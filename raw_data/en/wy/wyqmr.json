The editors, designers and I will be tweaking and fussing and adding and subtracting over the coming weeks to give this a look and feel that works with the rest of chicagotribune.com. The advantages to readers of this change include standardized permalinks, searchable archives, a \"read more\" feature that will reduce clutter on the front page, XML syndication (whatever that is) and improved capacity for such things as real-time blogging and photo illustrations: Also, I will probably be enabling the commenting (message board) feature that allows for topic-specific discussions and longer entries, but I want to work out a few other kinks first. Meanwhile, the old message board is here and the Notebook archives are here. The best ad in the Super Bowl telecast Sunday was the McDonald's spot about the couple using an online auction service to sell a french fry that seemed to feature the profile of Abraham Lincoln. The satirical target was fresh - the person who sold a grilled cheese sandwich on eBay that was said to bear the image of the Virgin Mary - and the deadpan documentary style presentation was tone perfect (the same evaluation holds for the companion commercial that ran during the pre-game). Compared to Lincoln Fry, the other ads, clever though some of them were, seemed derivative and familiar. Friday night at the Jones-Beck Awards - the Tribune editorial department's annual employee-recognition ceremony - I was named the winner of the award for achievement in digital journalism for my work on this Web log. The list of 20 or so winners in various categories is a well-guarded secret in advance of the ceremony, and it's always part of the drama for others to make sure that the honoree is in the ballroom. Sometimes these efforts leave clues that winners pick up on, but I always go to the ceremony so no one had had to say a word to me. Accordingly, I was genuinely shocked when Don Wycliff began his introduction, which praised this blog for, among other things, maintaining an amusing feud with Sun-Times columnist Neil Steinberg. I was shocked and a little embarrassed not because I'm an aw shucks guy - I'm very proud of leading the way in the expansion of blogging at the Tribune and, for the most part, of what the Notebook has offered - but because... Trib entertainment writer Mark Caro drew favorable attention from several Illinois bloggers during his guest stint here last week and he started an online hissing match with blogger/public-access TV chat host Jeff Berkowitz. \"Most often, (Barbara) Walters will, after a little fawning, suddenly confront the subject with a very rude personal question, just as a child or imbecile would. At these moments, the interviewer actively personifies the viewing audience at its nosiest. \"It is, in fact, her genius to intuit the wonderings of the tactless oaf within each one of us and then become that oaf. From \"Barbara Walters's Theater of Revenge\" by Mark Crispin Miller, Harpers Magazine, 1989 \"If you entertain (readers) too much they get greedy. Keep expectations moderate. If you find yourself being really hilarious, howlingly funny or insightful, you must take things down a notch or two. \"Identify the best lines and cut them. Root out the most elegant jokes and rewrite them to make them clunkier (like this sentence!. \"Think about the long term. I can't tell you how many times I've been seconds from pushing the button on a column and paused, thinking, `No, it's just too good.'\" Joel Achenbach \"Three entities of different ethnicities, professions, or species walk into a bar. \"The bartender says something innocuous. \"Each of the entities reply in a way consistent with the common perception of their profession, ethnicity or species. \"The third one's reply is the most outrageous.\" A generic joke, origin unknown. \"What you want is to reduce a politician to tears when he reads or she reads criticism\u2014not of them personally but of the very essence of their reason for existence as a politician. That would be the ideal. Short of that we would like to be constructive.\" Michael Kinsley, Los Angeles Times, on running an editorial page \"The unspeakable horror that is the Cathy wedding will actually last two weeks. Charles and Diana's wedding didn't last that long. Britney Spears' first marriage didn't last that long. \"I was very troubled by Eric Zorn's Jan. 27 column in the Tribune Metro section, `Pardon me if I don't get giddy over quint saga.' Zorn suggests that the desire for the Hortons to have more children was a poor judgment and that the decision of Marine Reserve Sgt. Joshua Horton to fight in Iraq was also poor judgment.\" I don't have a problem with the rest of Smith's letter---I don't agree with his viewpoint but I think it's good that our paper publishes opposing views, even in this case when those views represent a small minority of the response that I received to that column. But I do have a problem with his summary of my column -- a problem that occasionally crops up in letters to the editor. What I suggested -- in fact I wrote it very clearly -- was that it was the combination of the two decisions that constituted poor judgment. Once Horton knew he was almost certainly going to Iraq it was poor judgment for him and his wife to continue on fertility drugs, and then once they knew they had quintuplets on the way it was poor judgment for Sgt. Horton to choose to go to Iraq. I'm a longtime Beatles fanatic, but I can't say I'm too excited about Paul McCartney's upcoming Super Bowl halftime performance -- and not only because he's promised not to expose any body parts. A marching band in a football stadium I understand: The musicians fill the field; the sound fills the air. And sometimes they spell out funny words. Of course, all of that turns to tin when you put it onTV. But rock and pop acts in football stadiums, particularly those still configured for football games, fare worse. The sound is echoey, the audience is far removed (except for those hyper-caffeinated ringers strategically placed near the stage), and the energy is non-existent. No one comes out unscathed. Four years ago, Aerosmith, Britney Spears and 'N Sync shared the Super Bowl stage, and all of them stunk equally. Do football fans really yearn to watch a substandard mini concert between halves of the year's biggest game? Put it this way: Next time McCartney tours, I'm betting he won't stage a scrimmage during the intermission. Hey, now I know I've got blogging cred: I've been dissed by another blogger. Jeff Berkowitz of \"Public Affairs\" objected to my cocking my eyebrows at the spectacle of Congressional Republicans waving their purple-dyed fingers at the State of the Union address as a show of support for President Bush's foreign policy (see below). To me it felt unseemly for these privileged legislators to appropriate, for political showmanship, the powerful symbol of Iraqis braving landmines and snipers to cast their ballots. The Iraqis earned those purple fingers. These politicians didn't. Berkowitz writes: Would Caro also suggest that wearing a crucifix was wrong unless the individual doing so had been nailed to the cross? How about someone celebrating Dr. Martin Luther King Day who had not marched in Selma or even Chicago, or had not even been born then?... What in the world could Mark Caro be thinking? That it is wrong for a congressman who had supported the military action in Iraq [or even those who hadn't] to be happy that for the first time in Iraq in decades, Iraqis were to have a true say in their government? That it is wrong for a congressman to show his support for and solidarity with an estimated 70% [sic] of the Iraqis who went to the polls to vote, risking their lives--and that he was happy that although there was death and violence from the insurgents it was much less than anticipated? Caro got in that congressman's brain and heart and Caro figured out that the congressman didn't give a damn about that act of freedom.... Wait, I'm the one who was presuming to have climbed into those congressmen's brains and hearts? If you say so. My objection wasn't to the sentiment but the theater. In Iraq the purple finger meant this: I took a stand and voted. On Capitol Hill the purple finger meant this: We were right. It's perfectly appropriate to applaud the relatively peaceful elections in Iraq. Just don't take something that's resonant and real and cheapen it for the sake of grandstanding. How many of those giddy congressmen have actually flown to Iraq to show \"their support for and solidarity with\" those citizens? How many have spent one night of their lives in conditions similar to those experienced every day in Iraq? How many of their family members have joined the armed forces to protect liberty overseas? If you're going to wear the medal, fight the battle. Of course you should celebrate Martin Luther King, Jr.'s birthday even if you didn't march in Selma. But don't walk around your mansion wearing a \"Black Power\" pin and think you da man. Berkowitz also gives me the business for not criticizing Sen. Ted Kennedy for calling for U.S. troops' withdrawal the week before the election, and for my not sticking it to \"those liberals\" whose reaction to the elections was, in Berkowitz's words, \"Now the hard work begins.\" One, I wasn't blogging last week when Kennedy made his comments. Two, I'm writing about what interests me at the moment, and the purple fingers passed the threshold and five zillion other things didn't. I didn't write about President Bush's proposal to diminish Social Security benefits to everyone under 55, either. Does that make me Rush Limbaugh's soul brother? Here's a question: When did righties become so darned whiny? I'm serious. When Sinclair Broadcasting was going to force-feed its affiliates an anti-Kerry documentary immediately before the election, conservatives (Limbaugh included) kept responding to the criticism by griping, \"Where were you when 'Fahrenheit 9/11' came out?\"-- as if releasing a political movie in the open marketplace and imposing one on the public airwaves were the same thing. Even after Bush's victory, the ongoing sense of grievance and victimization among those in power is staggering. Can't a contrary idea be discussed on its own merits without all of that nyah-nyah nonsense? Just wondering. \"WHO DROPPED A WHOLE TRUCKLOAD OF FIZZIES INTO THE SWIM MEET? WHO DELIVERED THE MEDICAL SCHOOL CADAVERS TO THE ALUMNI DINNER? EVERY HALLOWEEN, THE TREES ARE FILLED WITH UNDERWEAR. EVERY SPRING, THE TOILETS EXPLODE.\" The Internet Movie Database lists 110 acting credits to the 72-year-old actor's name , including the mayor and \"Old man\" in \"Sorority Boys\" (2002). He also had an extensive stage career, in England and his native Canada. But sometimes it takes just one role to stamp yourself indelibly on the pop culture, and Dean Wormer was it. One of the great heavies in movie comedy history, Dean Wormer was the formidable foe of the frat-boy heroes of the 1978 film, \"National Lampoon's Animal House.\" Vernon's no-nonsense menace enabled him to hold his own against such scene stealers as John Belushi's Bluto --and he was damned funny in the process. There used to be a dentist in New Jersey who wrote gags for ailing shows.Has he retired? If ever a show was in desperate need of his help, it's \"Good Vibrations,\" the pathetic attempt at making a musical from songs by the Beach Boys. Variety's David Rooney is kinder, sort of. \"[T]his isn't quite the history-making train wreck trumpeted in advance by the bad vibrations emanating from its troubled previews,\" he writes but notes that a \"chaotic sense of haphazard, try-anything desperation pervades most aspects of this amateurish attempt to stitch the Beach Boys' hits into a musical.\" So crafting a \"Mamma Mia!\"-type show out of Brian Wilson's songs turned out not to be such a great idea-though theatergoers, not critics, will deliver the final verdict. \"Good Vibrations\" certainly sounds worse than \"All Shook Up,\" the thoroughly innocuous Elvis Presley songbook musical that, when it had its pre-Broadway preview here last month, proved at least to be more clever than it might have been. (Think higher-quality Velveeta.) I find it hard to see how anyone could get excited about these thinly plotted exercises in cheery musical nostalgia, but at least ABBA and \"Mamma Mia!\" have some built-in camp value; no one's going to confuse those songs with meaningful expressions of emotions. That's why I'd have to be dragged by the earlobes with hot tongs to \"Good Vibrations.\" If I may be so snobby, the true Beach Boys fans appreciate the deep streaks of melancholy and beauty in Wilson's music. The superficial nostalgia-mongering fans, to whom the Beach Boys are best represented by eternal teen Mike Love rather than eternal child-dreamer Wilson, never got past the band's dopey \"Fun Fun Fun\"/ \"Surfin' USA\" stage. I'd consider checking out a musical that incorporated the desperate yearning of \"Caroline No,\" the reflective dislocation of \"I Just Wasn't Made for These Times\" and the sublime fatalism of \"Till I Die.\" \"Good Vibrations,\" in turn, sounds like a show for Mike Love fans. By the way, in the aftermath of Johnny Carson's death, Brian Wilson's loopy, sing-song tribute to the man kept going through my head. Wilson and the Beach Boys recorded the song in the mid-`70s when the songwriter's crackpot naivete was at a peak. Finke homes in on Weinraub's apparent envy of those he covered --a feeling shared by many Hollywood reporters who think they're no less worthy than the folks cranking out pap and hitting paydirt. [W]hat oozes from [Weinraub's piece] is the gunky notion that a journalist wanted to live like the people he covered here. And he isn't alone.... I still can't get over the specter of Bernie cowering in the corner at Industry functions because the car he was provided gratis by his newspaper wasn't fancy--schmancy. 'Though I'm ashamed to say it,' he wrote, 'I was soon hunting for parking spots near Orso or the Peninsula Hotel to avoid the discomfort of having a valet drive up my leased 2-year-old Buick in front of some luncheon companion with a Mercedes.' I must say, I've never felt more conscious of what car I'm driving than when I've been in Los Angeles for work. Once I was interviewing a producer over breakfast in the Beverly Hills Hotel's Polo Lounge (his suggestion), and on my way out of the long driveway, an angry-faced guy in a Jaguar behind me started honking for no apparent reason. All I could think was: What, you're not supposed to drive rented Fords in here? But I'm with Finke and her attitude toward the whole car status issue: Hell, I'd think nothing of standing at valet parking in front of all of Hollywood and yelling loudly, 'It's the Chevy!' Weren't those purple fingers being waved by Congress folk at last night's State of the Union address just fabulous? See, Iraqis who braved threats of violence to go to the polls Sunday had their index fingers dyed with indelible purple ink as a sign that they'd voted. Who knew that so many representatives and senators had traveled all the way to Iraq to vote, too? Naw, they were just showing solidarity with those truly brave souls in that far-away country. Or they were celebrating democracy's victory. Maybe these people simply have wanted to show how giddy they are about the global spread of liberty, and who would be so cynical as to gripe about that? In other words, it took three days for an organic symbol of genuine sacrifice to be appropriated by self-congratulatory politicians. What land mines and car bombs did these legislators sidestep for the privilege of dipping those fingers in purple ink? Did they symbolically sit at the front of buses during the Civil Rights Movement, too? Next thing you know, Britney Spears will be sporting a purple finger. Oscar presenters, too. There's nothing like vicariously experiencing someone else's toils on the front lines. And for those who don't like the icky, inky part, here's a powerful symbol you can display in your own home: the Dyed Purple Finger Sponge. WEDNESDAY, FEB. 2, 2005 updated at 2:33 p.m. IN AN UNRELATED MOVE, THE SOX TRAINER HAS REQUESTED A STEEL-PLATED CUP Included is this amazing/appalling anecdote about the White Sox's newest catcher, and now that I've shared it with all of my Tribune cubicle neighbors (Terry Armour is still laughing about it and muttering, \"What an $%*(@#!\"), I thought I'd pass it along to you all: One of those now-it-can-be-told stories the White Sox, A.J. Pierzynski's new employer, surely haven't heard: During a Giants exhibition game last spring, Pierzynski took a shot to his, shall we say, private parts. Trainer Stan Conte rushed to the scene, placed his hands on Pierzynski's shoulders in a reassuring way, and asked how it felt. \"Like this,\" said Pierzynski, viciously delivering a knee to Conte's groin. It was a real test of professionalism for the enraged Conte, who vowed to ignore Pierzynski for the rest of the season until Conte realized how that would look. The incident went unreported because all of the beat writers happened to be doing in-game interviews in the clubhouse, but it was corroborated by a half-dozen eyewitnesses who could hardly believe their eyes. Said one source, as reliable as they come: \"There is absolutely no doubt that it happened.\" Tonight in his State of the Union address, President Bush will-- SPOILER ALERT! STOP READING! REALLY! YOU DON'T WANT TO IT'LL RUIN IT! PLEASE! FOR THE LOVE OF GOD! OR THE LOVE OF WHATEVER! BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'RE NOT ALL BELIEVERS OUT THERE, AND I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE ANYONE OUT! AND IF YOU DON'T LOVE ANYONE OR ANYTHING, STILL...JUST STOP! HALT! DO NOT PASS! JUST GO INTO THE WHOLE THING WITH A BLANK SLATE! ROLL WITH IT! YOU'LL HAVE MUCH MORE FUN! DON'T WATCH THE PREVIEWS BECAUSE THEY ALSO GIVE AWAY TOO MUCH! AND FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE, DON'T READ THE REVIEWS! AND IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN HEAVEN, STILL...DON'T READ THE REVIEWS! MAKE UP YOUR OWN MIND! YOU STILL HERE?!? WHAT THE *$%# IS YOUR PROBLEM?!? DON'T YOU LISTEN?!? CRIPES! I BET YOU READ THE LAST PAGES OF WHODUNITS FIRST, TOO! YOU LOSER! DON'T READ THE NEXT LINE, I BEG OF YOU! AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!! DO YOU THINK THIS IS A JOKE? YOU THINK I'M FUNNY? LIKE A CLOWN, FUNNY? I'M NOT GOING TO WARN YOU ANYMORE! AFTER THIS! THIS IS IT! STOP READING! YOU BOZO! OK, now that it's just us talking... President Bush in his State of the Union address will pitch his radical overhaul of Social Security, celebrate the Iraqi elections, tout our nation's wildly successful foreign policy and lay out a vision for a happy future that's almost completely lacking in specifics. The packed Capitol Hill audience will clap a lot and keep standing up and sitting down like they've got spiders in their pants. One side of the room will stand and sit more than the other; those people will be labeled \"Republicans.\" President Bush will say the State of the Union is-- Oh, so that's why I've been thinking of Yogi Berra as a sex god. I'd always pictured him as that squat ex-Major Leaguer who breathes malapropisms and inspires duck double-takes. But then came that \"Sex and the City\" billboard in April 2004. It took the form of a quiz: \"Yogasm\" a) a type of yo-yo trick. b) sex with Yogi Berra c) what Samantha has with a guy from Yoga class The answer, of course, was c), but the damage had been done. Seventy-nine-year old grandfather Yogi Berra had been tarred with the naughty brush without his permission, so he's suing the Turner Broadcasting System for $10 million over the ads promoting the \"Sex and the City\" reruns. The suit, posted on thesmokinggun.com, claims that \"the value of the plaintiff's name for commercial use in connection with the promoting of business products and services has been substantially diminished.\" It also notes that Berra is a \"deeply religious man who has maintained and continues to maintain a moral lifestyle,\" and the ad \"has created a false image of plaintiff that is both contrary to his personality, lifestyle and character as well as abhorrent to him personally and to his family members, friends and colleagues.\" Wow--all that agony and a $10 million lawsuit over a bad pun. I mean, it's not like the ad was offering the opportunity to have sex with Yogi Berra. With a tickle feather. And whipped cream. That would be different. But I'm sure TBS is chastened and is exploring other options. Perhaps Yogi Bear wouldn't mind so much? Still in catch-up mode (these entries will become more ripped-from-the-headlines, I promise)...Michael Wilmington mounted an eloquent case Sunday for Martin Scorsese to win his first Oscar for his direction of \"The Aviator.\" Now I don't agree that \"The Aviator\" is the year-topping masterpiece that Michael does --- the Best Picture race looks like it'll boil down to big scope (\"The Aviator\") vs. big emotions (\"Million Dollar Baby\") -- but that's not what's scratching at me in funny places. Rather, I'm bugged by the notion that Scorsese somehow would be diminished if he finishes his career without an Oscar. As Michael noted, Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, Orson Welles and Howard Hawks never won. Do their movies have less lasting cultural impact-is the term \"Hitchcockian\" shunned-because the filmmakers' mantles never sported little golden guys? Here's the main point: Scorsese and those other directors are much of the reason we view film as art: enduring, provocative, timeless. Lobbying for an Oscar, as Scorsese has done (particularly for 2002's \"Gangs of New York,\" which - sorry, Michael -- I also think was a \"mess,\" even if that puts me in agreement with the bilious William Goldman) doesn't raise a true artist's stature; it reduces it. What big awards did Picasso win? Shakespeare? Mozart? Art isn't about competition, and it also isn't about being lauded around the time of its creation. It's about the work, period, and the life it takes of its own. Leave the competition to the studios and stars tallying up box-office totals so they can calculate their future paychecks. Root for your favorites come Oscar time. But for heaven's sake, if you truly believe that great cinema is transcendent, don't make the mistake of actually giving a hoot. \"SEE, WE THOUGHT WE COULD GET BARRY BONDS FOR A CHUNK OF FALLING CONCRETE.\" This isn't a new or original thought, but remember when sports trades were fun to debate? Joe Carter and Mel Hall for Rick Sutcliffe. Rafael Palmeiro for Mitch Williams et al. George Bell for Sammy Sosa, for that matter. Now the conversation is more like this: \"Hey, we traded a shoo-in Hall of Famer and $15.5 million for a bag of rocks.\" \"What a deal!\" Sports fans are now expected to be economists-and only an economist or accountant could see true logic in these deals. Meanwhile, I'm stuck with my dunderhead layman's brain making calculations like this: Last year Cubs attendance at Wrigley Field hit a record 3.17 million. Assume the same numbers for next year, for every fan walking through Wrigley's turnstiles all season, $4.89 will be going to a player working for the competition. Hey, if this is new company policy, count me in. The Tribune Company could pay me $15.5 million--oh, heck, let's make it easy and say $1.5 million--and I'll write for the Baltimore Sun, provided they pay me, too. Several years ago I wrote a column that used an odd device. Each sentence in the column contained 17 syllables only. The topic was a man who wrote sayings with 17 syllables. Now my son's high school math teacher has shown me this interesting site. The number 17 is just simply everywhere you look it seems. Choose the Blue tells consumers which political party various corporations supported and urges them to shop Democratic. A New York Times op-ed waxes proud about Patrick Daley's enlistment in the Army and quotes me, though not by name. The blog \"Chicago Howtown on the Make\" takes a look at the swollen Cook County budget and asks an Emperor's New Clothes-like question that's got to be quietly on many people's minds: For the love of God, what exactly do these people do?\" A cause that no one could be against -- disability pay for wounded veterans -- Check! Action required by a non-Blago entity -- a demand that the V.A. craft a plan to address \"this intolerable situation\" -- Check! A press release -- an open letter to the V.A. Secretary -- Check! The win-win Blago-bonus -- A) Action by the V.A. means a moral victory for (Blagojevich), and B) inaction by the V.A. means (Blagojevich) stood up for Illinois military men and women, so no matter what, Rod Blagojevich is the champion of wounded soldiers -- Check! It's not Mr. Picasso Head and you can't print out or save the results, near as I can tell, but this site where you can create your own South Park character, complete with cartoon bleeding wounds, is a nice waste of time for your weekend. These Land of Linkin' entries are from the September, 2004 Notebook archives: Local blogger David Johnsen notes here that \"the biggest margin of victory (in Illinois) since the people (instead of state legislatures) began electing U.S. Senators was in 1920 when William B. McKinley (R) defeated Peter A. Waller (D) 66.8% to 26.8% for a margin of 40%.\" Only a late surge in the polls will prevent Keyes from setting a new record. Dan Johnson-Weinberger commends us to Juan Cole's intriguing math trick in which he asks us to imagine what America would be like if it were just like Iraq today, with everything adjusted to scale: \"What if there were private armies totalling 275,000 men, armed with machine guns, assault rifles (legal again!), rocket-propelled grenades, and mortar launchers, hiding out in dangerous urban areas of cities all over the country?\" and so on. Charles Shaw, E&P of the online magazine \"Newtopia\" has at last started a blog and I have at last, momentarily, overcome the balky relationship my ISP has with the host for ericzorn.com and updated my exceedingly vital Web logs of interest page. John Scalzi warns that the game Reverse, in which all your mouse movements are reversed on-screen as you navigate a little dot through a series of mazes, will drive you mad and kill your entire day.

Sorry `bout the delay getting started, but I just returned from the Sundance Film Festival and walked into the typical avalanche. Oh, wait, the avalanche was back in Park City. Bad metaphor. Sundance gets weirder every year, vibe-wise at least. The festival is a celebration of filmmakers who have spent years running up their credit cards to finance their little labors of love--and they do tend to be little, at least in scope. Then folks like the Hilton sisters and Pamela Anderson barge into town. They don't see the films, mind you; they go around to all of the corporate sponsorship houses collecting celebrity suck-up gifts and posing for photogs at parties. The most incongruous moment may have come at the party for the musical documentary \"Rize,\" directed by fashion photographer David LaChapelle. This rousing movie is about young folks who live in such poverty-stricken areas of Los Angeles that they have invented their own expressive, energetic forms of hip-hop dancing: \"krumping\" and \"clowning.\" Several of these kids and young adults were flown in for the \"Rize\" world premiere, and at the post-screening Q&A, they expressed with great emotion how humbled and awe-stricken they were by the whole experience. Later they performed into the wee hours at a party in a steel-and-glass office building atrium, and joining them onstage was...Pamela Anderson, crazy party girl, who looks even less real in person. Boy, it sure doesn't take long for genuine expression to be appropriated by the tawdry trendies these days. For what it's worth, Pammy, Paris and Nicky supposedly flew in on a private jet to support their pal LaChapelle. They weren't actually at the screening, however. A REASON TO MAINTAIN FAITH IN THE FUTURE OF SCRAPPY ARTISTS WHO CAN'T BASK IN THE REFLECTED LIGHT OF A SUPERPOPULAR COMIC BOOK Pretty entertaining, illuminating stuff, as Weinraub recounts how Jeffrey Katzenberg lost his motivation to be a pal once Weinraub quit covering Hollywood. But it still amazes me that Weinraub was able to spend so long on the beat after marrying Turner Pictures (then Columbia Pictures and now Sony Pictures) chief Amy Pascal. In retrospect Weinraub recognizes the conflict of interest in his recusing himself from covering his wife's studios but continuing to report on their rivals. But still...you'd think the Times might not have left the decision to him for so long. Ah, well, that was before the Times found religion on culture coverage and perceived ethical conflicts. That's not to say that Weinraub did a skewed job, mind you. And he's far from the only one who found his gig complicated by his marital situation. I quit writing about radio when I married a news anchor on one of the local rock stations, and the regular occupier of this space has run the usual disclaimers regarding his own spousal radio connection. Journalists also often find themselves in tricky spots come election time; we're not allowed to display political preferences via bumper stickers, for instance, yet our spouses may be inclined to support a campaign publicly. Anyone else want to talk about their jobs getting complicated thanks to family connections? FRIDAY, JAN. 28, 2005 updated at 2:23 p.m. BAAACK TO HER OLD TRICKS Sun-Times gossip maven Michael Sneed leads her column today thus: Heeee's baaack! - Rumble is former Republican U.S. Senate candidate/nightmare Alan Keyes is eyeing a bid for governor.... He's conducting the first meeting of his \"Cook County United\" gathering of 40 to 50 of Cook County's best conservative activists in his Loop office tonight! Several readers have noticed echoes in this presentation of yesterday's Illinois Leader article, \"He's Baaack: Keyes to hold initial Cook County United meeting tomorrow,\" that included the phrase that \"many are privately concerned that Keyes may form an exploratory committee to run for Governor.\" But as Capitol Fax publisher Rich Miller points out, what Sneed, the Leader and concerned, rumbling Republicans fail to realize is that Article V, Section 3 of the Illinois Constitution requires that to hold statewide office, a person must have been \"a resident of this State for the three years preceding his election.\" One of Miller's readers observes that this requirement not only eliminates Keyes from becoming governor (he didn't move to Illinois until August, 2004, and the election will be in November, 2006) but it also eliminates former Chicago schools chief Paul Vallas, who now lives in Philadelphia.

Rod) Blagojevich should not be re-elected in 2006.\" State Journal-Register political columnist Bernard Schoenburg's recent offering, \"Governor puts 'personal touch' back on state signs,\" reports that \"Illinois Department of Transportation crews are in the process of tacking up plates on the existing 68 signs, letting folks know that `Rod R. Blagojevich, governor' is among the people welcoming them.\" Rich Miller tells his readers about yet another mid-term report card for the guv, this one generated from a poll of political insiders taken at Springfield's Sangmo Club: Management of state government -- D; Budget management-- D; Social Services -- C- ; Political leadership -- D; Public relations; re-electability -- B-. This is a young woman who seems to be doing her best to be a mother to 6 children. She lost a baby. She had to face her husband's going to Iraq, fighting in Iraq, and being wounded in Iraq. Why would you write an article attacking this poor woman? Because she made some decisions that you think were wrong? Because you did not agree with her choices? Because she was lucky enough that some people wanted to give her some things to help her out? You took what might have been a shred of good news -- babies going home from the hospital, a soldier that didn't die in Iraq, people reaching out to help other people -- and turned it into something bad. Shame on you for your misuse of the power that you have. First I have to say that this letter, while representative of the smattering of negative mail I've received, is by no means representative of most of the mail that came in. As I wrote yesterday, response to the \"quint fatigue\" column has been startlingly positive, with many of the favorable notes containing the grateful, relieved sentiment that the writer felt he was the only one who felt this way. But regarding Kathy K's charge: I didn't - and don't - see this column as an \"attack\" on the Hortons. I didn't go out of my way to find their story, drag them into the spotlight and berate them for making what I see as an unwise combination of choices. Their story was offered up to the public in numerous media accounts as a good story, a story worthy of our special celebration and even generosity. Those promoting and facilitating this story were inviting our judgment on it. Sure, they wanted, expected and for the most part received a favorable judgment, but one of my responsibilities as a columnist is to offer independent judgments on stories in the news, particularly when I believe there are broader themes at play. And, obviously, a theme that I - and some 90 percent of those who wrote -- saw in the Horton story was irresponsibility; their embrace of incompatible choices. The stories we celebrate ought to be stories that reflect sound and responsible choices, and when we level criticism it ought to be in the name of suggesting the value of such choices. On Thursday I used my power, such as it is, to nudge public thinking in the direction of responsibility, particularly the responsibility I feel ought to attend the decision to have children. I took whacks similar to the above when about the warm fuzzy feature stories when a 15-year-old girl gave birth to the first baby born in 2005. DPG-- I went to a meeting for that \"DirectBuy\" service now being advertised on radio. Cost: $3950 for 3 years, then $200 each year after that up to the 10 years. Payment plans charged 17.75% interest. I'll have to take your word for it. I called one of the local DirectBuy showrooms to verify, but the woman told me she wouldn't talk membership fees on the phone, I had to come in for a \"presentation\" before I could learn how much it costs. The essence -- the je ne sais quoi -- of blogs is that an emerging technology makes it possible for individuals outside the mainstream media to reach an audience.... Blogs are fun. Blogs add a fascinating new element to public discourse. But blogs are another turn of history's wheel, not a radical departure.... Blogs and the reasons they exist have historical antecedents. Take Martin Luther in the early 1500s. About 60 years before, Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press. Before that, only the church and governments could afford to reproduce and manage information, keeping a lock on ideas and power. The printing press gave Luther a way to distribute his thesis -- an early version of blogging. A lot has been written lately about Web logs as political force, as new media and so on. But let's not forget the blog-as-literature idea, one that I get every time I check in with a locally written effort known as \"The Story of Why.\" This site is a live, serial reality novel that takes us into the head and the heart of a working-class Chicago woman whose life has been kind of a mess, in many respects, but who burns with a desire to put things right. She writes with great honesty and insight in her online journal but, fair warning, she uses a lot of swear words. Under the circumstances, you probably would, too. The other day I was leafing through some piano music when I noticed that Dolly Parton's bittersweet break-up anthem, \"I Will Always Love You,\" (popularized by Linda Ronstandt and Whitney Houston) has, in its hook, the classic chord progression I vi IV V that's found in so many sprightly 1950s and early 1960s pop hits (\"Teenager in Love,\" \"Lollipop,\" \"Last Kiss,\" \"Bristol Stomp,\" I won't go on). This reminded me of another evidently appealing series of chords: I V vi iii IV I IV V You find them in Pachelbel's \"Canon,\" and, with slightly different endings, in \"The Streets of London\" and \"Keep the Homefires Burning.\" If anyone knows of a Web site that traffics in surprise common chord progressions in popular, folk and classical music, let me know, I'll link to it. SANITIZED FOR YOUR PROTECTION Asking why corruption continues at City Hall is like asking why a dog scratches his ears with his paws. Answer: Because he can. There is so much wrong with an overcrowded classroom, but, perhaps most important, a qualified, experienced and enthusiastic instructor is diminished to a person who hands out assignments and reprimands Tempo's own Mark Caro will be subbing for me in this space next week. I'll be filling in for Mary Schmich the first two Sundays in February; Dawn Trice will be filling in for me in the column space on Thursday. Also, I will be the guest lefty on Milt Rosenberg's program Wednesday night, 9-11 p.m. on WGN AM (720), a Tribune Broadcasting station. \"You're going to get some mail on this one,\" said my editor last night after she'd finished reading my column for today. Her tone suggested that I ought to brace myself for an onslaught from those outraged by my challenge to the conventional wisdom that the story of the Horton quintuplets is a wonderful, heartwarming saga. After all, you don't take on a military hero - Sgt. Joshua Horton was seriously wounded in Iraq - and parenthood - his wife, Taunacy, gave birth to quintuplets three days after Horton was wounded--without stirring up angry passions. But what's stunned me so far today is that 95 percent of my e-mail responding to this column has been favorable - --\"You said what I was thinking,\" \"I was sure no one would have the guts to say what you said, but you're right,\" \"Thanks for telling it like it is\" and so on. Most correspondents have added that they were motivated to write to me, in part, because they were certain I'd be inundated by critical mail and wanted me to know I wasn't alone in my thinking. The negative comments have been isolated, but here they are: I find your comments judgmental and insensitive. The Hortons are living life to the fullest. I know it's useless to try and explain the idea of \"comrade in arms\" to a behind-the-lines quarterback. The concept of using any excuse to remain behind while your friends go in harm's way is obviously not a new one for you. What a sham that Zorn can't celebrate the joy of these sweet innocent little children and the love that the parents have for life, God and our country. As pro life parents - I applaud them and are so very happy that people have come forward to help them emotionally and financially. Mr. Zorn sounds like he is jealous of what all was given to the Hortons. Has he even considered how sad these parents and their doctor feels about the lose of one of the children? If I were the editor of the paper - I'd get this creep fired. The editors asked last night whether the print version of the column ought to include my e-mail address at the end. I used to include my address frequently - in fact, in the early 90's I was the first local news columnist to publish my e-mail address and invite reader response through this thing they call the Internet -- but I don't very often anymore and decided not to today. One reason is that, when there's room at the end for a little italic post-script, I prefer to flog the blog. A second reason is that printing my e-mail address roughly doubles the volume of correspondence I receive for a day or two, and that volume is already considerable and very hard to keep up with. A third, related to the second, is that publishing my e-mail address implies that I'll respond if you write to me. I do try to do this. But, perversely, publishing the address makes it less likely that I'll be able to on any given day. Tribune staff e-mail addresses are available online at this page. which is a subchapter of (bookmark them for handy venting), but I wouldn't mind if, in the name of consistency and putting the cookies on the bottom shelf, we included e-mail addresses in column logos and as shirt-tails to all staff-written stories. I'm just learning today that, about a week ago, Sun-Times Watch, a blog devoted to critiques of and news items related to our scrappy tabloid, went live on the Web. I'm happy to have the help in identifying the sources of Sneed \"scoops,\" but am disappointed that the anonymous writers of this blog don't share my enthusiasm for \"Page (sic) Wiser,\" whose sly, self-aware wit seems to escape those who only skim her columns. 9:35 a.m. - I will appear on WBEZ-FM's \"848\" for the month-in-review segment. I may be able to slip in a mention of the whole Mell/Blagojevich thing. 7 p.m. - I'll be calling a beginner's level country dance - contras, circles and squares - as part of Triple Rad Trad Fest at the Old Town School of Folk Music, 4544 N. Lincoln. This two-day festival features dances and jam sessions all Friday night and most of the day Saturday, and concerts from the hottest young string bands Saturday night. If you've never experienced this particular kind of roots folk, Triple Rad Trad will be a fine introduction. Writing about the controversy over the words \"under God\" in the pledge of allegiance in today's Tribune, syndicated columnist Kathleen Parker, argues that such a pledge is \"religion by any other name\" and blasts the \"self-anointed protectorate.\" For what we know about human beings is that people tend to resist that which is imposed from on high. By some natural law...channelers of piety usually exact the opposite of what they intend. Oh, wait a minute. I've made a terrible mistake. Parker is actually writing about the Tolerance Pledge that's endorsed by, among other animated figures, SpongeBob Squarepants. She writes that if teachers were to incorporate into their classroom activities a pledge in which children promise to respect all people, even those whose \"abilities, beliefs, culture, race, sexual identity or other characteristics are different from my own,\" it would cross a \"moral line.\" When she did write about the Pledge of Allegiance, back in June, 2002, she was perfectly willing to channel piety and allow the state to impose from on high religion by another name: To determine that \"one nation under God\" violates the constitutional prohibition against establishment of a religion is such a legal stretch and so out of touch with American reality that we can only figure it's a political scam. The Bush administration understands the words \"tyranny\" and \"freedom\" in much the same way as it understands international law. They mean whatever the White House wants them to mean. Bush is happy to support democracy when democracy supports America, just as he is happy to dispense with it when it does not. Likewise, when tyranny is inconvenient, he will excoriate it; when it is expedient, he will excuse it. I can't be the only one who imagines Portter as an adult, slumped on the telephone, explaining over and over again, \"No, no, it's 'Portter' with two Ts. P-O-R-T-T-E-R. Portter. That's right ...'' A long sigh. \"My parents gave me the name ...'' Neil Steinberg on the spelling of the first name of one of the Horton quintuplets. Digital clocks blinked as frantically as drowning swimmers. So Sen. Hillary Clinton, in her triangulating effort to position herself for an ill-fated run for the presidency in 2008, is calling for pro- and anti- abortion rights forces to find \"common ground.\" It ain't there. Oh, sure, you might get some agreement at the margins, but believe me, on the fundamental issue at stake there is no compromise. I went looking for it several years ago and conducted a very long, very civil online debate with Nora O'Callaghan, then the director of the Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago's Respect Life Office. Your search for common ground can start and end there. WIN- WIN Last week I was going to note that Zondervan, the nation's largest Bible publisher, had scored an amazing PR coup by having Rolling Stone magazine turn down an ad for its new translation. A simple ad in the magazine would have been glossed over by all but a few hundred readers of RS and passed otherwise unnoticed. But the controversy, which flared onto talk radio and appeared in scores of publications, reached millions with the news that Zondervan, that's Z-O-N-D-E-R-V-A-N, is issuing a youth-friendly version of scripture. What more could the company ask for? Well, this: Now RS has agreed to publish the ad which, in light of the past controversy, assures yet another round of coverage this week and then some echo coverage when the ad actually comes out. DIGITAL SNIFFING Orin Kerr , George Washington University Law School professor and blogger, reacts to the U.S. Supreme Court decision allowing random \"searches\" of cars by drug-sniffing dogs: Under the rationale followed by the Court today, the government may be free to invade your property so long as they only obtain \"non private\" information. This is particularly troubling in the context of computer searches and seizures. Can the police send a computer virus to your computer that searches your computer for obscene images, or images of child pornography, and then reports back to the police whether such images are on your computer -- all without probable cause, or even any suspicion at all? The traditional answer would have been no: the police cannot enter your private property to search even for non-private stuff. But thanks to the increasing focus on the nature of the information rather than how the information is obtained, it's no longer so clear. One is John O'Connor's Associated Press story that begins: A year after telling lawmakers, \"We have to end the practice of giving schools waivers from offering physical education,\" Gov. Rod Blagojevich is willing to consider a plan that would make it even easier for public schools to skirt the state's daily PE requirement . Two is \"Low marks for Governor,\" a Decatur Herald & Review editorial that gives the governor the following mid-term grades: Jobs -- C- Budget -- B- Education -- Incomplete Ethics --F Taxes -- D Leadership --F Meanwhile, in the \"with friends like these...\" file, the governor is getting props from rascally right-wing commentator Tom Roeser, who notes (Blagojevich) has balanced a two-year deficit of $7.5 billion without raising the income tax or sales tax, reducing the number of state employees from 72,000 under George Ryan to 59,000....He has provided health care for more than 100,000 adults and kids, passing funds for 17,000 more kids for preschool.....He's rebuilding the entire tollway system to knock down tollbooths, building Interstate 355, widening I-294 and I-90, creating 250,000 jobs, cutting emissions by 40 percent and cutting commuter times by 15 minutes, adding 500 more cops, creating a new Amber Alert system. OUT OF THE GENE POOL, INTO THE CESSPOOL This will sound like a suck-up, but here goes: Tribune editors are making the right call in not publishing this week's installments of the comic strip \"Out of the Gene Pool.\" They feature an infantile ca-ca joke in the form of a relentlessly repeated pun on the common four-letter word for excrement. You can poke around at comics.com and find the offending strips yourself, then tell me if you don't agree that they are way below even the low standards of taste on the comics page. WHAT'S YOUR STARBUCKS DENSITY SCORE? Metroblogging Chicago pointed me to this site, where you can type in your address and see how many Starbucks outlets are within 2, 5, 10, 20 or 50 miles of where you live. My two-mile score is 13, which seems high for the Nort'west Side. DIRECT THIS Those of you who are tempted by commercials for DirectBuy you're now hearing on that latter day medicine show that is talk radio (where the spots promoting blue emu oil have lately seemed to dry up) ought to be aware that this company used to be called \"UCC Totalhome\" and \"United Consumers Club.\" Over the past six years, Internet Explorer (by far the most popular browser) has become a third world bus depot, the gathering point for a crush of hawkers, con artists, and pickpockets.... Firefox's clean, intuitive interface, quick page-loading, and ability to elude intruders (has) elicited a thunderous response. In the month following its official November launch, more than 10 million people downloaded Firefox, taking the first noticeable bite out of IE's market share since the browser wars of the mid-'90s(....IE has lost 5 percent in the past six months, almost all of it to Firefox) Switching over is simple. Out of the goodness of my heart I have written a getting-started guide for my readers that makes those \"...for Dummies\" books look like books that are so technical that average people have to buy \"...for Dummies\" books to understand them. My early nomination for infamous quote of the year belongs to this wheeze from Atty. Gen. Lisa Madigan: \"You don't have a legitimate right to privacy in the possession of illegal drugs\" She said this in news stories today regarding her victory yesterday in the U.S. Supreme Court case of Illinois v. Caballes, a case, and decision that completely reeks. Roy Caballes was pulled over in La Salle County on Interstate Highway 80 by Illinois State Police troopers in November, 1998, for driving 71 miles per hour in a 65 miles per hour zone. Let's first stop right there, shall we? 71 in a 65 zone? Other cars were probably passing him like he was standing still. Everyone drives over 70 on Interstate 80 in rural Illinois. Caballes, a Filipino, seems to have been stopped not for speeding, but for DWB - driving while brown. Police asked to search his car, he refused, a drug-sniffing dog indicated contraband was in his trunk, the police used this as probable cause to search the trunk and--what do you know? - found 282 pounds of marijuana. Madigan argued and a 6-2 majority of the high court agreed that such a search did not violate Caballes' Constitutional protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. But as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote in dissent, the decision clears the way for suspicionless, dog-accompanied drug sweeps of parked cars along sidewalks and in parking lots.....Nor would motorists have constitutional grounds for complaint should police with dogs, stationed at long traffic lights, circle cars waiting for the red signal to turn green. Madigan's dictum, above, sounds an awful lot like the e-mail I get from those who think that law enforcement officials should be able to search where they want for whatever reason they want because \"people who aren't breaking the law will have nothing to worry about.\" \"You don't have a legitimate right to privacy in the possession of illegal drugs.\" Ewww. If the 4th Amendment means anything, and today it means less than it did yesterday, it means that you have a legitimate right to privacy unless and until the government independently establishes probable cause to violate that right. Drug-sniffing dogs, as Justice David Souter wrote in his dissent, obtain information about the contents of private spaces beyond anything that human senses could perceive, even when conventionally enhanced. So now that we've opened the door to superhuman methods of inspecting private spaces for evidence of illegal activity, the only barrier protecting our privacy is technological. It's just ol' four-legged dogs today. But what happens when we get ultra-sensitive electronic \"dogs\" tomorrow? Equipment that can sniff out not only narcotics, but other objects and substances; devices that can \"overhear,\" without benefit of conventional eavesdropping devices, our private conversations, and \"watch\" our every movement from a distance? I have no major regrets. I called 'em, for the most part, like I saw 'em. But I wasted time when I should have been living every moment to its fullest. If I have any advice to pass on to the rest of you it's all about living. Living every second of every minute of every hour of every day you are given on this good earth. And don't get caught up in any form of hatred. Hatred, anger and the negative only feeds upon you and will destroy you. Look for the positive. Search for the smile. Seek out the good. It is all around you, if you just take the time to recognize it. Laugh a lot because laughter is healthy.... But now it's over. Goodbye, my friends. Thanks for reading my stuff. God bless you all. HAPPY BUMMERSDAY, ONE AND ALL A British academic has used a rather elaborate formula, done the math and calculated that today, January 24, is the single most depressing day of the year. THE PERFECT RETIREMENT \"He will be missed,\" purred the announcer at the close of one of the many TV tributes to Johnny Carson yesterday. But he won't be, at least outside of his small circle of friends and loved ones. The rest of us have been missing him already for a dozen years -- he refused to become one of those celebrity hangers on whose hunger for the spotlight after \"retirement\" overcomes his good judgment. No image-tarnishing comebacks. No new ventures or directions or bids for attention in some other public forum. We remember him as he was when he was the king of late night -- natty, cool, quick -- and not as some faded version of himself. There's a lesson in that. Z-MAIL Rob G., Evanston -- Didn't you find it awfully rich to be accused of being \"prolix\" by a writer (Neil Steinberg) who just published an entire book -- 300 pages! - on the subject of men's hats? Sometimes when I get crabby or my lesser self rises up, I make the mistake--and it is a mistake - of dismissing another writer's efforts by sneering at the topic and asking the reader to sneer along with me. Just the other day, for example, I mentioned in what I hoped was a catty way that Steinberg had devoted a column item to a time when he saw a man carrying a child's umbrella. But in fact, of course, a good writer can make magic with any topic, however self-indulgent or trivial it might seem on the surface; and a bad writer can make a dreary mess out of urgent and earth-shaking matters. To attack a writer based on his or her choice of subject matter is vapid, and in my exquisite unprolixity I shall try (and fail) never to do it again. Rick L. -- An item appeared in your blog dated Monday, January 17, about a new column appearing in the L.A. Times. You liked it. (It sounds good to me, too, but that's beside the point.) If memory serves the L.A. Times is owned by your current employer, the Tribune Company. If so, isn't that enough to warrant a disclaimer? Not a disclaimer so much as a full-disclosure: The LA Times is our corporate cousin, though I can assure you that had nothing to do with why I mentioned the new column. THE SUPER NANNY STATE: WHY NOT? Slate's report on the law that took effect last month in the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan that bans the sale of tobacco and public smoking brings to mind an essay that ran years ago in the Chicago Reader that proposed an all-out prohibition on tobacco in the United States. One standard objection to such a law is that prohibition of alcohol didn't work and banning certain drugs only creates a dangerous underground economy. But the essayist argued that cigarette smoking, as a habit and addiction, doesn't really resemble addiction to alcohol or mind-altering substances. Smoking requires such frequent administration (20 to 40 to 60 cigarettes a day) that no otherwise law-abiding person would bother trying to skirt the law that frequently. The reward - the pleasure of smoking regularly -- simply wouldn't be worth the risk and the high cost of a black-market product. Sure, die-hards might buy cigarettes from dealers and smoke in their homes (in-home smoking is still allowed in Bhutan, as is importation of small amounts of tobacco for personal use), but few young people would likely take up the habit if it meant a life time of furtiveness and unfulfilled craving. I'm not saying there aren't other objections to an outright ban on tobacco - the preservation of our freedom to kill ourselves slowly with a noxious product; the benefit to society of smokers dying earlier than they might otherwise; the jobs created by Big Tobacco -- but the one that says \"prohibition doesn't work\" looks awfully weak. UPDATE: To those readers who thought my above reference to \"the benefit to society of smokers dying dearlier than they might otherwise\" was gratuitously nasty or somehow inspired by hate, I direct your attention to the following passage from Steve Chapman's column of April 24, 1997: The surprising truth is that, on balance, the government doesn't lose money from the ravages of smoking. Everyone on Medicaid or Medicare, sad to say, eventually dies of some ailment that the state will have to cover. For non-smokers, the costs are postponed a bit, but not reduced or averted. Smokers, however, yield savings elsewhere. Every smoker who makes his exit at age 60 instead of 80 reduces spending on Social Security and other pension payments. Duke University economist W. Kip Viscusi says that in monetary terms, society gains more than it loses from smoking--even without counting the taxes paid on cigarette sales. FINE LINES There were some surprises (at the inauguration), one of which was the thrill of a male voice singing \"God Bless America,\" instead of the hyper-coloratura divas who plague our American civic life. Peggy Noonan The chronically tardy Blagojevich may always be a day late, but with (Christopher) Kelly at his side, he'll never be a dollar short. Donations have poured in so fast, Blagojevich has soaked up in four years about the amount of cash ($36.4) million it took former GOP Gov. George Ryan 30 years to raise. A couple of emailers to the Achenblog who dismiss my work as \"bland.\" Let me just say this to you critics: Bland is underrated. Bland is a style that I have spent years perfecting. I know you think that a blog is supposed to be all snarky and quirky and vulgar and sexy and sparky and snippy, and have a billion links to other sites, and most of all, rage against the evil mainstream media. Listen up: I AM the mainstream media President Bush's soaring rhetoric that the United States will promote the growth of democratic movements and institutions worldwide is at odds with the administration's increasingly close relations with repressive governments in every corner of the world. Some of the administration's allies in the war against terrorism -- including Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Uzbekistan -- are ranked by the State Department as among the worst human rights abusers It was a God-drenched speech. This president, who has been accused of giving too much attention to religious imagery and religious thought, has not let the criticism enter him. God was invoked relentlessly ....Ending tyranny in the world? Well that's an ambition, and if you're going to have an ambition it might as well be a big one. But this declaration, which is not wrong by any means, seemed to me to land somewhere between dreamy and disturbing. Tyranny is a very bad thing and quite wicked, but one doesn't expect we're going to eradicate it any time soon. Again, this is not heaven, it's earth. Promoting freedom, of course, is a noble and highly desirable pursuit. If America were to make the global diffusion of freedom a central pillar of its foreign policy, it would be cause for joy. The way the present administration has gone about this task, however, is likely to have the opposite effect....The administration's notion of freedom has been especially convenient, and its promotion of it especially cynical. I loved what the president said about our obligations to dissidents around the world. \"No one is fit to be a master and no one deserves to be a slave,\" Bush declared. \"Democratic reformers facing repression, prison or exile can know: America sees you for who you are, the future leaders of your free country.\" Exactly right. And what, precisely, do those beautiful words mean for the president's policy toward China or Russia or Saudi Arabia? How consistently will we stand up for embattled democratic reformers? Always? Or only when convenient? E.J. Dionne When he spoke to America's traditional friends and allies, assuring them that \"we honor your friendship, we rely on your counsel, and we depend on your help,\" he must not have been addressing \"Old Europe,\" whose people don't believe his soothing words and remain deeply alienated from us. \"Division among free nations is a primary goal of freedom's enemies,\" he said, apparently without understanding how he has achieved that precise objective. There are good reasons for Bush to treat Saudi Arabia and Pakistan this way. Lots of presidents have done the same thing. But Bush hasn't rejected realism, he's fervently embraced it while telling his speechwriters to say the opposite. Mell had accused Kelley \"of exchanging plum posts on state boards and commissions for contributions to Blagojevich, prompting a threat from Kelly to sue.\" Mell made the accusation rashly, in the heat of a family dispute that was ignited when \"Blagojevich used powers he had never before invoked to shut down a Joliet landfill owned by a distant relative of Mell's wife\" and implied that Mell was quarterbacking funny business at the dump. Our story says \"Mell insisted he did not issue the statement because of Kelly's threat,\" which is not believable. It reeks of being dictated by someone metaphorically twisting Mell's arm behind his back. For instance, this astonishing sentence: I merely meant to say that the Governor's high profile and public familiarity with his agenda makes fundraising efforts easier for those involved in the process. Please, sir! May I have another? How humiliating is that? Mell declaring that people are stuffing the governor's campaign coffers simply because he has a high profile and they're familiar with his agenda! First question: Does Blagojevich really think that people are giving him all that dough simply because he has a high profile and they're familiar with his agenda? Or, gee, do you suppose they want something, now or down the line? And if so, what? This question gets to the heart of the ongoing scandal that is the role of money in politics, a scandal that touches almost every candidate who takes big contributions whether one finds neat quid-pro-quo lines or not. Second question: Why didn't Blagojevich take the high road? Kelly's his guy. The governor could easily have said, \"Hey, Chris: My father-in-law was upset with me and went over the top. There are three investigations now going on into what he said. We'll all be cleared soon enough. I'll stand by you. Just let it go for now.\" Last question: Does Blagojevich owe Mell an apology? The landfill that was such a dire environmental emergency that the governor personally lashed the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency into inspecting and then padlocking, reopened after just one week's worth of remediation. Where's the evidence of a crisis? Where's the evidence that the abuses were so grave and the landfill operation so corrupt that it warranted the flexing of state agency muscle and the ghastly rhetorical confrontation it provoked? May we look forward to a letter from Blago to Mell that concludes, \"I am sorry for any distress that my comments may have caused you or your family\"? P.S. -- Rich Miller's column today says, \"Mell's public humiliation didn't go over too well with many of his friends....and they undoubtedly know where a lot of bones are buried.\" HOW TOXIC WAS TEDIOUS TERI? When WLS-AM yanked morning drive co-hosts Don and Roma Wade off the air during a contract dispute in September, management replaced them with programs featuring a patronizing, self-righteous conservative plucked from the station's weekend lineup, Teri O'Brien, whom I found totally unlistenable. Of course, I'm not part of the perpetually seething right-wing crowd that `LS is increasingly targeting, so it's no surprise that I couldn't stand the program. But a breakdown of the ratings numbers suggest that quite a few seethers were also turned off by the squeaky balloon that is O'Brien's act. A helpful number cruncher picked apart the Fall, 2004 Arbitron ratings for me and reported that in the last 7 weeks Teri O'Brien co-hosted, WLS was in seventh place overall in morning drive with a 3.6 percentage share of the average-quarter-hour listening audience, and in sixth place among in the 35-64 age bracket with a 4.2 share. In the first seven weeks after Don and Roma returned Nov. 8, WLS-AM ranked second overall in morning drive with a 6.3 share (a 75 percent jump), and fifth in the 35-64 bracket with a 5.0 share (a 19 percent jump). It's a small scrap of statistical evidence, but it suggests what my intuition also tells me, which is that WLS is making a mistake as it purges, runs off or marginalizes liberal voices. Lefty mid-day host Jay Marvin was shown the door last month, liberal newsman Bill Cameron lost his nightly \"Chicago P.M.\" gig in September when the station decided to replace that program with a tape-delay of the conservative Sean Hannity, and the station has never made a sincere effort to replace the left-wing weekend program hosted until mid-2003 by Nancy Skinner and Ski Anderson. Don Wade has been noticeably more splenetic since his return -- Thursday he ranted indignantly because ABC network anchor Peter Jennings had made the perfectly obvious comment that the sight and sound of fireworks cause some people to think of the sights and sounds of war. Roma Wade had nothing. Her new-age sensibilities allow her to pass as the station's token liberal these days even though she's pro-war and never mounts serious rhetorical challenges to her husband's crabby-old-man routines. What's odd about this drift rightward is that there's clearly a market for balanced and left-leaning talk radio. The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that Air America, the liberal talk-radio network, is now in 45 markets after being given up for dead during financial woes last year. With an infusion of new financing and new management, the radio network has won high ratings in some of its local markets and has garnered the support of radio-industry giant Clear Channel Communications Inc. It has signed three-year contracts with its top two stars, Al Franken and Randi Rhodes, and raised an additional $19 million from private investors.... Local market research and anecdotal evidence indicate that the network is gaining traction. On the Internet, Air America is the fourth most popular radio station, with almost 200,000 weekly Web listeners, according to Webcast Metrics. ... (Still,) of the big-time political talk-show hosts, approximately 75 to 80 percent are conservative, says Michael Harrison, editor of Talkers, a magazine devoted to talk shows. And a June 1 study from Washington, D.C-based Democracy Radio reported that national and local conservative programming totaled over 40,000 hours every week, while progressive, or liberal, programming totaled just over 3,000 hours. How do you square domestic freedom with the curtailment of civil liberties in a war on terror? How do you proclaim that America is a force for freeing dissidents, when the government now has unprecedented powers to detain anyone suspected of terror across the globe and subject them to coercive interrogation techniques that the government will not disclose? This is one of the strangest news stories I've ever seen: Every week, more than 50 percent of all wagers made in Italy's national lotto game are placed on the same number. 53. As you tunnel down through the International Herald Tribune story you find that The number 53 has not come up in 177 drawings,\"one of the longest losing streaks in the history of the game,\" and so many Italians are convinced the number is due to come up that a consumer group says it has caused \"a collective psychosis that's led to excesses of all sorts and, in some cases, tragedies, with families reduced to the poorhouse and suicides.\" STUDS Kudos to my colleague and musical partner Mary Schmich for being named a 2005 winner of the Studs Terkel Award given annually to local journalists \"who use `unofficial' news sources and cover Chicago's diverse communities.\" Other winners who will be honored by the Chicago Media Workshop April 6 are Windy City Times publisher Tracy Baim, Chicago Reader investigative reporter John Conroy and In These Times founder James Weinstein. Mary's column today is, for the first time I can remember, a multi-item offering. I've taken to calling such columns \"print blogs,\" in part because the format (\"small random thoughts,\" as Mary puts it) is very bloggy, and in part because the term tends to irritate the print people who write them. GOOD NEWS FOR ILLINOIS DEATH PENALTY ADVOCATES As my colleague Robert Becker reported yesterday, Northwestern Law professor Larry Marshall has accepted a permanent appointment to head the clinical law program at Stanford University. Marshall, who played a key role in reversing murder convictions in such high-profile cases as Rolando Cruz, the Ford Heights Four and Gary Gauger, said Wednesday he will step down as legal director of Northwestern's Center on Wrongful Convictions. Marshall is a former rabbinical student and U.S. Supreme Court clerk, and he played an unsung, behind-the-scenes role in former Gov. George Ryan's decision to commute all of Illinois' death sentences in 2003. My first meeting with Marshall was on Monday, November 8, 1993. The day before I'd published a column about the then-upcoming execution of John Wayne Gacy in which I urged death penalty opponents not to protest Gacy's execution, but to wait and then focus attention on the larger, systemic problems with the death penalty. For instance, I wrote, \"Substantial opinion says several men now on Death Row in Illinois may also be innocent-Rolando Cruz, convicted of the 1983 slaying of 10-year-old Jeanine Nicarico in Naperville is one of them.\" Marshall called me the next day: \"I'm Cruz's attorney,\" he said. \"Would you like to look over some of the documents on the case? You might find them interesting.\" OK, I said. A couple of hours later he showed up, unannounced, with a huge collection of transcripts, briefs and news articles that had been written on the case. Over the years I came to know--and like and respect - Marshall so well that I stopped interviewing him or writing about him. It's been almost four years since I've mentioned him in my column. But I've noticed that even his foes - the prosecutors whose cases he regularly attacks - respect his integrity and his intellect. He believes not only in his cause, but in each of the clients he represents, which is why he never got the reputation as an opportunist, a reputation that often dogs crusading lawyers. In this one swoop our area is also losing a nationally recognized expert on infanticide De Paul University Law professor Michelle Oberman. She is married to Marshall and is now at Santa Clara University School of Law. THURSDAY, JAN. 20, 2005 updated at 8:10 p.m. BUT WHAT FUN IS THIS? I'm occasionally asked about my Neil Steinberg policy. It's to ignore everything he writes about me when he's wrong, and everything else he writes when he's right. So I'm left with few opportunities to mention him at all. Today's column in which I predict with utter confidence that Barack Obama will run for president in 2008, his protestations to the contrary, has drawn a large and often passionate response - most of it skeptical, some of it hostile. Some respondents wonder why I took the presumptuous tone and approach instead of sidling toward a conclusion more along the lines of \"even though he says he won't run, there are many reasons to think that he might, in fact run.\" My answer is, see the first paragraph of this item. Also, it's hard to go wrong when you plan to follow the standard media practice of making bold predictions and then reminding people about them when you're right ( as first forecast here... ) and never mentioning the matter again when you're wrong. I learned how to do this from the Michael Sneed Famous Columnists School, where we learned another lesson today: WRONG: New York Newsday columnist Liz Smith reported Wednesday that former president Bill Clinton could be the next Secretary General of the United Nations if Kofi Annan resigns RIGHT: Tipsville? Is former President Bill Clinton being promoted as the next secretary-general of the United Nations if Kofi Annan resigns? That's the latest rumor hitting the grapevine. A BACK OF THE ENVELOPE CALCULATION If Roger Clemens gets $22 million to pitch for the Houston Astros this year and he throws 100 pitches a game for 30 games (3,000 pitches), that works out to more that $7,000 per pitch . Mike Downey explains today why he's not particularly bothered by this rate of compensation - the free market at work and all that. He makes a good argument, though I wish the entire financial scale of big-time sports was smaller so that ticket prices weren't so high, but no one forces me to buy tickets so I'm not going to complain. Does anyone want to calculate how much highly paid pros earn per oft-repeated act and compare that rate of compensation to Roger's Request? Remember John Edwards? He was just a first-term senator and his pre-Senate resume - he was a successful trial lawyer - looks vapid and thin compared to Obama's record in public and private service. Yet lots of people took him very seriously as a presidential candidate last year. I'm sure others will be weighing in with their own list of reasons why I'm wrong, and I'll be glad to link to them (check back here as the day goes on).

Columnist Paul Varnell, in his latest column in the Windy City Times, a gay publication, distributed credit for recent passage of amendment to the state's civil rights laws that bans discrimination against homosexuals: Over the years gays were significantly aided by conscientious reporters and supportive columnists in the print media such as Jean Latz Griffin and Eric Zorn at the Chicago Tribune, and Tom Brune, Howard Wolinsky and Neil Steinberg at the Sun-Times--and unnamed editorial writers at both papers. WEDNESDAY, JAN. 19, 2005 updated at 6:12 p..m. Z-MAIL Dean V. -- Chicago's Winter Hump Day is not Jan. 19. National Weather Service data I've looked at shows: The lowest of the average low temperatures recorded for Chicago is 12 degrees, occurring between Jan. 15 and 21. The lowest of the average high temperatures recorded for Chicago is 29 degrees, occurring on Jan. 15 and 16. The lowest average median recorded for Chicago is 20 F, occurring between Jan. 15th and 18th. Meteorological winter runs from Dec. 1st through February 28th The midpoint of that 90 day period is Jan. 14 and 15. . If you average the dates above, you get Jan. 16. My figures are a couple of years old by now and I remember at the time that the interpretation wasn't as simple as finding the one day of the year that had the lowest average low, median and high temperatures. Given that, my new modest proposal is that we observe WHD on the same third Monday of January as we observe Martin Luther King Day - not to take away from the MLK celebrations but to add to them. I was on a CTA bus today when a stinking wino roused himself from sleep and staggered to the exit, shedding pages of the Chicago Sun-Times that had been covering him during his extended nap. And what should fall on my lap but a fetid copy of page 22, the very page upon which Neil Steinberg was feasting on the chum I had thrown into the quaint little shark tank that he calls a column - a column I never, ever would have occasion to look at or read, of course. But there it was: And his wife works for NPR So I was enduring another lecture from Prof. Zorn, not in his newspaper, of course, but in the hobby blog he uses to gusher on at a stridency and a length too tedious even for his Trib column (I tell you, I get bored and skim sometimes, and it's about me.) I typically refrain from comment. But this week's tirade was so nagging and unfair that I began to break my rule and leap to my defense. But after a few paragraphs I deleted it all, realizing just in time I was falling into his trap, becoming as petty and prolix as he. And why put you through that? I will professorially parse this little tantrum in a moment, but first, for you Steinberg readers who are checking in for the first time, the \"nagging and unfair\" blog item he was referring to: STEINBERG, PIMPING I turned on public radio Saturday morning hoping to hear the handwringing, bedwetting liberal blather that so vexes Sun-Times print blogger Neil Steinberg, who picks on NPR in his column almost every chance he gets. What did I hear instead? Why, none other than Neil Steinberg himself, flogging his new book yet again in a public radio interview. Shameless. Ah. Recently, Steinberg described himself in print as \"brash\" and \"mouthy,\" but I felt that description was inexact. Readers helpfully contributed many alternative adjectives - some more complimentary than others. But if I must pick just two to replace \"brash\" and \"mouthy,\" I'll go with \"shameless\" and \"touchy.\" Yet because I am such a fair fellow, I'll note that he's shameless and touchy in a compelling and usually eloquent way. A former friend of Neil's e-mailed me after this appeared and said, \"Good thing he doesn't read blogs, or who knows where this would lead.\" \"Oh,\" I replied. \"He'll read this one.\" Sure enough. He just happened to be bored and skimming, just like I happened to see his page of the Sun-Times totally by accident today. Let's take it from the top. My wife doesn't work for NPR. As I disclose frequently and disclosed at the end of that item, she works for WBEZ-FM. This is an immaterial error, I admit - WBEZ is not owned by NPR but it is the local affiliate - but it's an error nonetheless. He calls this a \"hobby blog.\" It's not. It's formally one-third of my duties here at the Tribune (I used to write three columns a week; now I write two columns plus the Notebook). And as I've noted before, Steinberg, who spends much of his free time writing books that almost nobody buys and fewer people read than visit this blog in one week, is the last person to accuse anyone of writing for a hobby. Not that there's anything wrong with that. He says that he typically refrains from comment, but, in fact, the beautiful thing is that he frequently mentions my name in his column - and always in that brittle tone of superior contempt. I never mention his name in my column. No, that's not quite true. I did once, July 30, 2003, when I listed him in the company of Chris Rock, Al Franken, Roy Blount Jr., David Sedaris and others who'd made me laugh--in a good way-- in the previous year. I do mention him here from time to time--sometimes favorably, because I am the bigger person, sometimes critically, because he asks for it -- but by no stretch of the imagination is this site about him, as he dreams; not like his old \"Bob Watch\" column was about Bob Greene. Where are we? Oh, yes. \"Striden(t)....tedious... nagging and unfair...petty and prolix.\" Hey I started the adjective war, I can take it. But as far as critics go, Steinberg has bigger issues today with Don Wade. The WLS-AM (890) commercial radio host tore into the portion of Steinberg's column dealing with Condoleezza Rice (If a wino has never shed a copy of Steinberg's column on you, it's a lot like a blog, only in print. He flits from one topic to the next, first offering a barstool opinion, then moving along to, say, tell us about a man he saw on the street carrying a child's umbrella or the last chess match he played with his son.) Wade called Steinberg's column \"shameful...a vicious, racist attack....an attack on an African American so blatant, so vicious so racist...\" and concluded, \"I don't know anybody who has that kind of arrogance. Has Neil Steinberg been drinking? Has he been doing drugs?\" I hope that through some fluke I'll chance upon Steinberg's next column to see how he defends himself against a real attack. Wednesday, which some people call \"hump day\" because, well, you know why (look here if you don't), is also,this year, Winter Hump Day. Jan. 19 is the day when average daily temperatures at O'Hare begin to nose back up again from a low of 21 degrees, reversing the smooth downward trend that begins on Aug. 1. That's worth celebrating. Three years ago I studied the charts to fix the date, named it Winter Hump Day and called for delirious annual celebrations. (I also proposed that March 31, when the normal low temperature breaks the freezing mark, be commemorated as Thaws Day and that July 12, when the normal high temperature at O'Hare crests at 84 degrees, be dubbed Fry Day). After all, the current analogous landmarks on our calendar--the solstices and equinoxes--are simply ancient approximations of these shifts as made by thermometerless agrarians. Thousands of years ago, people in our hemisphere noticed that the sun began to \"return\" and the days began to get longer right about Dec. 21. This herald of spring gave rise to all kinds of merrymaking, even though the poor ignorant sodbusters were generally in for four more weeks of plunging temperatures. How would they have known? They were able to measure the sun's apparent shifts in the skies with crude arrangements of rocks, but until Galileo fashioned the first thermometer around 1600, there was no way they could quantify or average daily fluctuations in outdoor air temperature. They couldn't get a handle on what WGN-TV/Tribune weather guru Tom Skilling calls \"thermal inertia--the lag of about one month that it takes the atmosphere to respond to the change in the angle of the sun.\" This same lag explains why the hottest days of the year tend to occur roughly 21 days after the summer solstice. Now we know better. Now it's time for a change in thinking Now... let the wild rumpus start! A MATTER OF PRIORITIES This item is a bit late, but reader Beth P. reminded me of a news story in last week's Tribune that cried out for comment. It was a page 3 Associated Press dispatch that described Pope John Paul II's agenda for the Vatican in 2005. What do you suppose was at the top of that agenda? Opposing the war in Iraq? The pope has been outspoken about that, after all. No, not that. Showing moral and practical leadership in the crisis in Sudan? In fighting against hunger, disease and destruction in the world's poorest areas? No. Good guesses, but no. Maybe battling abortion, racism or - hey, here's one - child sexual abuse? Nope. \"In his speech to the diplomats, the pope put lobbying against same-sex marriage at the top of the Vatican's agenda for 2005.\" Z-MAIL Joe W. -- You object to \"tsunami\" as a metaphor, but what makes \"tsunami\" special? Yes, 175,000 people have been reported dead (so far) in South Asia, but there have been far worse disasters in history with no changes in language. But we still use \"flood\" metaphorically, even though about 300,000 people were killed in Bangladesh in a 1970 flood, and 130,000 died in 1991. We use \"earthquake\" metaphorically. As many as750,000 died in China from a 1976 quake. Landslides have killed hundreds of thousands of people over the years. But \"landslide\" is still used to mean something other than an actual landslide. Why should \"tsunami\" be any different? The best I can do to explain it to you is to point out that \"tsunami\" is, until further notice, inextricably associated with one particular event and therefore with specific victims, while those other words are not. For a similar reason, \"ground zero\" became a distasteful way to refer to the center of action after the 9/11/2001. In the year before \"ground zero\" came to mean that spot in New York CIty where some 3,000 people died, papers here referred to \"ground zero of the pennant races,\" \"ground zero of the energy crisis,\" \"ground zero of O'Hare debate,\" \"ground zero with Geneva's volleyball program,\" \"ground zero for the cultural, business and political life of black people in Chicago,\" and so on. Similarly, you might say a running back \"spun and whirled through the defense like a tornado,\" but you wouldn't say he \"spun and whirled through the defense like the Utica tornado.\" R.W. -- Regarding the \"Baby Evan\" case, if I were to have fathered a child from a temporary fling, and if the mother were to not want the child, I, as the child's would want right of first refusal. If Mom doesn't want the kid, I, as Dad, am the first choice for custody. This letter went on at some length about the rights of biological fathers, which I believe ought not to exist at all. You want rights, sperminator? Marry the mom. Otherwise, I say it should be copulator emptor -- you get a woman pregnant, it's all responsibilities, no rights. It's the child who has the right to know his/her biological father -- to have some relationship with that man if possible. And so yes, for that reason, I agree that the law ought to give priority and preference to that blood bond. But please. Spare us all the preening about the \"rights\" you acquired when you impregnated someone. The local print media have shown admirable, even amazing restraint in not sensationalizing the story of the custody battle over 3 1/2-year-old Evan Scott, who as of Sunday night is living in Glenview with his biological mother. The TV coverage of the transfer of custody Saturday in Atlantic Beach, Fla., was lurid, sickening and most likely misleading. It was awful, watching Dawn and Gene Scott hand Evan over to Amanda Hopkins, his biological mother, and then crumble in grief, as anyone would. They'd raised the boy since he was two days old. The case has some similarities to high-profile custody battles in the mid-1990s - the most notable one in this area being the so-called \"Baby Richard\" case in which biological father Otakar Kirchner successfully wrested his son Danny from Jay and Kimberly Warburton of Schaumburg, who had adopted him shortly after birth. I came out on the Warburtons' side initially - though not nearly so vehemently as my former colleague Bob Greene - but then came to realize that such matters are not always as simple as they might seem. I'd viewed the issue as a parent: How would we have felt if the courts had ordered us to turn our son over forever to another family? And how would our son have felt, or how would I have felt at 3 1/2, to be torn from the only mother and father he has ever known? Devastated doesn't even say it. I projected that gut reaction onto the Baby Richard case: Forget about the quibbling adults; set aside the legal blather. Don't traumatize the boy by taking him out of a home where he is now healthy and happy. But I received objections from a source that surprised me -- adults who had been adopted as children. In voice-mail messages and follow-up phone calls -- occasionally angry or tearful, always thoughtful -- they pointed out that those of us non-adoptees who believed that it was in \"the best interests of the child\" for the boy to stay where he was were taking a short-term view of what his \"interests\" are. We were not, they said, taking into account the enduring power and importance of biological ties, ties we take for granted. Many I spoke to on this subject were passionate about natural ties. Some made reference to \"the primal wound,\" a trendy term that refers to the anguish some say infants inevitably experience when they are separated from their birth mothers and put up for adoption. In the short term, they argued, there is no question that a child so displaced will suffer intense feelings of loss and abandonment. And it is these feelings, this pain, that most in the general public can identify with and want, almost instinctively, to spare him. But most of us have no vantage point for a longer view. As non-adoptees, we are strangers to the long-term pain the adoptees suggested that children in Evan's position are likely to endure in adolescence and adulthood, knowing that his adoptive parents fought to keep him from his biological parents. It is the mysterious but powerful bonds of blood -- not conflicting claims about which adults have which rights when -- that makes these cases more complicated and more subtle than they seem when TV cameras poke their ugly snouts into moments of searing pain. I like to think that, at last, we in the print media are getting that. She ran the octaves from trivia to timelessness with speed and harmony. She could do funny and wise and sad all in the same paragraph, with no seams showing.... Her prose was razor-sharp, her personality gentle. Her mind was relentless, her manner good-natured. Her standards were exacting, her impulse forgiving. She was by nature the center of most rooms she entered, yet preferred to draw out others, to listen. As her momentum carried her to the top of the stairs, Alice looked back and tossed me a radiant smile. She had become my glimmering girl: She looked like a rock star. She looked like a teenager. She looked absolutely stunning. She thundered down the stairs in those shoes, and as the front door slammed behind her, it came to me -- what fantasy I had finally, easily entered this Halloween. I'd just seen Alice leave for her prom, or her first real date. I'd cheated time, flipping the calendar five or six years into the future. The character I'd played was the 52-year-old mother I will probably never be. After a 25-day break, Sneed returns today and immediately--in her first item--resolves what could have been a prickly dispute between me and Richard Roeper. Sneed writes that Gov. Rod Blagojevich \" may have (italics mine) enlisted the hush-hush advice of top Dem political strategist James Carville to help him win re-election ... and perhaps save him from the negative PR tsunami launched by his fed-up father-in-law.\" (Boldface also mine; needless ellipses hers) On Jan. 6 in this space I'd noted that the word \"tsunami,\" in part because it is so distinctive and now so inextricably associated with this massively ghastly sudden loss of some 160,000 lives, is no longer an acceptable metaphor for writers to use evoke a sudden, very precipitous and yet temporary increase. I predicted that for many years we will no more speak of a \"tsunami of e-mail\" than we will a \"holocaust of e-mail.\" Last week, Richard Roeper answered this prediction with a sharp, \"forget about it.\" He quoted Kent Brownridge, general manager of Wenner Media (parent company of Us Weekly magazine), in the New York Post: \"For a celebrity weekly, [the Brad Pitt Jennifer Aniston break up] is our tsunami.\" Actually, though, Brownridge was not using \"tsunami\" as a metaphor. He was - admittedly tastelessly--comparing the magnitude of the tsunami news story in the serious media with the magnitude of the Brad-Jen news story in the fluffy media. Sneed has rendered my quibble with Roeper moot. She has demonstrated that I was wrong; that, in fact, certain writers will plunge on and use \"tsunami\" for its cute sound even though it now conjures up the sudden, horrifying deaths of tens of thousands of people. Hat tip to you, Rich. Z-MAIL Don. B -- I don't think that one needs to be well-versed in all things pop culture in order to be a good conversationalist. There are just too many things out there. What you have to do is know at least enough about things to be able to negotiate a path from there to something you and your conversation partner both know about. I know almost nothing about sports, for instance, certainly not compared to people who can quote player stats from memory. However, this provides me with good questions to ask, and my conversant with something to explain If it turns out to be something interesting, away we go. And if it turns out to be dull, well, that's when I get to practice steering towards music, linguistics, or something else I'm more interested in. This reminds me of one of Dale Carnegie's most famous maxims, \"To be interesting, be interested.\" And any mention of that seminal self-help guru reminds me of the classic one-line quip, \"I used to have trouble remembering names, but then I took that Sam Carnegie course.\" However, I think it's unfair of him to say there haven't been any recent Hollywood portrayals of disabled people \"simply living,\" as he put it. There have been quite a few, and many of those have won Academy Awards. Consider: The Elephant Man My Left Foot Shine A Beautiful Mind Born on the Fourth of July Passion Fish Radio Simon Birch I Am Sam And I have to say the whole sub-genre of \"Heartwarming Story of a Disabled Person\" really doesn't appeal to me. I think it's just too pat, too easy. But to say that the only portrayals out there are of disabled people wishing to die (or being 'mercifully' killed) is a little harsh. Two films came out back to back, (\"...Baby\" and \"The Sea Inside'\") coincidentally I think. That hardly means that the moviegoing public is salivating to see the wheelchair-bound off themselves. A certain activist group has big issues with the hit movie \"Million Dollar Baby\" and the critics who have extravagantly praised it. I can't really discuss the matter without giving away the ending of the film, so if you haven't seen it and don't want it spoiled for you, click here and go on to the next item. I'll wait.... OK, is that fair warning enough for you? Ready? Here's the top of the news release from Not Dead Yet, a group of activists representing the disabled: Disability Activists Call Chicago Movie Critics: \"Million Dollar Bigots\" January 19, 2005 at 6 p.m., 65 W. Jackson Blvd., Chicago. Chicago disability activists will be protesting the bigotry and ignorance of the members of the Chicago Film Critics Association (CFCA). Virtually every critic in the association gave a rave review to Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby, a film that promotes the killing of disabled people as the solution to the problem of disability. How does the movie end? I haven't seen it yet, but the spoil-errific folks at TheMovieSpoiler.com describe it this way: Maggie (the boxer played by Hillary Swank who is paralyzed after a spinal cord injury) is bedridden for a long time and eventually has to have her leg amputated due to muscle atrophy and bed sores. She asks Frankie (her trainer, played by Clint Eastwood) for a favor. She no longer wants to live. She had her shot and wants to die remembering the crowd cheering her name. Frankie contemplates \"slowly killing\" her by letting her live or end her life while she is \"living....\" Frankie decides to fulfill her wishes and ends her life. a corny, melodramatic assault on people with disabilities. It plays out killing as a romantic fantasy and gives emotional life to the \"better dead than disabled\" mindset lurking in the heart of the typical (read: nondisabled) audience member.... These films don't reflect the typical disability experience, which, for most of us, is just the experience of living our lives. Books and movies about our simple struggle to live life in an oppressive society receive little notice from the public, press or critics. It's only when a disabled person, real or fictional, says they want to die that the movie becomes a hit, the book a bestseller. I can easily see public discourse on this topic devolving into sniping and hostile caricature. Sure, there are profoundly disabled people who do want to die, and filmmakers and writers should be able to tell their stories and provoke dialogue about the right to die. At the same time, Drake makes a good point -- that we far less often hear about let alone see celebrated the stories of those who are profoundly disabled yet savor their lives every bit as much as anybody else. It seems to me that it's this trend, not so much the plot of \"Million Dollar Baby\" in a vacuum, that's the problem. I can't recall seeing anything quite as bold in any publication as \"Outside the Tent,\" described as \"An experimental column in which the Los Angeles Times invites outside critics to take their best shot at Southern California's heaviest newspaper.\" The first offering is a appeal for more gossip. It's written by Mickey Kaus, Slate's resident blogger. Newspapers field criticism all the time, of course, but usually on specific controversial topics in the news and in the familiar confines of letters to the editor or obiter dicta from ombudsmen or public editors. I've never seen a publication--a media entity of any sort--offer considerable space to an independent, critical voice and say \"c'mon...what you got?\" My guess is that readers will appreciate the bravery of the effort. FINE LINES Liberals feel unworthy of their possessions. Conservatives feel they deserve everything they've stolen. Mort Sahl, cited by a friend as a companion quote to John McCarron's, Ownership society? That's conservative code for \"Got mine. Get yours.\" I happen to think that liberals have basically won the church-state argument, and all that's left is fighting over scraps that aren't worth it. It just feeds the religious right's feeling of righteous besiegement while gaining almost nothing in practical terms. Who really cares if Roy Moore plops a Ten Commandments monument in front of his courthouse? I can't help but wonder where these high-minded defenders of journalistic purity were just a few short years ago, when conservative darling John Stossel was forced to issue an on-air apology for presenting phony scientific test results on ABC's 20/20. Skinner, who was bounced from her weekly, token-liberal gig on WLS-AM (890) in July, 2003 after announcing her candidacy on the air, said she expects to start Friday. Following her in WXDX's broadcast day will be the syndicated radio stylings of the egregious Jerry Springer, whose politically-oriented show debuts today on WCKY-AM in his native Cincinnati. Springer will continue to celebrate the seamy, grotesque, painful, violent and lurid aspects of life on his daily TV program, taped here in Chicago. Skinner and Springer will be followed by programming from the Air America liberal talk network (including former local star Mike Malloy) , which still, unaccountably, has no outlet in Chicago even though one of the major, early backers of Air America, philanthropist Sheldon Drobney, hails from Highland Park. STEINBERG, PIMPING I turned on public radio Saturday morning hoping to hear the handwringing, bedwetting liberal blather that so vexes Sun-Times print blogger Neil Steinberg, who picks on NPR in his column almost every chance he gets. What did I hear instead? Why, none other than Neil Steinberg himself, flogging his new book yet again in a public radio interview. Shameless. Ah. Recently, Steinberg described himself in print as \"brash\" and \"mouthy,\" but I felt that description was inexact. Readers helpfully contributed many alternative adjectives - some more complimentary than others. But if I must pick just two to replace \"brash\" and \"mouthy,\" I'll go with \"shameless\" and \"touchy.\" Yet because I am such a fair fellow, I'll note that he's shameless and touchy in a compelling and usually eloquent way. University of Illinois College of Law Professor Francis Boyle announced Friday afternoon that he has nominated former Illinois Governor George Ryan for the 2005 Nobel Peace Prize for his work battling the death penalty. I'm expecting the usual round of seething and snarling about this news from conservatives who will point to Ryan's upcoming corruption trial as evidence that he doesn't deserve the honor of this nomination. But, first of all, the Nobel Peace Prize is not a lifetime achievement award or a merit badge for overall character. Alfred Nobel's will decreed that the peace prize be given \"to the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between the nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses,\" which could (and has in the past) attach to activism on vital social issues. And the fact that Yasser Arafat (1994) and Henry Kissinger (1973) are both winners illustrates that one not need be beyond reproach in all respects to be considered. In the second place, it's not all that big a deal to be nominated for a Nobel Prize. Any university professor of law, political science, history or philosophy may submit a letter on someone's behalf to Stockholm, and that person has a nifty line on his resume for the rest of his life. I mean, if I could find a professor willing to compromise his gravitas in the name of underscoring this point, I could be nominated for my work in attempting to broker peace between civil libertarians and religious worrywarts in the \"Christmas Wars.\" I'm just saying. FINE LINES Ownership society? That's conservative code for \"Got mine. Get yours.\" Only those who risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go. T.S. Eliot An earthquake would have left remnants to rummage through; floods and hurricanes would have allowed time for survivors to pack up their essential documents. The tsunami, in the suddenness of its onslaught, allowed for no preparations: not only did it destroy the survivors' homes and families; it also robbed them of all the evidentiary traces of their place in the world. U.S. authorities refused to allow a British Airways flight bound for New York to land on American soil because of a suspicious passenger. They requested the flight be diverted to Bangor, Maine. Now I am no geographic expert but how do you think that makes the people of Bangor feel? We don't want that to land in America. Send it to Bangor, Maine. What? Did we lose Maine in a poker game? Jay Leno Here's something you don't see every day: an entire moon of Saturn, hundreds of miles in diameter -- and it has a seam like a cheap toy ball. Gail B. - My 22 year old son is in the Army, an infantryman, he's trained to kill, not work behind the scenes and is headed for Iraq the end of January. When people hear this news, their comment is likely to be, \"He'll be in our prayers.\" The appropriate answer would at least be, \"Thanks, I appreciate your concern\" and I usually manage to mumble some approximation of that. Like you, however, I don't know if God exists, I don't care, and their offer of prayer annoys me. I want to say, \"Don't bother\" or \"Go ahead if it will make you feel better.\" As if it would matter. As if the friends and relatives of all the dead soldiers didn't pray effectively. What about the cancer survivors who attribute their remission to prayer? What does that say about those who prayed and died? What would you say? I would say thank you...because I would know what they meant (and what they didn't mean) by those words. It's my sense that in many cases \"I'm praying for you\" is more of a colloquialism than an actual promise that's literally fulfilled. I'm sometimes tempted to use the expression myself because, in our culture, it seems to me to be a shorthand way of saying \"I care about you, I'm thinking about you, I really want you to take strength from knowing how many people in your life want to extend support to you.\" I'm less sure how to react when people thank God for their good fortune or use an expression that suggests some form of good fortune is an answered prayer, God's grace in action or, as John Kass wrote recently, the act of an angel. Taken literally, this sentiment is very problematic -- as I've noted, I'm not sure which is more philosophically troubling - the idea of God who, conditionally, intervenes in life to grant the wishes expressed in prayers, or the idea of God who does not. Often, though, again, I think these are colloquial expressions of relief -- I'm sure I've used them myself, even after such trivial events as not forgetting my wallet as I rush out of the house in the morning (\"thank God I remembered, otherwise we'd have to go back and we'd be late!\") not meant to be analyzed too deeply. Jens Zorn -- You wrote that One of the great purposes and pleasures of culture--including high and low, artistic, social and political--is the way it gives us new starting points, things in common that advance our discussions and lower the walls that separate us. I might have added sports to your list and I might replace \"discussions\" with \"conversations.\" It seems to me that being able to have true conversation depends on one's ability to say something that invites an engaged reply from the other. This is where the common culture gives a neutral ground for small talk that, with luck, leads to a deeper interaction. I agree strongly with your statements that a person needs an understanding of pop culture to be considered as truly educated. Not everyone would agree with us... indeed there are many persons with advanced degrees who take pride in their indifference to the cultures of sports and of automobiles. But these folk can often only converse with their own kind because they seem incapable of utterance to which those not of the same kind can truly respond. Sustaining cultural literacy is no easy task... My own has huge gaps in contemporary music, in Harry Potterism, in video games, in TV (I may be the last living American who has not ever seen a complete episode of \"Friends\" or \"The Simpsons\"), and I'm a complete novice in religion. But I'm interested in enough other stuff to get by in most situations. I can't believe my own father has never watched \"The Simpsons.\" I burn with shame. Anyone who tries to follow pop cultural trends as a way to understanding shifts in the culture at large ought to be interested in this break-up, if only intellectually. As I argued several years ago in a similar context, ignorance of pop cultural developments and phenomena is a form of illiteracy. \"Literacy,\" broadly defined, involves at least passing knowledge of that which has seized the attention and imagination of the public. One of the great purposes and pleasures of culture--including high and low, artistic, social and political--is the way it gives us new starting points, things in common that advance our discussions and lower the walls that separate us. So I'm trying to care about Brad and Jen. Really I am. DOMESTIC DISCORD, PART TWO Amy Dickinson today offers the best line so far about the Gov. Blagojevich/ Ald. Mell dispute: It is no fun being witness to a family feud, but then again, it sort of is. I feel bad for the collateral victims here - wives and daughters, mostly - but if the governor and the alderman weren't worried enough about their loved ones to handle this dispute with discretion and class, I'm sure not going to lose any sleep on their behalf. To most of us, this story is yet another news gift that keeps on giving. Yesterday, the governor declared his administration \"clean as a hound's tooth,\" a folksy expression that reminded me of Dan Rather in its down-home imagery and of Gary Hart in its challenging tone. Hart, you'll recall, was dogged by rumors of marital infidelity in 1987 during the early stages of his run for the presidency, so he dared reporters, \"Follow me around. I don't care. If anybody wants to put a tail on me, go ahead. They'd be very bored.\" Reporters did tail him and yet they were not bored. Blago, who reiterated his \"bring it on!\" stance in another news conference today, is all but inviting stories such as this one in today's Tribune that casts a withering eye on his efforts to reform the Illinois State Board of Education: The new board hired a 24-year-old chief of staff who previously had driven Blagojevich's press van through rural Illinois. It approved a Downstate charter school at the governor's urging, even though the previous board had denied it four times. While it remained silent on key education issues, the board loudly publicized Blagojevich's proposed ban on violent video games.... Blagojevich also has silenced another voice on education, the Education Funding Advisory Board. By state law, the five-member board composed of business leaders and educators is supposed to recommend, every two years, a minimum per-pupil spending level. Using state and national research, the group is supposed to send lawmakers a report on Jan. 1 in odd-numbered years. Since Blagojevich took office two years ago, four members have either resigned or their terms have expired. The governor has not replaced any of them. As a result, no report was sent to lawmakers this year as required by law. The Daily Herald this morning found even a little more tartar on the gubernatorial hound's tooth: For the past month, Gov. Rod Blagojevich has garnered national attention for his plans to ban the sale of violent or sexually explicit video games to children. But in 1999, while serving in the U.S. House, Blagojevich voted against legislation that would have prohibited children's access to the very materials he now finds objectionable. The governor needs to realize soon that this vast cynicism about him will only get worse if he doesn't start behaving more like a work horse instead of a show horse. Yes, he has a lot of money in his campaign account, but money isn't everything. If it was, Blair Hull or Jack Ryan would now be the newest US Senator from Illinois. The folks at The Rod Report are happier than a possum in a hollow log with dead mouse between its teeth. SPORTING CHALLENGE I was explaining to my 7-year-old son the other day why I never watch the first half action in an NBA game -- because it doesn't matter; they don't even really start trying until the end of the game -- when I began to wonder what the statistics show. Does the first half \"matter\" in an NBA game any more than it does in, say, an NCAA basketball game? An NFL or NCAA football game? Soccer games at any level? The first four innings of baseball games? Put another way, is the team that's ahead at halftime less likely to end up winning an NBA game than the team that's ahead halfway through other contests in other sports or in basketball at lower levels? Obviously, the team that's ahead at halftime--by one point or several dozen--- will win more often than not in every sport. But how does that winning percentage change from sport to sport? I would do the necessary research and calculations myself, but then I would deprive some math teacher of a valuable class project or some stats freak the deep satisfaction of figuring it out for himself. It seems to me that examining as few as 100 random games in each sport would give results that would suggest a pattern, if any. Results are due by the end of the semester. Use both sides of the page if necessary. Several letter writers have taken me to task for not discussing in the role that prohibitions on use of the pesticide DDT have played in the continued incidence of malaria-- a terrible worldwide problem that's now flaring up in the tsunami zone. Point taken. DDT is an important angle to the story, but I decided not to try to shoehorn it into a column roughly 700 words long -- After all, a New York Times writer needed nearly 5,000 words last April to make the case that \"What the World Needs Now Is DDT.\" Here are a few passages from that piece: It repels mosquitoes in addition to killing them, which delays the onset of pesticide-resistance. It costs a quarter as much as the next cheapest insecticide. It is DDT.... Ask Americans over 40 to name the most dangerous chemical they know, and chances are that they will say DDT....(It) was banned in the United States in 1972....Its persistence in the ecosystem, where it builds up to kill birds and fish, has become a symbol of the dangers of playing God with nature, an icon of human arrogance. Countries throughout the world have signed a treaty promising to phase out its use.... (Yet) sprayed in tiny quantities inside houses -- the only way anyone proposes to use it today -- DDT is most likely not harmful to people or the environment. Certainly, the possible harm from DDT is vastly outweighed by its ability to save children's lives..... Given the malignant history of American companies employing dangerous drugs and pesticides overseas that they would not or could not use at home, it is understandable why Washington officials say it would be hypocritical to finance DDT in poor nations. But children sick with malaria might perceive a more deadly hypocrisy in our failure to do so.... The move away from DDT in the 60's and 70's led to a resurgence of malaria in various countries ...those countries that then returned to DDT saw their epidemics controlled..... DDT killed bald eagles because of its persistence in the environment. ''Silent Spring'' (Rachel Carson's 1962 book that raised alarms about DDT but did not mention its role in fighting malaria) is now killing African children because of its persistence in the public mind... Most environmental groups don't object to DDT where it is used appropriately and is necessary to fight malaria. But liberals still tend to consider it a symbol of the Frankenstein effects of unbridled faith in technology. For conservatives, whose Web sites foam at the mouth about the hypocrisy of environmentalists, DDT continues to represent the victory of overzealous regulators and Luddites who misread and distort science... DDT could protect people for $1.70 per person per year.... NYT columnist Nicholas Kristof summarized this information last week in \"It's Time to Spray DDT,\" and found little objection from the environmental activists whom everyone seems to want to blame: So why do the U.N. and donor agencies, including the U.S. Agency for International Development, generally avoid financing DDT programs? The main obstacle seems to be bureaucratic caution and inertia. In his conclusion, Kristof echoed a January, 2001 column by my colleague Steve Chapman: Environmental groups that want a worldwide ban (on DDT), notably the World Wildlife Fund, say countries with a problem should use other pesticides. But that's like saying firemen should fight blazes with anything but water.... Public health experts say nothing is as effective as DDT. And the alternatives are not only inferior but much more expensive. Note--here is the World Wildlife Fund position paper on DDT and malaria. I asked Josh Gottlieb, the subject of my column, for his thoughts on DDT, and he e-mailed this response: DDT is an extremely effective tool in the control of malaria, and the obstacles to its use are directly contributing to thousands of deaths. The interesting question to examine is the level to which dogmatism rather than rationality and data drive decision-making and policy..... Too often important policy decisions are driven by an emotional response to incomplete data or an historical inertia that is difficult to overcome. As important as overcoming this in any particular case might be, it is even more essential for us all to re-examine our decision-making methodology on both personal and societal levels. Various commentators have blamed the World Health Organization, in particular, for excessive stubbornness. Kristof called on the Bush Administration to lead the call for renewed use of DDT in malaria-ravaged areas. A better idea still would be for environmentalists to lead that call instead of offering mild assent when columnists contact them.. I do love you. I can't help that. But your relationship with food is killing you. It's killing us. At first it seemed like an eccentricity. Charming, almost. Almost. But the sandwiches, those obscene, grotesque sandwiches you consume ... Why do you need them so desperately? Will Kenyon -- The story in words and pictures of the life so far of William Albert Kenyon, born 16 weeks premature last October. Will is the grandson of local conservative spokesman Marty Geraghty, and the medical drama here is high. FINE LINES The United States has stopped searching for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Has ended the search. So two years of looking, one war and the closest we came to it was a pound and a half of rancid mutton David Letterman Under Saddam, Iraq's Sunni minority, with only 20 percent of the population, ruled everyone. These fascist insurgents have never given politics a chance to work in Iraq because they don't want it to work. That's why they have never issued a list of demands. They don't want people to see what they are really after, which is continued minority rule, Saddamism without Saddam. If that was my politics, I'd be wearing a ski mask over my head, too. I'm hoping the idea of a term limit for Supreme Court justices is gaining traction. Tony Mauro, U.S. Supreme Court correspondent for American Lawyer Media and Legal Times, boosted this common-sense Constitutional reform in this USA today essay and noted: The justices who have left the court in the past 35 years served an average of 25 years before retiring. By contrast, the justices who departed in the early years of the republic served an average of eight years. And once again, Swami Zorn forecasts that, one year from now, we'll be laughing at all the events they predicted that didn't come true and all the events they failed to forecast. Z-MAIL T.J.R. -- I'm usually a mild mannered moderate, but I'm finally at the point that I have got to blow off steam. Millions of children killed every year by malaria, tsunami orphans sold into slavery, men women and children being slaughtered in the Sudan because they don't believe in Allah, and countless other atrocities being inflicted upon innocent human beings, and these clowns are worried about what people are doing in their bedrooms. This is ridiculous. What ever happened to Barry Goldwater Republicans who believed in a fundamental right to privacy? Jim C. You wrote that the man who operates the Joliet landfill at the center of the Gov. Rod Blagojevich / Ald. Richard Mell dispute is the governor's \"wife's grandmother's brother's grandson (her second cousin if I read my genealogical charts correctly).\" But wouldn't it have been easier (and clearer) to say, \"the son of Dick Mell's cousin?\" Yes, but it would have been less fun and less illustrative of the distance in the blood tie. I was not trying to pull a fast one , as in, \"it's well known that the governor is sleeping with his wife's mother's brother's niece!\" Regarding all that, it strikes me as a completely rotten idea on its face to taunt your father-in-law by proclaiming your own virtue, as Blago' did Thursday. Unless you have lived utterly beyond reproach every minute of your personal and professional life since the day you met your spouse, your in-laws know things about you you'd rather not see turned into splashy puns on the front page of the Sun-Times. And what was the necessity? Almost every commentator except me has concluded that Blagojevich was correct-- morally if not tactically - in swinging his regulatory cudgel at his second-cousin-in-law, and the story was gradually dying down. THURSDAY, JAN. 13, 2005 updated at 12:30 p.m. PLAYFUL IN PEORIA Bill Dennis, the Web's rascally Peoria Pundit, has watched U.S. Rep. and now announced GOP gubernatorial hopeful Ray LaHood for years, and has this assessment: The trouble with a LaHood candidacy is well, LaHood. You know how Bill Clinton was described as having \"a little Elvis\" in him? Ray has no Elvis. Ray is the anti-Elvis. The man has no charisma. The man walks into a room, and he sucks all the charisma out of it. Rod Blagojevich, on the other hand, exudes Elvis. It's the only reason he wins elections despite being the most openly opportunistic, poll-conscious politician in Illinois history. But it looks like Ray is positioning himself as the cure for Chicago Rod. LaHood leans \"moderate libertarian conservative\" according to this summary of his voting record (via Austin Mayor). You can examine the records and get a snapshot assessment of other top Illinois leaders here. UPDATES-- Jeff Trigg here haunts LaHood with excerpts from a 2001 news story in which LaHood supported the idea that scandal plagued Gov. George Ryan should run for re-election. Over at the Illinois Leader, Joe Morris calls LaHood a key leader in the \"new Republican Establishment in Illinois\" as he analyzes the road ahead for conservatives. Is Nicolette Sheridan on \"Desperate Housewives\" supposed to be beauteous, sexy, alluring or in any way not completely skanky and repellent? COMICS CRITIC For the last week I've been inviting comments to the message board asking readers which of the regular comic strips in the Tribune they like least. I haven't kept a tally, but \"Prickly City\" and \"Cathy\" seem to be taking the worst beating in this totally unscientific survey. Here's a little \"Cathy\" analysis: Cathy has long defined itself by being centered on a single career woman, and, more specifically, by tapping into every ugly stereotype of career women, or for that matter women generally; her grating, monomaniacal obsessions endear her to absolutely nobody I know, or, for that matter, to any of the other characters in the strip. I've lifted it from \"I Read the Comics So You Don't Have To,\" a blog by freelance writer Josh Fruhlinger of Baltimore that offers daily critical ruminations on the strips he finds in the paper. What's intriguing to me about this effort, aside from how well written and tartly observed it is, is that it fills such an obvious gap in the cultural commentary scene. Millions of people read comic strips every day, and as far as I can tell Fruhlinger is the first and only comic-strip critic (again, link courtesy of Austin Mayor). NOTE--In an earlier version of this item I wrote, incorrectly and for reasons that I would like to blame on my staff if I had one, that \"Get Fuzzy\" had been singled out for special criticism from readers. In fact, no one has yet posted a criticism of \"Get Fuzzy.\" I thank the author of Shrubville, a blog devoted to analyzing \"Prickly City,\" for calling the error to my attention. The way I read Zorn, he's saying the landfill should have been allowed to continue (allegedly) accepting illegal materials, the second cousin should continue (allegedly) in doing so brag about his connections to the governor and Blagojevich should continue kissing up to the Chicago political machine. He reads me wrong. If Blagojevich had reason to suspect there was funny business at the dump, there were ways for him to act quickly, make a few phone calls and put a stop to it without both abusing the full force of the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency to solve what was, I'm sure time will tell, far more of a political problem than an environmental problem, and causing an ugly public rift in his family. The IEPA is not an arm of Citizens For Blagojevich. It should handle and prioritize and investigate based on environmental concerns and urgencies. Period. Any other use of that agency's power and authority is an abuse. No one has even suggested that Blagojevich made the case that the IEPA should commence an unprecedentedly frenzied crackdown on the Joliet dump based on environmental concerns. Mike R., Palatine-- I don't understand why you consider anyone who doesn't approve of \"gay rights\" to be narrow-minded. Aren't each of us entitled to our own choice of where our moral values come from, and what is considered right or wrong? How are you sure that being \"broad-minded\" about such moral issues is the best way for a human to be? I should be free to believe what I want about the subject without the government forcing me to act against my beliefs. If I was renting a room or an apartment I owned or was renting the unit myself and was looking for a roommate, and I lived there also and didn't want to share my home or my 3-flat with a person who chooses such a lifestyle, why can't I choose to rent to someone else without it being that I'm discriminating? Where's my right to choose? Tony U., Leesburg, Va. - If a person makes a lifestyle choice that I do not agree with should I not be able to dislike them? So, polygamists should be protected? those who \"like\" animals should be protected? Make no mistake about it, this is a lifestyle choice. For every report showing that being gay is genetic, I can show you a study showing it is not. Why shouldn't a person have the right to associate with whomever they please? We have laws already on the books that protect people, ALL people. Why add more laws that will confuse the issue. People are already protected, we do not need special protections for \"new\" classes of people. I've printed these letters as representatives of the critical responses I've received to yesterday's item kicking the homophobes while they were down about our state's new gay rights legislation. Something evidently seethes in the psyche of those who spend so much time and negative energy worrying about what other people do in the bedroom - some visceral disgust they can't control or, who knows, self-loathing. I'll say this again: No one is asking you to give your blessing to homosexuality or to say or think positive thoughts about it or to proclaim it moral. What they--what the law - is asking is that you not refuse to rent to, sell to, lend to or hire a person based on his sexual orientation, even as you are not now allowed to discriminate in these ways against a person because of his race, color, religion, sex, national origin, ancestry, age, marital status and physical or mental handicap. Whether or not homosexuality is choice, a hard-wired immutable trait or a strong tendency that can be overcome if the person tries really, really hard isn't material to this discussion because the law already extends such civil rights based on religious orientation, and religious orientation is most definitely a choice. This particular law doesn't force you to share your spare bedroom with a gay person - it exempts owner-occupied buildings of five units or fewer, and, curiously, businesses with 15 or fewer employees. The what about my freedom of association rights? whine has a very ugly pedigree, just so you know. It's the complaint that bigots have historically used to argue for the right to racial and religious minorities from public accommodations, jobs and other aspects of public life. Go back and substitute \"Jewish\" for \"gay\" and \"religious orientation\" for \"sexual orientation\" in the above letters or in this pensee from from the dependably thick Scott Thomas at the Illinois Leader, who pulls off the wing-nut trifecta by comparing homosexuality to necrophilia, incest and bestiality all in one oozing paragraph. Tuesday's passage of an amendment to state civil right's laws that discrimination based on \"sexual orientation\" in jobs, housing, public accommodations or credit \"opens a Pandora's Box for the homosexual, bisexual and transsexual agendas in Illinois,\" fretted Peter LaBarbera, Executive Director of the Illinois Family Institute. LaBarbera added that, \"Under the guise of 'equality,' legislators have passed a bill that undermines the rights of anyone opposed to homosexual behavior to live out their beliefs.\" This pitiful battle cry -- What about my right to discriminate? -- is typical of these narrow-minded, self-styled \"pro-family\" groups that respond with the worst sort of alarmist nonsense when presented with the idea that gay people ought to have the same rights under the law as everyone else and not be discriminated against because of who they are. Fourteen other states ban discrimination based on sexual orientation and 15 cities in Illinois already do so. Yet two years ago, when similar legislation failed, Family PAC leader Paul Caprio was among those who argued against it by citing the dreaded TTT - Transvestite Teacher Threat. \"There's an issue whether or not a school (will have) the right to say to a man, no, no, you can't teach at our school, you're dressing as a woman. We don't want that,\" Caprio told me at the time. Cross-dressing pedagogues are practically unheard of, even in states, cities and counties with non-discrimination laws. But this never stops equal-rights opponents from carrying on as though drag queens are about to take charge of the state's elementary curriculum and lead all the field trips. This law is not about perversion but fairness--equal (not special) rights afforded to people regardless of who they are and whom they love. Illegal acts will remain illegal. Employers will still be able to have dress codes. Religious organizations will probably still be allowed to hire and fire according to the dictates of their faith. Non-discrimination amendments don't legalize same-sex marriage, require affirmative action hiring or compel employers to provide partner benefits. Experience elsewhere tells us we won't see gay recruitment drives in our schools, notable increases in discrimination lawsuits filed by gays or the erosion of heterosexual relationships because, oh, what good are they anyway if the homos can have them, too? This amendment will be a success. Not only will it extend justice to those who are entitled to it, but the smooth transition will provide yet another smackdown for the ever shrill and increasingly marginalized gay-bashers and fearmongers. On a Northwest Side residential street yesterday, nearly a week after the rather paltry snowfall that brought out the chairs, sawhorses and other household clutter and had Chicagoans claiming droit du shoveleur I came across this example of what is so detestable about the mayorally-sanctioned practice: It's an array of milk-crates still claiming a spot in the street that was lightly shoveled days ago on a public street where parking is obviously not at a premium. Time for another amendment to the state constitution! I've recently updated my Web logs of interest page to include two new offerings, \"Illini Pundit,\" a right-leaning look at the news, and the \"Central Illinois Gazette\" by editorial page editor Tom Kacich of the Champaign News-Gazette. Check out the resemblance between Democratic Senate and former vice-presidential candidate Joe Lieberman and Sir Wilfrid Laurier, the former Canadian Prime Minister on that country's $5 bill (U.S. value, $4.12.) Z-MAIL Keith C. -- Blago-bashing is starting to sound a lot like Clinton-bashing. Not much traction with the public. I like Blago's stunts a lot more than George Ryan's stunts, such as the trip to Cuba, which seemed mainly designed to deflect attentions from indictments and other bad news. Ryan's moratorium on the death penalty ended up being dismissed as just another stunt. The guv's bashing of the video game industry is perfectly OK with me, even though it most likely won't result in any meaningful legislation. A little public shaming can't hurt, and if shaming won't work, fear is a great motivator. First, thanks for the first link elsewhere in your letter to this site, which clearly explains the whole cousin, second-cousin, third-cousin-twice-removed thing. Whether or not Blago-bashing gets any traction with the public remains to be seen. I received several letters Tuesday defending Blagojevich--not many, but still, more than I got when I named the guv my loser of the year --and most of them make the point that he's smart to set himself apart from Chicago pols like his father-in-law and we'd have ripped him up and down if we'd discovered him hesitating to crack down on a rogue relation. Phil Kadner explored this angle in his column Tuesday: I asked (Deputy Gov. Bradley) Tusk if the governor had reached out to Mell in an effort to straighten out this mess before it made newspaper headlines. \"That would have been unethical,\" Tusk said. \"If we had reached out to any other landfill operator to tell them EPA inspections were coming, or that they were going to be closed down, you guys would have pointed out how unethical that was. That would have been a story. \"Well, we can't treat the governor's father-in-law or his cousin any differently.\" Gosh, it's so hard to be virtuous, isn't it? Especially when the Big Bad Media jumps all over you no matter what. To my mind, Blagojevich has spent all his \"sincerity\" capital by turning cartwheel after cartwheel in order to draw attention to himself and the mantle of virtue he purports to wear -- stunts that get him noticed but don't seem to accomplish much. He portrays himself as the stout enemy of political insiders and trusts that the public won't realize that he's shown no talent for working with the legislature and other key leaders to get much done. Even when he has the right idea, he picks his fights and his tactics poorly-- this crusade against violent and explicit video games being a good example. By lashing out and demanding legislation that will almost certainly be found unconstitutional, he put retailers on the defensive and threw a roadblock in the way of a non-legislative settlement that would go a long way in keeping these games out of the hands of minors. Blagojevich reminds me of the neighbor who calls the police instead of talking to you and seeking a quick, amicable resolution when he sees your dog off its leash or thinks your stereo is too loud. TUESDAY, JAN. 11, 2005 updated at 10:49 a.m. SITTING WITH THE ANGELS OR JUST PLAYING THE ANGLES? Our editorial board today rues \"The two faces of Rod,\" but regarding the family feud so much in the news says that Gov. Rod \"Blagojevich sits with the angels on this one.\" Angels would have told the governor that there was a better way of handling allegations and suspicions of misbehavior on distant branches of one's family tree. For example, the quiet, firm, \"knock it off!\" approach using phone calls and words to the wise followed up with directives to regulators to be sure to go strictly by the book in dealing with any allegations of wrongdoing. This approach not only has the virtue of not needlessly hurting or embarrassing the family, but it also exhibits the strong, serene impartiality we expect from government and it insulates the governor from charges that he's using the power of his office to run vendettas that advance his political aspirations. Instead, Blagojevich is sitting with the angle-players, the operatives who are counseling him to preen about his own virtue, to patronize his wounded father-in-law and try to pretend that this inspection frenzy has something to with a newly awakened concern for environmental issues. They are telling him: The inevitable public rift in your family will play well with voters! These same angle-players are the ones who've been counseling Blagojevich all along to communicate with other political leaders and the business community through news conferences rather than face-to-face conversations. FINE LINES It is a sad fact of human relations that unqualified adulation often produces from the adored one contempt and a kick in the chops, rather than gratitude and kindness. Apparently, the same applies to human-divine relations. Keep your thoughts positive, because your thoughts become your words. Keep your words positive, because your words become your behaviors. Keep your behaviors positive, because your behaviors become your habits. Keep your habits positive, because your habits become your values. Keep your values positive, because your values become your destiny. Mohandas Gandhi WHOEVER HAD TWO WINS THE JACKPOT On Jan. 3, the Sun-Times' news-wire regurgitation column \"Scurrilous\" affected a world-weary air and listed roughly 60 celebrities and other fluffy news phenomenon under the heading, \"If Scurry never hears from these people (and things and shows and insects) again, it will be too soon. Really, haven't we had pretty much all we can stand, and then some, of the following:\" Donald Trump appeared on the list twice! The question I had was, how many days it would take for \"Scurillous\" to traffic in that of which he has had all that he can stand? The answer: Two days. The Jan. 5 Scurrilous dropped mentions of Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Simpson, both of whom appeared on the list. MONDAY, JAN. 10, 2005 updated at 1 p.m. THE DIBS WAR GOES NATIONAL Pro-dibs Boston city councilman Jim Kelly debated my anti-dibs wife several days ago for the nationally syndicated \"Weekend America\" broadcast on public radio stations. Even though I've moderated my anti-dibs position in light of political realities, I still think she clobbered him. Listen here and judge for yourself. The pairing of WLS-AM (890) afternoon host Roe Conn with legendary wit Bruce Wolf before Christmas lasted about a week, then ended quietly. This exchange from Conn's show Friday afternoon explains it: CONN: We were experimenting with some different things at the end of the year last year. CALLER \"CLYDE\": I know, Bruce Wolf ain't going to cut it CONN: He's a very, very nice man, and nothing ever would I ever say bad about him. A really good guy. CLYDE: He just can't cut it on this show. He don't fit in right. CONN: You know what it was? Bruce needs a lot of room to do what he does best. He's very funny. Bruce is going to end up doing very, very well, and it's going to be announced pretty soon. Even within this company he's going to be doing well. But here, on this particular show, we're all microphone hogs and nobody was giving him enough time to do what he really needed to do. So that wasn't really going to work out. I got the feeling, though, that no one on Conn's show - not Conn, not his able and wry newsman Jim Johnson, not his traffic reporter Christina Filliaggi - wanted to give Wolf much room to maneuver. Johnson has nearly moved into the role of equal-partner that Garry Meier occupied before Meier left the show in an ill-starred attempt to wring more money out of management. And Conn seemed to be trying to keep Wolf inside the \"sportscaster\" box rather than simply letting him loose and seeing if he could do what Meier did (only better because Wolf is wittier than Meier). A listener who reads between the lines of the above dialogue can hear Conn allowing that it didn't work because he didn't want it to work. It's his show, now, not \"Roe and Garry,\" as it used to be. And if he'd given Wolf a real chance to shine it would have become \"Roe and Bruce.\" The word itself just sounds silly, juvenile, and vaguely distasteful. He suggests this is one reason why newspaper editors -- a serious, mature and tasteful bunch, generally speaking - tend to be put off by the whole idea. The word doesn't have the heft of an enduring or respectable phenomenon, I agree. And I've noticed my colleagues and editors on the print side saying it to me hesitantly, thickly, a bit ironically, as if they were surrounding it with air quotes. How are things with your \"blog?\" I should, of course, snap back, Fine. How are things with your \"investigation?\" But I don't because I share their discomfort with \"blog.\" I recognize that it sounds faddish and frivolous, and that every \"blog\" suffers from association with the literally millions of frequently updated Web sites that are silly, juvenile and vaguely distasteful, not to mention profane, trivial and scurrilous. My sense is that the term \"blog\" has to die off before the concept can become a full part of the mainstream media world - that it's a millstone around the neck of this movement. What do you think? I and my editors here would like to know. While I was on my two-week break at the end of last year, local civil rights activist Rob Sherman of Buffalo Grove scored another victory in his nearly 19-year public battle to separate church from state. When Chicago announced a plan to give citizens a year's supply of blue recycling bags in exchange for their discarded Christmas trees, Sherman protested: That's fine for Christians, but it leaves out everyone else from the free bag program. The new program doesn't provide a constitutional way for non-Christians to get free bags. Chicago \"3-1-1\" telephone Information Line attendants have been provided with an FAQ sheet which contains, among other things, the following text: Q: What if I don't celebrate Christmas? What if I don't purchase a live tree? A: It's certainly true that there are many people in the city who don't celebrate Christmas or don't buy a live tree for the season. But there are many folks who do, and if you don't, I am sure you have a neighbor, a friend who would be happy to let you recycle their tree. That answer is simply not acceptable. What that means is that you either have to be a Christian or you have to find a Christian to sponsor you in order for you to participate in this government program. I am not going to allow the City of Chicago to require atheists to humiliate themselves into going from house to house, begging Christians to sponsor them into a government program by allowing the atheist to take away from the Christian's home, property that the Christian no longer wants. He was right. He often is. Yes, Sherman is a publicity hound and he rubs almost everyone the wrong way when he attacks popular targets, but what critics find most irritating about him is that he usually has a very good point. The trees-for-bags idea, for example, was a clumsy but well-intentioned plan. The city recognized the problem with it when Sherman sounded his alarms and quickly agreed to give free bags to anyone bringing in \"a large bag of recyclable material\" last Saturday, Jan. 8. This worked out great for us because our tree, as usual, was in Ann Arbor where we go for Christmas. So I took two big bags of recyclable materials up to the North Park Nature Center Saturday afternoon, sat in a very long line of cars that had trees strapped to or stuffed inside them, and scored my free bags. But now I'm on the warpath: The \"year's supply\" is a roll of 52 of the smaller-sized blue bags; a household that is conscientious (or, if you believe the negative publicity about the blue-bag program, a household that is occupied by dupes and stooges) can easily fill up three or four of these bags every week with paper, cardboard, cans, jars and bottles. A confession: I have lots of doubts about our city's recycling program and about recycling programs in general, yet so far I haven't explored those doubts with any vigor because I'm so emotionally attached to the feel-good rituals of recycling. If it works and it's important, the city ought to mandate it - either fine people who mix trash with recyclables or refuse to pick up their garbage - and use the best system available, not this lame, labor intensive program that so few people participate in. If it doesn't work or it's not that important, then let's put our civic resources elsewhere. In the meantime, though, I will fill all my free blue bags---I'll call them Sherman Sacks -- by April and then commence sulking. Hello? Making the clouds dance like Teletubbies would have done the same with a lot less damage. Houston Chronicle blogger Kyrie O'Connor on the idea that God used the tsunami to get the attention of evildoers. If...what the atheists are attacking is the notion of an all-seeing, all-powerful benign deity, constantly engaged in and altering the tide of human events, they do not need a tsunami to prove their point. The knowledge that just one child somewhere was dying of cancer would bring the whole fantasy crumbing down. Many people who wrote in response to my column last week regarding God and tsunami directed me to the book of Job in the Bible. There, they said, I would find answers to questions regarding the suffering of humanity. William Safire of the New York Times devotes his column today to meditating on Job and concludes, \"Questioning God's inscrutable ways has its exemplar in the Bible and need not undermine faith.\" I've never felt that the Book of Job reflects particularly well on God, myself. A character in Bernard Malmud's novel, \"The Fixer,\" puts it well on page 232: 'To win a lousy bet with the devil [God] killed off all the servants and innocent children of Job. For that alone I hate him, not to mention ten thousand pogroms. Ach, why do you make me talk fairy tales? Job is an invention and so is God. Let's let it go at that.

FRIDAY, JAN. 7, 2005 updated at 12:55 p.m. SANITY REIGNS... ..at our sister paper, the Los Angeles Times, which had the common sense and good taste this week to yank from its daily pages the exceedingly moronic, dismally repetitive, relentlessly unfunny comic strip, \"Garfield.\" I only wish we ran the non-adventures of that charmless cat so we could yank the strip, too. What's your least favorite daily strip in the Tribune? Me, I can't decide between Hagar the Horrible and Broom-Hilda. SERENITY NOW! When it comes to Gov. Rod Blagojevich, I'm trying not to become one of those jaundiced, obsessive commentators who see every action by their target of scorn as further evidence of his rotten character. Right-wing pundits did this to Bill Clinton -- his visit to his dying mother was yet another crass, morally depraved stunt designed to distract public attention from the fact that a White House intern sexually pleasured him in the Oval Office! -- and I vowed never to fall into that trap. While it's true that politicians are a particularly calculating and insincere bunch, everyone is a mixture of good and bad and it is possible for an observer to be too cynical, both for his inner good and for his credibility. He who doesn't give credit where credit is due can't expect the public to believe him when he hands out blame. With that in mind.... Blagojevich is getting undeserved good press today on two fronts, and I itch to point this out. A Tribune editorial today says Blagojevich \"should be commended for clearing the record\" by issuing pardons to Michael Evans, Paul Terry, Dana Holland and Lafonso Rollins. Gee. DNA evidence proved all four men innocent and they were released from prison long ago -- Evans and Terry in August, 2003; Holland in June, 2003, Rollins in July, 2003. Holland went before the Illinois Prisoner Review Board in October, 2003 to ask for his pardon; Evans and Terry appeared in January, 2004. Rollins was heard in October, 2004. The moral necessity of granting these pardons was overwhelming. Yet Blagojevich dragged his feet on Evans, Terry and Holland in particular, and the Trib editorial board finally had to plead, \"Pardon these men, Governor,\" in mid December. Commendation is due a public official who acts with courage and dispatch, not one who dawdles when the time comes to doing the right thing. Virtually every expert concedes that Gindorf was in the grips of post-partum psychosis when she killed her two young children in 1985, and not even the state's attorney whose office oversaw her prosecution, Mike Waller of Lake County, objects to Governor Blagojevich showing mercy at this stage and releasing her from prison. The public might have a hard time understanding such mercy. Even though psychological experts are nearly unanimous that post-partum psychosis is a very real form of temporary insanity that in rare cases prompts women to kill their children, the person on the street--- to judge from response I heard on the radio to the news yesterday that Texas' offspring-killer Andrea Yates is getting a new trial - has little sympathy. Gov. Rod Blagojevich ordered a Joliet landfill closed Thursday, two weeks after he found out one of his wife's cousins is alleged to have told construction waste haulers he had clout and they could dump anything at the site without scrutiny from environmental regulators. A top Blagojevich aide said the governor got involved in a matter normally handled by rank-and-file state employees to send a message that nobody in his family should expect special treatment, in particular his father-in-law, Chicago Ald. Richard Mell (33rd). The gubernatorial relative, Frank Schmidt, who denies any wrongdoing, is Patti Blagojevich's second cousin. Quick question: What's a second cousin? Answer: Your children and your cousins' children are second cousins. (You and your cousins' children are first cousins once removed, with removal signifying a shift in generations.) So Frank Schmidt, evidently, is the son of one of Ald. Richard Mell's cousins. Now, we Zorns are kind of a far-flung family so it may not be fair for me to speak from experience. But I don't know my wife's cousins, let alone her second cousins. In fact, I don't know my own second cousins, if indeed I have second cousins. So this doesn't exactly strike me as an \"is blood thicker than water?\" sort of test for the guv. In fact, his action strikes me as a bit of a stunt -- the governor involving himself in a minor matter as a display of muscle and an easy show of \"integrity.\" Asked why the Joliet landfill was targeted for quick enforcement when citizens have complained the state hasn't done enough to shut down older dumps, EPA Director Renee Cipriano said the agency plans to take a closer look at other operations. But giving special favor or especially harsh attention to someone because of who he's related to is not a praiseworthy use of government power. Let me conclude in full generosity by saying that I thought it was swell that the governor bought pizza for the phone-bank volunteers raising money for tsunami relief the other day. I am fascinated by all the apparently unironic angst and anger and flailing around (in heavy metal music). It is very impressive that some people still take themselves that seriously, and it reminds me of how Romantic poetry sounds vaguely ridiculous to readers today--\"my soul's own sepulcher\"? \"A drowsy numbness pains my senses\"? \"I drift along suspended in shadows\"? Dude. Get over yourself. While losing 15 (OK, 30) pounds is high on many lists of New Year's resolutions, nothing makes you feel better about your body than a trip to a Wisconsin water park. An out-of-shape and overweight guy can come back from the concession stand carrying Dippin' Dots and nachos, and still placate himself by noting the 10-year-old boy behind him has bigger man breasts. One sentence from an apologetic by Chicago's Resurrection Lutheran Church pastor Brian Hiortdahl demands a skeptic's response: \"God is always the fall guy,\" Hiortdahl complains. Please. Aside from some probing questions and raised eyebrows after major disasters, God is almost never the \"fall guy.\" In fact, one of the most striking elements of religious thought is that it tends to give God all the credit, all the glory, all the praise when things go right - when a child is born healthy, when a person recovers from disease, when disaster is narrowly averted - and point the finger elsewhere or shrug about the great mystery of it all when things go wrong. Here's a decontexualized set of excerpts from the sermons and writings Conklin collected from clergymen who were explaining how God figures in to their thinking about the tsunami: I don't know. There is a limit to our human knowledge that does not give us the full picture..... The famous answer given in the book of Job is \"we don't know,\" and that is not just a dodge. It's an acknowledgment of our extremely limited grasp of what God is up to. .... To try to get into the mind of God is sheer foolishness ....We do not know the reason for the tsunami. ..... My most honest answer is, \"I don't know.\" If there is a satisfying answer to this ageless question, it is hidden in the heart of God. I don't know, and I don't trust anyone who thinks they do. This attitude--we don't know - strikes me as appropriately humble and eminently workable. What annoys me, though, is that when it comes to other matters, so many clerics are so thunderously cocksure about who God is, what God demands, what God thinks of this and that. And it is that certitude - not the idea of religion or faith itself - that can make and has made religion such a problematic force in our world. Those who admit they don't know the mind and heart of God, God's plan or his design are not the problem. The problems come from those think they do know and that those who don't agree with them are fools and heretics worthy of contempt, subjugation or worse. Again, I direct those interested in engaging further with this topic to explore the generous set of links I have assembled here.

NEOLOGISM ALERT Reader J. Randy Edwards sent me the url to an interesting article on the Web and wondered if it had yet \"crossed (my) disk.\" Such an apt phrase, given that very little crosses my desk these days, but quite a bit figuratively crosses my computer's hard disk. It was a typo, Edwards said when I wrote to congratulate him. But we're going with it. I've got a stack of 1,223 e-mails on my disk this afternoon to begin plowing through.... BUSTED The other night I caught Alex, now 15, in the act of watching something he knew he wasn't supposed to. \"Hey, what's this?\" \"Umm...a \"Shut that off right now! We'll watch it together tomorrow night and we'll start from the beginning!\" Somewhat abashed, he turned off the DVD player. For Christmas, based mostly on Steve Johnson's say so and word of mouth assurance that the one-season NBC wonder \"Freaks and Geeks\" would make excellent viewing for a high school freshman and his parents, I bought Alex the 6-DVD set of all 18 episodes ever recorded. As the title suggests, the show dealt with high school outcasts - a trio of socially awkward nerds, a trio of marginal burn-outs and an emotionally lost former nerd seeking adventure and purpose in the company of burn-outs. Back in 1999-2000 when it aired, Johnson, the Trib's TV critic, called it \"a knowing look at a poignant time of life... wonderfully low key....excellent....first-rate....the opposite of WB's beautiful-teens focus... sharply observed, poignant and original, and even worthy of getting the family together to watch\" and, finally, after the network pulled the plug \"fondly remembered.\" \"Freaks and Geeks\" is all that. The characters seem like clich\u00e9s at first, but quickly gather depth as the series progresses. The fact that its themes are closer to the edge of real adolescent pain than the themes explored in the far more popular \"Wonder Years\" series to which it's sometimes compared is why it's better than \"Wonder Years,\" why it's such a great show to spark discussions with the teenagers in your house and, probably, why it didn't get a big enough audience to be renewed. This is not a feel-good show. If you don't cringe frequently watching \"Freaks and Geeks,\" then you led a charmed high school life. Anyway, we've been watching episodes with Alex every other night or so and dreading the day, soon, when we'll have watched the last one together. We've also become geeks of another sort, googling the stars to find out what happened to them, buzzing that in real life Jason Segel (Nick) is dating the very fetching Linda Cardinelli (yeah, she plays a teenager, but it's OK for me to say she's fetching because she was in her mid-20s when the series was filmed); and feeling remorseful that we didn't buy the eight-DVD, super-fan version. How dare that young man sneak off and try to watch an episode on his own? Right before Christmas I shot off an e-mail to a Tribune colleague noting that a certain Notebook entry had created a \"tsunami of e-mail\" that I was trying then to deal with. It was an excellent expression - and not one I coined - to evoke a sudden, very precipitous and yet temporary increase. The Japanese origin of \"tsunami\" made it sound a bit fancy, a bit more clever, knowing and even funnier than \"tidal wave.\" And though it had become something of a clich\u00e9, the ways in which writers were using \"tsunami\" kept it vivid and useful: In October, Amy Dickinson referred to the \"permissive parenting tsunami,\" and Tribune business writer Andrew Countryman noted \"a tsunami of downward revisions.\" Also last year in the Tribune, writers referred to the Baby Boom generation as the \"silver tsunami.\" cheered the \"tsunami of talent\" displayed by a group of artisans, wrote about a \"tsunami of tourists\" in the Caribbean, the \"tsunami of high expectations\" for the Cubs and so on. Of course, tsunamis had killed people before the Dec. 26 tsunami in Asia, but so had train wrecks and avalanches and blizzards and hurricanes, all of which writers cheerfully used and still use to describe crises as nugatory as fashion faux pas or excessive paperwork. But tsunami, in part because it is so distinctive and now so inextricably associated with this massively ghastly sudden loss of some 150,000 lives, is no longer an acceptable metaphor. For a time - probably many years-- we will no more speak of a \"tsunami of e-mail\" than we will a \"holocaust of e-mail.\" Former WLS-AM (890) talk host Jay Marvin is still keeping his blog, and recently posted this: People are amazing aren't they? I got an e-mail from a guy who took me to task for not having any core beliefs. He claimed I'm conservative, then he said I'm liberal, and on and on. I wrote him back and said the real question is not what I am, it's why you feel the need to e-mail a guy when he's out of work and gone from the station you listen to. You should be happy. The last left-leaning voice is gone. Then again some people are never happy especially when they have to think for themselves. FINE LINES This issue is positively hysterical in its iconolatry. One even senses that this avalanche of overwrought power worship is inspired by the very fact of George Bush's being such an obviously unworthy receptacle for such attentions. From beginning to end, the magazine behaves like a man who knocks himself out making an extravagant six-course candlelit dinner for a blow-up doll, in an effort to convince himself he's really in love. Matt Taibbi, New York Press, on Time Magazine's Person of the Year issue In the current sitcom lineup...several shows pair extremely attractive women...with TV husbands who are not only not studly, but downright fat, and a couple who are not only not mensches, but are ugly on the inside, too..... In portraying husbands as lousy parents, marginal breadwinners, and repellant sexual partners, the fat-husband sitcoms convey a persecution fantasy that rises from (a) swamp of (female) resentments. Also in that box was a torn flannel shirt, purple and red and blue and black, with a rip down the middle of the back. It was one of the things I'd collected from his mother's house after he died; I'd never washed it, and for years afterward I could still smell him on that shirt. Then one day a couple of years ago I picked it up, looking for something underneath it, and--nothing, just the smell of dust and flannel. And that was like losing him all over again, in a small way. I understand this is personal, but I'm curious as to whether your opinions change when adversity \"hits home\"? I've fielded hundreds of letters this week about Tuesday's column in which I explored the role, if any, of God, if any, in the tsunami. Many were very thoughtful, very nuanced, very engaging. Though most took issue with my conclusions and my expressed theology (I don't know if God exists and I don't think it matters in terms of what we should do in life), they did so quite respectfully. Very few, if any, raised questions that weren't raised last time I provoked a significant though not dangerously large increase in e-mail on the subject of religion in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. I engaged these questions and debated them thoroughly back then, and all those letters are still available online here and here for those who are truly interested in what I might say in such a dialogue. And those who aren't interested, who simply want to harangue or try to convert me and aren't the least bit open to considering seriously other points of view and testing them against their own won't visit those sites, won't want to look in on the ever-growing \"webliography\" I've compiled here in which smart people from all sides discuss these matters seriously, and wouldn't be moved by anything I'd trouble to write back. So, for the most part, I've simply sent a form letter back to everyone thanking them for their thoughts--even the angry people who've called me an arrogant fool or smug correspondents such as DES, above, who either hope or assume that I'm a hypocrite. In answering her, I'll add just this: Yes, I was an indifferent agnostic when my wife was battling cancer, now 14 years ago, and when she underwent extremely serious emergency surgery 6 years ago I did not pray for her well-being, and, to extrapolate from many of the letters I've received this week, it would have been vain and childlike for me to have asked God to intervene on my behalf, to treat God like some celestial slot machine into which if I only dumped enough quarters, I'd win. Over and over this week I heard from pastors and serious lay thinkers that God has his own designs, his own plans, his own purposes--- that we cannot alter them or challenge them, that we have only to trust in them; that prayer is about accessing the strength and comfort that his ultimate love and wisdom can supply, not about asking for favors. As I've written in the past, I'm not sure which is more philosophically troubling - the idea of God who, conditionally, intervenes in life to grant the wishes expressed in prayers, or the idea of God who does not. Discuss. The way I looked at it then, if there is a God and if he was going to decide whether Johanna lived or died based on the frequency or sincerity of my entreaties to him, then I would want no part of such a depraved and manifestly unjust being. (She's doing great, by the way, though my friend Father Pachomius, a Greek Orthodox monk, had his entire monastery praying for her at one point, so... ) Killing someone to teach someone else a lesson or prove a point or try to earn loyalty is tyranny of the worst sort. I won't be hostage to it. Over and over people wrote that God grieves the victims of the tsunami, that he didn't will it, he doesn't want it to happen (and, parenthetically, that man's first sin created all this chaos in the first place) and he loves us infinitely in his perfection. This might be. Again, I'm agnostic. But as we look around, what's the evidence for it? What's the evidence that we are God's particular pets, that this one spot in the vastness of time and space is God's special project, that he cares about individual human life? Never mind what your scripture says. There's lots of scripture our there, Christian and not, and I've had lots of it mailed to me over the years. What do your eyes and ears tell you? Try this mental exercise with me: I take you to a very large house and tell you to look around. You find several dozen children living in this house, some in wonderful, opulent rooms; some in horrid, squalid rooms infested by bugs. Some are dying because no one is giving them the medicine they need, others are living healthy but ordinary, comfortable lives. What's your conclusion be about the parents? That they are good and all loving parents who, in their majesty, allow the children to thrive or not depending on luck and their wherewithal? Or that they are arbitrary and somewhat cruel parents? That they are struggling parents trying somewhat fecklessly to do their best? That are absent or dead? And then what will you think after the children tell you various, competing and sometimes contradictory things about their parents--what they think their parents want from them, for instance, or why some of them are doing so well and others are not? My answer is that I'd rather hope not to find parents responsible for such a scene; that I'd hate to think that parents who truly cared and who were truly capable of preventing it would ever allow such injustice and such pain. Others will answer that we cannot, should not, must not make human analogies when it comes to God. Earthly standards don't apply and God's will surpasses all understanding and defies all clever metaphor. Could be. One of my favorites quotations on all this comes from Dostoevsky: If God is so difficult and impossible to understand, surely I sha'n't be held responsible for not being able to comprehend the inconceivable...I shall certainly be rewarded in the next life for my humility. S.C -- Your column reminded me of the Onion headline: \"God answers prayers of dying boy: 'No.' \" I should add that at least a quarter of the mail I received on this topic was supportive and grateful. Many predicted that I'd be flooded with \"hate\" mail, and I have to say that the anger level was actually lower on this issue that it has been on the \"dibs\" issue. Ron -- The words you use to describe your opposition to parking dibs -- \"my utopian vision and exquisite logic notwithstanding\" are an understatement. What you mean is arrogance and egotism. You plainly don't want to take the shovel and clear your own spot, because it's an affront to you. You'd rather someone else clear a spot, peons, if you will, so, you can use your \"utopian vision, and exquisite logic\" to \"muscle\" the space away. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've spent two hours already today shoveling sidewalks and the street and the alley and I've pushed three cars out of their icy traps. If there's one thing I have bona fides on, it's shoveling - an activity I actually enjoy. Mail has been very heavy regarding my column on dibs today and I'm directing everyone to the Web forum I created on the topic where I believe every possible angle has been covered and debated. Jens Zorn -- You wrote about \"what Northbrook lawyer Daniel Schaeffer elegantly refers to as droit du shoveleur, pidgin French for \"the rights of the shoveler.\" I assume this derives from \"droit du seigneur\" the right of a feudal lord to have sexual relations with a vassal's bride on her wedding night? I still can't get anything by you, Dad. The analogy here is that shoveler acquires the right to, metaphorically and colloquially, do to his neighbors that which the feudal lord does to the vassal's bride. Maureen Dowd once referred to Bill Clinton's sexual escapades in the White House as \"maladroit du seigneur,\" which infuriates me because I didn't think of it. SMITTEN Do you believe in a God who uses disasters to punish people or to instruct others? The Rev. Bernard Smith, Greene Chapel AME Church, Largo Fla. sure does, according to Tuesday's St. Petersburg Times. Reporters from that paper asked Smith about the tsunami, and he replied: God did not cause this catastrophe. But he allowed it to take place. You have to look at where it happened to understand. Most of the people who were killed were nonbelievers. That entire geographic area, in fact. Some would relate the event to ethnic cleansing. God said people would perish for lack of knowledge. We serve a loving God. But all these people fell into temptation, and fell away from God. Even the movie stars and models who were trapped over there, they were not of God. So they were not spared. Actually, Sports Illustrated supermodel Petra Nimcova was spared, thus creating something of a problem for Rev. Smith's ethnic cleansing argument. Note: I have closed the click poll on this page to further voting because I've just filed a column for Thursday based on the results. I've given up on my campaign to stop \"dibs,\" the quaint, maddening and, yes, popular local tradition of staking out street parking spaces with household junk after a snowfall. Four years ago I facilitated the founding of a movement known as PASS - People Against Space Saving - on the grounds that dibs is fundamentally small and divisive, an unfriendly, tacky exhibition of the every-man-for-himself school of crisis survival. Click polls taken at the time told me I was out of step with public opinion -- imagine that! me! -- but , more importantly, news stories told me I was out of step with Mayor Daley, who gave his approval to the (technically illegal) practice. Given that dibs seems likely to endure, it behooves us to come up with a few civic rules. To help, I've conducted a multi-question poll - an online referendum - to gauge public sentiment on these questions: How many inches of snow has to fall before the act of clearing a parking spot entitles you to dibs? Are you entitled to save a parking space that you didn't shovel out and is clear only because your car was covering it as the snow fell? How many days after a heavy snowfall should you be allowed to keep dibs on a space before it returns to the public domain? Can you claim dibs on a parking spot that's in front of another person's home? What punishment is due the person who violates dibs? Is there any junk from your garage so hideous that you wouldn't scatter in the street in order to stake your claim on a parking space? The polls have now closed. You may view the results along the right rail of this page. RIGHT:Pssst! Is former U.S. Senate candidate Jack Ryan, whose fans feel he was unfairly treated by the press, getting into the newspaper business? Word is Ryan is planning to start a weekly newspaper in Homer Township in Will County. Helloooo Jack? Stay tuned. LAND OF LINKIN' You can click here to put lettering on a handsome granite tombstone, then download the image as a .jpeg file and, I dunno, use it for your holiday cards next year. Bored clerks at an Austin, Tx. video store programmed the cash register receipt so that rental customers would sign a form that, in the fine print, says \"I hereby surrender my soul for all eternity to the clerks at I Luv Video and will become part of their legion of zombies.\" The evidence is here. Order your Obama for President, 2008 paraphernalia here Susan Sommer, New Lenox -- I find myself bemused by the flurry of indignation over how they (whoever they are) are taking the Christ out of Christmas. I've been a practicing Christian all of my life and an Episcopal priest for the last 10 years, and I don't recall a single Christmas season where I've expected that my community or retail establishments to provide the sacredness of the holy day for me. I don't expect to find a creche in my town square. I do expect to find a creche in my church. I don't expect to hear sacred Christmas music played in the mall. (In fact, I prefer not to, as the arrangements are often ghastly.) I do expect to hear and to sing the hymns in my church on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and on the Sundays following Christmas. I don't expect my daughter's public school to teach her about the sacred meaning of Christmas. I do expect that she will gain a grounding in her faith in Christian Formation classes every Sunday at church and in her home 365 days out of the year and it's my responsibility as her parent to see that this happens. For us practicing Christians to expect our communities, stores, and schools to form us in our faith is absurd, and for us to be outraged by their failure to do so is at best counterproductive and at worst ludicrous. As for the efforts of some to put \"Christ back into Christmas,\" I quote my colleague Tom Ehrich in his often provocative \"On a Journey\" e-meditation on God in Daily Life (\"Diversion,\" 12/23/04): \"If we truly 'put Christ back into Christmas,' we would hold our children close, smile at our neighbors, share our bounty with those less fortunate, lose our appetite for things, rethink our warfare, and weep over a God who loves us so deeply. Faith isn't about signage or slogans or noisy campaigns to blend culture and religion. Faith dares to believe what God actually promised.\" Jim P., Arlington Heights -- Speaking as a Christian clergyman (I am a deacon of the Chicago Roman Catholic Archdiocese): greeting everyone, regardless of religious persuasion, with an aggressive \"Merry Christmas\" not only risks social rudeness, it's not even particularly good Christian living. Of course, saying \"merry Christmas\" to someone who you suspect or know would be affronted by it, would seem to engage in hateful/hurtful behavior. That's contrary to the teaching of Jesus, who teaches his followers to love. But even more than that: the greeting \"merry Christmas\" only makes sense in the context of one Christian greeting another. Presumably, only Christians or those who wish to become Christians claim that Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God, and are celebrating his incarnation. If a person doesn't believe this, then saying \"merry Christmas\" makes no more sense than saying \"happy March 7th\". It's just another date on the calendar on which babies happened to be born. This gets to the heart of the objection to greeting non-Christians with \"Merry Christmas\". Christians should be greeting brother and sister Christians, and not the entire world, with Christian greetings. Christians shouldn't uncritically confer this brother/sisterhood on everyone, for the simple fact that not everyone is. To make the blanket assumption that everyone one meets is a fellow Christian is to be appallingly ignorant (or resentful) of the diversity that characterizes our society today. Finally: it's important to the identity of Christianity to recognize that not everyone is Christian. If Christianity loses the sense that there is a crucial difference between those who are brothers and sisters in Christ and those who aren't, then the Christian mission to bring about God's kingdom loses its urgency. Speaking as a Christian: let the very necessity of my courteous \"happy holidays\" greetings be a reminder to me that there is still much labor to do in the vineyards. Bottom line: to greet someone who is not a Christian (or at least who does not desire to be a Christian) with a Christian greeting is to distort the very meaning of what it means to be Christian. Patrick M., Crystal Lake -- As one raised Catholic in this most Catholic of towns, I am disgusted by the use of \"Merry Christmas\" as a weapon. But it's just the latest example of right-wing pre-fabricated media-manufactured majority paranoia, bigotry and intolerance. Let's face it. No way is this even an issue if there was not a carefully constructed mechanism in place out there constantly sniffing the breeze for \"evidence\" of depredations against born-again Christians, Republicans, jingoistic fake patriots, and everything that Sean Hannity claims to believe in. Right-wing radio seeks out any stray data-point that might confirm a jihad against the majority here, and shrieks through a thousand outlets when it finds it -- or, in this case, manufactures it. I'll be derided as a partisan hater for saying this. But I don't care. The times are partisan. We're living the McCarthy Era all over again, and I want it to be very clear which side I was on when it all blows over. True fighters against bigotry take risks. Martin Luther King was killed and so were many others. How much courage does it take today in this country to always defend the majority and scream about its rights? Zero.

MONDAY, JAN. 3, 2005 updated at 12:14 p.m. JAY, WALKING A coda in my life as a journalist has been saying goodbye to radio personality Jay Marvin. First time was in 1983 when he was sharp but disillusioned country music jock bounced from the unendurably bland WJEZ-FM. The next time was in 1996 when he left WLS-AM (890) after three years there as the resident liberal firebrand talk-show host and took a higher-profile gig in Denver. Marvin, now 52, returned to the station in 1999 as a more reflective, measured and libertarian voice, still by far the most left-wing of the daily hosts on the increasingly right-wing talk superstation. He sayshe's happy to be gone from the station, where he was never particularly appreciated or beloved either by management or the listeners. This is not merely brave posturing on his part. Jay and I are professional friends, I guess is how you'd describe it, and we've spoken about his frustrations frequently over the years, as well as his desire to move on. My role in these discussions has always been to urge him to stay and continue to provide counterpoint to the station that, in recent years, has bounced liberals Mike Malloy, Nancy Skinner and Ski Anderson and reduced the role of the iconoclastically progressive newsman Bill Cameron. It was also to remind him not to take the partisan skirmishes and vicious callers too seriously; to remember that talk-radio is show biz and, at his best, he was a great showman. But Jay is a restless and politically serious man, and I believe him when he says he's greatly relieved to be gone from the station, which in recent years had paired him with conservative Eileen Byrne in a match that had more on-air chemistry than he seemed to think. It shocked and pleased me this morning to hear Byrne offer a classy farewell (shocked because once personalities leave WLS, the usual custom is never to mention their names on the air again): I just want to say a word about my friend and former partner Jay Marvin. If you didn't already hear the news, Jay Marvin is no longer with the station. I enjoyed working with him very much. But I knew that he was not happy and I did not know how to help him. You know we. this is our first election that we'd gone through. He took the debate very personally. I didn't know how to help him be more positive about what we were doing. But let me say this as we go forward. That I loved his different perspective. And as we go forward, I'm always going to think of him and look at things from beyond my own eyes and ears and treat everybody who disagrees with respect. I did talk to Jay, he was going on vacation, he was on his way to Phoenix, and he sounded happier than he did in a very long time. So certainly I wish him all the best. I do, too. And I suspect that, as before, we haven't heard the last of Jay Marvin. I've been scouring the Web for reflections on the theological implications of disasters such as the tsunami. Here are more than 30 provocative links with represenative quotes appended: Send a Message to God--He has gone too far this time.\" It is a sad fact of human relations that unqualified adulation often produces from the adored one contempt and a kick in the chops, rather than gratitude and kindness. Apparently, the same applies to human-divine relations.\" Spare us this disaster drivel! \"The tsunami, tragic and horrific as it is, is simply irrelevant, or at least supernumerary, to the question of whether a benign God exists.\" God is not the Puppet Master--\"Christians cannot go on speaking about prayer as if it were an alternative way of getting things done in the world, or about divine power as if God were the puppet master of the universe. .... The idea of an omnipotent God who can calm the sea and defeat our enemies turns out to be a part of that great fantasy of power that has corrupted the Christian imagination for centuries.\" Where was God? --\"It is not blasphemous to challenge the highest authority when it inflicts a moral wrong.... Frankly, God's voice \"out of the whirlwind\" (in the Book of Job) carries a message not all that satisfying to those wondering about moral mismanagement. Virginia Woolf wrote in her journal `I read the Book of Job last night - I don't think God comes well out of it.'\" Tremors of Doubt: What kind of God would allow a deadly tsunami? --\"Perhaps no doctrine is more insufferably fabulous to non-Christians than the claim that we exist in the long melancholy aftermath of a primordial catastrophe, that this is a broken and wounded world, that cosmic time is the shadow of true time, and that the universe languishes in bondage to `powers' and `principalities'--spiritual and terrestrial--alien to God.\" The New Agnosticism? --\"Our local, human purposes are probably all we need to furnish life with the meaning it demands.\" Christmas Jesus Tsunami -- \"Who sinned that this great judgment was brought upon them by God? No one. But prepare yourself that you are ready for when life slaps you in the face too. The world's bad news is Jesus is all there is; but the good news is, Jesus is all you need.\" We futilely yearn for someone to blame --\"If we can persuade ourselves that there is some divine justice in a terrifying flood, then we have the consolation of believing that man may be in some sense the author of his own misfortunes.\" An Act of God? Believers from the Hindu, Christian, Muslim and Buddhist faiths, and an atheist, explain how they have come to terms with the events in south Asia. Was God in This Disaster? --Turning to both Judaism and Buddhism for solace, the author meditates on God's role in the tsunami tragedy. God and the Tsunami --\"Meaningless deaths...symbolize the death that, in one form or another, awaits every one of us, unless we repent, which means, unless we turn around and live our lives toward God.\" Making Sense of Senseless Tragedy --\"Blaming God and experiencing the spiritual implications of this natural disaster are even more profound given its occurrence over Christmas and New Year's - a time for celebration and renewal. Where is the gift, and what are the resolutions, in the face of such horror?\" Is God to blame for this?--\"It is a pertinent and challenging question for all those who believe in an interventionist higher being, an omnipotent God. ...What sort of God would sanction such apparently meaningless devastation?\" So .. is there a God? The Mirror (UK) asks distinguished believers and non-believers how they reconciled their faith with the horrors of recent days. God alone knows why there is suffering on Earth --\"`Mystery remains. Why isn't Love-without-suffering the meaning of things. Why does God endure His suffering? Why does He not at once relieve His agony by relieving ours?' All I can say is, God alone knows - and that's enough.\" O God, How Could You? --\"Was not your faith shaken? Where you not at least led to questions what kind of a God we have?... ? Can love be that cruel? Is God really a God who is love?\" A Time to Mourn -- \"It is repugnant to imply that the people who suffer from natural disasters somehow deserve their fate. And yet for all the callousness of those tales, they did at least put human beings at the center of history....Stories of a wrathful God implied that at least there was an active God, who had some plan for the human race. \" A Biblical Theodicy -\"That which God decrees is right simply because God decrees it; God can never err. God, says the Scripture, answers to no one.\" Wave that Beggared my Belief--\"God, if there is a God, should be ashamed of himself The sheer enormity of the Asian tsunami disaster, the death, destruction and havoc it has wreaked, the scale of the misery it has caused, must surely test the faith of even the firmest believer.\" Learning to lament, and learning lessons--\"Don't look for explanations; accept the mystery. We put reality in too small a box. If there is a gift in this unexplainable horror, it will be in a renewed respect for mystery.\" Disaster Tests Our Belief - \"`The question: How can you believe in a God who permits suffering on this scale? is therefore very much around at the moment, and it would be surprising if it weren't - indeed, it would be wrong if it weren't.'\" Tsunamis are not the wrath of God --\" God's ways are not our ways; nor are his thoughts our thoughts. This is not a cop-out, but an admission that confronted by suffering we are in the realm of mystery.\" Where Was God in the Tsunami? --\"Stop thinking of God as some big man up in heaven sitting there and making individual judgments about who shall live and who shall die, where he should put a tsunami and where he should put a beautiful sunset.\" Never mind e-mail spam. It's a minor annoyance compared to the other attacks to which our computers are vulnerable, and the clamor is growing louder from a public that doesn't want to fuss with firewalls, virus protection add-ons, scouring programs and all that geek nonsense. What we want is a computer that is very highly secure the second we plug it in and forever onward, with no additional attention from us to the security issue. We don't want anything to appear on our screens or end up residing on our disk drives that we don't first give our explicit OK to. We want it to be hard enough to e-mail us that advertisers and fundraisers and other mass-mailers can't get through, but easy enough that friends and those who have reason to wish to reach us personally have comparatively little trouble. And when the computer fails, as they all do eventually, we want all our data to be available in backups that the machine has automatically created and stored in an area immune from hard-drive crashes. Is this too much to ask? It may seem so, but I'll tell you this: The company that puts such a no-fuss product on the shelves will make billions. FINE LINES Among newspaper columnists, there may be no ookier spongiform than Zev Chafets of the New York Daily News. James Wolcott After years of Jewish parents' sitting through school concerts listening to the words \"It is the night of our dear savior's birth,\" maybe oversensitivity was inevitable, since any other kind of sensitivity had been in short supply.... Luckily, for most truly religious people, observing the feast is not about shouting \"Merry Christmas\" at passersby to show that you believe even if they do not, an exercise in smug superiority disguised as faith. It is an interior process of considering the lessons the child in the manger would teach once grown..... If saying \"Happy Holidays\" rather than \"Merry Christmas\" offers someone who is not of your faith more comfort and joy--well, 'tis the season for both. Anna Quindlen (The Modern Language Association) has come to resemble a hyperactive child who, having interrupted the grownups' conversation by dancing on the coffee table, can't be made to stop. Why all the celebratory stories every January about which baby was born first in the calendar year? The coolest baby--the one entitled to the most huzzahs upfront -- is the last one born before the clock strikes 12 the night of Dec. 31. That baby gives his parents a tax deduction for all of last year even though he was in the womb for all but the last few minutes of it. The child born several moments later, \"at the stroke of midnight\" as excited news accounts so often have it, is much more of a financial burden, all other things being equal. I'm suspicious of these stories anyway--I suspect numerous conspiracies of deceit and delay infect the accounts emanating from hospital delivery rooms; that times are rounded up or down as necessary to produce this annual phenomenon of chronologicallyprecisetots. Gianie Jalyn Redmond Izquierdo... became Chicago's first baby of 2005 when she was born at 12 a.m. in St. Mary of Nazareth Hospital Center's Family Birthplace (to) 15-year-old Yumerys Izquierdo. First, 15-year old girls shouldn't become mothers, period. Particularly when they're not married, as in this case, and most especially when the father is no longer in the picture, also as in this case: (The mother's) boyfriend and daughter's father, a 19-year-old Chicago man, hadn't learned of Gianie's birth late Saturday because Yumerys' dad had a restraining order placed against him in August. (Sun-Times) Nineteen year old men (or 18-year-old men, depending on when Romeo's birthday was) should not be having sex with 15 -year-old girls (or 14-year-old girls, depending on when Mom's birthday was). The accused commits (misdemeanor) criminal sexual abuse if he or she....commits an act of sexual penetration or sexual conduct with a victim who was at least 13 years of age but under 17 years of age and the accused was less than 5 years older than the victim. If the accused is 5 or more years older than the victim, it's a felony. And either way, the informal term for this kind of encounter is statutory rape. Teen sex-crime victims bearing babies out of wedlock is nothing to celebrate. In a year-in-review column last Thursday I named Gov. Rod Blagojevich my Big Loser of the 2004 (click here to read why). Given that polls show Blagojevich has pretty good approval ratings and no matter what a columnist criticizes he can expect at least a few angry letters from those who disagree passionately (...once again you idiots in the media fail to see the value in torturing orphaned puppies just to hear them squeal...), so I expected Blagojevphiles to mount a defense. In the space below is every rebuttal I've received so far by phone and e-mail: Hmm. Oh well. Next item: THE GOODS Tribune state politics editor Bob Secter has the goods on Blagojevich's \"stunt-of-the-month club\" style of leadership. Blogger and local public-affairs TV talk show host Jeff Berkowitz has the goods on newly elected congressman Daniel Lipinski's admitted failure to vote in the last few years. NO KIDDING \"Every year, the national and international media dutifully report on the announcement of the winner. I'm not kidding.\" ... Richard Roeper, in the recent column in which he named the winner of his \"Greatly Overexposed and Overhyped Fool\" award. My column on the emergence of \"Merry Christmas\" as a battle cry by aggrieved Christians drew a number of very thoughtful responses over the last few weeks while I've been on a blog break. I hope to print some of them here soon. But I also received an unusually large number of nasty, stupid letters (most of which only served to underscore my point, actually), to which I responded with the \"fan club\" form letter that, as I've previously acknowledged, I stole virtually wholesale from the rock star Moby: Thank you for your interest in Eric Zorn! As a new Eric Zorn fan you have automatically been enrolled in the Eric Zorn Fan Club. You will be kept up to date via e-mail on all of Eric Zorn's activities--column topics, speeches and other public appearances -- as well as special offers that our sponsors feel will be of interest to readers of Eric Zorn. Welcome to the Eric Zorn Fan Club! Though I'm tempted to heap patronizing scorn upon my e-mail detractors as that classy Neil Steinberg does , I find that this approach vexes them far more and has the virute of stopping the exchange cold. I'll be a guest panelist on the nationally-syndicated \"Beyond the Beltway\" radio program tonight from 6-8 p.m. central time. The Chicago affiliate is WLS AM (890); click here for other affiliated stations. The other guests are Marty Geraghty and Tom Shaer, and the topics include Donald Rumsfeld's future, Rudy Guiliani's future, the plague of steroids in baseball and the worries some have that Christ is being taken out of Christmas. Dame Posterity weeps in relief that this moment in broadcast history is preserved forever here. Immediately following \"BTB\" on WLS, you can hear \"Public Affairs\" blogger Jeff Berkowitz on \"Political Shootout,\" cranky host Tom Roeser's idea of a debate program in which he usually invites conservatives of various stripes to hash out their differences. FRIDAY, DEC. 17, 2004 updated at 1 p.m. ARE EARRINGS BLING? By a 3 to 1 margin, click-poll voters said \"no\" to the question, \"Aside from watches and wedding rings--Can you trust a man who wears jewelry?\" Judging from my e-mail, the negative response would have been even higher if I'd made an exception for earrings which on men, most often, are fairly subtle -- --- tiny hoops or modest studs. Such accessories, it seems to me, fall well outside the pinkie-ring, ostentatious-necklace, jewel-encrusted badge idea that John Kass was getting at earlier this week in his column on Bernie Kerik. In retrospect, a better way to word the question would have been, \"Can you trust a man who wears gaudy jewelry?\" And I would include in that any wristwatch that costs more than $150. If your watch costs more than that, buddy, you're just showing off. Final click poll results this week: Aside from watches and wedding rings--Can you trust a man who wears jewelry? Yes, 25% No, 75% (584 total responses) Should it be illegal for stores to sell violent or sexually explicit video games to people under 18? Yes, 64% No, 36% (4095 total responses) How many times a month do you call your own cell phone number in order to find it? I never do this, 66% Once or twice, 26% 3 to 10 times, 7% More than 10 times, 2 % (555 total responses) FREE TO A GOOD HOME, SPECIAL HIDDEN BONUS OFFER Two readers have now sent me \"Don't Think of an Elephant! -- Know your values and frame the debate.

DEAR APPLICANT: Mary Schmich today contemplates \"how age whittles away at our habits and routines, at our tolerances and desires,\" and writes: Will you ever again stay up all night? Not if you can help it. And staying awake all night is not the same as being awake all night. The first is called fun. The second is called insomnia. The first is a perk of youth, the second a curse of later age. I'm afraid this essay closes out any chance that RedEye will add Schmich to its stable of columnists. AN IDEA, FREE TO A GOOD HOME Ana Beatriz Cholo's front-page Tribune story Saturday about the trials, tribulations and anxieties of Chicago middle-school students and their parents as they try to get in to the city's elite, selective-enrollment high schools sounded very familiar themes. The harsh realities of the competitive process begins for some as early as 6th grade. Preteens--already contending with acne, cliques and the vagaries of the opposite sex--suddenly find themselves facing pressures usually associated with college admissions. We went through the process last year and found ourselves part of a network of frantic, fretting and sometimes confused parents who trade rumors and strategies and discuss fallback options. I wished at the time that someone would write a book describing all the options in detail and outlining the application, testing and other evaluation processes. Such a demystifying, reassuring book, updated annually, would sell very well in the city. Sidenote about Cholo's story: The boy whose huge, full-face picture dominated the top half of the front page that day - Ethan Kaplan - lives just down the street from us and is one of my son's very closest friends. He also lives about half a block away from Chicago Board of Education spokesman Peter Cunningham. Yet neither I nor Cunningham had anything to do with Cholo finding and interviewing the Kaplans. QUESTIONS THREE, A FOLLOW UP Earlier in the week I posed three questions : Why do you use AOL? (to AOL users) Would jurors have recommended the death penalty for Scott Peterson if he'd been a better actor? Is Chicago now the most pathetic big-league sports town in America? Regarding AOL: Answers tended to focus on these areas: The message/chat areas of AOL, which are robust, easy-to-use and better policed than free-for-all message areas on the Web. The parental controls, virus and Spam blocking features and other security and child-friendly measures. The fast, intuitive e-mail program that's not Outlook-based. I'm not a chatter or a habitu\u00e9 of message boards so I can't vouch for that feature, though it seems to me that free, Web-based communities are bound to offer interaction of similar quality soon if they don't already. I haven't found AOL's security features particularly useful as my 14-year-old goes right around AOL, uses a Hotmail e-mail account and accesses the Internet directly through Firefox or Internet Explorer. But I am a fan of the e-mail program. Though I wish they'd ask me for idea on how to tweak it when they next upgrade, I like the ease with which I can work off-line and I like the convenience of having had the same e-mail address for the last dozen years. Does anyone else remember the early days of e-mail when Compuserve, Prodigy, AOL and the other services would only let you send e-mail to other people on their service? And when such services were the only coherent spots on the wild, wooly World Wide Web, which someone once memorably described as \"the world's largest library, only the books are all over the floor\"? Search engines, blogs and other developments changed all that, and it's still not clear to me that these gatekeeper companies can survive as for-pay content providers. Regarding Scott Peterson: Very few readers responded to this query, to my surprise. Maybe because the answer is both obvious and somewhat disconcerting. Yes, if Scott Peterson had gotten on the witness stand during his sentence hearing and blubbered like a baby during a remorseful confession to having murdered his wife and unborn son, jurors, judging by their comments, probably would have spared his life. I didn't follow the Peterson case closely enough to have an opinion on the guilty verdict, though from the little I've read it seems plausible enough. But consider this: The person who is least likely to blubber remorsefully and beg for mercy at sentencing is the person who is factually innocent. Regarding Chicago teams: The consensus is yes, in recent years no town has put more hapless pro teams on the field, court and rink than Chicago. Jim McCarthy of Elmhurst came forward with this statistical analysis that proves it: Of the ten cities with franchises in all four major sports, four have not experienced a championship since 1998 (Chicago, Philly, Atlanta, Minneapolis). I don't think you can consider any city that has a championship, no matter how bad the other teams are (goodbye, Phoenix). Next step is to compare how many times each city has had a team make the playoffs (max would be 20 5x4); Minneapolis gets eliminated here and so does Philly, as the Timberwolves and Flyers have made it every year. Throw in the Twins and Vikings success for Minneapolis, and the Eagles for Philly, and they go over ten appearances. That leaves Atlanta and Chicago. Neither team has had their NBA team make a playoff appearance in five years. The Blackhawks edge the Thrashers in NHL playoff appearances 1-0, and the Falcons edge the Bears 2-1 in NFL. The tiebreaker is baseball. Despite Chicago having two teams to Atlanta's one, the Braves have made five playoff appearances to the Cubs/Sox two. So Atlanta has 7 of 20 playoff appearances (35%), Chicago 4 out of 25 (16%, with an extra baseball team). Strictly on performance, it's a no-brainer, Chicago is the worst. I'm sure folks in Atlanta who are tired of the Braves 13 straight division titles with only one championship would disagree, along with those in Philly who have watched the Eagles lose three straight NFC title games, but Chicago is indeed the worst. Case closed. CYNICISM COMPETITION Rich Miller's column this week is deeply cynical about why Gov. Rod Blagojevich chose a Naperville school to roll out his program to combat violent and sexually explicit video games: If he had taken his road show to a financially distressed downstate or suburban school, parents might have asked what he planned to do about their school district's forced over reliance on property taxes because of the state's inadequate level of education funding. Or maybe someone would have asked about all the political cronies and hacks he's installed at the newly revamped State Board of Education. Or they could have asked him what he's doing about the Meth epidemic that's decimating downstate communities, or the state's rapidly disappearing industrial base. Naperville, with its low crime rate, low unemployment and well-funded, highly rated schools, was most certainly a safe choice. I can't top that, but I can wonder aloud why Patti Blagojevich was a solo guest last night for the newsmaker interview portion of WTTW-Ch. 11's \"Chicago Tonight\" that deal with the video-game proposal. Normally segment host Phil Ponce has a disputatious panel to wrangle over the fine points of controversial proposals and a spokesman represents the top elected official who declines to enter the grubby scrum with the pundits and industry reps who disagree with him. Was sending or offering up Patti Blagojevich -- who usually stays in the background, especially on controversial issues -- a way of assuring a gentle, one-on-one interview on the subject instead of the rollicking debate this proposal deserves? She was well spoken, to be sure, but given that one of the key legal and legislative questions about the proposal is going to be its constitutionality, a member of the governor's legal team would have been the more logical choice. Unless, of course, the Blagojevich administration is playing the political angles, something Patti Blagojevich directly denied in her interview. (Special note from \"Elbow Roomer\" over on the message board: \"If there is anyone out there who knows the guv personally, can you suggest to him to get a makeover on his 'do? He looks like a refugee from a 1970's Smurf cartoon.\") SOME BOOKS WILL HAVE ALREADY BEEN CLAIMED EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE NOT YET LABELED AS CLAIMED. BOILERPLATE RULES: Most of the books I'm giving away to Notebook readers have been sent by generous publishers hoping for a mention which, I suppose, they will get when I mention that I'm giving the book away. First person to e-mail me about any given book gets it. Put the title of the book in the subject line and include your mailing address (U.S. only). One book per household.

And more...including lots and lots of letters just below Z-MAIL Dan Curry, former spokesman for and political adviser to ex-Ill. Atty. Gen Jim Ryan -- Jim Ryan led the charge to convince six or seven national retail chains, including Wal-Mart, Circuit City and Sears, to stop selling M-rated video games to minors. His administration ran a sting to prove stores were ignoring the rating code and then convinced US Senators from Richard Durbin to Joseph Lieberman to John Ashcroft, to support his call for a voluntary ban. The pressure led to the chains' decisions to put in place register prompts to card minors when M-rated games were being purchased. So, presumably, the stores are already preventing kids from buying M-rated games. When almost every newspaper in Illinois endorsed Jim Ryan for governor over Blagojevich in 2002, many of them cited Ryan's effectiveness on violent videos. He rejected the legislative approach because he thought the public pressure approach would be more effective. He probably would have gotten more national press with legislation, but wouldn't have gotten the results he did. Jennifer Granholm, then AG of Michigan, followed Ryan's exact blueprint, including the stings, and did a few press conferences. She never revealed that she borrowed our idea down to the last detail. This certainly seems like the sensible approach. The governor's approach seems destined to lead to endless hairsplitting by lawmakers, police, prosecutors and judges about which sorts of cartoon figures and what sorts of animated mayhem, nudity and sexual behavior falls outside the law. Your honor! Despite his name, Pac Man is clearly not a man, and the fact that he wears no clothing does not suggest lasciviousness. And as for the prosecution's claim that his consumption of his foes constitutes unwholesome cannibalism, I can only refer you to People v. Mario Brothers , in which.... Joe R.-- This week's stunt brings me back to when I first heard the name Rod Blagojevich. He was a newly elected congressman from Chicago, and his first stunt in office was to hold a major issue press conference. His issue was the government shipping napalm through Chicago on railroad cars without informing the public. He made his indignant face, with the usual backstop of confused constituents, and exclaimed \" we need to be notified as to exactly when this dangerous material is to be shipped through Chicago.\" Even in pre-911 times, I thought that this was an incredibly stupid idea to inform people how and when to blow up or hijack a shipment of napalm. Not to mention the fact that, as the Global Security Web site explains, \"Napalm is less flammable than gasoline and therefore less hazardous.\" \"Napalm is gasoline and benzene.\" Lee Saunders of the Navy's Weapons Support Facility told reporters who asked him about Blagojevich's blatant fear-mongering. \"You drive around with gas and benzene in your car everyday. These kinds of materials are shipped routinely all over the country.\" I haven't. And I've considered him a pandering lightweight ever since he cast that vote. He also voted with the Republicans in Congress to support the judge in Alabama who wanted to post the Ten Commandments in his courtroom. Ginnie F. When I was 12 I loved the Prince Purple Rain soundtrack. So I bought it, I had the money. My mother, on the other hand, did not want me to listen to Prince because she thought he was inappropriate for my age. So she threw out my Prince cassette (this was 1984, so I had cassettes). So I bought it again, it was only $10 and made sure I didn't listen to it when Mom was around. I still love listening to Prince! Do you get my point? I think I get it - whatever the law doesn't make illegal for them, kids will get their hands on. But should we have fined retailers who sold Prince recordings to kids back in 1984, or in hindsight does that look like a silly idea? Doug Nelson, Chicago -- Since you took the opportunity in your column today to be critical of Republican candidates who don't properly concede after losing an election, I must mention that Jesse Jackson, Jr. would not take my call in November, 2002 when I attempted to congratulate him for winning when I ran against him that year. Oh, I'm sure this happens a lot--I heard stories about smaller races in which losing incumbents obstructed the transition process - and, every time, it's a disgrace. I'd wag my finger again, but my wife disapproves. Frank F., Chicago - How does one go about running for the position of Mayor of Chicago? I looked into that today. I contacted the city and they told me to contact the Board of Elections office. I reached the latter and asked how does one run for Mayor of Chicago, what are the requirements. I was told, \"We don't know yet.\" \"Well, there must be some general information you can provide me with.\" \"We haven't made those decisions yet,\" they told me. \"Please,\" I said, \"can you provide me with an idea of what the requirements were for the last election for Mayor?\" \"No, it wouldn't make any difference.\" Finally I got from them that the next election of the Mayor will be in February of 2007 and that in September of 2006 a candidate can start circulating petitions for their candidacy.. As a taxpaying citizen of Chicago for the past 25 years, I demand that the requirements for Mayor be clear and accessible and available to all via the internet or at least on paper so that anyone can go downtown and pick this information up or have it sent to them. When I ask the Board of Elections about the requirements for running for Mayor of the City of Chicago, I believe they should be readily available to me and I should not have to ask questions to be provided with information that should have been provided to me when I asked, \"What are the requirements for running for the mayor of Chicago?\" They were nicer to me when I called. When you have a column, bureaucrats tend to be a little more forthcoming, and in this case a woman told me that, while things could still change, the requirements last time were that a candidate had to gather 25,000 signatures, be a registered voter who has lived in Chicago for a year, not be in arrears on any city taxes and not a felon. Helen G. -- I notice your recent link to the Lego Bible scenes on thebricktestament.com and wanted to express some concern about it. Those who don't scrutinize the site carefully might be inclined to purchase the related books for little kids--especially given the glowing reviews on the site from so many mainstream and religious publications. But take a look at the stories of Sodom and Gomorrah, or Cain and Abel--the first scene in the latter is helpfully entitled \"The man had sex with his wife Eve,\" illustrated with a Lego depiction of that very act. I personally would not want my 5-year-old daughter looking at that and asking me about it, and I'm neither religious nor terribly conservative. Indeed, some of them are \"edgy dioramas\" as the San Jose Mercury put it, though it's difficult for Lego people to do anything truly objectionable given their very limited anatomies and ranges of motion. The images created for the site and related books are used in Sunday schools, according to news reports. But whether the intent is reverent or irreverent isn't exactly clear, but as the Philadelphia Inquirer reported in December, 2003: Insight into (the author and creator's) intent is found in his introduction, where the artist describes his epiphany at the local Taco Bell, when his burrito burst into flames and God's unmistakable voice told him \"from this day forth you will illustrate for Me, My most holy of books, the Bible, completely in Lego.\" In exploring this topic I found that if one looks diligently enough on the Web, one can actually find something billed as \"Lego porn.\" You pervs out there can do you own searches. Just don't tell Gov. Blagojevich about this, I beg of you. He'll propose prosecuting shopkeepers who sell Lego to minors. Dan G. -- Allowing cell phones on planes is going to turn the cabin into a giant phone booth. I can see heated arguments and even fist fights arising because of this. The main reason is there's nothing you can do to escape from your seat mates conversation, unless you have a set of ear plugs. Maybe that's the solution, free earplugs. Amtrak had so many complaints from customers in Northeast, who were fed up with nonstop cell phone conversations, that they created a \"quiet car\" just for those who want to travel in silence. The airlines can't do that, unless they offer cell phone free flight schedules. I have no doubt that eventually this change is going to happen, if it's technologically feasible, because we're so tethered to our phones nowadays. But the experience of flying, which used to be kind of exciting (remember the term \"jet set\"), is about to become torture. Joshua T. No other city has anywhere near the number of combined years without a championship as Chicago (the Cubs are the longest streak in sports, the Sox number 2 and the Hawks the longest in hockey). Even cities like Minnesota, which certainly are tortured, have had playoff teams multiple years running. Other cities like Seattle have recent success. Baltimore is a bit tortured, I guess, but nothing like Chicago. But, you know, thanks, Guv. I think my wife and I can handle this. We don't need the protection of a new law, with all the inevitable enforcement costs not to mention the costs of defending the Constitutionality of an effort that in other places has failed to pass constitutional muster. Should games carry accurate labels advising the purchaser of the sex and violence content in them? Yes. My understanding is that they are, but I'm not a gamer. Should retailers be strongly encouraged by government, civic and parent groups not to sell the most graphic games to children? Yes. And at the same time, these groups should strongly encourage parents not to buy such games for their children, perhaps even with a publicly funded education campaign. Fifty years ago it was comic books that excited the controlling passions of our public moralists determined to protect youth. Forty years ago it was movies. Twenty years ago it was song lyrics. Legislations, cops and courts weren't the answer then, and they aren't the answer now. We don't need the bureaucracy engaging in endless hair-splitting over what is and isn't a \"depiction of death\" or what does or doesn't \"predominantly appeal to the prurient interest of the player\" in what is, after all, a cartoon. Blagojevich drags the 10 Commandments issue into his argument and uses it preemptively to attack the ACLU - an organization that generally enjoys support among his fellow Democrats. Then he brings in a hypothetical 6-year-old and suggests that the ACLU has an opinion one way or another about whether it's \"OK\" for a child to play that game or whether the child has a \"right\" to play that game. But that's a decision that would remain up to the child's parents even if Blagojevich's proposals were to go through. Am I missing something? Are 6-year-olds buying these games and playing them against their parents' wishes or without their parents' knowledge? Or is the governor just freelance fantasizing, tossing pebbles at easy targets again instead of doing the hard work and making the tough decisions to bring state back to fiscal health? There oughta be a law against that, too. Take the click poll on this page: Should it be illegal to sell violent or sexually explicit video games to people under 18? Yes is beating no by a 2 to 1 margin in early returns. Currently, people who give vehicles and other items to charity can deduct the fair market value when they calculate their taxes. But after complaints that the system was being abused by charities that auctioned the cars for far less than what was claimed by car donors, Congress cracked down. Starting next year, the Internal Revenue Service will allow donors to deduct only the amount the charity receives for the sale of the vehicle if the price is more than $500. In other words, as I read this, if you donate before Jan. 1, you can use a figure for \"fair-market value\" that is higher than the actual market value of your car --- lie on your tax form. . I suppose this is an old tradition - grossly inflating the re-sale value of the crud you donate to charitable institutions - but it's odd to hear it celebrated and encouraged on commercials. The Bernard Kerik scandal is getting worse and worse. Since Kerik withdrew from his Homeland Security Director nomination it has been revealed that he has had a secret marriage, two mistresses and worked for a mafia-related company. As a result Kerik has been given a role on \"Desperate Housewives\" Conan O'Brien Does anyone else find it faintly that \"The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie,\" which stars that blocky yellow icon of kids' television, has been kicking the skirted behind of the sword-and-sandals epic \"Alexander\"? Four of my seven performances of the past four days were at the Old Town School of Folk Music with the cast of an annual sing-along organized by Chicago Tribune columnists Mary Schmich and Eric Zorn, a show called \"Songs of Good Cheer.\" I had rehearsed several times with this group and had been very impressed with the quality of their musicianship and their good humor. The performances were, each in its own way, magic. We did an abbreviated family show, two full shows for adults, and one short one (Monday) morning for senior citizens. The proceeds went to the Tribune's seasonal charity. Each audience was different, each performance unique, even though we repeated many of the same routines in all of them. Maybe the effect of the show on my outlook and mood could be explained by Mary Schmich's observation to the audience that \"you can't be stressed out if you're singing.\" Maybe it was a bit more than that. The concert hall at the Old Town School seats four hundred people, and all of the shows but the one for seniors were sold out. It is a beautifully arranged space for performing music. There's not a bad seat in the place, and the audience is near enough that I could make out faces in the last row in the balcony. When you get four hundred folks singing back at you, smiling at you, clapping with you, it becomes startlingly clear how great the gift of music is. As our group displayed their many talents, and as people rose from the audience to tell funny, touching stories (Zorn and Schmich had held a contest, as they usually do), I relaxed and let the music and the warmth of our mutual efforts move the old holiday uneasiness out of my mind. We did songs from several cultures, singing in Spanish, Hawaiian, and Ladino. We musicians offered our own idioms, bluegrass, jazz, and pop. There were several moments where we instrumentalists dropped out and all of us sang together without accompaniment, moments that ended in a joyous hush, full silent seconds before the applause broke out. When it ended I felt more grateful than ever that I had been given the gift of music, that I had had a chance to be a part of this, that I could help share that gift. It was such a privilege to be there. May your season be as bright as the faces in that room. This feature has proven very popular - among the eager players was a woman from Virginia who hoped to get first in line if, by some chance, I was giving out a Dr. Phil book. Alas. So far, no hard feelings: The modest blip of publicity has mitigated whatever small sting any author might feel that I don't feel his or her title is a must-keep for my permanent collection. There's something talk-radio about giving things away to the audience, but, then again, there's something talk-radio about blogs. Anyway.

WEDNESDAY, DEC. 15, 2004 updated at 5:09 p.m. COFFEE, TEA OR YAK? Oh, great. Breaking news today is that it apparently won't be long before airplanes will no longer be safe from what one of Mark Brown's readers dubbed \"second-hand yak\" --- that cacophony created by people talking too loud into their cell phones. Many have attributed this to plain rudeness, but one of my readers, Ron Tevonian of Chicago, retired director of research and development at Bell Labs, wrote a while back to explain that it's not that at all: When you speak to someone who is standing a few feet away from you, you use a moderate voice. But speak to the same person with your mouth right up against an ear and you instinctively whisper. Now compare most miniaturized cell phones with an old fashioned desk phone. Without a mouthpiece directly in front of your lips, you instinctively feel the need to speak louder. Next, consider your experiences with conventional desk phones (the kind which offer a mouthpiece close to your mouth). Blow into the mouth piece. Do you hear the sound in your ear? That is called \"side tone.\" Phones used to have that feature designed into them - to reassure the user that the phone was working, and to provide some feedback to the speaker to help throttle excessive volume. Cell phones don't have \"side tone\" - so there is no clue to the user about whether they are speaking loudly, or not. Tevonian has more thoughts on this problem as well as a three-part solution. Aspiring columnists should take note of John Kass' column this morning on Bernard Kerik. He takes a small but he believes telling detail about a current event--in this case an aside in some stories that Kerik wore a \"jewel-encrusted badge,\" - and applies to it a strongly-held but seldom voiced personal opinion --- in this case, \"Everybody knows you can't trust a guy who wears jewelry.\" A notion like that perfectly fits the space of a column and is destined to spark conversations and arguments on the radio and in workplaces around the region. They don't give prizes for this sort of manifestation of the column-writing art -- not consequential enough for the judges - but they should. All John's effort lacked was an accompanying click poll, which I have thoughtfully created on this page along with a poll based on my own nearly daily experience which asks: How many times a month do you call your own cell phone number in order to find the darn thing?

WHERE ALL THE TEAMS ARE BELOW AVERAGE In response to my question yesterday, sports fans have written to nominate Atlanta and Minneapolis as more woebegone major-sports towns than Chicago. Some have questioned my requirement that a city have an NFL, NBA, NHL and MLB franchise even to qualify and have challenged my \"...in the last five years\" limit as well. I'm not enough of a stats cruncher to look much past the current/most-recent standings, in which I see that Chicago has worse teams than Atlanta and Minneapolis in very major sport except basketball, where the feeble Atlanta Hawks are slightly more feeble than the Bulls.

ANSWER ME THESE QUESTIONS THREE News that America Online is preparing to \"abandon its strategy of exclusivity and free much of its music, sports and other programming to non-subscribers in hopes of boosting ad sales\" prompts me to ask my fellow AOL subscribers this blunt question: Why do you use AOL? I'm not suggesting anything particular by this question. Though the Associated Press story quotes an industry analyst that \"AOL is left looking like the race car in a race that nobody wants to run in anymore.\" Next question: Would jurors have recommended the death penalty for Scott Peterson if he'd been a better actor? I read \"yes\" into the lead paragraph of this story: REDWOOD CITY, Calif. -- Repelled by Scott Peterson's seeming lack of sorrow and remorse, a jury decided Monday that he deserves to die for murdering his pregnant wife, Laci, almost two years ago. But maybe I'm too touchy. Last question: Is Chicago now the most pathetic big-league sports town in America? I suppose there are a number of ways you can slice this question to come up with an answer you like, but lets just take the last five years and look at metropolitan areas with major football, baseball, basketball and hockey franchises. The Bulls, Bears and Hawks have been crummy, the Sox have been mediocre and the Cubs have under performed. Consider final standings, league, division or world championships, average winning percentages playoff games won or some appropriate combination of factors. Which city, if any, has it worse than we do? CHEERS Thanks to everyone who turned out this past weekend to Songs of Good Cheer, the caroling programs that Mary Schmich and I front for at the Old Town School of Folk Music. To the sold-out crowds at all three shows who filled the auditorium with sound, to the professional musicians who joined us on stage. To Gail Tyler, Dan Glomski and other staff and volunteers from the school who handled all the details. To Alison Halstead from Tribune Holiday Giving who oversaw production of the songbooks and other elements of Tribune sponsorship. Also to Tribune literary and Sunday Magazine editor Liz Taylor, WGN AM (720) host John Williams and RedEye columnists Maegan Carberry, Alison Neumer and Jimmy Greenfield for helping out and playing along. To Caroline Kaplan, Saturday's brave young \"Gloria.\" And to story contest winners Marguerite Williams, Daniel Knight, Linda Struck, Virginia Harding and Miriam Wolf. The problem we're starting to have with this event is that it now sells out too quickly for us to flog it - and Tribune Holiday Giving - in our columns in the weeks leading up to it. And flogging and milking is what we're all about during this most busy season. Every time we talk about moving to a bigger venue we think how hard it would be to recreate the gorgeous intimacy of the Old Town School auditorium. Anyway, portions of the event will be broadcast on WGN AM at 7 p.m. on Christmas Eve and again at 8 a.m. on Christmas morning. We also brought in a recording engineer this year to see if there are enough tracks available without my singing on them to make a good CD. If so, you can count on me to flog and milk that mercilessly. \"THIS IS THE BEST NIGHT OF MY LIFE!\" We had a blackout for about an hour Monday evening on the Northwest Side. So we ate dinner by the light of two candles and the menorah, after which the kids huddled around the table and began trying to do their homework. Ben, who is 7, was giddy with the excitement and novelty of it all: \"This is the best night of my life!\" he declared. At the time I was on the phone with our friend and neighbor Liz, checking on their power situation, and I relayed Ben's remark. Her 6-year-old, Mike, had just said the exact same thing. Both boys were heartily disappointed when the lights came back on a short time later. Before he went to bed, Ben suggested that we have another blackout tomorrow night. FINE LINES The people who support (abstinence-only sex education) are right--abstinence is the only fail-safe way to prevent pregnancy and disease. But they are also living on another planet. Here on Earth, about 60 percent of high school seniors have had sex... Yet some partisan critics, apparently unable to defend (Defense Secretary Donald) Rumsfeld, attacked (Chattanooga Times Free Press reporter Edward Lee) Pitts. \"He created news in order to cover it,\" said conservative political commentator Rush Limbaugh. \"...

I can, but it's a huge pain for me right now given the way I do the html coding. But I have a better idea: Switch to the Firefox browser that I've been so zealously promoting. It offers a way to read link-intensive pages that, once you try it, you'll never go back. In Firefox, when you're on my site, reading with that feverish intensity that this blog inspires, and you come across a link to something you'd like to check out, you can open it for later reading without having to tear your eyes away. You simply click on the link using the wheel on your wheel mouse (if don't have one, buy one. They're not expensive and very handy) and the page opens in a separate \"tab\" behind the page you're reading. You can open many pages at once in new windows this way, and they will be ready to read with one click on the appropriate tab at the top of the screen the instant you are done with this page. This is especially handy for headline-intensive sites like the Tribune front page, when going back and forth can be kind of a pain. My easy-to-follow instructions on how to download and install Firefox are here.

ADVANTAGE: ACLU Now this is more like it. A group of those insufferable people who simply can't abide the fact that our Constitution encourages people to think for themselves in matters of personal morality and religion went to the Washington D.C. headquarters of the American Civil Liberties Union Thursday to try to score points. Their report, posted along with photographs, reads as follows (boldface added for emphasis): A bunch of us went down to the ACLU Headquarters in Washington this afternoon to, umm, serenade them with Christmas carols. None of that \"Holiday music,\" either. These were actual Christmas carols, with words like \"Christ Our Savior is Born.\" The ACLU people were incredibly cool about the whole thing -- they set up a little table with cookies and coffee for us, and stayed downstairs and joined in the singing.

I argued yesterday that it's a bad idea because you really never know what music a bus driver might choose to expose the children to. Former Illinois Commerce Commission employee Bob Lane e-mailed to remind me of another reason it's a bad idea: October 30, 1996 -- Federal safety officials on Tuesday finally brought a measure of closure to last year's fatal train-school bus crash in Fox River Grove.... A fast-moving Metra commuter train hit the rear fender of the bus, which extended over the tracks as driver Patricia Catencamp waited at a red light on Algonquin Road at U.S. Highway 14. Seven Cary-Grove High School students died in the Oct. 25, 1995, accident, and more than two dozen were injured.... (Among the causes:) Loud music was playing (on the radio) in Catencamp's vehicle, and she told investigators she did not hear the whistle of the approaching train. (Chicago Tribune) \"I'M AN OLD MAN AND IT'S EARLY IN THE MORNING. I'M GATHERING MY THOUGHTS HERE \" Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's cranky initial response to Spec. Thomas Wilson who asked him during a \"town meeting\" in Kuwait about inadequate armor on U.S. military vehicles sums up how I feel most mornings. I plan to include it on the next customized coffee mug I order. Speaking of custom mugs, we're giving them to the grandparents for Hannuka/Christmas this year. With digital photos stored on the computer and online photo-gift ordering sites, it's astoundingly easy to have them made and shipped, and they're treasured like almost no other present. And speaking of Spec. Wilson, his action reminded me of \"Mack,\" the beleaguered terrapin at the bottom of the stack in Dr. Suess' classic allegory, \"Yertle the Turtle.\" For two years I feel like I've been speeding down a darkened road, blasting past all the Bridge Out signs. Today I saw orange-and-white sawhorses up ahead, blocking the road. They got closer and closer all morning long, but it's too late to swerve now, and too late to stop. I crashed through and kept going... Also very moving are the concerned comments from her readers, many of whom don't know her personally.

FOR REFERENCE The message board on TV coverage of the LaSalle Bank Building fire will be archived for a while, but new comments will not be added to it. The topic was the controversy up in Gurnee in which a student complained because a school bus driver was playing Christmas carols on the bus radio. The district initially told the bus driver to cut it out--don't play the radio at all - but last night the school board overruled administrators and OK'd the playing of radios on school buses. Our story says, \"The decision brought applause from audience members, who had packed the board room. Some began singing `We Wish You a Merry Christmas.'\" But of course the inevitable problem is that once you allow bus drivers to decide what sorts of music kids get to listen to on the way to school, you're at the whim of, well bus drivers. Not to knock bus drivers. But you can't fight for the right of a Christian bus driver to play Christmas carols to the kiddies on the way to school without, then, fighting for the right of a Jewish bus driver to play sacred Jewish music or a Muslim bus driver to play sacred Islamic music or an atheist bus driver from slipping in a CD of Dan Barker's \"Beware of Dogma.\" Then some real-life Otto might choose to play his heavy metal station or his old Cheech and Chong cassette. Point is, that when, in an effort to advance religion, you allow an exception to common-sense public policy (in this case, that school bus drivers should not play the radio for the kids), you open the door to the possible advancement of all sorts of things. Hey, I do have a copy here of Dan Barker's CD, \"Beware of Dogma.\" Quoth the Washington Post: Barker is an atheist, a born-again atheist at that, having been a teenage evangelist and a successful Christian songwriter whose search for religious truth took him away from Jesus.... The 16-track CD includes satirical takes on popular songs, including \"God-Less America\" and \"Why BSA?\" (to the tune of \"YMCA\" by the Village People), which assails the Boy Scouts of America for excluding atheists and gays.

It happened when I set up the online debate on immigration policy last year, when Joshua Hoyt, the executive director of the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, was a real pill about agreeing to tangle on even ground with Dave Gorak, the executive director of the Midwest Coalition to Reduce Immigration in Lombard. Hoyt finally agreed, but I've been waiting since March for him to write his final installment. It happened again, though to a lesser extent, when I set up the \"live-birth\" abortion debate between anti-abortion activist Jill Stanek and pro-abortion rights advocates. The Planned Parenthood of Illinois contributors to the debate were the most difficult to bring to the digital table. And again, now, it's the ACLU that's balking at the idea I've been floating this week that a diverse group of advocates should gather before next December and hammer out a joint statement on what they all agree is appropriate for school and civil winter holiday observances. I don't think it's a lack of confidence in their positions that prompts liberals to shy from engaging on the field of debate. I think it's insularity tinged with - OK, I'll say it - arrogance. As much as I respect and believe in the ACLU and its mission, I was somewhat dumbstruck yesterday when local leaders were telling me they don't think there's a problem out there; that Americans and public officials do understand what is and what isn't appropriate at the holidays. Ask any talk radio host in America - the misunderstanding and ill-will on this subject is rampant. Though Prof. Zorn will surely find this bit of news appalling, I think it's pretty funny: St. Bernard Catholic Church, not far from Lambeau Field where the Green Bay Packers play, has changed its Mass schedule for Christmas Eve. With the Packers at home against the Vikings in a rare Friday game at 2 p.m., St. Bernard's moved its 4 p.m. Mass to 6 p.m. Hey, I'm thrilled to be mentioned in the competition. May they always spell my last name right! But there's not a single line in my entire 24-year body of work at the Tribune that would lead anyone to think I would presume to care about when a church would schedule its services. Maybe if the Sun-Times hired an actual local person to write the column, it would contain better zingers. Many of you sent in answers, which I'll summarize here: 1. The use of \"tehee\" in the solution instead of the much more common \"tee-hee\" as a synonym for \"snicker\" is legit because, even though no one really spells it that way, it does appear in the dictionary. Some respondents admitted that such variants and obscurities are not hallmarks of the puzzle writer's finest hour and that \"tehee\" is, to use a harsh pejorative among puzzle folk, \"inelegant.\" 2. When a question mark is appended to a clue, it generally signals that a pun or odd bit of whimsy is involved. In this case \"Hot flower?\" works as a clue for the answer \"lava\" because lava is a hot thing that flows. 3. The fetish for symmetry is (some say) a mostly American thing and even though it does force the puzzle maker into such inelegancies as \"tehee\" more frequently than if he or she had fewer constraints, the overall effect of symmetry in puzzles creates a sort of meta-elegance. I suppose. And I really don't have a dog in this fight, as I seldom do the crossword puzzles myself. But if I did, the ability of a puzzlemaker to make his puzzles absolutely symmetrical would not at all enhance my pleasure in doing his puzzles, as much as it might enhance his or her pleasure in crafting them. And, darn it, it ought to be about me, the puzzle-doer, and not the puzzle-maker. (MoveOn.org is) a network of aggrieved liberals, connected by the central nervous system of the Internet, and it enables its members to convince themselves they're \"doing something\" when they're really not. Christmas carols and other kinds of music will again be played on a Gurnee-area school district's buses after a short-lived ban gave new meaning to the \"Silent Night\" season. At a special meeting Wednesday night, the Woodland School District 50 board told Supt. Dennis Conti to allow radio music on the buses again. The decision brought applause from audience members, who had packed the board room. Some began singing \"We Wish You a Merry Christmas.\" Conti said he was disappointed that the board did not support his ban, which he contended was a matter of safety, not Christmas music. A collection of useful links related to what really is and isn't OK in public schools during the winter holiday season is here. WEDNESDAY, DEC. 8, 2004 updated at 1 p.m. D'OH! The State Journal-Register reports that the newly dedicated World War II memorial in Springfield contains an error \"literally carved in stone.\" A reference to the \"Berma\" campaign on the $1.5 million memorial will be changed to \"Burma\" in the spring, officials say. BUT IN FACT... The clich\u00e9 has it that - \"By mostly removing the issue from the democratic process, (the Roe v. Wade decision) created the current polarization over abortion, in which both parties are officially committed to extreme positions.\" (James Taranto, Wall Street Journal Online) But in fact -- The abortion debate was and would have remained driven by absolutist positions. Anyone who has ever seriously debated this issue knows how silly the idea is that legislative compromise would ever lead to any sort of resolution or long-term peace. The clich\u00e9 has it that - \"Our nation depends on immigrants to do the scutwork that Americans can't bring themselves to do.\" (Neil Steinberg, Chicago Sun-Times) But in fact - As \"Fear Factor\" has proven, Americans will bob for cows' eyeballs in a vat of blood if the price is right. So the idea that immigrant laborers perform tasks that Americans simply refuse to perform is misleading. The truth is that immigrants work for wages that Americans refuse to work for. They're not filling a labor shortage, but a wage gap. FINE LINES Cultural salt lick Rebecca Traister in Salon on \"Sex and the City.\" Even (football coach Ron) Zook's worst record in his three years at Florida -- 8-5, twice -- would be a major success at Illinois, where folks speak airily of a grand football tradition that doesn't actually exist. One of the things I promised readers 478 days ago when I started this blog was to keep track of the number of days DuPage County State's Attorney Joe Birkett has dithered about Brian Dugan since his office announced he had conclusive DNA proof that Dugan raped murder victim Jeanine Nicarico of Naperville in 1983. Indicting and trying Dugan will likely dredge up embarrassments for DuPage County authorities, men who long zealously pursued other suspects in the case and pooh-poohed Dugan's self-incriminating statements. \"Every time you call me, we're a little closer,\" Birkett said when I last checked in with him 287 days ago (2/25/04) to ask what was taking so darn long. He characterized the investigation as \"aggressive.\" OK. Today marks 754 days since Nov. 15, 2002 , when Birkett's office announced that Dugan's DNA matched DNA evidence found in Jeanine to a scientific certainty. The same handy duration calculator on the Web allows me also to report that we've seen 602 days of gubernatorial inaction since April 16, 2003, when a plainly supportive Illinois Prisoner Review Board held a clemency hearing for Debra Gindorf. Virtually every expert concedes that Gindorf was in the grips of post-partum psychosis when she killed her children in 1985, and not even the state's attorney whose office oversaw her prosecution, Mike Waller of Lake County, objects to Governor Blagojevich showing mercy at this stage and releasing her from prison. But for 602 days, Blagojevich has stalled and demurred. Birkett sent around a letter to state GOP bigwigs recently saying he's interested in running for a statewide post. And most observers think Blagojevich has his eye on higher office as well. Yet both seem to have an awful lot of trouble just doing their current jobs. A gallery of gadgets, features, and cooking devices that appeared and, in some cases, disappeared during the creative cooking of the 1950s.

Click here for a dispatch from Neil Steinberg's book party last night Click here for something intriguing on the stem-cell research debate The Army's published account not only withheld all evidence of fratricide, but also exaggerated Tillman's role and stripped his actions of their context..... Commanders also withheld the facts from Tillman's widow, his parents, national politicians and the public. Tillman sounds like a fascinating man, from all accounts - an extremely thoughtful, well-read and iconoclastic person. \"He demanded straight talk about uncomfortable truths.\" So here is a truth that's likely to make some people uncomfortable. Pat Tillman did not believe in God. \"Pat isn't with God,\" said his younger brother Rich, addressing mourners at Tillman's funeral. \"He's [expletive] dead. He wasn't religious. So thank you for your thoughts, but he's [expletive] dead.\" San Francisco Chronicle columnist Gwen Knapp, one of only a handful of reporters who mentioned this, wrote: What? This didn't happen for God, as well as country? A professional athlete turned soldier, and we're supposed to believe that he'd have no use for piety? Robbed of a clich\u00e9, where does that leave us? It leaves us better aware than ever that there are atheists in foxholes. And everywhere else as well. At the suggestion of readers I have removed \"natural habitat\" from the list of pleonasms and, at the suggestion of WBBM AM (780)'s Bernie Tafoya, have added Chicagoland area, which, as he points out, is like saying \"Chicago-area area.\" I was expecting to see a paragraph describing how Keller eventually took all of her notes and sat down at a computer and began to write the stories by interspersing direct quotations with her own narrative of the events to arrive at a rough draft, which she then sent to her editor for editing, after which she had a bagel and a cup of coffee before getting a revised copy of her story back from the editor, etc., etc. Har. As if any editor ever got back to a reporter that quickly. But seriously. Such an explanatory note - similar to notes in major non-fiction books - allows the writer to free herself from having to throw in the narrative speed bumps that are journalistic attributions, and to write with muscular, novelistic vividness, like this: It was a great black mass, a swirling coil some 200 yards wide at the ground--it was wider in the sky--heading northeast at about 30 m.p.h. They looked up and saw it but they thought: No. Couldn't be. Could it? There was a wild beauty to it, a fiercely knotted loveliness that was like nothing they'd ever seen. They could see debris swirling in it, pulled in and out and sucked up and around, frenzied sticks of wood, trees, dirt, other things, everything. The ones who watched it come, watched it fill more and more of the blue-green sky like the canvas of a finicky painter who decides to slather the whole thing in black and start over, felt almost hypnotized at first, rooted to the earth but looking up, up, up. Instead of like this: It was a great black mass, those who saw it said. A swirling coil that the National Weather Service later estimated was some 200 yards wide at the ground. It was wider in the sky, meteorologists said, heading northeast at about 30 m.p.h. Residents of Utica later said they looked up and saw it but they thought, \"No. (It) couldn't be (true). Could it?\".... You get the idea. Keller's series sweeps the reader along so powerfully because she was able to pack all those attributions, citations and explanations into that side-bar. I hope it becomes a journalistic convention of its own and that we see a lot more work just like this. Was there too much behind-the-scenes material? Not for my tastes. I'd love to hear more about how Keller reported this story, the relationships she built up in Utica, the hold over her that this storm obviously had. If you haven't read it yet, go do so. It could keep me in \"Fine Lines\" entries for the next month. The Sun-Times' political reporter in Washington seems determined to be the Lone Mainstream Journalist Who Sees Through Obama, but her efforts so far have a whiff of desperation: Sen.-elect Barack Obama (D-Ill.) chartered an airplane and flew to Omaha, Neb., to lunch with billionaire Warren Buffett and his daughter Susan, who donated $1,000 to Obama last August. Obama would rather you not know about his meal with Buffett and his daughter. She's wroth that the lunch wasn't on Obama's public schedule and accuses him of being \"secretive,\" though these attacks lack context - Do any other public officials keep journalists abreast of their meal plans? Do all of them except that slippery devil, Barack Obama? --- and any hint that anything untoward is taking place. All she's doing with such nattering is creating a credibility problem for herself down the line should she ever catch Obama doing something that does have the whiff of scandal. How can you believe Lynn Sweet? She's been out to get him from jump street. I'd never heard of J-Date until last night. Then, within the space of 15 minutes at Neil Steinberg's book-release party, two people, independently, told me of having recently found matrimonial bliss through this Internet matchmaking service for Jewish singles. (story ) In a sign of the times, though, I couldn't help but think of this new concept \"buzz marketing\" in which volunteer agents make it their mission to go out and spread the word about certain products. (story) Did these stories come out of nowhere, or was I being buzzed? From now on, it seems we'll never be sure anymore when friends and acquaintances drop brand names on us. As an incorruptible journalist, I will be the last person you can truly trust. And no, I wasn't crashing Steinberg's book party. I was invited. Yes, he and I throw spitballs at each other in print, but I'm unable to take it personally and still enjoy both his company and his writing. I'm looking forward to \"Hatless Jack,\" his latest. It's a social history of headwear, and Steinberg pointed out to me that it's the first of his books that contains no first-person because he didn't want to \"interfere with what I think is a great story.\" The party was very swank - Richard Roeper and Bill Zwecker were the official hosts--and featured caterers in bowler hats serving appetizers that looked like little works of art. I didn't see Bob Greene among all the swell people there, but I had to leave early so maybe he was able to drop by later for that conciliatory vodka gimlet Steinberg has promised him. Groveling at the feet of the Tribune media empire he detests, Steinberg will be Milt Rosenberg's guest tonight on WGN AM (720) at 9 p.m. It's brilliantly, grotesquely unconventional....(One respected researcher proposes that) we create functioning parts of an embryo without the whole....by turning off one of the genes that guide embryo formation.... The plan would be to follow the recipe for cloning...but turn off (the gene that directs the formation of the placenta). Then, once the cell begins to divide, reactivate the gene, too late to organize the embryo but early enough to make stem cells....The idea is so wild that (members of President's Council on Bioethics) who usually know where they stand on embryo issues aren't sure what to think. In light of my column today on the efforts of the Alliance Defense Fund to \"save Christmas,\" I've challenged that group as well as the ACLU of Illinois to sit down next October and generate a joint statement to be distributed to all public school districts in at least the six-county area outlining the substantial areas of agreement between the two sides as to what is appropriate at public school winter holiday assemblies. It's more fun to fight, I know, but finding and publicizing the common ground here would be a great public service.

Johanna is particular about buying only the most natural of the Brownberry sandwich breads and has trained me to look for the name \"Catherine Clark\" on the label. \"Founder of Brownberry Bakers,\" the label says. Or said. When shopping recently I went looking for the name and couldn't find it until I turned the loaf over and found Ms. Clark listed in the boilerplate on the underside. Who was she? Here is a portion of her May, 1986 obituary: Catherine Clark, who started the multimillion-dollar Brownberry Ovens bakery in a small store in Wisconsin 40 years ago, has died at the age of 79. Mrs. Clark...started Brownberry Ovens in 1946 at Oconomowoc, Wis., after she received a good response to the bread she baked at home. The native of Whitewater, Wis., began the business with two assistants and often traveled to grocery stores, offering a taste to persuade the grocers to buy her bread. Brownberry Ovens grew to have two Midwestern plants and sales of more than $16 million a year. The company was purchased in 1973 by Peavey Co., a Minneapolis-based agribusiness firm, but Mrs. Clark stayed on as board chairman until she retired in 1979. Now she's getting dissed. Don Marquess, Vice President of marketing for George Weston Bakeries Inc., in Lombard, which owns the brand, responded to my e-mail query with this bland explanation: We moved the name \"Catherine Clark\" to our back panel over a year ago. The move was made to allow the health benefits of our product to be shown to our consumers. I don't think so. I'm a label watcher, and I think this just happened and that George Weston Bakeries is throwing Catherine Clark under the bus and hoping no one will notice. REDUNDANCIES AGAIN Former Trib colleague Jim Szantor adds and contributes these pleonasms to the list and roster: Reason why advance reservations mix together arson fire pre-plan NOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK Long ago, I assumed that Chicago was called \"The Windy City\" because it was particularly breezy here. Then I learned that locals know the term was coined in the late 19th century and referred to what inveterate windbags our politicians are. Recently, then, Ed \"Cecil Adams\" Zotti's \"Straight Dope\" column in the Reader cited the work of Barry Popik a \"relentless word bloodhound\" and noted that \"the term was already being used in 1885 with reference to the city's lake breezes, and he's since found instances dating from as early as 1876.\" This led me to the entry on this topic in the newly published \"Encyclopedia of Chicago,\" and an archived \"Straight Dope,\" both of which point to wind, not hot air, as the source of the nickname.

I've become the subject of an e-mail campaign by the good folks at bookcrossing.com, who see some sort of convergence between this effort and their own and want me to publicize it. What do they do? A Tribune feature in September, 2003 described it this way: These devout readers, more than 100,000 strong, leave well-loved books in public places so that others may find them, read them and share with others. A May, 2003 Tribune feature gave the nuts and bolts: Members register the books scheduled for \"release into the wild\" on the Web site. They can then download preprinted labels, stick them on the book jacket and include on the label their BookCrossing member-assigned ID number. When the book is found, the discoverer can go to the Web site to register the discovery. The \"releasing\" member is then notified by e-mail of the book's \"recapture.\" The concept, said BookCrossing co-founder Ron Hornbaker of Kansas City, Mo., is \"to turn the whole world into a lending library.\" THE THIRTY-SECOND FORWARD SKIP; AN UPDATE Steve Johnson and I were noting in this blog last week that TiVo and Comcast Cable's DVR don't offer the marvelous, instantaneous 30-second forward advance. Clever people wrote to us to explain how one can program one's TiVo and Comcast 6412 to do a 30-second skip. For Comcast: Press and hold SETUP until red LED blinks twice. Enter 994. LED blinks twice. Press SETUP once but don't hold it. Enter 00173 Press LIVE key (or any other key you want for skip) LED blinks twice. For TiVo: Bring up any recorded program. (I believe you have to be watching a recorded program rather than \"Live TV\" in order to enable the feature.) On your TiVo remote, key in the following sequence: SELECT PLAY SELECT 3-0 SELECT If you've successfully entered the code, you should hear three \"bings\" in succession to let you know that you've successfully enabled the 30 second skip feature. The skip-to-hash button on your remote will now skip forward 30 seconds during playback. ( The previous function of the skip to hash button --that is, jumping to the next \"hash\" mark on the playback progress bar at the bottom of the screen-- can still be accessed by first pressing fast forward or reverse.) A great deal of my e-mail this week concerned my Tuesday blog entry and Thursday column pondering the \"real reasons\" Patrick Daley might be enlisting in the U.S. Army. Daley, 29, the only surviving son of Mayor Richard M. Daley and the grandson of former mayor Richard J. Daley, gave an interview to the Sun-Times earlier this week saying it was simply love of country and desire to serve that inspired him. I wondered if revising his rather unimpressive biography for political purposes wasn't also on his mind. This got me the \"how dare you?\" treatment from a number of correspondents. Their argument, to sum it up, is that when it comes to so noble an act, it's unseemly to question or analyze the motives. When someone does something good and brave, they say, we should simply thank him and not ask or wonder why. But I see no point, no advantage, no leg-up on reality, to looking at the world that way. I'm fascinated by the question of why people do what they do, as well as the converse question of why people don't do what they don't do. Human beings are not Vulcans, perfectly logical and rational. They are a roiling cauldron of ambitions, fears, desires, hopes, prejudices, instincts and impulses -- some good, some bad; some obvious, some hidden; some we're candid about, some we lie about. Even Mother Theresa wasn't exactly Mother Theresa, if you believe Christopher Hitchens' take-down book summarized here. Why otherwise sensibly cynical people would suddenly close their minds on the question of motive simply because the topic is military service is beyond me. This young man is likely destined to play a significant role in our city's political future, he's giving an exclusive interview to a friendly columnist about the grand nobility of his next step in life, and most of this city's pundit class is declaring that we should take it at face value and say nothing other than, \"thank you, Patrick.\" But pondering his motives and his future in light of his past are not incompatible with tipping our hats to what he's embarking upon and expressing respect and gratitude. MORE ABOUT `DOCTOR' Mail also continues to be heavy on the question of whether we should call PhD's \"doctor\" outside of an academic setting. I said no, and most of those who've written in to disagree contend that those with doctorate degrees have worked really, really hard for them and so deserve this show of respect and acknowledgement of their sacrifice. Pshaw. Academics - particularly doctoral candidates and assistant/associate professors striving for tenure - work very, very hard, it's true. I grew up in an academic family and so did my parents--the hours are long and the pay not what it should be given the level of accomplishment. But a lot of people in this world work really hard and put in really long hours, and don't demand a title after they're all done. And their jobs often aren't as fascinating and stimulating as academic pursuits. And hey, as one correspondent put it, if those with doctorate degrees want to be called \"doctor,\" everyone with a master's degree ought to ask to be called \"master.\" And for the rest of us....hmm \"Bachelor Zorn\" might be an interesting title. Why do I think it's generally OK to make an exception for medical doctors? In many cases, as grumpy PhD's pointed out, it takes less time to get an MD than a PhD. Because it's sometimes useful to know who is and isn't an MD, and to have that knowledge reinforced through conversation. But in general, even MDs tend to sling their titles around a bit much for my tastes. In circumstances where you would otherwise refer to someone as \"Mr. Jones\" and he has an MD, \"Dr. Jones\" strikes me as appropriate. But I find many doctors using the \"Dr.\" in situations when they otherwise would not use \"Mr.,\" and this very much rubs me the wrong way. Thanks to everyone who's been writing in on this. I'm glad for the input and may even do a follow-up column on the topic. I'm also grateful to the scores of Notebook readers who so far have weighed in with a range of thoughtful opinion on the to-link-or-not-to-link question.

LAND OF LINKIN It's not Mr. Picasso Head and you can't print out or save the results, near as I can tell, but this site where you can create your own South Park character, complete with cartoon bleeding wounds, is a nice waste of time for your weekend. THE BOYFRIEND'S BACK After an extended hiatus, \"The Boyfriend\" returns to Debra Pickett's S-T column today. I remain fascinated by her public campaign to shame this lad into marrying her, though nauseated, of course, by the way she refers to him. Today she hints that marriage is an area in which she is \"significantly more impatient\" than The Boyfriend is, and quotes a friend lamenting \"three years of your life waiting for (The Boyfriend) to commit.\" I've noted that Neil Steinberg, recently, in apparent solidarity, has taken occasionally to referring to Edie as \"the wife,\" lower case. The station is part of Tribune Co., and program host Milt Rosenberg is a professor at the University of Chicago. Steinberg frequently expresses contempt for both Tribune company and professors, but, as we saw earlier today, he'll hop in the promotional sack with anyone. SORRY! THIS BOOK HAS BEEN CLAIMED. BOILERPLATE RULES: Most of the books I'm giving away to Notebook readers have been sent by generous publishers hoping for a mention which, I suppose, they will get when I mention that I'm giving the book away. First person to e-mail me about any given book gets it. Put the title of the book in the subject line and include your mailing address (U.S. only). One book per household. Tribune company employees, family members, etc. not eligible. I won't keep on file or reuse your address, you have my word as a former Cub Scout. But, at the same time, I understand that readers place a certain amount of trust in chicagotribune.com and in me; trust that they're not going to click idly on some link here and be assaulted by graphic images or descriptions of sexual, excretory or violent activity; nudity, racist jokes, medically disturbing photos and that sort of thing. So where's the line? Yesterday I had what I thought was a clever, snarky and useful idea: Richard Roeper's two most recent columns in the Sun-Times were devoted to listing his readers' favorite Web sites. But the Web version of those columns didn't contain working hyperlinks to those sites. Duh. So under the headline, \" A FEW GOOD LINKS FROM YOUR WEB-SAVVY, USER-FRIENDLY CHICAGO NEWSPAPER,\" I made a link-intensive list of those sites and submitted it to the editors. They balked at several of the sites which, if you explored them at all, led you to material that had, shall we say, very little redeeming value or literary merit. I chose not to run a partial list - far less snark value in that, I thought, and merely an invitation for Neil Steinberg to trot out one of his favorite expressions and accuse the Trib of once again \"dabbing the perfumed hankie\" to its lips. And I didn't fight the overall ruling. But I did point out that we seem to be making up the rules as we go along here, and that it's probably time that we come up with a sensible, easy-to-follow policy about what chicagotribune.com writers can and can't link directly to. An editor suggested: Why don't you propose one, then, as a starting point for discussion? I'll be glad to, but first I'd like to ask the users - you - what you expect and would like to find in the way of off-site links at a Web site that bears the imprimatur of the Chicago Tribune. Should we link directly only to material that maintains \"family newspaper\" standards? If not - if you feel we should link to important, interesting, relevant and entertaining sites even if they have a few cuss words on them - would you like such links to be accompanied by content warnings? Always, or just in certain circumstances? Are there any other safeguards or guidelines you feel would be appropriate or necessary? (I'm interested particularly in the views of those with children who have access to the computer). For instance, we could offer the Web addresses of perhaps too-edgy sites, but, like the Roeper columns, present them in plain text, forcing readers to take several affirmative steps (select, copy, paste, go) in order to reach the destination. Or we could have a one-click rule that mandates that any offensive content be at least two mouse clicks away from chicagotribune.com content. You tell me. This isn't a vote, by the way. Even I don't have a vote when policy decisions like this get made. But it helps all of us to hear from Web users whom we hope will visit us again and again and make us a daily destination, not just an occasional stopping point. But, lo and behold, (Wednesday's) Steinberg column closes with the following announcement: Friday morning at 9:30, Neil Steinberg will discuss his new book, \"Hatless Jack,\" on WBEZ-91.5 FM. Steinberg is unencumbered by the sort of principle that would cause him to refuse an invitation to plug his book in a venue he finds contemptible - it's part of his charm, really, and I mean that. If he worried about foolish consistency, he wouldn't shoot from the hip all the time in that vastly entertaining, damn-you-all-anyway fashion of his. Just last week he extended a thorny olive branch to former columnist Bob Greene, whose work Steinberg had regularly eviscerated in the pages of the Reader and whose fall from grace at the Tribune he had mocked in the Sun-Times and on (non-public) radio. Steinberg offered no direct apology to Greene - he never does that in print - but said \"I like to think that people can change,\" meaning Greene, and said he'd buy him a \"conciliatory vodka gimlet\" should the Sun-Times take his advice and hire Greene. In that same column, Steinberg conceded/boasted, \"If ever there was a master of shamelessness, it's me.\" What's with Sun-Times columnist Neil Steinberg and National Public Radio? Today: \"...those who, indoctrinated by the adult version of Disney cartoons, National Public Radio, are morally opposed to any foreign cuisine that isn't a corn tortilla baked on a hot stone.\" April, 2003: \"I'm not one of those lemon-faced NPR liberals...\" January, 2003: \"There were perhaps 300 people at the rally, well salted with young green-fatigue anarchist types selling \"The Daily Socialist\" and gray-haired NPR radicals.\" November, 1999: \"There was a precise moment when my inarticulate dislike for National Public Radio crystallized into a fine gem of loathing. Some linguist was talking on and on about how English has taken over the world and will spell the end for other languages. \"English has become the 'lingua franca' of the world,\" he said. The idiot interviewer made one of those `mmm-hmmm' purring noises, completely missing the irony of using an Italian phrase to argue for the dominance of English.\" April, 1999: \"... the sort of people who listen to National Public Radio: bespectacled, be-sweatered, well-scrubbed, comfortable and soft, as if they couldn't change a tire if their lives depended on it.\" Additionally, Steinberg writes many of the unsigned editorials at the Sun-Times, where we've seen the following digs: November, 2003: \"What was the `appropriate' response to Sept. 11? What would NPR have done?\" December, 2001: \"Zealotry is immune to evidence. The demand for proof--whether from the Arab world, from NPR liberals in America or from cafe communists in Europe--was not a sincere request for a persuasive link between the avowed terrorist and this particular attack \" September, 2001: \"...the kind of anti-patriotism you hear on National Public Radio, the simplistic `My country, right or wrong' met with the equally extreme `My country--wrong.'\" Now I admit that I'm more highly attuned to such jabs since my wife works at the local NPR affiliate, but Steinberg, a friend of whose writing I'm an admirer, does seem to have a fixation on the network. He's stuck on the old stereotype of NPR, which is now more balanced in its news and commentary offerings than most radio networks. To know that, however, he would actually have to listen. I sent the above to Steinberg for his response, and he sent back the following: Sure, it looks like a lot of references to NPR, but you're aggregating them over, what, almost five years? From both my column and the editorial page. I'm sure there are a lot of other loathed entities --Communist China, PETA, terrorists -- who got an equal or greater number of jabs. My only complaint is that it is both unfair and unfounded for you to suggest that I am only criticizing NPR because I don't listen to it. You don't know that. I listen to NPR as much as I can stand to, and always find its claims to have changed to be unsubstantiated. That said, no hard feelings on my end. We all have wives, and I would go to bat for mine, too. It is indicative of the stand-up guy you are. Books are being claimed rather quickly by loyal Notebook readers. Today's offering is my personal copy of Roald Dahl's \"Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator,\" which I offered here several months ago in the context of how much I loathed the book. This sequel to the classic \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" will make a perfect gift this season for someone you don't care for much. SORRY! THIS BOOK HAS BEEN CLAIMED.

THURSDAY, DEC. 2, 2004 updated at 10:37 a.m. BLOGGING ON BLOGGING For what it's worth, this story tells us that \"blog\" was the \"most requested online definition this year\" at the online version of Merriam-Webster's 11th Collegiate Dictionary. An online journal which produces fame without wealth for pajama-clad scribes, known as bloggers, who write so well they don't need editors and who survive by eating ramen noodles and Tang powder from a spoon. Another lurch in this medium's movement toward mainstream legitimacy is the kick-off of a blog jointly written by University of Chicago's Nobel Prize winning economist Gary Becker and noted local author and 7th District U.S. Court of Appeals Judge Richard Posner. The Center for Excellence in Television Comedy reports that \"The Daily Show\" is 46 percent less funny than it was during the Democratic primaries, and a whopping 55 percent less funny than it was during the last month of the presidential contest. OK, I made those statistics up. It only seemed right -- fake stats for a fake news show But the fans? What is wrong with them? They are idiots, being played for suckers by a bunch of millionaires who own ball teams. Because they happen to live in a certain area, they root for a certain team. Never mind that the players usually don't live in the area and they would, for either a buck or a whim, go somewhere else. The fans for some reason identify so passionately with a team that they are willing to risk physical injury on its behalf. Freud, I am sure, had a term for such people: jerks. I'm sure everybody ever associated with Notre Dame will tell you color had nothing to do with letting Willingham go, that it's totally a coincidence, which is like spitting in somebody's face and telling him it's a rain drop. Also, \"Confessions of a Cad,\" below, is still, unaccountably, unclaimed.SORRY! THIS BOOK HAS BEEN CLAIMED.

WEDNESDAY, DEC. 1, 2004 updated at 11:52 a.m. Correspondence with readers on the Patrick Daley story is here, lower on the page. FAILURE TO MILK My fellow Trib-blogger Maureen Ryan offered a timely blog entry yesterday on record-shattering winner Ken Jennings defeat on \"Jeopardy!\" Word was all over the place early Tuesday that the machine-like Jennings was going down on his 75th show, just as, Ryan noted, \"online rumormongers had long said Jennings' final episode was taped back in September.\" For a while I was a daily watcher of the Jennings Juggernaut - he was fascinating and a bit icky as he laid waste his foes - but as soon as I learned approximately when he was going to lose, I tuned out. No drama. \"Jeopardy!\" missed a great opportunity. Producers should have discarded their playbook and persuaded key affiliates to begin carrying each game featuring Jennings live, just like a sporting event. Yes, the show is ordinarily taped months in advance and stations air it at various hours of the day, but this was not an ordinary champion and the chance to spark a genuine outbreak of \"Jeopardy!\" fever passed by. ATTEMPT TO MILK Trib TV critic Steve Johnson, currently spending the school year in Cambridge, Mass. and filing periodic dispatches for Tempo from there, forwarded to me a public relations pitch from an agency representing Mont Blanc pens that I, in turn, forward on to you: Hi Steve, From the first episode of ABC's \"Desperate Housewives,\" the nation has been intrigued by Mary Alice's suicide followed by a clue - a handwritten note stating, \"I know what you did. It makes me sick. I'm going to tell.\" The characters and America didn't know what to think when the disturbing note was found in Mary Alice's things. This past Sunday, it was discovered that the incriminating note was written by the pesky Mrs. Huber, who used a nondescript pen for such a d\u00e9class\u00e9 message. She could have at least done it style. As the saying somewhat goes, select your pen as you would your sword. Montblanc features quite a selection of styles, from old world fountain pens to the modern mechanics of a fineliner tip and everything in between. Unless you live out in the middle of a field, we are often subject to the peccadilloes of our neighbors - perhaps not as dramatic as found on Wisteria Lane each week, but disturbing nonetheless (loud music, barking dogs, early morning lawn mowing). Confrontations about said behaviors can lead to nasty arguments, tones in an email can often be misconstrued (not to mention traced). A hand written note slipped under the door or anonymously placed in the mailbox speaks volumes without a difficult confrontation. Let me know if you would like to speak Jan-Patrick Schmitz, President & CEO of Montblanc North America about handwritten notes, pens and how to deliver a clear message when you don't know what to say. I look forward to hearing your thoughts. He converted me to the technology two years ago and I now try to convert others with a dreary missionary zeal. Here's our e-exchange, edited to remove typos, profanity, libel and in-jokes. To Steve -- Two issues of great interest to me that you didn't touch on in your wonderful story today have to do with the 30-second skip-forward feature that I love more than life itself. As you may know, the Dish PVR we have offers a one-touch 30-second advance that allows us to hopscotch through even long commercial breaks in just a couple of seconds. I seem to recall your Replay TV box had the same feature, and that TiVo does not because advertisers don't like it. One, what's the future of this feature? And two, why in name of all that is holy do the interests of advertisers trump the desires of customers when it comes to features on an electronic device that is ostensibly designed, engineered and sold by an independent company? Why should advertisers have any say at all in whether a 30-second skip feature is included? Why would TiVo not want to make the most user friendly device it can make? How many different ways can I ask this question? To Eric -- Yes, although I didn't get into it, the 30-second-skip was another key reason for me rating Dish the best. Replay had it, although I think I've read that they caved in and removed it on later models. Comcast does not. TiVo does not. TiVo needs to make advertisers happy in order to try to grow a second revenue stream, other than just subscriptions. That's more important to them than fighting for a feature whose importance doesn't become obvious until you actually have the box installed. And now, to add insult, they're sticking in pop-up ads that appear when you try to fast forward. It may gain them some ad dollars, but I think that'll be balanced out, or worse, by the cost to them in loyalty. I have read that you can go to PVR forums and find ways to program your own 30-second skip, but haven't tested it. I think the future for the feature, nonetheless, is good, as long as the universe of DVR makers remains diverse. It's such an obvious one, and not having it is like putting a gas-pedal-limiter on a Ferrari. Though I will say, having lived with the FF button now, that you get pretty good at just whizzing through, sort of like adapting to those thumb-point mice in laptops. This recent Associated Press story offers a similar and unconvicing explanation: \"TiVo has to become more advertising-friendly because, at the end of the day, TV runs on advertising dollars and companies that are part of that food chain have to acknowledge that,\" said Tim Maleeny, director of strategy at Publicis & Hal Riney, a San Francisco-based advertising firm. A FEW GOOD LINKS If my critical bile has you on edge, try reading this feel-good blog entry about the persistent kindness of a CTA bus driver. The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) explains here why you should view ABC-TV's \"20/20\" gloss on the murder of Matthew Shepard ( it was a drug crime, not a hate crime ) as bogus. Ex-gay Watch keeps track of the efforts of those who are selling the idea that homosexuals can change to heterosexuals if they work at it hard enough. After an hour and a half of gimlet-sharp conversation he shows little sign of dulling. Maybe he doesn't join the visitor in a morning martini the way he once did, but the Scotch is proffered as usual, and is refilled promptly. The gleam in Terkel's eye is undimmed by misfortune too. The humour and the storytelling flow as naturally as ever. His fall, he says, \"was a wild jazzy tumble, choreographed more by Bob Fosse than by George Balanchine....\" Anecdotes and flourishes seem to gatecrash the party from all directions. But, rather like the fluid and fantastic architecture of Antoni Gaudi, there is an underlying structure that is rock solid. Just when you think that the years may be taking their toll and that he may be wandering off the point, he brings you unerringly back to it. Bernard Schoenberg of the State Journal-Register reflects here on the excess of gubernatorial bodyguards and coatholders: In the spring of 2002 that Blagojevich made a campaign issue of Paul Vallas, who was a top rival for the Democratic nomination for governor and then-CEO of the Chicago Public Schools system, having \"chauffeur-driven limousines,\" which really meant drivers. The issue was included in some Blagojevich speeches, debates and campaign ads. Terry McDermott of the Los Angeles Times here tells of his maddening battle with computer spyware and how AumHa.org finally saved him. \"Political Animal\" blogger Kevin Drum riffs off McDermott's story and here tells how he tries to keep spyware at bay: AdAware,SpyBot, a-squared, and, finally, the installation of the Notebook-recommended Firefox browser. The best - in fact only - article I've ever read on food phobias, why we like and dislike certain dishes - is food phobias is this essay in Slate by Jeffrey Steingarten, the food critic of Vogue: People should be ashamed of the irrational food phobias that keep them from sharing food with each other. Instead, they have become proud and arrogant and aggressively misinformed. But not me. When I donned the heavy mantle of food critic, I sketched out a six-step program to rid myself of all puissant and crippling likes and dislikes. Ever call \"Shotgun!\" to get dibs on the front passenger seat in a car? Well, it seems there are rules to this game -- 4,500 words' worth of rules. Read `em here. Paul F. -- I have to take issue with you. Sure those are all good points and good questions to raise, if and when he does go into politics. But he is not running for office, he's more likely running away from something by enlisting in the Army. I'm more inclined to give the guy a break and wonder why he would sign up for the Army,, of all things, than I am to criticize him right now. I suspect there's a variety of reasons anyone signs up for military service, and without any inside information I'd never presume to say for sure what might be motivating anyone to do that or, well, anything else. We heard a lot of whispering, remember, that Republican investment banker Jack Ryan went to teach at Hales Franciscan, an inner-city parochial high school, in order to polish his political resume. He did go on to run for the U.S. Senate, and he played the \"selfless teacher\" card in his ads. But it seems possible (likely, even, given that he reportedly went back to back to the school after dropping out of the race) that political considerations weren't by any means the only factor or even the largest factor in his decision. Shannon L. -- I am disgusted with you and your nasty, mean-spirited article. There is absolutely no journalistic merit in raising questions about this young man's desire to join the military. Yet because his father is a politician, you feel this makes him a target. How unfair. He is not a politician and therefore, the public has no business knowing the details of his private life. Do you really think that in order to make people \"forget\" about stupid and meaningless incidents in his past, someone would risk his life by joining the military, especially when doing so virtually assures him a tour in Iraq? This logic doesn't even make sense. Finally, who are you to assume that he's going to enter into politics just because his family members have done so? If anything, and especially after hate-filled articles like yours, I would guess he'd get as far away from politics as possible. Maybe that's the reason why he joined the military! Or, perhaps he just wanted to do a good thing with his life and serve his country....but what cynic would ever think of that? Rick W. -- Are you upset because Patrick Daley backed President Bush in the election? You really have a lot of nerve questioning this decision. Were you ready for West Point at 18? Now you're saying that he is willing to risk his life in Iraq for a chance in politics? I think you're confusing him with your hero, John Kerry. The fact is, to continue with my Jack Ryan point above, that certain acts do ultimately help write or rewrite a political biography, whether the budding or aspiring politician is motivated by that fact or not. Is Patrick Daley a budding or aspiring politician? It's a fair speculation, given his bloodlines. And look, the guy gave an exclusive interview on this to the columnist in town most likely to write a big, puffy valentine on the front page of the paper about it. And it's fairly unusual for a 29-year-old man with a new business degree to enlist in the Army. It may be cynical to consider the political implications and possible motives, but it's na\u00efve not to. And the story of this town is the triumph of the cynical over the na\u00efve. Tom McC. - It is unclear to me how participation in a still-unjustified travesty of a war will provide Patrick Daley with a \"clean slate,\" as you put it. However well-meaning the motives of most enlistees, their mission (to protect the American people) is not served in Iraq, which poses no real threat to the American people, according to virtually all experts - our President's inconsistent statements notwithstanding. Sorry, it bears repeating: Iraq had nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks, and Iraq was not developing \"weapons of mass destruction.\" Better that Patrick would join the Chicago police force (with which he has life experience), who truly serve and protect, rather than join up with the proven morally vacuous military engagement in Iraq, where far too many Americans and innocent Iraqis are dying every day in the true cause of political and economic conquest. But for Patrick, who has an MBA as President Bush does, perhaps political and economic conquest is what it's all about . . . including no-bid government contracts which we all pay for. It's an honorable thing to sign up to serve in the military, whether or not you or those who observe you agree with the decisions of the commander in chief. It would be wrong to impute to Patrick Daley any endorsement of a specific engagement or military effort beyond what he told Sneed: \"I have friends in Iraq and Afghanistan. They tell me it isn't as bad as you read in the press, that much in those countries is working and that we are making progress.\" S.I. P. -- I'm not saying that you're wrong about young Mr. Daley, and I think you voicing it is terrific, because you're only saying out loud what others are thinking. But it's beyond my comprehension that this is being done to put a notch on a resume for public office. I just can't see public office being that important. But, if it is that important to Mr. Daley, and he's willing to risk his life in order to get this on his resume..more power to him. There's not much that I'd be willing to possibly sacrifice life and limb for. Keep up the good work, and continue bringing us your funny, insightful, but sometimes infuriating observations. Oh, I will, thanks. And, again, I'm looking at the likely outcome here, not presuming to know Patrick Daley's heart or his head. And certainly, I'll say again, there's little evidence to suggest that the children of powerful Illinois politicians need to make grand, selfless gestures and achieve great things on their own before running for high office. Still, it's interesting to me that in many other circumstances, observers of the social and political scene are eager to ascribe motives to all manner of actions by high profile people. Yet when it comes to the choice of military service, so many take an approach that is both credulous and hands off. Now a few of the many, many letters that have poured in concerning the social use of the title \"Dr.\": Michael. B. -- I must have missed your past columns harrumphing that it is inappropriate and \"fawning\" to refer to Martin Luther King Jr. as \"Dr. King,\" or Madeleine Albright as \"Dr. Albright,\" and so on. Actually, I'm not a big fan of using \"Dr.\" as a title for anyone, but you'd look a lot less petty if you acknowledged that this is a game played on both sides of the political divide. (And I will acknowledge that perhaps it started on the right, with Henry Kissinger.) Several correspondents accused me of Rice bashing, which really wasn't my point at all. I've never heard Rice call herself \"Dr. Rice\" outside of an academic setting; my quibble started when I heard reporter Cheryl Burton of WLS-Ch. 7 using the title for Rice about 30 times during one report one evening. Ezra Getzler, Dept. of Mathematics, Northwestern University -- Excuse me for my pique, but doctors of a university (and certainly former provosts of the leading universities in the country), have, by custom, far more right to employ the title \"doctor\" than a graduate of a medical school. A medical degree, while it is taken after a bachelor's degree, is really more equivalent to a master's degree by coursework in the arts and sciences, since it requires no thesis. The MD takes three years of study, while the doctorate in arts or sciences (usually a Ph.D. or D.Phil.), takes between five and eight, often additional to a master's degree; and energy and relationship sapping, poverty-stricken years at that. Writing a thesis suitable for publication in a top journal or by an academic publisher is no mean thing. Fawning? No, simply convention - the same convention that grants honorific titles to a broad array of others in our society. Why, exactly, has the Chicago Tribune decided to withdraw this small sign of respect for the best educated, and some of the most thoughtful, members of our society? It's not just the Tribune that has decided that the term \"doctor\" is best understood and therefore best applied to MDs, it's every journalism style book I know and convention, as you put it, outside of the academy. We live in a society that, for the most part, rebels against social titles - it's part of the veneer of classlessness and egalitarianism that we try to maintain. American convention says that you don't get to have a title that's meant to remind everyone constantly in non-work settings how long you labored for your sheepskin or how much more educated and thoughtful you are presumed to be. Sure you worked hard and it's a long, difficult slog to get a Ph.D. A lot of people in business, sports, the arts... even journalism...put in many tough years and achieve quite a bit as well. They deserve respect, too. And rather than give everyone a title, we generally--outside of the realms of elected office and the judiciary - shun titles and let folks earn their respect day in and day out. Using \"Dr.\" with MDs serves a useful purpose - it can pay off to know who is a physician in times of crisis. But, that said, I'm opposed to the way many medical doctors throw their title around in settings where it's clearly irrelevant--- in cranky e-mails to me, for instance, where no one ever signs his name \"Mr. Joe Smith,\" for example, yet physicians are unable to resist signing their notes \"Dr. Joe Smith.\" Because I am a doctor, my opinion ought to carry more weight with you.... Sorry. Leslie K.-- In my experience, the majority of the people who say Ph.D.s should not call themselves \"Dr.\" do not hold doctorates themselves, and academics tend to be about evenly divided on the issue. At the University of Pennsylvania, where I earned my doctorate, the title was used routinely. However, a scholar friend says that when he was at Harvard, the title was considered infra dig. I like to think that Penn is a \"high-prestige\" school, though I'm sure many Harvard graduates would not agree. I am fairly neutral on the subject, though I've used the title in certain specific situations. I don't object to its use by others, in part because it wasn't invented solely for physicians. Derived from the Latin doctus, for \"learned,\" this title was first applied in medieval Europe to those who had earned advanced degrees in such fields as theology, civil and canon law, and the arts as well as medicine. Europeans still use it in this manner. In Italy, for example, I am addressed as Dottoressa -- nient'altro -- though my degree is in art history, not medicine. But here's a question for you: Why is it that I've never heard anyone object to the use of the title \"Dr.\" by psychologists, whose degree is a Ph.D., not an M.D.? Or by scientists? In the fields of education and religion, the title is also quite common. The Presbyterian minister who christened me, a doctor of divinity, was never addressed as anything other than \"Dr. Patterson,\" and my elementary school principal was always \"Dr. Ater.\" What is your explanation for this rather puzzling inconsistency? S. W. -- I have friends with J.D.s, and Ph.Ds in all manner of fields from some very highly regarded institutions who are technically \"doctors\" but who would never consider using the term. Why is it then that every superintendent and grade school principal seems to use it? And is visibly annoyed if others don't? True enough, lawyers never go by \"doctor\" even though they hold doctorates and psychologists, because they treat patients, seem particularly fond of the title. In a therapeutic, office setting, calling one's analyst, dentist, optometrist, veterinarian or chiropractor \"doctor\" seems appropriate to me. But a school superintendent or principal? Never. IRIS CHANG: A POWERFUL AND FOND REMEMBRANCE Paula Kamen's essay in Salon about her good friend and our former Tribune colleague is well worth the read: I was definitely a firm convert to the Iris Code -- to the point of spreading the gospel. When I occasionally went to universities to speak on my books, and then was a guest at writing classes, I would lecture students to \"Iris Chang\" it. She had become a verb to me. An action verb. \"Just think big!\" I told them. \"That's half the battle! What do you have to lose? If someone turns you down, they turn you down, so what? And then you move on. Just get a sense of entitlement, will you? It doesn't matter if you're in the Midwest. Or if you're at a public school. Just decide what you want and go get it. To the point of being naive. \"Your voice is not your voice. It's the voice of your generation! Just Iris Chang it!\" I explained, almost taking on her passionate tone as I spoke.

Wedell Cox, Heartland Institute, on government support for Amtrak. Several more details about the awful crash Thanksgiving morning on I-57 that was the subject of my column this morning. The 71-year-old Florida native, Rudolph Pasquino, whose Nissan Maxima crossed the 70-foot median and rammed head-on into a car occupied by the Flores family of Chicago, was only 10 miles from the exit authorities believe he planned to take to visit family for the holiday, according to Illinois State Police Sgt. Robert Ventura, who is investigating the crash. Ventura, who didn't get back to me until this morning with the additional details, said that Pasquino's car veered off the roadway almost immediately after leaving a construction zone near Marion and smashed into a temporary speed-limit sign on the left shoulder. Had he merely fallen asleep at the wheel, that impact likely would have awakened him, Ventura said, and he would have had plenty of time to stop the car or bring it back under control. The fact that he didn't - that the car kept going at a gentle angle across the median - suggests that a heart attack or other medical crisis had rendered him unconscious seconds before he lost control of the car. However, Ventura said, State Police are keeping open the possibility that Pasquino's driver's side air-bag deployed when he hit the sign, leaving him somehow incapacitated as his car continued on. \"The cars were so badly damaged, we may never know,\" Ventura said. A bulldozer was parked in the median area, and the tire tracks indicate that Pasquino missed hitting it by just two feet, Ventura said. He and I ended our phone conversation with numerous head-shaking expressions - what a shame, what a ghastly fluke these sorts of things are. Two feet! Or two seconds either way, here or there, and we might have a one-car, non-fatal spin-out or crash. Every accident like this is filled with wouldas, shouldas and couldas. One of the most haunting newspaper stories I've ever read appeared well over 20 years ago in the Tribune. It was written by Janet Cawley, and as I remember it she reconstructed the final hour in the life of a downtown business executive of some sort who, when driving home on Lake Shore Drive, was struck and killed by a man driving at high-speed whose car jumped the median barrier and plowed into him. People who knew him agonized over the thought that if they'd asked him one more question on his way out of the office, he would have caught another elevator, been 10 seconds earlier or 10 seconds later on the Drive and seen the accident ahead of him or in his rear view mirror. Like so many low-carb foods, it's dreadful --- just like I'd imagine packing material would taste like if you sprinkled a bit of sugar on it. WORD WATCH My Thanksgiving Day column cataloged the modern conveniences that make life so amazing these days, and reader Chuck Stevenson took issue with my inclusion of \"hot-water heaters\" He wrote, tartly, \"Hot water needs no heating.\" He's exactly right. \"Hot water heater\" is deeply redundant, yet, in my defense, it's also highly colloquial. I checked our electronic archives and found nearly 400 uses of \"hot water heater\" in the Tribune since the mid 1980s; the rule of thumb seems to be that one in every five stories that refers to these devices calls them \"hot water heaters\" and not the more concise and equally accurate \"water heaters.\" Fancy people call such expressions \"pleonasms,\" and here are a few more I found while trolling the web: advance planning aid and abet armed gunman ATM machine boiling hot cease and desist close proximity close scrutiny completely empty/full consensus of opinion downward descent each and every end result free gift freezing cold join together natural instinct null and void pair of twins past experience past history PIN number pre-recorded safe haven SAT and ACT tests surrounded on all sides tuna fish And Trib editor Dave Ibata points out that \"exactly right,\" above, is highly pleonastic.

The problem with Iraq is the left? Excuse me. Right-wingers created this insane mess. They control all three branches of government and are determined to make everything worse, having admitted no mistakes and thrown out the people who tried to warn them of their delusions. And Kristof thinks the \"biggest risk\" comes from liberals? Just what is it he thinks we are going to do to upset this brilliant war effort? Write a really nasty folk-song? I've asked lots of people if they've ever suddenly diverted their path to follow a member of the opposite sex. Every woman I've asked has said no, often with an incredulous head-shake; every man has said yes. We must be careful not to confuse election results with cultural trends. As survey after survey of contemporary social attitudes demonstrates, social conservatives no more represent the mainstream or the future than Prohibitionists did in the 1920s. If anything, it's the baby-boom sensibility spawned in the 1960s that has become mainstream in America today... The socially conservative attitudes held by many evangelicals and older Americans are simply out of step with what most Americans believe.... A generation ago, most Americans believed in moral absolutes, biblical truth and the authority of their religious leaders, but today, the vast majority say that religious morality is a personal matter.

Sun-Times gossip maven Mike Sneed is reporting today that Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley's only surviving son, Patrick, 29, has enlisted in the U.S. Army's airborne infantry and will report for duty within the month. \"It could lead him to Iraq or Afghanistan within a year,\" writes Sneed. She plays her front-page scoop as a simple, feel-good narrative of a young man blossoming with promise - he \"recently graduated with honors from the University of Chicago's MBA program and could have pursued lucrative job offers,\" she notes - who just wants to serve his country at a time of international peril. And while this may, in fact, be all there is to this story, Sneed's account leaves out or glosses over some biographical details that cynics can and will point to as possible contributing factors to young Daley's decision. Politics is the family business, and if Patrick Daley has political ambitions, as many suspect, he needs to change the public story line of his life so far, which has been marked by a very low-profile obscurity punctuated by negative news stories: Patrick was 16 years old when he hosted a party for about 50 teenagers at the family's Grand Beach, Mich., vacation home in March 1992. The mayor and his wife were out of town and had not authorized the party. A fight broke out, and Andrew Buckman was struck by a baseball bat by Mike Lawler, then 16, and suffered a life-threatening cerebral hemorrhage. ( Chicago Tribune ) Mayor Richard Daley's son Patrick was among several young men questioned by police early Saturday, Jan. 15, 2000, in connection with the theft of crowd-control barriers outside a Near North Side nightclub, Chicago police said. Patrick Daley, 24, was released after being questioned for about 45 minutes, police spokesman Pat Camden said. (Chicago Tribune ) Additionally, there is the disquieting matter of young Daley's washout at West Point - something Sneed touches on today but that Chicago media has generally steered clear of: In 1993, now former Democratic U.S. Rep. Bill Lipinski, then no longer the Daley family's congressman, gave Patrick a coveted nomination to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y. As you may know, a high school senior does not simply apply to the service academies, but in nearly all cases, he or she must persuade an elected federal official to nominate him. The nominators are not bound by any standards and they may nominate as many as 10 candidates for every vacancy they control. From that group, the admissions staff at each academy selects one. But the nominating official may also nominate only one candidate, which practically assures that candidate one of the tuition-free spots. How many people did Lipinski nominate for West Point that year? What was so special about Patrick Daley, and how does that nomination look given the hindsight that Daley withdrew from the academy after 14 months? When I looked into this in the middle of last year for a column on service academy admissions, a spokesman for Lipinski said he didn't know why Daley's son was nominated or how many others were nominated that year, and that the staff member who oversaw that decision has retired. Fine. I let it drop, as it wasn't central to my column. But such questions will be central to the coverage of any entry by Patrick Daley into the political arena and part of an unflattering silver-spoon narrative. (Not to say that being called the inexperienced offspring of a political heavyweight has proven to be any sort of handicap in Illinois politics). Or, more accurately, such questions would have been central to the coverage of any entry by Patrick Daley into the political arena. Whatever possibly various motivations are behind it, this volunteer stint in Army will erase those questions and give the mayor's son not just a clean slate, but a glistening, red, white and blue slate.

All happy families resemble one another, but each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way? No, that is exactly wrong. Happy families are wildly, even eccentrically, diverse. But in every unhappy family, as any social worker can tell you, you will likely find the same dreary woes: dead love, physical or psychological brutality, alcoholism, infidelity, poverty. The forthcoming White House tax plan is pure simplicity. It will transfer the tax burden from the wealthy to the workers, from families with high earnings to those in the middle.

I want to wear a little American flag on my lapel in solidarity with the troops, while I besmirch every value they are dying for. Tom Friedman, New York Times. A superpower that announces a goal and gives up without achieving it will not be super for long. In the end, Nixon and Kissinger added five years to the length of the Vietnam War, and we lost it anyway. Did that add to our superpower credibility? Well, maybe. In the Kissingerian world of high strategy, a reputation for pigheaded stupidity can be almost as valuable as a reputation for wise persistence. What could be more credible than a reputation for staying the course no matter how disastrous it turns out to be? (Dressing up an opinion by calling it a \"value\" confers) two big advantages in the propaganda war. First, a value just seems inherently more compelling than a mere opinion. That's a big head start. Second, the holder of a value is automatically more sensitive to slights than the holder of an opinion. An opinion can't just slug away at a value. It must be solicitous and understanding. A value may tackle an opinion, meanwhile, with no such constraint. It's fine if religion influences your moral values. But, when you make public arguments, you have to ground them--as much as possible--in reason and evidence, things that are accessible to people of different religions, or no religion at all. Otherwise, you can't persuade other people, and they can't persuade you. In a diverse democracy, there must be a common political language, and that language can't be theological.

First book -- \"The Borowitz Report--The Big Book of Shockers,\" a series of Onion-like essays by the author of \"Who Moved My Soap?\" BEHIND THE MUSINGS On August 26 I promised Notebook readers an explanation why that day's column was a quick and dirty run-down of \"man jokes\" making their way around the Internet: Wednesday (Aug. 25) at a little before 2 p.m., a column I'd been working on all day and been setting up for several days before that, fell through. I'll explain fully on this blog in a few weeks, I expect, but for now, the basic reason the column fell through was that a close relative of someone I'd spoken to at length Wednesday morning called to plead with me, not unreasonably, to hold off writing about that interview even though he'd helped me set it up Tuesday afternoon. I agreed. There are times when the public's right to know trumps an individual's desire to control the release of personal stories and private information, but this, trust me, isn't one of them. Though my first obligation as a columnist is to my readers, I sometimes have to balance that obligation with an application of the golden rule: Am I treating my sources and subjects as I would hope to be treated? When it comes to private citizens or private matters, it seems to me that people have the right to change their minds and have information postponed or withheld, even when it screws up my day royally. Now it can be told: The column was an in-hospital interview with Studs Terkel, the 91-year-old legend who took a terrible fall on the stairs in his Lakeview home July 4 and was often said, obliquely, to be in terrible shape, days from death. He was recovering, however. Very slowly, but very obviously. He had a hard time talking and staying awake when I spent about 90 minutes at his bedside, tape recorder going, but got off some excellent reflections about death, life and the election. He was eager, even grateful, to talk to me. But his son, Dan, who'd helped me set up the interview, had strong second thoughts when I called him to ask where readers should send cards and letters. Now isn't the time, he said. The recovery is still day-to-day. Studs was in no shape to make the decision to be interviewed. Studs went home shortly thereafter and, when I went to pay strictly a friendly call a little more than a week ago, he looked to be in good shape -- back in his trademark red gingham shirts, able to chat and reminisce gloriously. After that visit, friends relayed a message to me -- the Terkels were concerned I was planning to write a column about my visit. I assured them, back through friends, that of course I'd announce my intentions and get clearance and bring a notebook and tape recorder if I were on the job. In the back of my mind, though, I knew that Studs has too many writer/journalist friends to expect that news -- especially good news -- about his condition would remain my exclusive. And in fact when I went online Friday in Pittsburgh to see what was in the Chicago papers, I saw that Carol Marin had devoted her Sun-Times column to describing her recent visit to the home of the newly hale Studs Terkel. \"It didn't go through me,\" Dan Terkel said when I called to ask how the family's frantic reluctance to avoid publicity had turned into a Sun-Times column in just a couple of days. That's your inside baseball for today. And the important bottom line is that Studs is mending remarkably and very focused on completing his next (never say last!) book. FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 2004 updated at noon YOUR MOST MEMORABLE HOLIDAY GIFT OK, Notebook readers. It's time for you to rise to the seasonal occasion. Every year, as you may know, my columnist colleague Mary Schmich and I co-host a series of winter-holiday caroling parties in the Old Town School of Folk Music auditorium. We're both amateur musicians--I play a variety of stringed instruments in the hillbilly style and Mary plays a very impressive barroom piano - and we surround ourselves on stage with real talent from the Old Town School staff. Songsheets provided, all proceeds to charity, fine details here. Ticket sales are brisk this year - they always are. The program is \"less `Mighty Wind' than you might think,\" as Mary has put it, and we get lot of repeat business. But entries to our \"most memorable holiday gift of your childhood\" story contest have been coming in slowly. Very slowly. Very, very slowly. We hope that the main reason for the sluggish public response to this contest -- winners get a pair of tickets to \"Songs of Good Cheer\" and the chance to read their stories and help lead a song from the stage --- is that we announced it only once, on Halloween, three days before the presidential election. Reader's minds were not yet on their misty memories of the winter holidays. Now, though, as we creep close to the Dec. 1 deadline for entries, we hope they are. We're asking for short--300 words max--essays that answer the question: What was your most memorable childhood holiday gift? And why? The tale can be heart-rending, hilarious or just plain weird. Reply to [email protected] or, if you wish to compose in longhand on the finest parchment, to Mary Schmich, Chicago Tribune, 435 N. Michigan Ave., Chicago, IL 60611. And if you don't feel like entering, come sing with us anyway. Mary sticks around afterwards and autographs programs, which you can then try to sell on e-Bay for thousands. I'm totally disgusted by the lack of news judgment and proportion at WLS-Ch. 7, which last night during its 10 p.m. newscast devoted several minutes to a ridiculously insignificant little accident on the ground at O'Hare: The wing of a taxiing plane scraped the side of a service vehicle. Three people suffered minor injuries. Anything slightly out of the ordinary at our airports sends local television news departments into wild frenzies, something I attribute to TV's primitive attitude toward flight. Every time a commercial airliner has minor engine trouble or hits major turbulence, news minivans race to the airport for live reports and interviews with passengers as though, 101 years after Kitty Hawk, they have finally confirmed their superstition that humans are not meant to fly. What else but vestigial disbelief that airplanes do not drop from the sky of their own weight could have inspired Channel 7 to completely ignore major news out of Springfield on the issue of stem-cell research, the mad cow scare and the troubling rise in the theft of manhole covers among actual news stories? The reality is that this governor almost always refuses to take a public stand on anything controversial until the last possible minute. ...(He) obviously doesn't like to get out in front of anything that could tarnish his image. From SBC, to ComEd to the gaming bills, he has allowed the General Assembly to take the lead on all of the unpopular decisions. What does Illinois AG Lisa Madigan have to say about whether Chicago should and will own a casino? \"Not up to me,\" she said. She is the chief legal officer of the State of Illinois. She ran as the \"people's lawyer and people's advocate.\" She almost single-handledly beat back the forces that would have placed a casino in Rosemont, yelling mob ties, mob ties and saying the Gaming Board wasn't doing its job. Attorney General Lisa Madigan pulled the plug on a casino deal, critiqued the Gaming Board and offered advice to legislators on how to get \"a quick infusion,\" of casino revenue by \"de-activating a casino license\" and issuing a new license. Now, when Mayor Daley says he wants Chicago to own a casino in his city and Governor Blagojevich straddles the issue- the people's eyes all look to AG Madigan, and she says, \"Not up to me.\" A common criticism of Web logs is that they deal in banalities - the everyday occurrences in everyday lives -- and are therefore both self-indulgent and dull. Yet while some, perhaps many, are dull, it's not necessarily the subject matter. The everyday occurrences in everyday lives can be fascinating. Ira Glass, the Chicago-based genius behind public radio's \"This American Life\" proves it nearly every week. If you like that program, you may like \"The Story of Why,\" a brutally honest blog by \"Gladys Cortez,\" the pseudonym of West Garfield Park woman. I won't even try to describe it and can't link directly to it on orders from above due to concerns about strong language.

David Letterman CORRECTION Yesterday, in writing about the coffee-shop controversy, I mistakenly referred to the Bad Ass Coffee Co. as the Big Ass Coffee Co. Big Ass, of course, is the brand of ham that David Letterman occasionally presents to his guests, and is not affiliated in any way with Bad Ass coffee, though I'm sure they would go well together. And in both instances, \"ass\" refers to a donkey, of course. I have one last thought somewhat related to this topic, and it comes in the form of a question: Does the name Fuddruckers on the chain of hamburger restaurants strike you as somehow inappropriate --a sniggering, little child \"what'd I say? what'd I say?\" name mean to evoke...? Or is it just me? MILLER v. TRIGG Capitol Fax publisher Rich Miller e-mails me that he doesn't choose to get into a public spitting match with Illinois Libertarian party head Jeff Trigg, who slagged Miller good in a recent Web posting. Miller send along this link and this link, both of which suggest a personal dimension to the feud. But these postings don't change the answer to question that Trigg poses and answers in the affirmative: Was Miller unfair in his recent characterization of Ill. Sen. Steve Rauschenberger's (R.- Elgin) efforts to aid fellow Republicans during the recent campaign? In this morning's e-mail came a request for answers from a graduate student preparing a research paper for a journalism class. Here are her questions and my answers: If bloggers shun traditional ethics codes, what are they following? Perhaps they have their own code of ethics that can be defined. What are these codes? You make a mistake the moment you try to generalize about bloggers. There are 4.7 million blogs out there now, by Technorati's count, and they run the gamut. You might as well as ask about the ethics of people who express their thoughts in e-mail. The better bloggers strive for fairness, accuracy and transparency--the exact same standards that fall under the rubric of \"traditional ethics.\" I would like to find out if the majority of bloggers have any conventional journalism training. Have certain bloggers been trained in traditional journalism? The majority, surely not. Certain bloggers, though, yes, have come up through conventional journalism channels -- Andrew Sullivan, Dan Kennedy, Dan Weintraub, Jeff Jarvis, Howard Kurtz, Josh Marshall, David Corn and Charlie Madigan, to name a few--and still publish frequently in conventional journalism outlets. Other popular bloggers have come up through (and still work in) academia -- the Volokh Conspiracy team, Dan Drezner, Duncan Black(\"Atrios\") and Glenn Reynolds come quickly to mind-- an area that provides training in how to research and write accurate and reliable material. But I'd add quickly that training in traditional journalism (or academia) is neither a prerequisite for or a guarantee of the practice of sound, compelling journalism. Most importantly, given the immediacy of the internet, how has this changed mainstream journalism? Are bloggers limiting mainstream journalists' ability to be objective and balanced? I don't see bloggers limiting anyone or anything. They've proven to be a strong, usually independent force with an ability to play a role in shaping the conventional news agenda. Do you think younger people, maybe Generation X or Y, rely on bloggers for the news instead of traditional media outlets? Do people who rely on traditional media believe that bloggers lack credibility because of the kind of ethics (or lack thereof) they follow? Why do you think the younger group relies on bloggers instead of the traditional media for news? My gut feeling, based on no data, is that younger readers are particularly comfortable with the blog format and use it as, among other things, a useful portal to traditional media outlets. Having grown up in the Internet age, they're less likely to generalize about the entire medium and more likely both to understand that there are reliable and unreliable blogs out there, and to know how to identify high-quality blogs. To the extent that younger readers go more often or even first to blogs, I suspect it's because they enjoy the commentary and perspective with which good bloggers frame the news. Remember, nearly every decent blog relies heavily on \"traditional media,\" quoting from it and linking to it promiscuously. So it's a mistake to see these two sources of news as separate when, in fact, they are complementary. Which ethical code gets violated the most by bloggers and why? On the evening of the election, bloggers published early exit-poll results suggesting that John Kerry had a strong lead. The premature data turned out to be wrong. How often does a blogger's story like this one turn out to be wrong? Given important issues like this one, what impact do these errors have on the public, and the blogger's credibility? What happens to bloggers when ethical implications and accuracy is disregarded? Does anything? In traditional news media, this stuff wouldn't fly as we found out with the violations committed by Jayson Blair and Dan Rather. These had serious repercussions. The exit poll data was forwarded along by bloggers, but it was being published by such venerable old online news outlets as Slate. So let's not point the finger at bloggers for the release of that data. Let's also not accuse the bloggers (or Slate) of being \"wrong.\" The reports reliably transmitted data from the exit pollsters and, in every case I know of, cautioned that the figures showing Kerry with a strong lead were premature. Bloggers have nothing to be ashamed of regarding election day, 2004. How often are bloggers wrong? That's very hard to quantify because, not to get too Bill Clinton on you, but it depends on what the meaning of \"wrong\" is. Take, for example, the rumors that flew around cyberspace earlier this year that the John Kerry campaign was about to be decimated by a sex scandal. Sites such as Drudgereport were quick to report on those rumors but (as I recall) were careful to couch them as rumors. Does the existence of a rumor qualify as news? Bloggers tend to say yes -- \"news\" is anything that has an impact on the conduct of important people (in this case, the scrambling of Kerry's staff to contradict the reports and un-do any damage done among voters and donors). Conventional media tends to say no -- that there's a self-referential, circular and therefore potentially very damaging quality to such a low standard for news; it contains no check on the dissemination of wholly unsubstantiated lies and misrepresentations. And while bloggers often lower their standards to float partial or unsupported reports (hmmm, sound like any newspaper gossip columns you know?), they also generally offer quick corrections and clarifications when they're wrong. The coin of the realm in the blogosphere is credibility. Lose it and you lose readers. Acquire it, keep it, build it, and readers come back. Bloggers are starting to get recognized as members of the press. For the first time, The Democratic National Convention had agreed to issue press credentials to \"credentialed bloggers.\" When those independent, \"less credentialed\" bloggers got snubbed from the DNC, they went a step further and asked their readers to donate money to fund a trip so they could cover the convention. How common is this practice? Are readers willing to donate? Is this ethical? Even some of the credentialed bloggers asked their readers to help cover expenses for covering both the campaign and the conventions. Some have long had Pay-Pal \"tip jars\" on their sites, the equivalent of voluntary subscription payments. The more poplar bloggers now are making decent money with advertising on their sites. Whenever any writer is being paid for his work, the potential for compromising conflicts and ethical dilemmas sticks its nose in the door. So the proper question here, if I might be so bold, is not whether money / sponsorship issues can or has influenced blogs, but whether it seems to be a particular problem in blogs as opposed to other forms of media. And I think the answer is no--that independent bloggers are not tailoring their message to curry favor with sponsors or editing themselves to maintain good relations with their patrons. I'll be shutting down the Notebook for Thanksgiving week. See you again on Monday, Nov. 29. THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 2004 updated at 1 p.m. THE GRILLED CHEESE \"MIRACLE\" -- FOUR QUESTIONS Concerning the story about the 10-year-old grilled cheese sandwich that purportedly bears the image of the Virgin Mary I ask this: If this combination of overcooked and undercooked butter does, in fact, resemble the image of a woman, what about is suggests the Virgin Mary? Host Jay Marvin of WLS-AM (890) noted Wednesday that the face-like pattern looks more like Nicole Brown Simpson than any image he's ever seen of Mary. I'm seeing maybe pop star Madonna, actress Carol Kane or breezy Sun-Times columnist Paige Wiser. Point is, we don't have any real idea what Mary looked like. Isn't all the carrying on over the sandwich perilously close to idol worship? Given the vast and no doubt very impressive opportunities for miraculous deeds available to an omnipotent diety, why would God resort to such a peculiar, dare I say cheesy little parlor stunt like forming what sorta looks a face on a sandwich? If some supernatural force did contrive to create the image of the Virgin Mary on a grilled cheese sandwich, who is to say which force did so or for what good or evil purpose? Z-MAIL Jim -- Regarding Bad Ass Coffee, I don't understand why anyone needs to use crude language or behavior to make a profit. Certainly coffee could be sold successfully under a different name, correct? I am a father of two young boys, and I have lived in Antioch for five years. Why do my kids need to be exposed to this language as their school bus passes the store's sign? I'm no saint, but I do make a point of speaking and acting \"cleanly\" in the presence of children, etc. I expect others to extend this common decency as well. The Big Ass Coffee Co. folks want to know what you think of the name. Click here for a feedback form. JUST DON'T SPILL YOUR CHEERIOS ON IT For years, futurists have been telling us that someday, we'll be reading our daily newspapers at the breakfast table on flexible, mobile computer display screens that resemble paper. \"It's finally time to start believing it,\" writes David Pescovitz at TheFeature.com. On a new prototype \"the screen is about as thin as a human hair, enabling it to be rolled up into a tube with a radius of one centimeter.\" Hunters soon may be able to sit at their computers and blast away at animals on a Texas ranch via the Internet.... A controversial Web site, already offers target practice with a .22 caliber rifle and could soon let hunters shoot at deer, antelope and wild pigs, site creator John Underwood said on Tuesday. The Humane Society of the United States and the Fund for Animals issued a joint news release saying that they are \"appalled\" by this idea. \"We'd like to think that this is just a half-baked idea or a hoax, but when it comes to canned hunts, we're rarely surprised by the level of depravity that can be reached,\" said Heidi Prescott, national director of The Fund for Animals. Wayne Pacelle, president and CEO of The Humane Society of the United States added: \"This is a snuff film scenario in which animals will be senselessly killed for the voyeuristic pleasure of someone sitting at a keyboard. It is pay-per-view slaughter. This bizarre plan should be shut down and outlawed immediately.\" I PREFER TO CALL HIM \"MISTER DEMENTO,\" THANK YOU VERY MUCH My insistence that Condoleezza Rice's Ph.D. does not entitle her to be called \"Dr. Rice\" outside of the academy has drawn such a strong response pro and con that I'm putting the question to a click poll. Election Day was a triumph for conservatism, but it may have been a mixed blessing for the people who yak about it on TV and radio. Conservative talk, by far the most popular kind on the airwaves, has always traded on an undercurrent of grievance, a sense of being the underdog against the implacable, oppressive forces of liberal \"elitism.\" The farther conservatives were from power, the better the Us-vs.-Them model worked. And David Corn, Washington editor for the Nation, writes The Bush years have been very good for us. Circulation has almost doubled--from mid-90,000 to nearly 170,000. (For comparison--I'm not gloating--The New Republic is below 70,000, The conservative Weekly Standard is about 65,000. And the right-wing National Review, last I checked, was 155,000.) As our publisher Victor Navasky has repeatedly quipped over the years, \"What's bad for the country is good for The Nation.\" DEFERRED AMENDMENTS, A SERIOUS PROPOSAL I believe that there's significant merit in the idea that we should amend the Constitution to allow foreign-born citizens of the United States to run for President. But I believe it's a terrible idea to amend the Constitution in order to allow one person - be it California's Austrian-born Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, or Michigan's Candian-born Democratic Gov. Jennifer Granholm --- to seek the presidency. It's so disgraceful and so dangerous to amend the Constitution in response to one political figure that this proposed amendment--- heck, all proposed amendments -- ought to have a 20-year fuse on it: The amendment will not take effect until 20 years after it is fully ratified and adopted. Such an idea would act something like the late philosopher John Rawls' \"Veil of Ignorance,\" in that it would encourage those tampering with the document to look beyond its impact on today's cast of characters in the news and consider only the long-term effects. It also might allow Congress to seriously consider the excellent idea of limiting U.S. Supreme Court justices to 15-year terms. Miller, who writes the syndicated Capitol Fax column, is under fire in the blog world from Jeff Trigg, executive director of the Libertarian Party of Illinois, who here seeks to correct the record on Miller's semi-retracted attack on state Sen. Steve Rauschenberger. I get the feeling these two don't like one another. PUBLIC INDECENCY, PART I In the aftermath of the weird, racy \"Desperate Housewives\" promotion that preceded \"Monday Night Football\" this week on ABC, the Federal Communications Commission says it is reviewing a raft of complaints before deciding whether to launch an investigation. How might we expect that to go? Blogger Jeff Jarvis recently filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the FCC and came away outraged by the flimsiness of the pretexts that drive the agency: The latest big fine by the FCC against a TV network -- a record $1.2 million against Fox for its \"sexually suggestive\" Married by America -- was brought about by a mere three people who actually composed letters of complaint. Yes, just three people. ... Because the complaints were sent to multiple individuals at the FCC, it turns out there actually were only 90 complaints...from only 23 individuals (and) all but two of them were virtually identical. In other words, one person took the time to write a letter and 20 other people then photocopied or merely emailed it to the FCC many times.... So in the end, that means that a grand total of three citizens bothered to take the time to sit down and actually write a letter of complaint to the FCC.... And on the basis of that, the FCC decided to bring down the heavy hammer of government censorship and fine Fox an incredible $1.2 million for suggesting -- not depicting but merely suggesting -- sex on a show that had already been canceled because the marketplace didn't like it anyway. This is the respect the FCC gives to the American people and our First Amendment. PUBLIC INDECENCY, PART II Following up on the controversy over the planned opening of a Bad Ass Coffee Co. franchise store in north suburban Antioch, I asked Notebook readers yesterday to vote where they placed the word \"Ass\" on my finely calibrated six-point scale of offensiveness, with 1 being not off color at all, 6 being extremely off color. Nearly 1,000 of you voted, and the overall result was 2.9, just a shade more polite than mildly off color. Complete results: 1. Not off color at all. I use it freely when speaking to the clergy and small, impressionable children-- 10% 2. Just slightly off-color. I use it nearly all settings, but with a slight pang because I know it's substandard-- 21% 3. Mildly off-color. I use it among friends but avoid it in formal writing and when speaking to strangers-- 51% 4.Off-color. I'm no prude, and I don't mind when others use it, but I do try to avoid the word and find other synonyms -- 12% 5. Very off-color. I never use it and shudder when I hear it. -- 4% 6. Extremely off-color and offensive. I never use it and think ill of those who do -- 2% For reference, in November, 2003, the word \"wussy\" scored a 2.6 on the 6-point offensiveness scale, in May of this year the word \"scumbag\" scored a 2.8, and in February, \"fart\" scored a 3.3. Numerous correspondents have suggested that, apropos of franchises with icky names, I conduct a similar poll on the word \"hooters.\" FINE HEADLINES I can't decide which I think is more clever: The Trib headline on the Bad Ass coffee story, \"Antioch shop's name spurs big brew-heehaw,\" or the Sun-Times' headline on the story of the injured buck that staggered into the airport, \"D'oh, a deer gets into O'Hare.\" WILL I EVER SHUTUP ABOUT FIREFOX? In time, yes. But this new, free Web browser (click here for easy installation instructions) has me accosting friends and strangers with a missionary's zeal, and publications all over seem to be in agreement. EJV -- One can only hope that when the University of Illinois student cartoonist gets back after being suspended for penning an ethnically insensitive cartoon, he publishes a cartoon showing the administration and his other critics asking their caricature Indian, Chief Illiniwek, to do his Sambo dance. KNOCK IT OFF WITH THE \"DOCTOR\" RICE, ALREADY Condoleezza Rice is not a doctor, numerous references to her in the media as \"Dr. Rice\" notwithstanding. Journalistic convention - which tracks with everyday usage and the common sense pursuit of clarity - is to use the title \"doctor\" for physicians only. Outside of the academy, we don't confer the title upon everyone who has earned a Ph.D., as Rice has. And so all references to her as \"Dr. Rice\" on TV and in print come off as disagreeably fawning and obsequious. Instead he suggests some very tough questions for her upcoming confirmation hearing, including: The president says it is \"cultural condescension\" to question \"whether this country, or that people, or this group, are 'ready' for democracy.\" Condescending, perhaps, but is it realistic? If, knowing what we now know about Iraq's weapons programs, you still think pre-emptive war was justified, what other nations might, by the same criteria, merit pre-emptive action? In 1991, the secretary of defense, explaining the unwisdom of regime change, said: \"Once you've got Baghdad, it's not clear what you do with it. It's not clear what kind of government you would put in place of the one that's currently there now. Is it going to be a Shiite regime, a Sunni regime or a Kurdish regime? Or one that tilts toward the Baathists, or one that tilts toward the Islamic fundamentalists? How much credibility is that government going to have if it's set up by the United States military when it's there? How long does the United States military have to stay to protect the people that sign on for that government, and what happens to it once we leave?\" Was Dick Cheney right? FOLLOWING UP... My wife accuses me of seldom following up on columns I've written. Well today, just to prove her wrong, I offer these updates: 1. On June 1, I wrote about the long, tortuous route to the creation of a World War II Memorial in Illinois. This week, John Reynolds of the State Journal-Register writes that the memorial \"will be finished in time for its dedication Dec. 4\" in Springfield's Oak Ridge Cemetery. 2. On June 12, 2003, I wrote about the allegations of a local family that Chicago Police Officer Donald Owsley was preying on a mentally incompetent man, attempting to get him to sign over considerable assets. Another family had previously leveled an almost identical charge. This week, as my colleague David Heinzmann reported, a civil trial is underway at the Daley Center to try to determine whether Owsley is \"a saint or a crook.\" Meanwhile, those plucky gumshoes at the CPD's division of internal affairs are still investigating Owsley, who remains on the payroll. 3. In June, 1997, I pondered the radio ads that said, \"Heart disease can have few, if any symptoms. It can strike anyone, any time, with no warning whatsoever. Truth is, sudden death may be the first and only symptom.\" Were ultra-fast cardiac scans really the miracle tool the frightening ads implied? It is, medical experts agree, an extraordinary time in cardiology. Depending on which way the scanning market goes, the nation could save a fortune on diagnostic tests, and medical care could be improved. Or expenses could soar and patients could be harmed. FINE LINES This is an eminently foolish book, by an old man for whom the life of the young has become a grotesque but tantalizing rumor. It is overdrawn, overlong, underconsidered, and filled with at least one forehead-slapping ay caramba per page. Dan Weil, attorney and former city building commissioner -- 64 WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 17, 2004 updated at 10:30 a.m. UTTERLY VULGAR, HIGHLY OFFENSIVE AND REPUGNANT COFFEE SHOP? Or just a cute double entendere? My colleague M. Daniel Gibbard's story today about the controversy in suburban Antioch over plans to open a Bad Ass Coffee Co. franchise in town quotes from a resolution passed Monday by the indignant village board: The shop's name is found to be utterly vulgar, to be highly offensive to the ordinary moral sensibilities of this community and to be repugnant to the entire concept of family values and traditional American ideals. Wow. That's some delicate community they have up there in Antioch. Or is it? Several times in the past I have deputized readers of the Notebook to rule on various edgy words so that we might rank them in order of offensiveness. The choices I offer in the click poll are always the same, no matter what the word, so today I poll the readership. On my six-point scale, how offensive do you find the word \"ass?\" See Thursday's blog (above) for the result. TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 16, 2004 updated at 12:38 p.m. Z-MAIL Dan Palmer, Evanston-- Regarding the story and your comment about the controversial comic strip published recently in the Daily Illini: Once again we have a demonstration of how it is OK to make offensive jokes about Jews. Imagine the reaction if the joke were changed to \" I wanted to tell a black joke, but I didn't want Darnell down at the bank to beat me with his lips.\" Jesse and Al would have been picketing the school, and the cartoonist, Matt Vroom would have been finishing his degree elsewhere. I appreciate and enjoy satire and believe that if somebody is not offended, it probably isn't very good. However, Vroom's joke, such as it was, was the type of joke I would expect to find in a newsletter from Matt Hale's group, not the Daily Illini. The realities of life, such as your response, dictate that, yes, Vroom was unwise to attempt to skewer bigots by turning them into caricatures. One of the most sly ethnic jokes I know goes like this: Q: What do you call a (offensive slang term for a member of the target group) with two PhDs? A: (offensive slang term for a member of the target group) The surface response to this joke is likely to be that the teller believes that, no matter how educated or accomplished, those who belong to the group seemingly targeted by this crude riddle will always be inferior and worthy of contempt. Actually, though, the joke is on the bigot. It lampoons the absurd, grotesque lengths to which his prejudices take him, and invites the listener to laugh at him, not with him. This was the edgy appeal of the Archie Bunker character in \"All in the Family\" - a program that was very controversial and somewhat misunderstood when it premiered in January, 1971--and was the point of Vroom's cartoon. Satire is tough. We had an editor in chief at the Tribune a while ago who used to caution us about our \"modest proposal\" columns - many people read quickly and take statements at face value. Even this morning, I've fielded a number of letters from readers informing me patiently that the F in \"FUBAR\" (Fouled-up Beyond All Recognition) does not stand for \"Fouled,\" as I wrote. BEHIND THE MUSINGS Today's column about the issue of bad language in \"Saving Private Ryan\" sprang from a glimmer of an idea I had that the 66 TV stations across the nation that didn't air the movie were being nervous ninnies because no one was really so prickly and stiff-necked as to file an actual complaint about such an obviously serious and important work of art. I realized that it was quite reasonable for local stations to be wary. The FCC standards in this area are both vague and subject to shifts in the cultural crossbreezes. This really isn't fair to anyone - not to the producers, to the broadcasters or to parents, all who whom deserve to know at the very least exactly how the rules will be applied. The American Family Association has a point: Given that FCC rulings are four-square against use of the f-word and imply strongly that context does not mitigate its fundamental indecency, then airing \"Saving Private Ryan\" with its 20-odd uses of same blatantly crossed the line. And if the agency doesn't rule against ABC and the affiliates that aired the movie, then its lines are arbitrary and provide no real protection or guidance for anyone. We do need such lines and they should be clearly drawn and enforced so we can at least know where to begin the debate on what is and isn't proper prime-time network fare. I see an analogy here to the immigration issue- really!--in that one of the reasons the political disputes are so raw and bitter is that we have failed to bring the letter of the law and common practice into accord. Until we enforce the laws we have, it's almost impossible to tell how those laws need to be changed. (The State Journal-Register weighs in here on the FCC's \"random administration of discipline.\") Firefox has won praise from some Internet experts for being more innovative than Microsoft's Internet Explorer and less susceptible to malicious programs that routinely attack the Microsoft browser. Firefox, they say, is a compact, free-standing browser designed to display Web pages rapidly while blocking pop-up ads and other unsolicited windows. Downloads of the new browser were running at the rate of a million a day last week. Fortune lists the pros and cons, but its article is favorable: Many say Firefox is also more fun to use (than Microsoft's Internet Explorer); it dazzles people with its user-friendly design. For instance, it includes so-called tabbed browsing to keep open multiple windows with different websites. You can even open your favorite ten sites each morning with a single mouse click. Want to block an ad? A single click does it. Search services from Google, Yahoo, Amazon, eBay, and Dictionary.com are built in. It's over. Our relationship just hasn't been working for a while, and now, this is it. I'm leaving you for another browser.... I know, I've tried breaking up before, and I've always come back, but that's because I couldn't find the right browser to move on with.... What I want is a browser that's strong and secure, one that handles the latest content and won't crash. I want transparency. I want code that actually means something. I have found just that. With Mozilla Firefox, at least I know where I stand. The code is open source, built from the ground up, clean -- not recycled. Information Week's Security Pipeline also gives Firefox the thumbs up, and Washington Post personal technology columnist Rob Pegoraro answered numerous reader questions about his enthusiasm for Firefox in his online chat the other day. During a recent six-week period, I conducted a small spyware experiment on my Windows computer. I kept track of days I opened Microsoft Internet Explorer. At the close of each day, I ran Spybot, a detection and prevention program. Here's what happened: On nearly every day I used Internet Explorer, I was infected with a new batch of malware -- spyware or adware. On days I used Mozilla Firefox for browsing and avoided IE, without exception I remained uninfected. Today's lesson from the Michael Sneed Famous Columnists School: WRONG: Kristin McQueary of the Daily Southtown reported Sunday that former GOP senatorial candidate Alan Keyes has has left Calumet City and bought a Loop condo, and is continuing with plans to help rebuild the state Republican party. RIGHT: Sneed hears former GOP senatorial candidate Alan Keyes has left Calumet City, bought a Loop condo, and has definitely decided to remain here to help build the GOP. Most tellingly, the Democratic leadership, which fielded thousands of lawyers to watch for election fraud across the country, isn't backing the blog-driven outcry that the election was stolen. That's because it wasn't. Democratic National Committee Chairman Terry McAuliffe has conceded as much. And so has David Wade, a spokesman for the Kerry campaign. \"I'd give my right arm for Internet rumors of a stolen election to be true,\" Wade said. \"But blogging it doesn't make it so.\" Amen. The flaw here is that this is not a \"blog-driven\" outcry. The major left-wing blogs - Daily Kos, Eschaton, Political Animal, Talking Points Memo, Bushlies, Matthew Yglesias, Tapped and so on (see here for links to these and more ) have not endorsed or promoted this outcry, which has its home on a few desperate Web sites and maintains its momentum not through blogs, but through frantic and frequently forwarded e-mails. FINE LINES Is there any trait more repulsive than the reading of sexual self-help books? This dark question emerges from the pages of \"She Comes First: The Thinking Man's Guide to Pleasuring a Woman,\" a new book that promises to \"solve the mystery of female satisfaction.\" The answer may surprise you: Yes, there's something more repugnant than reading this book. The most repulsive act imaginable...is to have written it. The story concerned the uproar over a cartoon published in the Daily Illini by a young artist with the irresistible name of Matt Vroom. Vroom, in an apparent attempt to make fun of those whose anti-Semitism inspires them to utter absurd slurs, featured a character saying that he was refraining from telling a \"Jew joke'' because he didn't want \"Isaiah down at the bank to beat me with his nose.'' This kind of over-the-top satire is very risky because of the inevitability that even some of those who appreciate the intent will find the execution offensive. We've known this since at least the early 1970s when Archie Bunker in all his florid yet amusing ignorance burst onto the pop cultural scene, yet we're destined to continue arguing about it. But, I'm sorry, anyone who has ever been the executive producer of Ricki Lake's degrading daytime celebration of all that is tawdry and grotesque in the human condition has no right to participate in such a debate, much less lecture anyone about \"setting examples.'' FIREFOX ON FIRE Friday's blog urged you to check out the new Firefox browser - a smart, sharp improvement on the dominant Internet Explorer. I'm not alone in my enthusiasm for this free product. Firefox displays an elegant simplicity within and without. Its toolbar presents only the basic browsing commands: back, forward, reload, stop, home....Anybody using Internet Explorer should switch to Firefox today. Seriously. Even if you've loaded every IE security update, Firefox will give you a faster, more useful view of the Web. Despite being a ``1.0'' release, Firefox is mature. And the breeding is good. It's the product of more than a thousand full-time engineers and volunteers and is based on the open-source Mozilla suite, which in turn has its roots in Netscape. Interested? I have posted an easy-to-follow series of directions on how to get started running Firefox at chicagotribune.com/firefox that my 14-year-old son clicked through without complaint in roughly 10 minutes. My cheat-sheet has yet to pass the Mom test -- can my somewhat techno-phobic mother follow the instructions? -- but I'll let you know. In sum, the advice to Moveon.org and other groups beating the drum for this cause is, well, move on. If we learned anything in the aftermath of the election of 2000 it's that rage over an allegedly stolen election cannot be channeled into votes in the next election. The left needs to look forward, not back, and if there's substance to these claims, I'm sure the army of Democratic lawyers marshaled for the Kerry cause will be more than able to handle it. FINE LINES Who were two of the most divisive political leaders in US history? Thomas Jefferson and John Adams. The bitterness of today's political discourse pales in comparison to the political duels of the 1790s and early 1800s. And the Democrats of 2004 ought to study the example of the Jeffersonian Republicans of the 1890s, who mounted a highly partisan, kick-ass opposition. The inevitable Gene Russianoff has appeared fully 46 times (this year in the New York Times), in pieces by 23 different writers. Russianoff is a \"staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, a transit advocacy group,\" a label The Times has slapped on him the way Homer glued \"gray-eyed goddess\" to Athena. Jeff Berkowitz at \"Public Affairs\" offers a rococo theory about how and why state Republican chair Judy Baar Topinka engineered the Alan Keyes candidacy in order to discredit the hard right wing of her own party. Dominic DiFrisco, publicist and Italian-American spokesman -- 71 Daniel Barenboim,Chicago Symphony Orchestra Music Director -- 62 FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 12, 2004 updated at 8:44 a..m. 41 SIMPLE STEPS TO IMPROVING YOUR LIFE You will thank me for this. Today, this blog offers to introduce you, free, to the wonders of \"tabbed browsing.\" In a normal Internet browser -- such as Internet Explorer, which the vast majority of Web surfers use -- you have to open each site separately, and switching between open browser windows usually requires two moves of the mouse and two clicks. A browser equipped with the tab feature allows you to open a cluster of sites all with one click -- for example, you could open the front pages of the Tribune, Los Angeles Times, Washington Post and New York Times all at once-- and to toggle between them with one click on the file-folder-like tabs at the top of the screen. It dramatically changes the way you use the Web. And the tabbed browser that many computer users are very big on right now is the recently released Firefox 1.0 from Mozilla (descendant of Netscape): \"I suggest dumping Microsoft's Internet Explorer Web browser, which has a history of security breaches. I recommend instead Mozilla Firefox,\" wrote Wall Street Journal computer columnist Walter Mossberg in September. \"It's not only more secure but also more modern and advanced, with tabbed browsing, which allows multiple pages to be open on one screen, and a better pop-up ad blocker than the belated one Microsoft recently added to IE.\" Firefox easily imports all your favorite links, stored passwords and other goodies from IE and so far I haven't found any Web sites that have trouble with Firefox (though anecdotes I've read online indicate that there are, so you shouldn't delete IE just yet). Last week I quoted Capitol Fax columnist Rich Miller's column in which he took Republican state senators Dave Syverson (Rockford) and Steve Rauschenberger (Elgin) to task for bringing Alan Keyes (Maryland) to Illinois to challenge Barack Obama (the People's Republic of Hyde Park) and then more or less standing back to watch the wreck unfold. So I feel obliged to quote Miller again this week as he offers a correction/clarification: I made a truly stupid error last week and missed several contributions from Sen. Dave Syverson and Sen. Steve Rauschenberger to Republican candidates this fall. I apologize for the error, but the money wasn't enough to completely change my point. THE PRIDE OF NORTHWESTERN Former Daily Northwestern ace columnist Kevin F. Sherry is the subject of \"The Kevin F. Sherry Sweater Project,\" a very funny Web site in which his friends Eric Torbenson and Stephen Lynch offer scathing critiques of the appalling sweaters in Sherry's closet. Hey look, it's Frogger, the sweater!.... When do I go back to being an Aztec wall hanging?.... That box of Triscuits that fell in an airplane toilet? Found it. This is a Web site you'll want to share with friends. Speaking of Northwestern, I've been telling Michigan fans in my circle to expect a very tough challenge from the Wildcats on Saturday in Ann Arbor. A Sun-Times sportswriter is picking the scrappy underdog NU team to beat UM 24-23, and I wouldn't bet against him. The bad news is that Ryan, a Tempo staff writer, is deeply wrong in her estimation of the \"best character \" on ABC's \"Desperate Housewives.\" Anyone else notice that the best character on \"Desperate Housewives\" is neither desperate nor a housewife? The level-headed Julie Mayer (Andrea Bowen), daughter of nervous divorcee Susan Mayer (Teri Hatcher), is by far the most appealing person on the hit show. In fact, though, the best and most appealing character on the program is Lynette Scavo (Felicity Huffman), the harried mother of demon twins and two other seldom seen children. Or, perhaps, if you listen to my wife Johanna, the best character is the icy neatnik, Bree Van De Kamp (Marcia Cross). Bree is the \"best\" character, Johanna says, while Susan and Julie together are the \"most appealing.\" What do the French say, you ask? Well, a French Web site devoted to the program polled its readership on their Personnages Pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9s and the R\u00e9ponses de tout le monde showed only 1 percent voted for Julie as best female character. Susan got 32 percent of the vote, Bree got 27 percent. Lynette got only 7 percent, but these are Jerry Lewis fans we're talking about here. Speaking of \"Desperate Housewives,\" one of the plot lines is the furtive affair that Gabriella Solis (Eva Longoria) is having with her teen gardener, a high-school student. The show plays it for laughs and the occasional sexy scene, even though, horrors! Gabriella is in a position of authority over the gardener. Yet I took some heat two years ago for the opinion I offered about Laurie Augustine, the library aide at Glenbard East High School who was charged with (and later sentenced to nine years in prison for) having sex with three 17-year-old male students. That story is back in the news this week as one of the young men has filed suit against Augustine for all the trauma she allegedly caused him because, you know, he was helpless coming back to her for sex again and again: First, with all due respect to high school library aides, I doubt they have sexually coercive authority over even the most delinquent borrowers. Second, these \"children\" are actually young men whom DuPage County State's Atty. Joe Birkett and most prosecutors would charge as adults in other circumstances. And third, because they are young men, I doubt very much that this \"abuse\" will be anything worse for them than a mixed memory--kinda sleazy on the one hand, kinda cool on the other. It's a drastic overreaction to charge the woman with felonies and publicly humiliate her husband and their six kids. Fire her, yes. Fooling around with students isn't cool. But suspend the students too. They also knew better. And kept it quiet. Yet if the sexes were reversed--a 41-year-old male library aide romping with female students--my frowns would be genuine. That situation intuitively seems worse to me for a variety of biological, social, cultural reasons. Critics may feel free to unload on me again, but consider this: A program featuring the inner lives of suburban husbands would never play for laughs a plot line in which one of them was having an affair with the family's teenage nanny or high-school maid. MAN YOUR TAPE DECKS! WXRT FM-93.1 is playing U2's brand new album, \"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\" over and over and over again today. AN EXPRESSION I NEVER WANT TO SEE AGAIN S-T gossip columnist Michael Sneed today referred to a celebrity \"chewing the yum-yum\" at a local restaurant. I find no evidence on google or the Nexis database that any writer anywhere has ever used these creepy words before to describe eating food. PASSING THE SNIFF TEST Slate offers the lengthiest and linkiest run-down of Ill. Atty. Gen. Lisa Madigan's argument yesterday to the U.S. Supreme Court that having drug-sniffing dogs check out the car of a speeder doesn't violate the Constitution's ban on unreasonable searches and seizures. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg asked whether police would be free to go up and down public streets with dogs, looking for illegal drugs. O'Connor wondered whether police could use the dogs to sniff inside a person's home. Madigan stood firm, forcefully arguing that police could use the dogs, without any evidence of criminal activity, on public streets or in parks or, even, around the outside of a person's home. I realize that dogs are low tech, but technology is getting better and better at metaphorically peering through walls, and it's disturbing to see an ostensibly liberal Democrat like Madigan willing to trample our expectations of privacy in order to preserve a lousy drug bust. \"Truth Girl,\" the anonymous local attorney who started writing the \"Truth About Keyes\" Web log shortly after untended Republican fire hose Alan Keyes entered the race for U.S. Senate in August, has decided to continue her noble work in cyberspace. Previously she'd indicated that, like an itinerant gunslinger in an old Western movie, she was about to announce \"my work here is done\" and ride off into the blogging sunset. But this morning came a most welcome letter: I have purchased www.truthgirl.com and will hopefully be live on Monday. I'm aiming for a two-part site. A 5-step plan for helping Democrats turn their evangelical friends and family members Democratic blue--complete with resources on specific issues, a history of evangelicalism; and directions on how to find an evangelical if you don't know one. A blog (probably less frequently updated than the Keyes blog was) that tracks the current issues being discussed by the religious right. As for my qualifications for offering an insider's view on the religious right: I am a Wheaton College grad; the daughter of a Bob Jones University grad and the daughter of Christian bookstore owners. I took every class on the history of evangelicalism that Wheaton had to offer and worked at a place called the Institute for the Study of American Evangelicals for 3 years. Eventually, I became a Democrat myself, which makes me feel qualified to explain how to convert someone. Finally, as I have had to explain my background to every single friend that I've made since moving to Chicago, I feel qualified to explain American evangelicals in lay language. There might be people more qualified than me on any of these topics, but since I was having fun blogging, I thought I would keep it up Every day now I get numerous e-mails from concerned to outraged Democrats wondering about the contention/rumor flying around the Web that the recent presidential election was stolen and suggesting I or the newspaper look into the charges. This is one of those allegations that, if true or provable, will rise no matter who ignores or tries to suppress it. And if it's false or completely improvable, it will die the slow death of any rumor. Look, the Democrats had thousands of lawyers ready to pounce on vote fraud issues and spent many many millions of dollars to win the presidency. They are in by far the best position to advance these claims. Yet, so far, they're not advancing them. Headline on a Tribune story about stick-up men preying on the Skyway toll plaza I know that there were nine others who tied me in this contest, but I still feel like I have been given a clear mandate. I want to reach out to all of the other contestants who share my views, and I will cooperate with the Tribune staff in scheduling our lunch as long as I pick the time and date. Once, you had to be a media or political person of a certain minimum altitude to be let in on (the early results of exit polls on election day). Now, all you need is a Net connection and rudimentary typing skills. Those who used to have the clubhouse all to themselves have found the door wide open to anyone and everyone. And some of them don't like it. Which, come to think of it, really is so 1997: Information formerly reserved for a cadre of insiders now spreads more quickly than those insiders can control it. In other words, the middlemen have been eliminated. (If you spent 100 large at business school, you call that \"disintermediation.\") Just took a bit longer to hit the Election Day carnival, that's all. Having spent Election Day in the fray ourselves, we'd advise our media pals to get over it -- the clubhouse door is off its hinges for good. Like countless businesses back in '97, they now need to shift their focus from imparting information people already have to providing analysis people need. As a blue state type liberal, I'd rather pay my taxes and know that there is a real safety net out there than have to fund everything on my own. I can't do the homeless, the medically needy, the abused, the hungry, the foreign aid, the environment and the arts all on my own. Journalists sometimes refer to a newspaper as \"the daily miracle,\" an expression that I'd never fully appreciated until last night when I toured the Tribune's Freedom Center printing plant for the first time. Touring a printing facility had always seemed to me like a grade-school field trip, so, jaded and mature fellow that I am, I'd passed on several opportunities over the last 20 years to see the presses roll. But I found it awe inspiring to witness the power and vastness of the machinery that takes the digitized work of all the writers, editors and photographers in our newsroom and, in a few short hours, turns it into a massive ink-on-paper product that ends up on hundreds of thousands of doorsteps. It seems like each one ought to cost 50 bucks, not 50 cents. The question it left me with - a question for which I have no answer - is whether this highly computerized, highly efficient process is the final, nearly perfect realization of how 20th century technology can create a 20th century product, or whether it's simply another step along the way of streamlining an enduring delivery mechanism between journalists and their audience. Much smarter people than I am about all this say newspapers as we know them will never die - that people will always want to hold the product in their hands, clip it, slide it across the breakfast table, tuck it under their arm on the way out the door and curl up with it on the sofa. But the history of technology is seldom kind to those who say \"never.\" My tour was part of \"Greet the Press,\" a United Way benefit event where Mary Schmich and I took questions from an audience that nearly filled the meeting room, to our great relief. Jack O'B., Lemont -- A current TV commercial shows a sweet, affectionate, fatherly man who has just purchased cell phones for his teenage daughters. His wife is standing by to translate his generosity and paternal love into terms the spoiled brats can understand. When Dad hands the kids their cell-phones and tells them that they can all talk together as a family now, they look at him like he's a repulsive cretin from Mars, but when Mom adds that they can talk to their friends all they want, they leap up smiling in relief and hug Mom. Dad, grinning sheepishly, says, \"Ok! Group hug!\" Ignoring him completely, Mom and the girls run out of the room together, leaving Dad standing there like a whipped cur, arms hanging at his sides, with a pathetic expression on his face. \"Call me sometime?\" he implores, but they are gone without so much as a thank you or goodbye. Why this commercial bothers me so much I can't quite put my finger on, but I find it extremely offensive. It's not funny. It's not \"cute.\" If they were my kids, they'd be confined to their rooms on bread and water with no TV and no phone for a month-and-a-half. I don't even want to get into what I would say to my wife for not backing me up. She could have at least demanded of the snotty, self-centered ingrates an obligatory Thanks, Daaaaad. Help me out here, professor, will ya? Am I over-reacting? Am I getting sensitive to male bashing in my old age? Do I just not get the joke here about modern family values? The Dads are Dorks theme runs throughout advertising. And while I don't trouble myself to get wroth over it, I certainly agree that this particular commercial does not make me want to rush out and buy my kids anything , let alone a cell phone. Readers? Elyse M. -- Your Tuesday column presented interesting statistics on how people's views on homosexuality have changed. Perhaps some day the majority of people, in their states' referendums, will vote in favor of sanctioning gay marriages. And that is the way it should be--the people voting on this issue rather than the courts stuffing it down our throats. What I've never understood is why the legal arrangements two consenting adults wish to make regarding the definition of their relationship in the eyes of the law constitutes \"stuffing\" anything down anyone's throat. To me, this sounds like griping that because your neighbor chooses to worship in a different fashion from you, the laws allowing him do so amount to stuffing his faith down your throat. Mind your own business, Elyse. It's the American way. Sally H., Valparaiso -- I was struck by your use Tuesday of the Martin Luther King Jr.'s quote, \"the arc of history is long, but it bends toward justice,\" because I had just come across it yesterday for the first time. I checked and found that King was quoting the 19th century Unitarian preacher and abolitionist Theodore Parker of Boston when he used these words in a speech in March 1965 in Montgomery, Alabama. Not a big deal, but I thought you might be interested to know this . I'm always interested in quotation-related information, as so many of the best ones get distorted and misattributed as they make their way around. King evidently was paraphrasing and truncating Parker, whose original quote is wise but not particularly pithy: Look at the facts of the world. You see a continual and progressive triumph of the right. I do not pretend to understand the moral universe; the arc is a long one, my eye reaches but little ways; I cannot calculate the curve and complete the figure by the experience of sight; I can divine it by conscience. And from what I see I am sure it bends towards justice. Things refuse to be mismanaged long. MISSED IT BY THAT MUCH! No brag just fact: Tom Bevan and John McIntyre of RealClearPolitics.com have posted a side-by-side comparison of their pre-election Electoral College map prediction and the actual result. Pretty eerie. The vastness of red-state territory on such maps make it look like the blue states represent a literal and figurative fringe element in society But here is what the electoral map looks like when you adjust the size of the states for population. Speaking of maps, this map showing the slave vs. free states prior to the Civil War has been making the rounds, often wryly juxtaposed with the recent blue/red electoral map. (Here is some arguing about what it means and doesn't mean, via \"Austin Mayor.\") Though I cheerfully offer these maps up for your perusal and reflection, they seem to me to add to the sense of national polarization: The idea that, say, Minnesota and Iowa are significantly opposed politically because Minnesota is a blue state and Iowa is a red state vastly, even poisonously overstates the case. This is yet another reason that I find myself flopping my position on the Electoral College system. I flipped from against to for many years ago, believing that the system now in place was the best way to prevent the nation from breaking into numerous strident factions, each with its own presidential candidate. The biggest deterrent to small parties is the reluctance of most Americans to cast a ballot for someone who can't win, and the Libertarians and Greens will face that same obstacle even under a new system. Besides, the danger looks greatly exaggerated. What causes partisan fractionalization in other countries is a parliamentary system of government, particularly if it's combined with proportional representation--neither of which is in prospect here. Direct popular election, keep in mind, is the universal norm in other American elections, yet there has been no proliferation of minor parties in races for governor, state representative or sheriff. If this approach works at the state and local level, there's no reason to think it wouldn't work equally well in a national election. That argument as well as the utterly ridiculous focus that the presidential candidates placed on just a few swing states in the final weeks of the election have prompted me to flop back to opposing the current system. I was against it and for it before I was against it, in other words. There is already speculation that Hillary Clinton will be the nominee for the Democrats in 2008. Well, you have to admire the dedication of the Democratic Party. They just lost an election and they're already hard at work planning to lose the next one. Bill Maher Sign your name. Your real name. Not \"Dr. Bigstuff\" or whatever swashbuckling pseudonym you tremble behind while hurling spitballs. Mary Schmich, offering advice today on how to write good hate mail. The Social Security's fascinating Web site also gives you the most popular names on a state-by-state basis. For example, the most popular name for girls in West Virginia last year was Madison, while the No. 1 baby name for boys in Utah 2003 was, surprisingly enough, Twista. (All right, it was actually Ethan, but how much more fun would it be if it really was Twista?) As far as I can tell, there's no truth to the rumor that if Mary Schmich and I get a lousy turn-out at tonight's \"Greet the Press\" charity event at Freedom Center, our overlords will see us as losers and replace us with the column-writing tag team of Dennis Byrne and Teri O'Brien. It's from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m., includes a tour of the printing plant and a deluxe reception (I have no idea what the reception will be like, but, to me, bottled water and coffee are deluxe so I feel safe in making this promise) as well as a chance to ask Mary Schmich whatever you've been dying to ask her. Tickets are available at the outrageously low price of $30. E-mail [email protected] or call 312-527-8800. It's festival seating, so be on time! WE ARE TRULY A DIVIDED PEOPLE Last week's click poll asked: If you peeked in Tuesday afternoon on any of the scores of Web sites that were posting what the exit polls were saying....do you feel misled? ...do you wish those who know such information would withhold it from you? ...will you look for exit-poll numbers on the Web on Election Day, 2008? Forty-seven percent of nearly 500 respondents said yes, they felt misled. Thirty-four percent said they wished that those who knew such numbers would withhold them. And only 51 percent said they'd seek out exit poll numbers four years from now. These were the most closely decided click polls in a long time. In order to promote healing and bridge the gap between yes and no, I'd enjoy hearing from some of you who felt misled: What, exactly, was misleading about what you read? Every site I was looking at carefully draped the numbers with caveats and disclaimers. And I'd like to hear from those who want such information withheld from them: Is yours an expression of personal weakness? Or a desire to have the media withhold the information from everyone . And from those who say they won't look for those numbers in `08, I've gotta know: Are you for real? If someone says, at 2 p.m. on Election Day, \"hey, Slate.com has the latest exit polls on the race,\" will you really resist? If so, you are a stronger person than I. MONDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 2004 updated at 5:10 a..m. RED STATE FAMILY VALUES Instead of picking on gay people, those pushing for a Constitutional amendment seeking to protect the institution of marriage in America ought to call for the deannexation of the Bible Belt. Writing in the Boston Globe, William V. D'Antonio, a visiting research professor at Catholic University in Washington, D.C.,offers this evidence: The Associated Press, using data supplied by the U.S. Census Bureau, found that the highest divorce rates are to be found in the Bible Belt. The AP report stated that \"the divorce rates in these conservative states are roughly 50 percent above the national average of 4.2 per thousand people.\" The 10 Southern states with some of the highest divorce rates were Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Texas. By comparison nine states in the Northeast were among those with the lowest divorce rates: Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont..... For all the Bible Belt talk about family values, it is the people from (Sen. John) Kerry's home state (of Massachusetts), along with their neighbors in the Northeast corridor, who live these values. Indeed, it is the \"blue\" states, led by Massachusetts and Connecticut, that have been willing to invest more money over time to foster the reality of what it means to leave no children behind. And they have been among the nation's leaders in promoting a living wage as their goal in public employment. The money they have invested in their future is known more popularly as taxes; these so-called liberal people see that money is their investment to help insure a compassionate, humane society. Family values are much more likely to be found in the states mistakenly called out-of-the-mainstream liberal. What Eric Zorn said - or wrote, rather - is that even though many people had asked Eric Zorn if he thought record-setting, perennial and graceless loser Alan Keyes was a likely candidate to take over the then-vacant slot of permanent WLS morning host, Eric Zorn thought this was very unlikely. Now that veteran morning duo Don and Roma Wade have signed a new contract and are back on the air at WLS as of this morning, Eric Zorn is ever more certain. Equally unlikely, Eric Zorn believes, is that Keyes will be as good as his word and stay in Illinois and fight to reform the Republican party. Some among the hard core want him to stay. Conservative strategist Tom Roeser of Park Ridge wrote enthusiastically of Keyes in his Saturday column in the Sun-Times: The fact that Keyes got 27 percent of the vote and 1.3 million votes and carried 10 counties, all Downstate, is amazing. And this without the support of the state GOP, which left him off its most expensive mailing! His vow to stay in Illinois and build up the grass roots is welcome news for a party that has been starving for the enthusiasm and fresh ideas he imparts. Actually, were he to stay it would be welcome news for Democrats, who should be so lucky as to have Keyes gallivanting around the state doing his Cotton Mather act in the name of the Republican party. But he'll be gone by Thanksgiving, I predict. And Capitol Fax columnist Rich Miller says that among the political corpses he'll leave in his wake is that of State Sen. Steve Rauschenberger, who must bear responsibility for being one of first major proponents of importing Keyes from Maryland: Rauschenberger is telling everyone who will listen that he wants to run for governor in 2006. The man who brought us Keyes and then did almost nothing to help his fellow Republicans survive the resulting Democratic landslide claims he can bring the party's feuding moderate and conservative wings together. So far, Rauschenberger has been all talk and no action. Unless he changes his ways, all those fawning newspaper editorial board members ought to take a closer look at their former darling. Eric Zorn would like Keyes to stay here primarily because Truth Girl, an anonymous lawyer who started up the \"Truth About Keyes\" blog when he became a candidate, has said she will quit her blog when Keyes quits Illinois. And Eric Zorn has developed kind of a thing for Truth Girl. WHO'S TALLER, ZORN OR SCHMICH? One way to find out is to join Mary and me from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. Nov. 9 at \"Greet the Press,'' an event at our Freedom Center printing plant benefiting United Way. It's for a good cause, we promise not to sing and we promise that we'll tell you what Amy Dickinson is really like. Tickets are $30 and they include a reception and a tour of the Freedom Center. Reserve by emailing [email protected] or calling 312-527-8800. FINE LINES And while all Americans can take some pride in the racial progress African Americans have made in recent years, what whites--and indeed blacks--really want is for the whole awful nightmare to be behind them. The ultimate proof that we have finally done so would be for a black person to be elected president of the United States. In Barack Obama or Colin Powell, whites, giddily, begin to see not only figures who can command both white and black votes but also the promise of a real racial unity. Their candidacies are thrilling because they carry with them the notion that the symbolic gap between the races may be beginning to close. What all this suggests is something religious conservatives know but resent: As a general rule, Americans think morality is a matter best left to personal choice, not government policy. Their attitude brings to mind the story about the pastor who got carried away trying to reform his flock, only to be admonished: \"Now you've left off preachin' and gone to meddlin'.\" (George Bush) forced his tax-cut package through without seeking any compromise with the Democrats. He ripped up the global warming treaty without offering any alternative.... He assembled an energy task force that listened to corporate executives but did not hear out environmentalists, and he refused to say who was working with it. After 9/11, he campaigned against Democrats and claimed they did not care about the nation's security. And in the 2004 campaign, he repeatedly lied about Kerry, mischaracterizing his positions, distorting his words, assailing him as weak. And he stood by as his allies launched unsubstantiated attacks on Kerry's military service and character. That is how he won: by mocking Kerry and hurling false charges against him. And now he says he wants to win over Kerry's supporters? It's a little late for that... Q. What's the difference between the Vietnam War and the Iraq War? A. George W. Bush had a plan to get out of the Vietnam War. A joke told on the \"A Prairie Home Companion\" joke show Saturday. WHAT WERE THEY THINKING? The Program on International Policy Attitudes takes a look here at survey data showing what was on the mind of the American electorate Tuesday regarding the war in Iraq: (There is) consensus among the American public that if Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction and was not providing substantial support to al Qaeda, the U.S. should not have gone to war with Iraq. Seventy-four percent overall have this view, including 58% of Bush supporters, 92% of Kerry supporters and 77% of the uncommitted-those who (had) not made a definite commitment to vote for one or the other candidate.... Despite the widely-publicized conclusions of the Duelfer report, 49% of Americans continue to believe Iraq had actual WMD (27%) or a major WMD program (22%), and 52% believe that Iraq was providing substantial support to al Qaeda. Oh well. FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 5, 2004 updated at 1:10 p..m. DO YOU FEEL MISLED? While it's true that the early exit polling on Tuesday suggesting a victory for John Kerry turned out to be misleading and a number of Web logs including this one posted those numbers early in the day, it's not accurate to say that bloggers got it wrong or to imply that eggy residue remains on their cheeks. Every site that posted such numbers (including Microsoft's Slate and this blog) urged caution and reminded readers that the numbers were just samples and had the same sorts of margins for error that all samples have. If readers jumped to unwarranted conclusions, they weren't alone. Both presidential campaigns reportedly were gloating/sulking respectively over those same numbers. \"News\" does not come out all at once, in a neat, complete package. The way it emerges in fragments - some of them false, some of them simply pieces of pieces--often shapes the story from within and becomes part of it. But I have these questions for those who peeked in Tuesday afternoon on any of the scores of Web sites that were posting what the exit polls were saying: Do you feel misled? Do you wish those who know such information would withhold it from you? Will you look for exit-poll numbers on the Web on Election Day, 2008? Take the click poll on this page. In the most recent click-poll, regarding the terms \"supervisor\" and \"superior\" to describe those for whom you work, 73 percent of respondents voted for \"supervisor,\" 4 percent voted for \"superior\" and 23 percent said it didn't make no never-mind nohow. TWO FOR 1/3 THE PRICE OF ONE!!! Mary Schmich and I will be doing one of those \"Greet the Press\" chats to benefit the United Way at Freedom Center Tuesday evening, and we're really hoping for the sake of our own fragile egos that we're not the only ones there. It includes a tour of the printing plant and costs $30, which may seem like a lot. But it's for a good cause and it's competitively priced compared to S-T columnist Neil Steinberg's charity event--a $90-a-head luncheon Nov. 14. Why, for $90, you can come to Greet the Press (call 312-527-8800 or email [email protected]), bring a companion to the charity sing-along that Mary and I host each December at the Old Town School (details here ) and have $10 left over for refreshments at the concert. Plus Mary is much better looking than Neil BLOG BOWL II RESULTS All 17 Illinois bloggers who entered Blog Bowl II correctly predicted the landslide victory of Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Barack Obama over Alan Keyes. They predicted margins ranging from 38% to 60%, and many were very close to the actual margin of 43%. Only two bloggers expected Keyes to get as much as 30% of the vote, but most were pretty close to his final total of 27%. Only five correctly predicted the re-election of George Bush and gave themselves a shot at winning bragging rights under my scoring system. They were Chris Rhodes (JoinCross): Jeff Berkowitz (Public Affairs), One Man (One Man's Thoughts), Jeff Trigg (Random Act Of Kindness) and Jason Hinds (Song of the Suburbs). Click here to find them and all others. Rhodes and Trigg both picked Obama to win by 44% and garner 24% of the vote. Trigg picked Bush to win by 13 electoral votes; Rhodes picked Bush to win by 14 electoral votes. Now that Iowa has been called for Bush, his actual electoral vote margin is 34 votes, making Rhodes our winner by the narrowest possible margin. Given that he writes for a Republican blog, I'm sure he'll consider this a strong mandate and begin immediately offering predictions willy-nilly. How did the Electoral College meta-polls we've been following do? The trophy here goes to Election-Projection.com, which told us early Tuesday it would be Bush,289 / Kerry, 249. The drool-soaked pillow of remorse goes to the Princeton/Wang analysis, which projected Kerry,311 / Bush, 227. And even though Alan Keyes blasted them as lies, the Illinois Senate polls were also relatively spot on and within their margins of error. In final polling, they found Obama winning by these margins: SurveyUSA 39% Research 2000, 42% Tribune/WGN, 47% Rasmussen, 44% Political Animal blogger Kevin Drum gives out his national polling awards here, with the winner being Pew Research. JACK WATCH As relentless as he is relentlessly unfunny, Sun-Times' editorial cartoonist Jack Higgins continues to kick John Kerry while he's down. I didn't believe on Thursday that Higgins could ever draw a cartoon that was more pointless and gratuitous than the one that appeared that morning. It showed a skeletal figure wearing one of those masks from the movie \"Scream\" topped by a Red Sox cap. A man standing by says: \"There, there. Why the long face, Sen. Kerry?\" Yet he proved me wrong today with an even more pointless and gratuitous panel: Voice from behind a door that is barricaded with a chair: Johnny, s'il vous plait, how do I open this door? Kerry, sitting morosely at his desk: Just shove it. I'd love to be in on the meetings where he explains what he's working on to Steve Huntley, the editor of the S-T's editorial page. Well, see, Kerry's wife speaks French, see? And we hate the French because they're against the war, right? And Kerry's really sad, right? So, he says \"Shove it,\" meaning shove the door, but also, you you won the Pulitzer Prize! UPDATE-- Several readers have suggested that \"shove it\" is an allusion to the very minor dust-up in the media during the week of the Democratic National Convention when Teresa Heinz Kerry angrily told the editorial page editor of the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review to \"shove it.\" If so, however, it only renders the cartoon more comedically impenetrable. He tells her to \"shove it\" because she told someone else to \"shove it\" back in July, and.... My brain hurts. FINE LINES Yes, Democrats need to make it clear that they support personal virtue, that they value fidelity, responsibility, honesty and faith. This shouldn't be a hard case to make: Democrats are as likely as Republicans to be faithful spouses and good parents, and Republicans are as likely as Democrats to be adulterers, gamblers or drug abusers. Massachusetts has the lowest divorce rate in the country; blue states, on average, have lower rates of out-of-wedlock births than red states. But Democrats are not going to get the support of people whose votes are motivated, above all, by their opposition to abortion and gay rights (and, in the background, opposition to minority rights). Paul Krugman This election was won on fear. Fear of gay people. And fear of foreign people. Carol Marin Girlie mandate Dave Gonzo of American Politics Journal describing George Bush's margin of victory. A large part of the public likes the conservatives' theme music. Now they will be tested on whether they like the lyrics. Barney Frank (George Bush) didn't say he'd made life better for the average American over the past four years. He didn't say he had transformed the schools, or made college more affordable, or brought jobs to the unemployed or health care to the sick and vulnerable. He said, essentially, \"Be very afraid. Be frightened of terrorism, and of those dangerous gay marriages, and of those in this pluralistic society who may have thoughts and beliefs and values that differ from your own.\" Republican U.S. Senate candidate Alan Keyes has posted extensive excerpts on his Web site of what he labeled his \"concession speech.\" Funny thing, though. Aside from a glancing mention of having to \" face hard truths this evening,\" the speech contains no concession - no straight acknowledgement of defeat, no ritual congratulation to his opponent, Barack Obama, for winning a hard fought race, no pledge to heal the wounds of a bitter campaign and no description of the traditional telephone call from loser to winner conceding the race. A low-class, mean act to the end, Keyes never made such a phone call. Notebook reader Gretchen L. says we should remind Keyes to do God's bidding and \"shake the dust off his feet on his way out of Illinois.\" Her source is Matthew 10:14, which says: And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet. UPDATE: This story quotes Keyes in a radio interview. I'm supposed to make a call that represents the congratulations toward that which I believe ultimately stands for and will stand for a culture evil enough to destroy the very soul and heart of my country? I can't do this. And I will not make a false gesture. Good manners do not demand that he make a false gesture, that he endorse Obama -- as bitter primary foes often do -- or wish him luck advancing his programs (Keyes called him a \"socialist\" again Thursday). All they demand is that he call Obama, concede defeat and offer a ritual congratulation similar to the ritual handshakes that he exchanged with Obama prior to each of their three debates. Those handshakes must have been \"false gestures\" too, making Keyes a hypocrite on top of everything else. But the handshake, the concession call, the courtesies and rituals of legislative bodies are all part of the sustaining and ennobling idea in American politics that the opposition is not the enemy. All of us could do to remember that this week. Z-MAIL Pete P. -- The advantage that the Republicans enjoy is not the co-opting of the word \"moral.\" It's from being aligned with the majority on these cultural issues, moral or not. It may bring you satisfaction to have your cultural views acknowledged as moral, but it won't convince anyone to change their minds. What the Democrats probably need to do is move closer to the majority on some of these issues, not try to change the terminology. I disagree. There's a long history in politics of language shaping beliefs and of terminology making a huge difference in public opinion. If you look at the polls on abortion, for example, you see over and over that exactly how you ask the question--what words you use--has a significant impact on the result you get. And where I think the left has failed is in allowing the right to frame the \"values\" debate and define what \"morality\" is and where it's applied to issues. See the following letter. Meg O.-- I'm going to start my private revolt by using replacement wording for some popular phrases that the Republican party has worked into the national vocabulary. \"Pro-life\" (is anyone \"Pro-death\" for goodness' sake?) becomes Marriage Act\" becomes \"Scared of Homosexuals Act,\" etc. Daniel D - There are less loaded words that could be used to describe what happened in the election. Saying that people with \"traditional\" values influenced the election may be the most neutral way of putting it. The converse would be that people with progressive values had fewer votes. I guess what I'm trying to say is that saying that morals or values played a role in the election is technically a neutral statement -- until someone comes along and assumes it to mean that the morally superior people actually won. \"Faithful Reader\" -- I wonder if the \"moral issues\" buzzphrase is really about people feeling not that they have \"higher moral values,\" but that they really do perceive (as Kristof wrote and you quoted) that their own moral values are subject to ridicule by people who don't agree. I've engaged this area of discourse more vigorously and, I like to think, more respectfully than most writers. I think there's a paradoxical element to how the media and other public figures talk about religion and faith. On the one hand, we do, despite some assertions and complaint to the contrary, pay a lot of lip service to venerating faith. On the other hand, we trivialize and patronize it by, generally, not doing it the favor of discussing it seriously. It's considered rude in our society to debate points of religious belief, to ask hard questions about the implications of certain belief systems or to in any way try to hold people to account for the often vast gulf between what they claim to believe and what their actions and words suggest that they do believe. We cloak the whole matter in a kind of gauze and push it just off limits, meaning that when disputes do arise, disagreement and questioning is perceived as \"ridicule.\" Trust me, no one is as ridiculed and held in automatic contempt as those who are not believers or churchgoers. It is, for instance, pretty much unthinkable for someone without a strong religious identification to run for any office higher than alderman. The real issue here -- the fault line in this debate -- is the degree to which we will allow religious views to shape policy and to therefore move from the personal, private sphere into the public sphere. For instance, a person's private, faith-shaped belief (thank you, Alan Keyes) about homosexuality is his business, and how he expresses it in his home and in his church is also his business. But if and when he tries to translate that belief into law, it becomes everyone's business. One of the more maddening arguments I've heard in opposition to gay marriage is that to allow gay marriage is to violate the Constitutional rights to freedom of religion of those whose religious views prompt them to find homosexuality an abomination. Religious people may answer, for good reason, that proponents are asking them to embrace and celebrate something they find objectionable. If and when that's the case, they have a legitimate complaint. It's inflammatory and misleading to imply that a good citizen must heartily approve and affirm all that is legal in society. An analogy, for me, would be sport hunting. I tolerate that it's legal, but, personally, I find the idea of killing a sentient being for fun to be offensive and objectionable. (No I won't debate this topic with you or anyone--I did that here and feel no need ever to do it again) But because I'm not all PETA about it, I don't try to get in the way of those who want to hunt, so long as they don't want to hunt in my backyard (we seem to have an opossum under the deck) or compel me to celebrate it. Hunters, gay people and evangelicals, for that matter, deserve to have society offer them the same freedoms and accommodations as it offers others others, but they do not deserve to be celebrated, endorsed and affirmed or, for that matter, considered off-limits for criticism. Yet the very sound, very American objection to the imposition into law of values rooted in faith rather than objective public policy considerations now translates into \"hostility to religion.\" Yet I don't think we have the civic vocabulary to talk about this problem in a productive way. It's all part of this larger concern I have which is that, these days, disagreement is commonly labeled as \"hate.\" MDP -- Non-conservatives must begin to consistently and pro-actively speak about their concerns as not just social concerns, but \"moral\" concerns. When polled or otherwise questioned about the importance of moral/ethical values, democrats must deliberately choose not to accept the conservative interpretation of the word \"moral\" and replace it with their own interpretation. If Democrats did this, there would be a surge in the percentage of liberals who would acknowledge that morals are of great importance to them. Thus, it would force pollsters, pundits, etc. to either qualify the term \"moral\" with \"conservative\" or \"religious morals\", or find another way altogether to speak about the narrow items of gay marriage, abortion and perhaps religion. G.L .-- Regarding your click poll about \"supervisors\" vs. \"superiors,\" I much prefer the more technically correct, \"the bozos I have to report to.\" Thomas L. NRA Life Member -- What is so wonderful is that your opinions mean nothing. Your side lost once again because you are so out of step with the majority of Americans. It is great to see you so unhappy. See Richard Roeper's quote below. FINE LINES Just how Jesus would react! Richard Roeper in response to harsh, taunting e-mails relating to the election. The president got re-elected by dividing the country along fault lines of fear, intolerance, ignorance and religious rule. He doesn't want to heal rifts; he wants to bring any riffraff who disagree to heel.... Mr. Bush, whose administration drummed up fake evidence to trick us into war with Iraq, sticking our troops in an immoral position with no exit strategy, won on \"moral issues.\" Liberals must acknowledge that if our rantings about Bush are correct, the majority of Americans truly do want a filthy rich, fear-fanning, warmongering, homophobic, misogynistic, born-again Texas frat boy running things. ... Mission Accomplished, President Bush. Victory is yours. If liberals can't beat this candidate under these circumstances, when can we? ... According to exit polls, the notion of lesbians sharing wedding cake and other affronts to our \"moral values\" are more important voting issues than Iraq, health care, terrorism or education. The fact that (gay marriage) is widely unpopular cannot obscure the fact that it is morally momentous and morally right. Liberals once lost elections for supporting civil rights as well and now look back on those losses as badges of honor. Eventually, since young people are far more tolerant of homosexuality than their parents, gay marriage will stop hurting Democrats at the polls. Until then, the party should try to win elections on other issues--and look forward to the day when conservatives apologize for trying to deny yet another group of Americans their full human rights. Peter Beinart, New Republic Rightly angry at the way that some religious communities have been mired in racism, sexism and homophobia, the liberal world has developed such a knee-jerk hostility to religion that it has both marginalized those many people on both the left and the right who actually do have spiritual yearnings and legitimate complaints about the ethos of selfishness in American life. So, the big story of the election is how public concern over \"moral issues\" gave George Bush the decisive edge over John Kerry. In most of the coverage, however, we never hear articulated exactly what these \"moral issues\" are, what distinguishes them from plain old issues and why it's taken as a given that conservatives are more \"moral\" than liberals and progressives. The term seems to encompass opposition to gay marriage - rejected by a majority of voters in 11 out of 11 referendums - and so-called \"partial-birth\" abortion, along with support for an increased role for religion in the public sphere. It doesn't so much disturb me that I may be hold a minority viewpoint on all three of these questions, but that pollsters and pundits so readily employ terminology that assumes the idea that the above are the more \"moral\" positions. To use the word \"moral\" so narrowly yet so casually is to yield vast territory in the culture wars before the first rhetorical shot is fired. I won't do it. I refuse to concede the idea that the person who wants to amend the Constitution to prevent a loving, consenting same-sex couple from creating a legally recognized bond containing all the rights and responsibilities of marriage has higher \"moral values\" than the person who doesn't. I refuse to concede that the person who believes it's his right to interpose his beliefs about right and wrong into the often painful and very difficult decisions made by pregnant women and their doctors has higher \"moral values\" than the person who doesn't. I refuse to concede that the person who wants the government to endorse one particular belief about the supernatural over another has higher \"moral values\" than the person who thinks it's none of government's business to take sides on matters of faith. There's more. I refuse to concede that a person has higher \"moral values\" if he believes in God. I refuse to concede that a person has higher \"moral values\" because he strives to restrict free expression of political and artistic ideas that may offend others. I refuse to concede that a person has higher \"moral values\" because he subscribes to the errant notion that \"abstinence-only\" is the best way to teach teenagers about sex. I refuse to concede that a person has higher \"moral values\" because he believes in diverting public education money into voucher programs that would end up using tax dollars to fund parochial schools. I refuse to concede that a person has higher \"moral values\" because he favors capital punishment and opposes medical marijuana and fetal stem-cell research. In short, I refuse to concede that true \"moral values\" are inherent in the entire grab-bag of conservative causes, notions, paranoias and fantasies to which we have attached both that label and the equally abused and co-opted term \"family values.\" Morality - right and wrong - is bigger than that. U.S. Sen.-elect Barack Obama made that point in his second debate with challenger Alan Keyes, who made incessant, hectoring attempts to claim the moral high ground: Well, I think there's something immoral about somebody who's lost their job after 20 years, has no health care, are seeing their pension threatened. I think there's something immoral about young people who've got the grades and the drive to go to college, but just don't have the money. It's at this level that Democrats/liberals/progressives need to start trying to bridge the \"moral values\" gap into which John Kerry evidently fell Tuesday. Yes, morality is important. But it's obscene to apply the term to something as ultimately harmless as the legal status conferred upon a gay couple and not apply it to, oh, say, the idea of waging a pre-emptive war based on an ill-supported conjecture or giving huge tax breaks to the richest Americans while cutting funding for education and after-school programs. The left should eagerly embrace the term \"moral values\" and join the debate. War is a moral issue. Tax policy is a moral issue. Workers' rights is a moral issue. The environment is a moral issue. The preservation of civil liberties is a moral issue. Until we make that case, we'll continue to lose national elections. For seven consecutive presidential elections, the Democratic candidate has failed to garner 50 percent of the vote. Not since Jimmy Carter in 1976 has a Democrat won a majority, and even Watergate could get Carter only 50.1 percent. THE AMERICAN GULF A poll of voters conducted by our sister paper, the Los Angeles Times, showed divisions between Bush and Kerry supporters so deep that all the \"let's move forward together\" exhortations in the world won't close them. Here's a summary of a few examples (percentage is of those who agree with the statement). Because of George W. Bush's economic policies, the country is better off. Bush voters 79% Kerry voters 5% The situation in Iraq was worth going to war over. Bush voters 85% Kerry voters 11% Moral/ethical values were important in deciding how I voted for president. Bush voters 52% Kerry voters 26% I approve of the way George W. Bush is handling his job as president. Bush voters 96% Kerry voters 7% The country is better off because of George W. Bush's policies and we should continue in the direction he set out. Bush voters 92% Kerry voters 2% Let the healing begin! FINE LINES I don't believe for a moment Bin Laden was trying to sway voters to Kerry with his taped address. This was the outcome he wanted, a gift from us to him: an unapologetic Christian Crusader in the White House whose re-election gives lie to the notion that Abu Ghraib was an aberration and that the deaths of thousands of Iraqi civilians weigh upon America's conscience. This morning America could not look more like a grinning aggressor to the Arab world, an aggressor with fresh marching orders..... A country that unctuously likes to think of itself as too busy to hate was able to rework its schedule this election year. Take, for example, Sadie Fields, president of Georgia's Christian Coalition. Like most evangelical Christians, Fields showed an admirable willingness to ignore what the often-inconvenient eponym of our faith actually said (some fiddlefaddle about not judging others and loving them instead) to focus entirely on two things Jesus never cared about: abortion and homosexuality. Verily, where would American Christianity be without those with the vision and determination to junk Jesus' teachings in favor of issues they consider more important? \"Betty Bowers\" One of the Republican Party's major successes over the last few decades has been to persuade many of the working poor to vote for tax breaks for billionaires. Democrats are still effective on bread-and-butter issues like health care, but they come across in much of America as arrogant and out of touch the moment the discussion shifts to values..... One-third of Americans are evangelical Christians, and many of them perceive Democrats as often contemptuous of their faith. And, frankly, they're often right. Some evangelicals take revenge by smiting Democratic candidates. This essay in Slate artfully discusses the pros and cons, ups and downs of exit polls leaking out all over creation when the polling places are still open. The operative issue is whether journalists should trust their audiences to deal responsibly with the information that they, the journalists already have. Another issue is whether it serves any purpose for a publication to try to shield its audience from accurate, tasteful, relevant non-libelous information that its audience can and will go elsewhere to find. This Hartford Courant article analyzes the role of Web logs in all the fuss during the day Tuesday that had much of America believing Kerry was going to win Over here, expert pollster Mark Blumenthal looks at how the pre-election polls and aggregate polls did in actually predicting results. Bottom line: Pretty well. Z-MAIL Tim1979 -- Much as I may sometimes criticize Eric Zorn's viewpoint and occasional tilt away from fairness... the fact remains that his creation and maintenance of this Notebook is wonderfully democratic, breaking down age-old barriers between journalists and readers and a lot of journalists don't like that. EZ has earned himself a place in Chicago j-history as a pioneer in an area that we'll all take for granted one day. Tim posted this in several parts over in the \"graffiti board\" message area of this blog, and I just had to share. I hope he's right, not necessarily about my place in journalism history, which I believe was secured several years ago with my classic \"give a nose-hair clipper for Christmas\" column, but with the idea that more and more columnists will adopt this medium as a way to break down the barriers and one day it will all seem as ordinary as ink on paper. A THOUGHT ON GAY MARRIAGE Much of America, it seems, doesn't want the word \"marriage\" co-opted by couples who are unable to have children and whose reproductive parts don't fit together as nature intended. They don't want our government or our society to \"bless\" them. But it's a church or a community that \"blesses\" a marriage, and blessing is a religious notion that should stand apart from the law, even as marriage itself is a sacrament. The public objection to gay marriage strikes me as analogous to the objection a rabbi might make to the idea of a gentile bar mitzvah. \"Bar mitzvah\" has a certain meaning among Jews and in the culture, and it would chip away at that meaning and significance if synagogues had to allow any teenaged boy of any faith who sought a solemn, sacred rite of passage into adulthood to have a bar mitzvah ceremony (or teenaged girls to have bat mitvahs). I would endorse and defend that objection, so long as the state were not the provider of bar mitzvah certification. Which clearly it's not. But if it were-if the state licensed bar/bat mitzvahs and first communions and baptisms -- I would see a very knotty First Amendment problem and would be among the first to suggest that the state not be in the business of blessing various spiritual transitions and passages, and should leave those matters to the churches. So we have two ideas, the domestic contract and the man-woman union as sanctified and blessed by a church or community. ] They are interwoven in the legal notion of \"marriage\" for, I'm sure, sound historical reasons in nations that, I'm also sure, had little or no tradition of keeping such church/state matters separate. If the words \"marriage\" and \"blessing\" are the sticking points, perhaps they should be relegated to the religious domain whence they came and where they belong. As the saying goes, if you like that sort of thing, it will be just the sort of thing you'll like. WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 2004 updated at 11:46 a..m. A PLACE CALLED HOPE Twenty months ago I chose to put my trust in President Bush and hoped that he was right - that we'd reached the point where the threat posed by Iraq was so serious that it called for the solution of last resort -- a military attack. I came to regret and disavow that choice. And now, more than 1,100 American deaths and one quagmire later, it appears that I'm in the position once again of having to hope that Bush is right - that his approach to fighting international terrorism is the best approach, the one that, long-term, will result in maximum liberty and minimum loss of innocent life. My hope this time is not accompanied by either trust or a sense of choice, but it is a hope. Those of us who feel there is a better way had our turn at the polls Tuesday, and we lost. (I wasn't in denial in the wee hours last night about acknowledging in this space the drift of these results, by the way. The Tribune is among the many news organizations that are very cautious about calling races.) President Bush has won a second term. Now he gets four more years to try to be a uniter not a divider, to increase respect for the United States throughout the world, to reduce the threat from Islamic fundamentalists who practice terror, to put more people back to work, to improve health care and extend educational opportunities to the disadvantaged, to stanch the flow of red ink in the Federal budget, to protect the environment and to do all the other things he promised he'd do. Republican President Bush will enjoy a Republican Senate, a Republican House, Republican appointees in seven of the nine Supreme Court justice seats, 29 Republican governors and virtually 24/7 support from right-wing talk radio to help him realize those promises and confirm the beliefs of his supporters. Credit and blame for what happens in this country and to this country in the upcoming years will belong to him and his party. Speaking for myself, I'll be happy to apportion both and trust that they will accept it honestly. They begged the electorate to give them responsibility. Well, they've got it: Opportunity. Responsibility and that ol' devil Accountability. No more blaming Dan Rather, Tom Daschle or the homosexual agenda when things go wrong. No more bleating about what President Clinton did to the economy and a White House intern and didn't do to Osama bin Laden. Some of my e-mail this morning has been taunting and ugly - celebrating the Bush victory by inviting me to eat crow and do anatomically impossible things. But winning an election does not demonstrate the superiority of your principles and programs; it's merely a chance to do so. To the old saying that the only poll that matters is the poll taken inside the voting booth on election day, I'd add that the only vote that matters is the vote ultimately cast by history. I have more doubts than hopes about what history will say about George W. Bush. So does about 48 percent of the electorate. The doubts will inspire our vigilance. The hopes will get us through. Kerry backers whose expectations of easy victory rose this afternoon on the winds of exit poll numbers posted to numerous Web sites and forwarded all over creation fell hard when at least some of those results turned out to be just so much hot air. The special, live one-hour \"Daily Show,\" hosted by Kerry-backer Jon Stewart, felt like a funeral in between the pre-taped hilarity. Still, at this hour, Salon is reminding one and all: Democrats shouldn't get too depressed. So far, there have been no state results that have contradicted those predictions -- although early numbers from Wisconsin, with some 34 percent of the vote in, do not look promising for Kerry. Not to mention Florida. Meanwhile, Alan Keyes has gone down to yet another epic defeat, this time in our U.S Senate race. Hmm. Do you suppose Someone is trying to tell him something? The Associated Press has called the suburban U.S House race between Melissa Bean and Phil Crane for Bean, the Democrat. She's up about 10,000 votes with 95 percent of the precincts in. It's almost time to start coloring in those electoral maps. For what they're worth, the 6 p.m. EST exit-poll numbers now being posted all over the online world show Kerry leading in Minnesota by 10 percentage points, in Pennsylvania by 7, in Wisconsin by 3, in Michigan by 4, in Florida and Ohio by 2, in New Mexico and Nevada by 1. They show Bush leading in Louisiana by 13 percentage points, in Arizona by 10, in Arkansas by 9, in Missouri by 5, in Arizona by 6, in North Carolina by 4 and in Colorado by 1. Iowa is a dead heat. I've used the smallest gap where I've found discrepancies. These are the last exit polls we'll be worrying about. Now the real polls are starting to close and networks are starting to call races. Remember that Media Matters plans to post in real time the moment that news organizations make their projections in these races. They are showing the same Bush 39, Kerry 3 score that we're using at chicagotribune.com in the Electoral College race to 270. MS-NBC appears ready to post here all exit polling data as soon as the polls close. updated at 6 p..m. COLUMNIST: KERRY WILL WIN AND I QUIT! No, not me. Jimmy Breslin of Newsday. In a remarkable farewell column today, he writes: I am so sure (of a Kerry victory) that I am not even going to bother to watch the results tonight. I am going to bed early, for I must rise in the darkness and pursue immediately an exciting, overdue project. Besides, if I was up, so many people, upon seeing every word I said of this election coming true on television in front of them, would be kissing my hands and embarrassing me with outlandish praise. So I go to bed with total confidence. I will get up and stroll to other meadows. I invented this column form. I now leave. CHEESE REPORT Jim Geraghty at The National Review Online suspects that Breslin, Zogby and others who think this race is over will end up drooling the drool of regret into the pillow of remorse, as they say over at ESPN: The \"big cheeses\" in GOP circles weren't worried by today's nutty exit poll scare. They know the bad, bad history of initial exit polls.... The 2000 Florida poll showed Gore winning by three, and we all know that ended with a 537 vote Bush win..... Catholic vote looks good for the President, particularly in Wisconsin. Bush is getting 40 percent of the Hispanic vote, compared to 35 percent in 2000. In Milwaukee, Republicans reported that the tires on 30 rented vans they planned to use to take voters to the polls had been slashed, while Democrats blamed Bush backers for posters in the inner city stating that the election is tomorrow. U.S. stocks staged a sharp reversal Tuesday, with blue chips sliding into negative territory and the Nasdaq paring gains amid reports that John Kerry is putting in a strong early showing at the polls. Jack Shafer at Slate explains why his online magazine is among those sites posting exit-poll results as fast as it obtains them: Slate believes its readers should know as much about the unfolding election as the anchors and other journalists, so given the proviso that the early numbers are no more conclusive than the midpoint score of a baseball game, we're publishing the exit-poll numbers as we receive them. Some people say it's irresponsible to publish the numbers--or broadcast early projections of winners--because it may disturb voter turnout. As Slate Editor Jacob Weisberg put it in today's Times, he doesn't want to put the Web site \"in the paternalistic position of deciding that our readers aren't mature enough to react in the proper way to truthful information we possess.\" His colleague, Slate blogger Mickey Kaus, tells his readers, \"Pay no attention to that bad man Jack Shafer!\" He scorns the publication of exit polls but asks that those who know the results e-mail them to him. Jonah Goldberg at the National Review Online claims here that at least some of the early Pennsylvania \"exit poll\" projections were bogus: Those numbers with Kerry leading by 20 in PA were definitely from the Kerry campaign. Whether they represented an early voting tally or just a totally non-serious collection of tallies from various dudes with clipboards is unclear. But they are entirely bogus for the purposes of understanding what's going on today. As for what is going on today. Florida seems to be looking ok but tight. Still too close to call in Ohio. Etc. When I have something more concrete, I'll let ya know. updated at 4:42 p..m. MORE EXIT POLL REPORTS FROM THE WEB Again, shakers of salt with all these numbers. 4 p.m. EST exit-poll data now flying around the Web show: Bush leading by 2 in Nevada, 7 in Colorado, 2 in North Carolina. Kerry leading by 9 in Pennsylvania, 1 in Ohio, 1 in Florida, 4 in Minnesota, 2 in New Mexico and 5 in Wisconsin. The polling group Zogby International called the election for Kerry at 5 p.m.: Kerry 311, Bush 213, with two smaller states, Nevada and Colorado, too close to call. Seems a bit premature to me. If Zogby's wrong, he won't just have egg on his face, he'll have a Grand Slam breakfast. updated at 4 p..m. WHADDAYA KNOW? First, here's the latest and the last review of Electoral College poll meta-analyses: Next: Leaked reports of the first round of exit polling data flying around the Web show Kerry leading by the following margins in the followig states: Michigan 51-48, Wisconsin 52-48, Minnesota Wisconsin 52-43 and New Hampshire 57-41. These same reports/rumors show Bush leading in Arizona 55-45, Colorado 51-48 and Louisiana 57-42. Exit poll mania spread through media and campaign circles Tuesday afternoon after first wave of morning data showed Kerry competitive in key states.... National Election Pool -- representing six major news organization -- shows Kerry in striking distance -- with small 1% lead -- in Florida and Ohio, sources tell Drudge... [But early 2000 exit polls showed Gore +3 in Florida; showed Gore-Bush even in CO [Bush won by 9], exits showed Gore +4 in AZ [Bush won by 6]... Note the spin. The \"mania\" was not caused by Kerry being \"competitive.\" All the polls showed he was going to be competitive. Nor is \"in striking distance\" the way one usually refers to someone who apparently has the lead. The \"mania,\" such as it was, was caused by the hint that Kerry might run the table on key states. Elsewhere, professional pollister Mark Blumenthal explains in detail how such polls are conducted and gives six reasons why no one should get too het up about them early in the day: It is still just a survey.... The mid-day numbers do not reflect weighting by actual turnout.... Voting patterns may be different early in the day .... Early or absentee ... voters (are) not available to interviewers standing outside polling places.... They could be fictional.... Field workers have been known to find creative ways to boost the morale of their own troops or demoralize the other side. The people who do exit polls would rather you ignored them.... few GOP bigwigs are disputing that the early exit numbers are not encouraging for Bush. (But) whomever you're voting for, for Pete's sake, don't be put off by exit polls....They are a blur of a blur. So stay tuned. And vote. I'll try to keep this site updated with interesting election-related links, but to bypass the middleman go to my site, Web Logs of Interest. Z-MAIL Steve-- I also have wondered why there hasn't been more outcry over Jack Higgins' political cartoons in the Sun-Times, which are rarely funny, usually false, and often mystifying. You want to know about offensive, trite, and unfunny comics, Professor? Have you ever read \"Prickly City\" in the Tribune? Fortunately, there is a blog devoted to the comic tripe \"Prickly City.\" The sociocomic stylings are independent of the comic and amusing on their own. I thought it would be worthwhile to bring this to your attention, although your Lincoln Square sensibilities might be offended by such salty language. My sensibilities are pure Albany Park, but thanks for the warning. I don't read the comics pages that much - I'm not proud of it, I just don't get around to it much anymore - and am interested that this sort of relentless criticism is now part of offerings on the Web. Rich Q. -- I don't know how this election will turn out but another 4 years of Bush will result in more than 4 more years of hell. Actually and apropos of comic strips, Matt Groening, creator of \"The Simpsons\" and author of \"Life in Hell,\" a syndicated strip that appears in the Chicago Reader, recently pledged to rename his strip if Kerry is elected - \"Life is Swell\" was a tentative offering. I don't believe life will be swell if Kerry is elected - the problems he'll face will be enormous. But Wednesday will be. Republican U.S. Senate candidate Alan Keyes, in the end, had no decency or shame in attacking his Democratic opponent. Of all the hysterical and vicious things he's said in what has become a pitiable attempt to gain attention for himself, his playing of the Hitler card over the weekend was the most hysterical and vicious: On Saturday, Keyes accused (Democrat Barack) Obama of supporting evil policies on abortion and gay rights. On Sunday, Keyes went even further when asked about Obama's appearance at St. Sabina Roman Catholic Church on the South Side. \"Any Roman Catholics who vote for Barack Obama are committing, in the opinion of the pope and the Holy See [Vatican City], a mortal sin,\" Keyes told reporters \"Catholics who vote for him make themselves part of that evil, just as the folks in Germany who voted for the party that eventually led to the Holocaust.\" Sometimes very close races get heated and candidates say things in the final days that they later regret. But this race is not at all close, and it's hard to imagine that there's any purpose, design or strategy behind Keyes' wild spewing and invocation of the Nazis. We're watching the last gasps of a true temper tantrum, and it really has ceased to be amusing. The editorial is from the Journal Standard in Freeport, and it says that Barack Obama's \"potent brand of liberalism is extreme\" and that Keyes is a charismatic, influential man of deep personal conviction....a voice that can't be ignored, a voice that speaks mightily for many conservatives in our state. He offers fresh and novel ideas to taxation and costly government programs, and he isn't afraid to swim against the tide of public opinion. But that's as good as it gets for Keyes. In the end, the editorial board of the JS came down for Obama because Obama's knowledge of the state and his dedication to issues of equity when it comes to education, civil rights and health care for Illinois' children and working poor provide a refreshing anecdote to the politics of division and cynicism that have become the rule - rather than the exception - in state, local and national government. HOW PATHETIC IS ALAN KEYES? PART THREE One of Keyes' top strategists, Dan Proft, wrote an 1,100-word pre-election column in the on-line conservative Illinois Leader offering his predictions for election day and didn't once use the K word. That's right, not a single mention of Keyes, and this was clearly Proft's choice as he's also the publisher of the Leader. Many people have asked me if I think Keyes is a serious candidate for the morning-drive shift on conservative talk station WLS AM (890) that's now in limbo. There's talk that he could host or co-host the air shift that was long the domain of Don and Roma Wade until the station yanked them off the air in mid-September in a contract dispute. This talk was fueled by WLS' inclusion of Keyes in its \"Stars on Stage\" 80th anniversary celebration at the Chicago Theater Oct. 2. My guess is that even listeners who favor his brand of unwavering moral certitude and prissy pomposity would tire of his act quickly, especially in morning drive when there's only so much browbeating a person can stand before lunging for the dial. I doubt they'll ask him, even as I doubt that Keyes is serious about hanging around Illinois trying to foist his services as a reformer on the state GOP, as he recently announced. And since Proft wouldn't offer a prediction about Keyes I'll offer one to go with my 29 percent of the vote forecase --he and his neck beard will be home in Maryland for Thanksgiving. AND HOW PATHETIC AM I? It's my most childish tradition: On the day of presidential elections now, I wake up at 5 a.m. and set my tape deck to begin recording conservative talk radio hosts. This year I'll record four hours of Tedious Teri O'Brien and the house elf who serves as her co-host; two hours of Bush/Keyes supporter Eileen Byrne and her sensible lefty co-host Jay Marvin; and three hours of Rush Limbaugh, all on WLS AM. I'll store the tapes away until Wednesday. If Bush wins, I'll record over them and never listen - as I ultimately did after the 2000 election. But if Kerry wins, I'll listen to and savor every last prediction of victory, smug expression of assurance and pooh-poohing of Kerry's chances, just like I did after Bill Clinton beat Bob Dole in 1996. The pleasure of listening to Limbaugh crow, \"We're going to do it, folks, we're going to win, I can feel it! I can feel it!\" when I knew they didn't do it and they lost was, I admit, a small-minded pleasure. But a huge one. Z-MAIL Pflood-- Well, the day before the election and - surprise! -- look what was on the Tribune op-ed page: Essays by Dennis Byrne and Charles Krauthammer. That's it. Since they endorsed Bush, I've been considering lightening my recycling load. Since you are the voice of sanity at your paper, I thought I'd give you the courtesy of a goodbye notice. Byrne and Krauthammer usually appear on Monday just as the more liberal Leonard Pitts usually runs on Tuesday and Molly Ivins usually runs on Thursday. So Monday was nothing out of the ordinary. I hope you'll reconsider your decision to drop the paper when you recognize, on Wednesday morning, that our editorial didn't make a difference in Illinois; that it didn't impact or reflect our very fine coverage of the campaign and the election, and that if readers of sanity desert the Tribune, then we voices of sanity will be considered expendable during the Kerry administration. Further, I have to add that it strikes me as odd that so many readers are in such a lather over an editorial in the Tribune but I've not heard a peep or a threat to stop subscribing to the Sun-Times over the nasty, false, mean-spirited and hamhanded editorial cartoons by Jack Higgins. Reporter to Kerry: You say terrorism is a nuisance, like prostitution and illegal gambling? Kerry: Yes, and rest assured we will pursue terrorists with the same vigor we pursue prostitutes. Of course, \"terrorism is a nuisiance\" isn't what Kerry said at all. What he said was \"We have to get back to the place we were, where terrorists are not the focus of our lives but they're a nuisance,\" a perfectly fine goal. At least Higgins was riffing on an actual quote. In this three-panel offering from Monday, I'm utterly mystified by the factual basis of the \"joke:\" Bush: America's security is up in the air! Kerry: America's security is not up in the air. Undecided voter: (flipping a coin) I'll be the judge of that. Maybe I'm missing something, but I find no quote from Kerry in the archives even remotely like \"America's security is not up in the air,\" or that even suggests he believes that American security is not at risk from a terrorist threat. Kerry talks about it a lot, in fact--our unguarded ports, our lack of support around the world and so on. That Higgins never lets facts stand in the way of taking whacks at Kerry doesn't seem to bother readers, however. Anyway, I feel better now. More Z-mail: XJYDX -- What's this you say about hoping a greater than expected number of Bush haters show up to vote? You consider yourself a dignified, professional and objective reporter? NOT!!!!! You are a liberal disgrace to your employer, Chicago and our great nation. So tell us, why does a hateful pin head like you support Bin Laden and Kerry, the two Michael Moore-on Fahrenheit 911 parrots? You're the last person in America to be using that lame old \"NOT!!!!\" joke, and I'm the pin head? Hscdes -- Do you really hope for a big turnout of hateful and outraged voters against Bush? Are you hateful and outraged? Osama bin Laden had to resort to a grainy video as his big October surprise. Beats nuclear bombs in the Loop doesn't it? Point being, we have had no new attacks since 9/11. We are winning the war on terror. The Taliban is destroyed, Saddam's regime is gone, 400,000 tons of dangerous ordnance has been destroyed in Iraq, Afghanistan has had free elections. So, are you too a hateful and outraged voter and why? What does Kerry really offer? I see a sharp distinction between being hateful and outraged, and I find the attempt to conflate the two terms poisonous and misleading. I can disagree with someone to the point of outrage without \"hating\" him. We teach our kids that \"hate\" is a strong, noxious concept and the word ought not be used lightly. I'd use it Osama bin Laden. But I wouldn't make the mistake you make in underestimating him--in supposing that he's been reduced to impotent invective simply because he hasn't struck again in the U.S. We know that these terrorist groups are methodical and they take their time --- we didn't have a foreign terrorist attack on U.S soil between the first bombing of the World Trade Centers on Feb 26, 1993 and the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 - that's 3119 days. It's now been 1,148 days since 9/11 2001. If we get to 3,119 -- March 27, 2010--- without another attack on our soil, I'll be impressed by your claim that we're \"winning the war on terror,\" the increase in the number of terrorist attacks worldwide notwithstanding. What does Kerry offer? He is a human \"re-set\" button on our relations with the international community. I see him as potentially a flexible and respected world leader who will make us safer than the maladroit and unreflective George Bush. FINE LINES Putting the \"ass\" in ambassador. \"Austin Mayor\" in a blog headline atop commentary about some recent infamous remark from Alan Keyes. Song of the Suburbs: Obama by 38%; Bush by 3 electoral votes; Keyes 30% of the total vote. (Jason Hinds) Truth About Keyes: Obama by 46%; Kerry by 6 electoral votes; Keyes 23% of the total vote. (Truth Girl) WurfWhile Obama by 46%; Kerry by 22 electoral votes; Keyes 25% of the total vote. (Hiram Wurf) Zorn's Notebook: Obama by 39%, Kerry by 50 electoral votes, Keyes 29%of the total vote. I figure that Libertarian Gerry Kohn will take roughly three percent of the vote in the Senate race from repulsed Republicans, and that Keyes will do better than most expect because he'll get a bonus few points of \"what the hell\" votes from those who wouldn't really want to see him elected, but don't want to send Obama off to Washington with an enormous mandate. (Some asked if the tiebreaker was a trick question or a simple math quiz related to the first question, but in fact, as noted, there are two other candidates on the ballot who stand to snag several percentage points). My thinking on the presidential race is that it's not going to be very close, either way, and that if Kerry does get a stronger than expected outraged, anti-Bush turnout as I hope and expect, he'll win a few surprise states along with the major battleground states he's supposed to win. If not, well, I'll be really wrong. If so, however, perhaps I'll win the coveted bragging right for which all Blog Bowl II entrants are playing. My prediction is not based on any one particular reading of the electoral vote map, but a gut feeling about all of them. Even the meta-polls -- the survey analyses of the best available recent polls -- show split results as of 3:30 p.m. Monday: Surprise, surprise, the predictions tend to follow the political inclinations of the pundits in question (just like in Blog Bowl II). Footnote: The DraftVallas blog entry was submitted on time but not entered in this morning's first posting because of clerical problems. I will post late entries tomorrow morning, but only for exhibition purposes. 2004 - THE YEAR OF THE TRANSCRIPT It's a lot of reading, but this complete transcript of the recent debate between incumbent Republican congressman Henry Hyde and Democratic challenger Christine Cegelis (provided by the Cegelis campaign) is a fine opportunity to overcome the \"sound bite\" problem and contrast the candidates in context. Interestingly, the most exemplary campaign in the history of Illinois politics for providing the public with verbatim transcripts of key speeches, debates and interviews has been the Alan Keyes campaign. This site http://www.renewamerica.us/archives/ has allowed voters to take a full, unfiltered and uninterrupted look at virtually every public utterance by Keyes. BLOGGING THE DEMOLITION Gaper's Block published this extensive essay by Sun-Times technology writer Howard Wolinsky on his thoughts as demolition began on the old Sun-Times building. The end of the essay points to the Web site Wolinksy and his wife, Judi, maintain, which in turn points to three very useful lands of linkin': Word Play-- \"A collection of sites on the Web that feature having fun with words.\" Measure 4 Measure -- \"A collection of interactive sites on the Web that estimate, calculate, evaluate, translate, etc. \" Map Happy --\"Interactive maps to get you from here to there and beyond.\" Hours of fun. STEP BACK, MILT; GIVE IT UP, NEIL To judge from this recent column from the Chronicle of Higher Education, famed emeritus UIC dean Stanley Fish has become the old crank at the feet of whom other old cranks bow: Now that I have all the time (well, not quite all) in the world at my disposal, I've been spending it improving everyone I meet, whether or not those I minister to welcome my efforts.... Although I'm no longer a dean, I can't shake the habit of being at the office every day, all day. Because I have nothing particular to do, I roam the halls looking for things that are wrong, and I find them. (In the classroom) my students receive the full force of my reforming zeal. I tell them that I haven't the slightest interest in whatever opinions they might have and don't want to hear any. I tell them that while they may have been taught that the purpose of writing is to express oneself, the selves they now have are not worth expressing, and it would be good if they actually learned something. This rant is deserving of an Abe Simpson award, one I've just created in honor of the cartoon character who spoke the immortal line, \"The good Lord lets us grow old for a reason -- to gain the wisdom to find fault with everything he's made!\" I wrote out the steps below as I made my way through installing and setting up the Firefox Internet browser on two Windows computers. I'm guessing the steps are very similar for Mac and LInux machines, and as I update this instruction page I'll be happy to append notes having to do with that and other issues: Close all operating programs except your current browser, then on this page, move your cursor to this link -- http://mozilla.org -- and LEFT CLICK ON THIS LINK(all clicks are left clicks unless otherwise noted) At the top of the page you will see the announcement \"Firefox is here!\" Just below that, in the light green box, you will see the words \"Free Download.\" CLICK THE \"FREE DOWNLOAD\" LINK. When a dialogue box pops up on your screen asking if you want to run or save this file, CLICK \"SAVE.\" In the next dialogue box, your computer will offer you a suggestion as to what you want to save the file as and where--you will probably be in one of your main directories (desktop), but you will know where you are by the designation that appears in the space after the words \"Save in:\" near the top of the box. Remember that location as you CLICK \"SAVE.\" The file Firefox Setup 1 will begin to download and keep you posted as to its progress. It's a relatively small file 4.68 MB, and will take a DSL or cable modem less than a minute. Once this download is complete, the dialogue box will probably close and you'll once again be looking at the mozilla.org homepage. In the corner of your screen, CLICK THE WINDOWS \"START' BUTTON Move your cursor up the \"Start\" menu and CLICK \"RUN.\" In that dialogue box, CLICK \"BROWSE.\" You will now have to locate the directory to which the Firefox Setup file was downloaded. If you don't see it in the menu in front of you, move your cursor up to the location box (it's next to the words \"look in:\" and CLICK ON THE DOWN ARROW. You are very likely to see the name of the directory here to which you downloaded Firefox. CLICK ON THAT DIRECTORY NAME. In the proper directory, you will see a menu icon labeled, Firefox setup. CLICK ON IT. The run dialogue box will pop up., CLICK \"OK.\" If you get a security warning, CLICK \"RUN\" The file will extract and in fairly short order you will see the \"Welcome to Mozilla Firefox\" screen. Click \"NEXT.\" In the license agreement, after you read the fine print carefully - ahem - CLICK \"I ACCEPT.\" Then CLICK \"NEXT.\" Under \"setup type,\" the standard set-up is already selected so unless you want to get fancy, CLICK \"NEXT.\" On the Summary page, CLICK \"NEXT.\" Your computer will install Firefox. When it's done, you will then see a page that says \"Install complete.\" On that page, two boxes are checked. One says \"use Firefox as my home page,\" and I recommend , for now, that you CLICK ON THE CHECK MARK NEXT TO THE HOME-PAGE OPTION IN ORDER TO REMOVE THAT CHECK MARK. Leave checked the \"Launch Firefox\" box checked and CLICK \"FINISH.\" Presently, the \"Import Wizard\" will ask if you want to import your options, bookmarks, passwords and other data from your current browser, which may be checked (mine was Internet Explorer and the proper box was checked). I recommend you do so, if your browser is listed, and CLICK \"NEXT.\" The computer will then tell you that it's importing data from your current browser, and you will see the orange Firefox icon in your task bar (mine runs across the bottom of my screen) and it may be flashing. CLICK ON THE FIREFOX ICON. The \"default browser\" window will come up onto the screen: \"Firefox is not currently set as your default browser. Would you like to make it your default browser?\" I recommend that you DO NOT change your defaults until you're sure you like the program, so be sure that box is unclicked. It's up to you if you want Firefox to ask you this question each time it boots up. I left that box checked, myself. CLICK \"NEXT.\" You will now be on the Firefox start page, which is the default (automatic) home page for the program. Most of us already have our own homepages that we prefer, thankyouverymuch, and to make your customary home page your default home page, the first thing you want to do is go up on the menu line across the top of the browser and CLICK \"TOOLS.\" In the tools menu, then, roll your cursor all the way down to CLICK \"OPTIONS.\" In the field where it specifies \"Home page location,\" move your cursor onto the internet addres that is there and CLICK ON THE ADDRESS. Type Control-A and then Control-X to erase the default address, type in the full internet address of your home page and then, at the bottom of the screen CLICK \"OK\". On the main Firefox page, CLICK ON THE LITTLE ICON THAT LOOKS LIKE A HOUSE. You are now on your homepage and ready to create a handy tabbed-browser set to make your daily perusal of favorite sites faster and more pleasant. The example below will help you create a \"Chicago Tribune News Columnists\" group, which is something no serious person should be without. To start, go up to the menu line and CLICK ON \"BOOKMARKS.\" From here you can type Control-M or move your cursor down a couple of lines and CLICK \"MANAGE BOOKMARKS.\" Near the top of the \"Manage Bookmarks\" screen you will CLICK ON THE \"NEW FOLDER\" ICON. In the field for \"name,\" type in \"Chicago Tribune News Columnists\" and CLICK \"OK.\" Move your cursor to top right corner of this window and CLICK ON THE X TO CLOSE THAT WINDOW(note, there is a slightly faster way to create new folders, but I think this way give you a better tour of the program as you're getting started) You're now back at your home page. Move your cursor into the white box at the top that displays the internet address of your home page and CLICK ON THE INTERNET ADDRESS OF YOUR HOME PAGE. The address should now be highlighted. Either tap the spacebar or type Control-X to erase that address. Then type in http://chicagotribune.com/firefox and CLICK ON THE LITTLE BUTTON THAT SAYS \"GO.\" You will find yourself on this very Web page. Scroll down to this point in the text and move your cursor on this link -- Eric Zorn -- and RIGHT CLICK ON THAT LINK. In the small dialogue box that pops up, CLICK ON \"BOOKMARK THIS LINK.\" In the \"Add Boomark\" dialogue box that pops up, move your cursor just to the right of the white, text box to the right of the words \"create in:\" and CLICK ON THE DOWN ARROW. Note that there are two down arrows. The smaller one that's even further right will come in handy later when you have lots of bookmark groups, but never mind that now. You will see several options after you click on the down arrow in the previous step. Move your cursor down to the name of the folder you have created and CLICK ON \"CHICAGO TRIBUNE NEWS COLUMNISTS.\" The top of this box should now say Name: Eric Zorn, and under that Create in: Chicago Tribune News Columnists.\" CLICK \"OK.\" Scroll down to the line that says \"Chicago Tribune News Columnists\" and move your cursor onto that little black triangular arrow on the right side of that line. Another menu window will open that shows the names of all the columnists and, at the bottom, the option you want. CLICK \"OPEN IN TABS\" Firefox will now open all of the above internet addresses simultaneously. Moving between one columnist and another is as easy as clicking on the tabs at the top of the page that resemble file-folder tabs. You'll now find it easy to create tab sets for your favorite blogs, national news sites, local news sites, whatever. \"Change of Subject\" by Chicago Tribune op-ed columnist Eric Zorn contains observations, reports, tips, referrals and tirades, though not necessarily in that order.
