Although the Commission's name suggests a more general charge, its work was largely confined to a single task: consideration of state licensing for naturopath s. During the course of a year, naturopaths failed to make a persuasive case for the qua lity of their educat ional experience, the efficacy of their treatments, th e accuracy of their diagnoses, or the rational basis of their beliefs. Skeptics provided extensive material s, including a Massac husetts based, peer- reviewed study of naturopathic opinions, comprehensive governmental documents on naturopath licensing, and a comprehensive review of naturopathy lite rature. All of these demonstrate the futility of the ca se for the licensi ng of naturopaths. We, the undersigned, therefore register ou r opposition to the proposed licensure of naturopaths in the Commonwealth of Massachus etts, and to the establishment of any self- regulating board of \"naturopathic medici ne.\" The Commission heard overwhelming evidence that an endorsement of naturopath s through licensure woul d pose a clear threat to public health and safety. No scientific evidence was presente d supporting naturopathic claims, but ample evidence was presented to show that these claims are implausible and dangerous. No evidence was presented to justify distinguishing the small group of naturopaths represented on the Commission fr om other, \"less educated\" naturopaths. Finally, the pro-licensure repor t fails to consider the Ariz ona report described below, which illustrates that a self-regulation statut e cannot result in mean ingful regulation and public protection in a field that is inherently irrational and unethical. The signatories of this report have compiled this brief to reflect the evidence presented to the Commission and to fulfill the charge that the legislature presented to the Commission. We urge readers of this summary also to review the extensive background materials attached to it. Any objective reviewer will find that the evidence is fair and comprehensive, and leads inexorably to the conclusion that naturopaths are not qualified to be licensed heal th care providers.2Table of Contents Executive Summary..............................................................................................1 Summary of Findings in Nine Key Areas......................................................................4 Discussion of the Process........................................................................................8 The Origin and Real Agenda of the Special Commission: to Advance the Licensure of Naturopaths.............................................................................................8 Opponents of Licensure Presented th e Commission's Charge............................................................................9 The Commission's Actions............................................................................9 \"Organizing Principles\".................................................................... 9 Case Naturopathic Licensure as Presented to the Commission...................................10 1.

Licensing: Establishment of licensing for naturopaths is not warranted because: A. Evidence presented shows that there is no list of proven, safe and effective treatments or methods necessary to defineprofessional naturopathy. B. Evidence presented shows that there is no clear, established scope of practice for naturopathy. C. Evidence presented shows significant problems in structuring and implementing state regulati on of naturopathy in a manner that protects the public. D. Evidence presented shows that there is no way to determine who would be a deserving candidate for naturopathic licensure,even if the clinical claims of naturopaths were valid. E. Evidence presented shows that there is no basis for distinguishing the validity of the claims of one group of naturopaths from that of others. F. Evidence presented raises serious questions about the ability of the small number (approximately 30) of individuals seekinglicensure to fund and staff a self-regulating board without serious conflicts of interest. G. Evidence presented shows that standard naturopathic practice is substandard medical prac tice. Thus a self-regulating naturopathic board would le gitimize unacceptable practices. H. Evidence failed to demonstrate a set of principles or methods that distinguish naturopathic practice from what licensedmedical doctors and doctors of osteopathy are already able to do. Therefore, there is no social or professional need that naturopathy supplies. I. \"Collaborative practice\" betw een naturopaths and medical doctors is untenable because of irreconcilable scientific and ethical differences. 2. Title Protection The exclusive right to the titles \"n aturopath,\" \"naturopathic physician\" or any similar title should not be established because: A. The Commission heard no evidence supporting the claim that the title \"naturopath\" should be legally limited. B. The Commission heard evidence from another, larger, national organization of naturopaths w ho are opposed to licensing. They5asserted their own qualificati ons, which are neither more nor less demonstrably valid than the group represented on theCommission. They oppose the licensure on the grounds thatlimitation of the term \"naturopath\" would arbitrarily limit theirability to make a living, and th at those naturopaths seeking licensure are not qualified to practice medicine. The evidencedoes not warrant granting ex clusive right to the term \"naturopath\" to any partic ular group of naturopaths. 3. Educational and Training Standards Naturopathy schools should not be re cognized as medical schools or as providing adequate health care training because: A. The evidence shows that academ ic and attendance standards in naturopathic schools and nati onal accrediting programs are inconsistent and lack rigor. Th e mere issuance of an \"N.D.\" degree cannot guarantee that gradua tes are qualified or able to advise the public on matters of health. B. Evidence shows that the course content of naturopathy schools is filled with unscientific asse rtions and beliefs that strain credulity. 4. Clinical Experience Naturopaths should not be recognize d as having clinical experience adequate to advise patients on matte rs of health and disease because: A. Evidence was presented showing that both graduates and practicing naturopaths lack experience in recognition of disease and effects of treatment. B. No evidence was presented that naturopathy schools provide competent clinical training or any significant experience caringfor truly ill patients. 5. Testing Standards There is no basis for recognizing a ny meaningful testing system in naturopathy training because: A. Uniform testing of naturopaths has been shown to be ineffective in establishing minimum entry standards forlicensing of naturopaths. B. Meaningful testing is not possi ble because of the lack of a comprehensive, proven body of knowledge and methods thatdefine naturopathy. C. The Arizona report shows that, in spite of strong legislative efforts to mandate testing, such testing is impossible to design6and implement. Indeed, in Ariz ona all applicants passed the examination regardless of test results. D. Naturopaths did not present standards or examples of examinations to the Commission. 6. Independent Board Issues The Commonwealth should not s upport the establishment of an independent licensing board because: A. Standard naturopathic practice is substandard medical practice. Thus an independent naturopa thic board would legitimize unacceptable practices. B. The Arizona report shows the pr oblems inherent in allowing naturopaths to establish their own boards. Major problems existwith scope of practice, dispen sing of narcotics, conflicts of interest, funding, and public prot ections. Arizona has a 65-year history of licensing naturopaths, a community of 400 licenseesand an established school of na turopathy. Massachusetts could not expect to avoid the problems experienced by Arizona. C. There are only 30 naturopath s in Massachusetts and 1500 nationally. Such a small group ha s little capacity to support an independent board. 7. Disciplinary Actions and Public Protections The Commonwealth should not recogn ize a public protection capability in a naturopathy board because: A. Standard naturopathic practice is substandard medical practice. Thus the establishment of a se lf-regulating naturopathic board would, paradoxically, endorse pr actices that would be grounds for discipline if perfor med by a medical doctor. B. The Arizona report shows the lack of meaningful public protections from naturopathy self-regulation. C. No evidence was presented show ing that licensed naturopaths in any state have any history of oversight by state licensing agencies. D. Existing fraud laws in Massachus etts should be strengthened and the Attorney General's health care division be asked todevelop mechanisms to use existing laws to protect the publicfrom misconduct, fraud and abuse by practitioners of all types.78. The Duty to Refer Sick Patients to Medical Doctors The evidence demonstrates the inab ility and unwillingness of naturopaths to make timely referrals to physicians because: A. The duty to refer depends upon th e ability to recognize the need to refer. Naturopaths' limited training does not equip them to recognize the early signs of serious diseases or todistinguish self-limited diseas es from those that require significant intervention. B. Naturopathic literature demons trates a disdain for standard medical practice and an unwarra nted faith in naturopathic \"healing.\" C. A Massachusetts study indicate s that naturopaths do not recognize the duty to refer patients who need urgent orspecialized medical care. 9. The Title \"Physician\" The Commonwealth should support a ban on use of the term \"physician\" or \"primary care physician\" by naturopaths because: A. The evidence presented to the Commission supports prohibition of the use of the term \"physician\" by individuals who are not licensed medical or osteopathic doctors.Indiscriminate use of this term constitutes a health and safety risk for unwary consumers. B. Naturopaths have consistently a dopted this term in an attempt to legitimize their claims. C. No useful similarity exists between naturopaths and physicians regarding training, experience , capabilities or methods.8Discussion of the Process The Origin and Real Agenda of the Speci al Commission: to Advance the Licensure of Naturopaths The Special Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medical Practitioners was established in the summer of 2000. The Massachusetts Society of Naturopathic Physicians had long sought licensing for its constituents, who number about thirty. The Legislature had consistently and over whelmingly opposed such licensing since 1995. After repeatedly failing to advance its ag enda, this small group of naturopaths and its legislative patrons managed to establ ish the Commission, not through legislation approved by the Health Care Committee but th rough an undebated, outside section of the 2000 budget. Opponents of Licensure Presented th e only Comprehensive Critiques Among those opposing licensure are the only members of the Commission who used their professional expertise to evaluate naturopathic claims: Drs. Kimball Atwood and Arnold Relman, representing the Massachus etts Medical Society and the Board of Registration in Medicine, respectively. Th e two began their Commission work open to the possibility that the public might benefit fr om some form of regulation of naturopathy, but were persuaded to oppose licensure by th e wealth of evidence that was brought to bear, much of which is restated here. These physicians prepared exte nsive critiques of the field for the benefit of Commission members. These are appended to this report, and provide useful descriptions of the beliefs and claims of \"naturopathic medicine\" and examples of how rational physic ians evaluate such claims. Those favoring licensure of naturopaths did not show an interest in investigating the validity of naturopathic practices. The natu ropaths themselves did not choose to defend questionable and erroneous pract ices, but rather denied their existence or importance. This denial was in spite of the fact that every questione d practice was gleaned directly from primary naturopathic sources represen ting the mainstream, including the leadership, of the field. Thus, the pro-li censure report reflects no sens e that a state endorsement of such practices might be detrimental to the ci tizens of Massachusetts. On the contrary, the signatories of the pro-licensure report tr ust naturopaths themselves to establish a responsible system of self-regulation - a trust that is not feasible under professional and ethical social codes, and not warran ted in light of the Arizona report. This opposition report, by virtue of provi ding numerous examples of naturopathic practices, stands in contrast to the pro-licensure report, which provides none. We ask the legislature to question why the proponents of naturopathy did not discuss the validity of specific naturopathic practices.9The Commission's Charge The outside section of the 2000 budget es tablished the following tasks for the Commission: An identification of the types of pr actitioners and therapies available An estimate of the use of such therapies An evaluation of the necessity for state licensure of naturopaths as a consumer protection measure A review of naturopathic e ducation and training standards A review of the scope of practi ce of state licensed naturopaths A review of potential standards of conduct for licensees of naturopathy A review of third party reimbursement for therapies The Commission's Actions The Commission met for nearly a year. Duri ng that time, the issue of licensure for naturopaths dominated its activities, in sp ite of evidence showing that the demand for naturopathic services is mi niscule. Pro-licensure natur opathy advocates consistently supported an independent licensi ng board with the broad author ity to define naturopathy, its standards and scope of practice. Th e representative of acupuncture on the Commission, who is an administrator at a lo cal acupuncture and oriental medicine school, also supported this position w ith the provision that naturo paths be excluded from the practice of acupuncture. \"Organizing Principles\" The Commission spent several meetings establishing a set of \"organizing principles.\" These were eventually organized into two major categories: \"Criteria that Suggest the Need for Government Intervention\" and \"Criteria that Suggest the Need for Licensure.\" Most of these criteria reflected the superficial trappi ngs of legitimacy, e.g., the existence of schools, a national society, and an examination; one was concerned with the only relevant initial criterion for a health care profession: validity of claims. This was phrased as follows: \"Is there evidence of e ffective treatment of conditions if treated by well-trained naturopathic medical practitioners?\" The answer to this is \"no,\" but those favoring licensure accepted the as sertions of naturopaths in spite of substantial evidence presented to the contrary. The Case for Naturopathic Licensure as Presented to the Commission A small group of naturopaths, who refer to themselves as \"naturopathic physicians\" or \"naturopathic doctors\" (\"ND's\"), seeks licensu re to practice an unus ual form of medicine in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Th ese individuals are few by any standard, numbering approximately 1500 in the enti re U.S. and 30 in Massachusetts (by comparison, in Massachusetts alone ther e are about 30,000 medical doctors, 4,000 nurse10practitioners, 400 nurse midwives, and 1800 chir opractors). They contrast themselves to other, more numerous naturopaths, by vi rtue of having attended on-campus schools, which number four in the U.S.1 These schools grant the \"N.D.\" degree, but so do several other, \"unapproved,\" correspondence school s. The N.D. degree is not recognized nationally or in the Commonwealth of Ma ssachusetts. The Commission was presented no specific information detailing the educational and work histories of the 30 or so members of the Massachusetts Society of Naturopathic Physicians. The naturopaths represented on the Commission make several assertions, all of which are contradicted by the evidence, to justify their quest. These a ssertions, together with our responses, are as follows: 1. Naturopaths State that they are \"Primary Care Physicians.\" These naturopaths claim to be \"primary care physicians\" and to be adequately trained for this calling. They view their scope of practice as covering every aspect of medical care except trauma and major su rgery. This claim is repeated in the literature of every major institution of th e field, including the official websites of all four schools in the U.S., the official website of the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians (AANP), and the Textbook of Natural Medicine (the only general textbook of the field). The following quotation is from the website of theNational College of Naturopathic Medici ne in Portland, Oregon, one of the four naturopathy schools recognize d by those seeking licensure: Naturopathic doctors (N.D.s ) are primary care physicians, most of whom are in genera l private practice. They are trained to be the doctor first seen by the patient for general healthcare, for advice on k eeping healthy, and for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic conditions. 1 They are: Bastyr University in Kenmore, Washingt on; the National College of Naturopathic Medicine in Portland, Oregon; the Southwest College of Naturopath ic Medicine in Tempe, Arizona; and the University of Bridgeport College of Naturopathic Medicine in Bridgeport, Connecticut. All four schools have websites.11Response : Primary Care Physician Claim In one of the few concessions to the ove rwhelming evidence against the claims of naturopaths, the pro-licensure report suggests that the title \"primary care physician\" be denied to them. \"Naturopa thic physician\" would still be available, as would all claims regarding the ability to diagnose and treat disease. Regardless of what the pro-licensure repo rt may state, the pretension of these naturopaths to be \"physicians\" is the st andard for the field as a whole. It is precisely what Massachusetts consumers will be told if such practitioners become licensed. No crafting of legislative language can change this fact, as evidenced by the attached letter from the State of New Hampshire demanding that the AANPstop proclaiming that New Hampshire licenses naturopathic \"physicians.\" Recognition of the status of their graduates as \"physic ians\" is central to the survival and growth of the four na turopathy schools. These schools actively support political action for licensure throughout the c ountry. Prospective and former students demand licensure as a means of returning their considerable financial investments in naturopathy de grees. Thus consumers in Massachusetts and other states must be led to believe that licensed naturopa ths are \"primary care physicians.\" If the Commonwealth license s naturopaths in any way, the schools, the national organizations and the individual naturopaths will assert that they have been recognized as \"physicians\" in Massachusetts. Naturopathic Education Does Not Jus tify the Title \"Physician\" or \"Doctor\" Simple arithmetic shows that the educat ion of naturopaths and medical doctors cannot be comparable. Evidence-based medical school require s four years, of which at least one is spent in an intens ive, hospital setting learning about patients who are seriously ill. To be licensed to practice medicine, a graduate M.D. must complete another year of intens ive hospital traini ng (the well-known \"internship\"). Most primary care physicians in modern times, moreover, havesubsequently completed two more years of post-graduate training and passed acertification exam. Naturopathic schools also advertise a f our-year curriculum, but during this time they claim to combine standard medical training with naturopathic training. The latter includes multiple courses in various \"alternative\" practices, includinghomeopathy, acupuncture and traditiona l Chinese medicine, \"naturopathic manipulation\" (a form of chiropractic), Ayurvedic medicine , cranial osteopathy, herbalism, and more. 2 Exclusive practitioners of several of these methods, who are not naturopaths, contend that four ye ars is a minimum requirement for training in each. How, then, could naturopaths be ad equately trained in all of these and in scientific medicine as well? 2 Bastyr University Course Catalog. Available at: http://www.bastyr.edu/catalog /courses/default.asp?PID=NM12Naturopathic Clinical Training is Inadequate Naturopathic schools, moreover, offer no tr aining in the care of sick, hospitalized, patients, and little or no teaching by expe rt clinical professors. Naturopathic school faculties overwhelmingly consist of naturopaths, who themselves have had inadequate training. Naturopathic schools have no significant hospital affiliations.The result is to perpetuate a dubious, superficial understand ing of health and disease, as will be discussed further below. Licensure would Create a Double Standard The central element of medical education in the clinical years is to learn from qualified physicians and be exposed to real diseases, trauma and chronic conditions. Thus, for naturopaths to clai m training comparable to that of even minimally qualified M.D.'s who are allowe d to practice primary care, two years of intensive hospital training would ha ve to be added to the naturopathic curriculum, the second occurring after graduation. Since this innovation is not part of the proposal for naturopathic licen sure, the result would be to construct a two-tiered medical system for the citizens of the Commonwealth. Naturopathic Credentials are Inconsistent The evidence, furthermore, shows that many graduates of \"approved\" naturopathy schools (including the naturopath on th e Commission, Barbara Silbert) do not attend the full four years at naturopathic school. Instea d they receive up to two years of credit for schooling in other fields, such as chiropractic, whose teaching also deviates from the basic educational and scientific premises of evidence-based medical schools. If the Commission repres entative, who is president of the Massachusetts Society of Naturopathic P hysicians, has such w eak credentials, it can reasonably be concluded that the cred entials of the average naturopath are at least as questionable. 2. Scientific Training and Educational Quality Naturopaths seeking licensure claim to have received the same basic science training as medical doctors, and to have passed an examination that is alleged to be equivalent to that re quired of medical doctors. Response : Basic Science Training If the quantity of naturopath ic training is lacking, so is its quality. Naturopathic schools claim to teach the same basic scie nces as science-based medical schools, but the evidence presented to the Comm ission proves otherwis e: no scientifically trained physician, for example, could po ssibly believe that a hydrogen peroxide bath can effectively treat or prevent asthma by \"bring[ing] extra oxygen to the entire surface of the skin, thus making the lungs somewhat less oxygen hungry.\" This claim, which is incompatible w ith the facts of anatomy and physiology, is13made in a naturopathic treatise written by a leader in the field and printed on the official website of the AANP.3 It is typical of the my riad pseudoscientific claims made by naturopaths, many more of which are discussed in the accompanyingNaturopathy Monograph prepared by Dr. Atwood, the Massachusetts Medical Society representative to th e Commission. We explained th is claim and others like it to the Commission shortly after two Bost on teenagers died of asthma for lack of prompt, definitive treatment. These teenagers may not have been treated bynaturopaths, but their deaths clearly show that the conflict between scientific facts and irrational claims makes a difference in the treatment of real diseases. Acute asthma victims do not have time to be bathed in hydrogen peroxide. Naturopathic Schools vs. Real Colleges and Universities Naturopathic schools display the trappings and titles of established universities, but are actually small facilities that were started by a few individuals to promote a dubious health \"system\" not recognized by society at large. These schools may have a for-profit history and receive funding from health food and \"dietary supplements\" companies, as is documented on p.21 of the accompanyingNaturopathy Monograph. They do not o ffer a variety of undergraduate and graduate degrees. Health consumers should be wary, in gene ral, of any health-related field whose training programs are unaffiliated with la rger, established academic institutions. Lacking such affiliations, the field is insulated from the scrutiny of the larger scientific community and is thus likely to perpetuate dubious, un scientific beliefs and practices. Often such be liefs are the product of the musings of one or a few individuals. Bastyr University's public ations show such limited authorship. Naturopathic Educati on and the \"Moonies\" Of the four on-campus naturopathic sc hools in the United St ates, only one, the University of Bridgeport College of Natu ropathic Medicine, can boast that it is part of a real university. Yet this is no or dinary university: it is the \"flagship\" of the World University Federation, a front organization for the Unification Church. Legislators will recall that this is th e cult of the Reverend Sun Myung Moon, from whose name its more common desi gnation, the \"Moonies,\" is derived. Naturopathic schools, unsurprisingly, have not joined the scientific community but have maintained an ideological, cult-like approach to health care. Accreditation Naturopathic schools are not accredited in any meaningful way. The Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME) has been the acc rediting body in the past, but it does not certify th at what naturopathic schools teach is valid. It merely ascertains that certain peripheral factors are in order. These include, according to consumer health activist Stephen Barret t, M.D., \"record-keeping, physical assets, 3 Kane E. Asthma. http://aanp.net/Library/articles.lay/EK.Asthma1.html . Emily Kane, N.D., the author of this article, is listed as a senior editor of the Journal of Naturopathic Medicine , \"the official publication of the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians.\"14financial status, makeup of the gove rning body, catalog characteristics, nondiscrimination policy, and self-evaluation system.\"4 The CNME publishes a handbook explaining its criteria for accred itation, but naturopath ic advocates did not provide it to the Commission. The National Advisory Committee on Institu tional Quality and Integrity, for the United States Department of Edu cation, voted in 1999 to deny the CNME recognition as an accrediting agency. This occurred as a result of violations found in relation to the accreditation of the Southwest College of NaturopathicMedicine. 5 The proponents of naturopathic licensure on the Commission knew this, but did not present it to the other members. This contrasts with the accrediting body for evidence-based medical schools, the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME). The LCME is concerned with such relevant issues as the content of the coursework, the preparation of newly- admitted students, evaluation of student achievement, and academic counseling. These criteria are available on-line.6 The LCME is recognized by the U.S. Department of Education, contrary to what is stated in the pro-licensure report. Testing The assertion that naturopathic testing is comparable in any substantial way to testing required of medical doctors remains merely an assertion: no examples of test questions, materials or results we re offered to the Commission by licensing advocates. Evidence from the Inspector General of Arizona's report, however,documents that there are serious problems with composition, grading and the quality of the panel that compiles the ex aminations. Evidence in that report also shows that no one who failed the exam in Arizona was denied a naturopathy license during the period of review. At le ast one of the Arizona exam writers also helped write the national examination. 3. The \"Scientific Evidence\" for Naturopathy Naturopaths assert that there is a wealth of scientific evidence for their practices. The Textbook of Natural Medicine, the major textbook of the field, cites \"10,000 references\" to support its claims. Response : The Lack of Scientific Evidence for Naturopathic Practices There is no scientific basis for the bulk of what makes up naturopathy. By disingenuously claiming credit for some practices that are uncontroversial and well known to all, such as low fat diets, naturopaths can appear to be rational and 4 Barrett S. A Close Look at Naturopathy. Quackwatch. Available at: http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelat edTopics/Naturopathy/naturopathy.html 5 Ibid. 6 http://www.lcme.org/start.htm15scientifically grounded. In fact, claims that are truly naturopath ic in origin range from pseudoscientific nonsense (see p.12 above) to outright consumer fraud, such as the use of hair analysis to dia gnose mineral deficiencies and \"toxins.\" The Textbook and Scientific Evidence The \"10,000 references\" claimed by the Textbook of Natural Medicine are irrelevant to the issues, as is shown in some detail in the accompanying review by Dr. Relman and the Naturopathy Monograph. An example is this : in a chapter on AIDS, colloidal silver is recommended for the treatme nt of opportunistic bacterial and yeast infections. The au thors justify this by citi ng a study in which colloidal silver is used not as a medicine, but as a preservative . In fact, colloidal silver is a well-known, toxic heavy metal, which the FDA has declared unsafe for anymedicinal use. Naturopaths' Unwillingness to Test Their Own Methods Naturopaths have had ample opportunity ov er many decades to test their claims scientifically, but have failed to do so. Fo r example, they claim to effectively treat streptococcal pharyngitis (strep throat) without antibiotics but \"with very low incidence of poststreptococcal sequelae\" including rheumatic heart disease. They offer no data to support this astonishing claim. Any rational physician evaluating the AANP Position Paper on \"strep throat\" wi ll quickly realize th at if naturopathic treatments were to become common, th e incidence of rheumatic fever would rebound to levels not seen since the introduction of penicillin.7 Naturopaths don't test their own methods for the simple reason that they are certain, a priori , that they work. This is a hallmark of pseudoscience. When naturopaths claim that there is \"scien tific evidence\" for their methods, it is an attempt to justify preconceived beli efs based only on na\u00efve conjectures. An Example of Scientific Evidence Offered to the Commission An example of the scientific evidence offered by the naturopathic representative on the Commission is this: when challenged to provide evidence for the assertionthat childhood ear infections are caused by dietary sugar (a common naturopathic error), she produced a bibliography of arti cles. Perusal of the list revealed that most of the articles had nothing to do with ear infections, but instead pertained to tooth decay. The others were equally irre levant, and typically came from obscure, non peer-reviewed journals. 7 Treatment of Strep pharyngitis. Position Paper of the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians. http://aanp.net/position.papers/PP.strep.html164. Naturopaths and Referrals to Medical Doctors Naturopaths state that they know when to refer patients to medical doctors. Response : A Massachusetts Study and other Evidence Refute Referral Claim Naturopaths cannot possibly know when to refer patients for competent medical care, both because they have had too little training to detect subtle signs of serious illness, and because they believe that th eir own ineffective methods can cure real diseases. This is shown abundantly in the Naturopathy Monograph , and is most striking in a survey done by a pediatrici an from Boston's Children's Hospital in 1999: only 40% of polled Massachusetts na turopaths would refe r a two-week old infant with a temperature of 101 degrees (a dire, life-threate ning emergency) for definitive medical care.8 When we presented this study to the Commission, the representatives of the natu ropaths denied that the subjects of the study were among their constituents. This is false: most of the subjects were identified through the AANP or the Massachusetts So ciety of Naturopathic Physicians. Their denial was characteristic of how naturopathy proponents, during the Commission's work, responded to criticism : real evidence, overwhelming in its refutation of naturopathic claims, was c ountered with mere assertions and claims of persecution. 5. Naturopaths Claim Unique Knowledge of Medical Secrets Naturopaths claim that they can enhan ce the public health by methods that are, apparently, unknown to medical doctors, nu rses, nutrition experts, public health experts, and other evidence-based prac titioners. Naturopaths claim to know how to \"boost the immune system\" so as to a void the need for antib iotics and prevent diseases such as cancer. They claim to \"eliminate the underlying cause of a problem, rather than merely mask the symptoms.\" They claim that most diseasesare caused by multiple \"toxins\" \"food allergies\" that naturopaths, notlegitimate toxicologists can detect. Among these toxins, according to naturopaths, are antibiotics, heart and blood pressure medicines, and most other life-saving medicines that medical doctors prescribe. Response : Naturopathy is a Mixture of Unrema rkable Claims and Absurd Theories The naturopathic claim to enhancing public health is spurious. Some of the dietary and lifestyle changes that natu ropaths suggest for patients are mundane and widely known (e.g., lose weight and ge t more exercise); others have been disproved in real studies (e.g., dietary sugar is allege d to cause hyperactivity in children) or are prima facie absurd (e.g., dietary sugar allegedly causes ear infections in otherwise he althy children by providing sugar for bacteria to eat). 8 Lee AC, Kemper KJ. Homeopathy and naturopath y: practice characteristics and pediatric care. Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med . 2000 Jan;154(1):75-80.17Any specific claims that esoteric natur opathic ministrations can boost the immune system so as to prevent cancer, for ex ample, are implausible and made without evidence, and thus constitute straightforward consumer fraud. The Myths of \"Toxins\" and \"Food Alle rgies,\" and Associated Diagnostic Quackery Equally false and alarmist are naturopa thic claims regarding toxins and food allergies (e.g., 25% of Amer icans allegedly suffer from heavy metal poisoning, and food allergies are claimed to be a major cause of problems ranging fromlearning disorders to kidney diseases). Many of the means by which naturopaths diagnose these toxins and allergies ar e outright quackery: electrodiagnostic devices (banned by the FDA as worthles s), hair analysis, applied kinesiology, iridology, and more. A practitioner who expects to find multiple offendingsubstances may well \"uncover\" these with some of these methods, while missingthe occasional real one. Im agine the pressure on the DPH to do something about these horrible toxins and allergies, once legitimized by the official diagnoses of licensed practitioners. Imagine, for that matter, the effect of this on worker'scompensation, disability insurance, union grievances, and civil court caseloads. The Assault on Rational Medicine and Public Health Initiatives: Childhood Vaccinations The systematic denigration of rational medicine and public health, by seeking to dissuade patients from taking medicine s and otherwise to undermine the public trust in rational health care, can only cause harm. Indeed, ample evidence was presented to the Commission showing that naturopathy poses threats to rational public health ini tiatives, most notably by its opposition to childhood vaccinations. This is extensively documented in the Naturopathy Monograph , and also in the study from Children's Hospital mentioned above, in which only 20% of Massachusetts natu ropaths polled said that they would recommend childhood v accinations to parents. When such evidence was presented to the Commission, the naturopathic representatives flatly denied it. It is disturbing to us that th e signatories of the pr o-licensure report seem to have minimized such a dangerous misr epresentation. In part s of the country in which anti-vaccination movements have had real influence, the incidence of serious, even deadly, childhood diseases has risen alarmingly (see pp. 40-43 of the accompanying monograph for a discussion of this issue). Because we called this issue to their attention, naturopathic advocates have included language in the pro-licensur e report suggesting a requirement for \"mandatory tracking of immunization status\" of childre n under the care of naturopaths. This is well intentioned but na\u00efve. All that would be required to defeat this provision is a tacit agreemen t between the anti-vacc ine practitioner and the apprehensive parents.18Bioterrorism, Homeopathy, and Naturopaths Here is another example of a public he alth claim that is both outrageous and relevant to current events. Dana Ullman, a nationally-known proponent of homeopathy, has recently recommended a homeopathic preparation to prevent anthrax.9 This recommendation has no basis in research and is refuted by the facts of chemistry and biology, because there is no active ingredient in the preparation. Mr. Ullman is not a naturopath, but there is ample reason to assume that naturopaths in general would subscribe to this irresponsible notion. Homeopathy is a fundamental part of the naturopathic belief system. It is taught, uncritically, in all four naturopathic school s. Mr. Ullman's website, \"Homeopathic Educational Services,\" is listed as a \"recomme nded website\" by the National College of Naturopathic Medicine.10 Homeopathy is promoted in the Textbook of Natural Medicine and recommended in virtually ev ery naturopathic treatise. The 1994 edition of the Journal of Naturopathic Medicine (the \"official publication of the AANP\") recommends homeopathic \"nosodes,\" the same sort of preparationrecommended by Mr. Ullman for anthrax, as safer and more effective than realvaccines. 11 Many naturopaths consider themselves to \"specialize\" in homeopathy. Among these is Amy Rothenberg, who made several presentations to theCommission and is editor of the New England Journal of Homeopathy . There is no basis for the claim that home opathic preparations can prevent or cure any disease. 12 We refer the reader to the accompanying Naturopathy Monograph , p.45, for a discussion of how scientifically -na\u00efve practitioners are seduced into believing that homeopathy and many ot her ineffective treatments \"work.\" 6. \"Naturopathy is Safer\" Naturopaths claim to be safer scie icians, because they use \"safe, natural remedies.\" Naturopaths, for example, claim to be able to treat diseases such as coronary artery di sease and hypertension (high blood pressure) with natural remedies that ha ve essentially no side effects. 9 Garsombke K.

Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine . In press.19Response : The Real Dangers of Naturopathy There is no evidence that naturopathic practices are safe, except in the deceptive sense that many of them amount to nothi ng at all. There is ample evidence that misinformation offered by naturopaths is dangerous, as exemplified repeatedly in this report. Two examples of many recomm ended naturopathic treatments that are unsafe, unnatural, and irrational are chelation therapy for coronary artery disease (see p.12 of the Naturopathy Monograph ) and colonic enemas for \"detoxification.\" The safety of many ot her naturopathic remedies remains a theoretical and anecdotal issue, since no studies have been done, even in states where licensure has existed for decades (one must persist in questioning the integrity of a field that relentlessly sells its methods as safe and effective without ever having subjected them to scientific scrutiny). In fact, in theory, and in anecdotal reports, naturopathy is danger ous. Examples have been cited above, and others abound in the accompanying Naturopathy Monograph . Herbal Sales, Ethics and Exploitation A particular concern is the unethical peddling of supplements and herbal preparations by naturopaths, who know little of their pharmacology and have a major financial incentive to overse ll them. These points are extensively documented in Dr. Atwood's monograph (pp.13-22 and appendix I). Language in the pro-licensure report intended to re spond to this problem (Part IV, 6) is inadequate: \"unsubstantia ted advertising claims\" about products sold by naturopaths are the norm for the field, and \"excessive charging\" could only be curbed by prohibiting th e practice altogether. 7. Competing Factions of Naturopaths Naturopaths seeking licensure claim that their on-campus training distinguishes them from other, more numerous pract itioners who call themselves \"naturopaths\" or \"traditional naturopaths\" and whose training is typically obtained through a correspondence course. Those petitioning for licensure assert that the latter grouppresents a threat to public safety and s hould therefore be excluded from licensure. Response : There is no Demonstrable Difference among Naturopaths The Commission was shown nothing to suppor t the claim of differing standards of care among naturopaths. All of the impl ausible, unproven methods that are described in this report and its appendice s are advocated by graduates and faculty of \"approved\" naturopathy schools.20\"Traditional naturopaths\" also state that thei r schools are accredited.13 The signatories of this report did not clos ely examine the claims of graduates of naturopathic correspondence schools, a nd have no opinion regarding the feud between \"naturopathic physicians\" and \"traditional natur opaths,\" except to observe that the latter may be less of a threat to public safety because they don't claim to be primary care physicians. 8. Self-Regulation by Naturopaths Naturopaths and their patrons claim that they are capable of responsible self- regulation. Response : Standard Naturopathic Practice is Substandard Medical Practice There is no reason to believe that natu ropaths can provide responsible self- regulation. The absurd and dangerous prac tices that permeate the field are not merely on its fringes, but are the standard s of practice. Such claims are promoted in the schools, in multiple treatises by naturopaths, on the website of the AANP, and in the Textbook of Natural Medicine . Consider the implications for self- regulation by comparing this with evid ence-based medical practice: the vast majority of medical doctors know that these entities have no basis in fact or reason and that professing them constitu tes unethical practice. When physicians think of discipline among their own ranks, they think of ridding the profession of such practices. It would be inconceiva ble to see such claims condoned by any board of registration, legitimate profe ssional society, specialty board, medical school, examination, or textbook. In na turopathy, on the other hand, the very leaders of the field are touting these claims. An Illustrative Case Here is an example that illustrates this point. In 1999 the Medical Board of California disciplined an internist for treating a child suffering from ADHD(attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) with an anti-fungal drug. The internist had based this treatment on the belief that the child suffered from \"candida (yeast) overgrowth\" of the gut. This is a sp urious \"diagnosis\" not confirmed by any evidence, but popular among some pseudos cientific practitioners, including naturopaths. It is promoted in the Textbook of Natural Medicine by co-editor Joseph Pizzorno, Jr., the former president of Bastyr University (see p.31 of the Naturopathy Monograph ). The California medical board correctly recognized this treatment as falling outside the standard of acceptable medical care: The use of any antifungal medication based on the diagnosis of ADHD and/or the history and physicalexamination of this patient was a departure from the 13 By the American Naturopathic Medical Cer tification and Accreditati on Board (ANMCAB). See: http://www.anma.com/21standard of practice. [Footnote: The asterisks ( *) in this document denote matters which are negligent, do not meetthe standard of practice and are aggregated together as repeated negligent acts whic h constitutes unprofessional conduct under 2234(c) of the Business and ProfessionsCode.] 14 The Board's decision, which was reaffirmed by an administrative law judge, was to revoke the physician's license unless he submitted to a five-year period of rigorous retraining and obser vation. Two physicians in New Jersey have also been disciplined for invoking the bogus \"candida overgrowth\" diagnosis.15 Consider the paradox that would result from the establishment of a board of naturopathy: diagnosing \"candida overgrowth\" of the gut as an explanation forADHD, which is a clear example of qu ackery, would be accepted as the standard of care for a group of licensed health practitioners in Massachusetts. Patient Safety Initiatives would be Undermined by a Naturopathy Board The Massachusetts legislative and executi ve branches are cu rrently involved in initiatives to reduce medical errors. Th is will involve, among other things, systematic efforts to discourage substanda rd care. It would be irrational and self- defeating for the legislature to establish a new board that would legitimizesubstandard practices. Health Fraud and the Office of Consumer Affairs The Office of Consumer Affairs (OCA) is rightfully concerned with protecting Massachusetts' citizens from health fra ud. Its \"Medical Care Information\" web page provides a link to the FTC/FDA st atement on fraudulent health claims, which includes several examples of mainstream naturopathic claims.16 The establishment of a naturopathy board woul d thus pose an irreconcilable conflict within the OCA, which would house this board. The Paradox of Naturopa thic Self-Regulation The pro-licensure report includes language intended to persuade the legislature (and the public) that a se lf-regulating board of na turopaths will provide responsible oversight of naturopathic pr actitioners. In par ticular, Part IV, 12 states: \"the regulatory authority should be empowered to take disciplinary action against licensees for: (2) fr aud, deceit or misrepresenta tion of facts in connection with the diagnosis, evaluation or treatment of any patient.\" Legislators might note, however, that virtually every interacti on that a naturopath has with a patient 14 Medical Board of CA vs. Robert Sinaiko, MD. Available at: http://www.quackwatch.com/11Ind/sinaiko.html 15 Barrett \"fraud, deceit or misrepresentation of facts.\" This is to be expected of a field that is based on preconceived fantas ies and conjectures, rather than real knowledge. Appended to this report is a series of quotations by leading naturopaths, covering a wide variety of dis eases, that further illustrates this point. It is inconceivable that a self-regulating board of naturopaths would take disciplinary action against li censees whose \"misrepresentations of facts\" are the very standards of the field. The Arizona Inspector General's Report Last year, the State of Arizona conducte d an audit of the Arizona Naturopathic Physicians Board of Medical Examiners. The result is a scathing report that describes all manner of corruption and inco mpetence. This occurred in a state that has had licensure of naturopaths for more than 60 years, and that harbors one ofthe naturopathic schools. It is of some concern to us that the existence of this document was known to at least one patron of the pro-licensure effort for several months, but he did not to reveal it to the Commission. As the definitivegovernmental study of naturopathic licen sure, the Arizona Report should have been the subject of extensive commen t at Commission meetings and in the majority report. Its findings, however, are highly critical of naturopathy and as such were never allowed to be presented. The full text is attached for the objectivereview of the reader. 9. \"Collaboration\" with Medical Doctors The pro-licensure report states that \"t he Commission believes that naturopathic medicine is complementary to conventional medicine\" and recommends that \"thenaturopathic licensing board, in consul tation with the Department of Public Health and the Board of Registration in Medicine, promulgate regulations to establish standards for collaborati on between naturopathic doctors and conventional medical doctors.\" (Part IV, 5.) Response : Naturopaths Do not Seek Collaboration The authors of the pro-licensure report are mistaken. Naturopaths do not think of what they do as \"complementary\" to evidence-based medicine. They think of naturopathy as \"a distinct system of primary health care,\" as revealed by the official definition quoted in Part II of the pro-licensu re report itself.17 This fact is further demonstrated by every naturopath ic treatise, which includes a systematic denigration of standard medicine as treating \"only the symptoms, not the underlying cause,\" and warns the reader against modern, proven pharmaceuticals, which naturopaths call \"toxins.\" 17 AANP Definition of Naturopathic Medicine (emphasis added). Available at: http://aanp.net/position.papers/PP.definition.html23It is thus highly unlikely th at naturopaths could be we dged into a \"collaborative\" role with medical doctors. This is entirely different from the MD/nurse practitioner issue, in which there was no quarrel between the two groups regarding the rational basis of medicine itself. If natur opaths were to agree to a bill that requires collaboration as a cond ition of licensure, that should be viewed with suspicion: their training and tenets suggest that they would agree only as a matter of political expediency, and hope to minimize its effects on their practice later. Moreover, any medical doctors who would agree to work with naturopaths are either na\u00efve, or of dubious characte r themselves. The fact that there may be such MD's should provide little comfort to anyone concerned with public welfare or professional ethics. Ethical Requirements for M.D.'s Indeed, the prospect of medical doctors collaborating with pseudoscientific practitioners is in direct conflict with medical ethics, and hence with the charge of the Board of Registration in Medicine . Medical doctors are bound by a code of ethics that effectively prohibits them from engaging in any collaboration that involves gratuitously unscientific pract ices. The relevant passages from the American Medical Association Code of Medical Ethics18 are as follows (emphasis added): E-3.01 Nonscientific Practitioners. It is unethical to engage in or to aid and abet in treatment which has no scientific basis and isdangerous, is calculated to deceive the patient by givingfalse hope, or which may cause the patient to delay inseeking proper care. E-3.04 Referral of Patients. A physician may refer a patient for diagnostic or therapeutic services to another physician, limited practitioner, or any other prov ider of health care services permitted by law to furnish such services, whenever he orshe believes that this may benefit the patient. As in the caseof referrals to physician-specia lists, referrals to limited practitioners should be based on their individual competence and ability to perf orm the services needed by the patient. A physician should not so refer a patient unless the physician is confident that the services provided on referral will be performed competently and in accordance with accepted scientific standards and legal requirements. (V, VI) Issued prior to April 1977. 18 AMA Code of Medical Ethics. Available at: http://www.ama-assn.org/ama /pub/category/2503.html24E-8.20 Invalid Medical Treatment. The following general guidelines are offered to serve physicians when they are called upon to decide amongtreatments: (1) Treatments which have no medical indication and offer no possible benefit to the patient should not beused (Opinion 2.035). (2) Treatments which have been determined scientifically to be invalid should not be used (Opinion3.01). E-9.132 Health Care Fraud and Abuse. The following guidelines encourage physicians to play a key role in identifyin g and preventing fraud : (1) Physicians must renew their commitment to Section II of the AMA's Principles of Medical Ethics which states that \"a physician shall deal honestly with patients and colleagues, and strive to expose those physicians deficient in character, competence, or who engage in fraud or deception .\" V. A physician shall continue to study, apply and advance scientific knowledge, make relevant information available to patients, colleagues, and the public , obtain consultation, and use the talents of other health professionals when indicated. The Massachusetts Medical Society prom ulgates the same code of ethics, as follows: The Council of the Massachusetts Medical Society on February 9, 1983, voted to adopt the AMA Principles of Medical Ethics as the Massac husetts Medical Society Code25of Ethics. This Code is intended to establish general principles and rules of conduct for membership in the Society.19 Science, Honesty, and Informed Consent Such language, requiring a sc ientific underpinning for the practice of medicine, represents a fundamental transformation of medical ethics over the past century. It is no longer ethically permissible for physic ians to base their judgments primarily on the vicissitudes of personal opinion, pa tient satisfaction, te stimonials, social trends, conjecture, or the many other non-sc ientific considera tions. All of these play a role in compassionate medical pr actice, of course, but objective evidence must always come first. Even when there is no scientifically validated treatment for a condition, physicians are obliged to explain this to pa tients in the most honest terms. This is the very basis for our modern understanding of informed consent. It is the most important ethi cal innovation that modern medicine has to offer. Naturopaths lack this ethical foundati on. They claim that their methods are \"continually reexamined in the light of scientific advances,\"20 but this is plainly false. Many naturopathic claims are refuted prima facie by science: consider the assertion regarding hydrogen peroxide and asthma on p.12 above. Other claims, implausible but not impossible, could l ong ago have been proved or disproved by simple, straightforward studies that natur opaths have failed to perform: consider the assertion regarding strep throat described on p.15 above. Many more of both types of claims are discussed in the Naturopathy Monograph . Naturopaths have not studied their methods for the simple r eason that they have always been certain that they work. By any reasonable modern standard, this certitude is unwarrantedand dishonest. It is a throwback to the 19 th century origins of the field, and not in keeping with the integrity that can reasona bly be expected of health care providers in the 21st century. Ethical Physicians would Oppose Collaboration with Naturopaths Evidence-based physicians, therefore, are bound by their ethical code to oppose any scheme that would establish a form al collaboration between themselves and naturopaths, because this would inevit ably result in unsc ientific, fraudulent practices being rendered by such a team. The examples given in this report and its appendices provide ample evidence of this truth. Medical licensees who condone naturopa thic methods or premises could be vulnerable to discipline: for unscientif ic, substandard care; for conduct that undermines public confidence in the medical profession; or fo r ethical violations such as selling unproven herbs from the o ffice at substantial profits, which are fundamental and are recognized univer sally by physician licensing boards in this 19 Code of Ethics. Available at: http://www.massmed.org/about/ethics.asp 20 AANP Definition of Naturopathic Medicine. op cit.26country and abroad. For the legislature to nullify such discipline by an act of law would be a negation of the highest order of medical ethics, and a defeat for the public interest. The DPH should not Condone Naturopathy Language in the pro-licensure report s uggesting that the Department of Public Health be involved in \"promulgating re gulations to establish standards for collaboration\" is subject to the same obj ections. The DPH, which is interested in patient safety, should not appear to promote implausible, unproven methods in any fashion. Licensed naturopaths would, moreover, be a giant, unnecessary headache for the DPH. Naturopaths would continue to proclaim that multiple toxins and foodallergies are the underlying causes of di sease, that heavy metal poisoning is common, that water fluoridation is a hea lth hazard, that bioterrorism can be prevented by homeopathic preparati ons, that childhood immunizations are dangerous and unnecessary, that most peopl e suffer from chronic yeast infections, and that there are esoteric methods , known only to naturopaths and other \"alternative\" practitioners, for preventing cancer and othe r serious diseases. All of these claims are false and in direct confli ct with the efforts of the DPH, but would have the appearance of validity once espous ed by licensed practitioners. It would be self-defeating, and confusi ng to the public, for the DPH to appear to play a role in legitimizing such claims. 10. Licensure in other States Naturopaths claim that their licensure in other states lends legitimacy to their quest for licensure in Massachusetts. Response : The Reality of Naturopathic Licensing in Other States Licensure of naturopaths in other states is a result of several factors, none of which has to do with legitimacy. First, it exists in only 11 states. The realquestion, then, is why has it been reject ed in 39? Some states that license naturopaths have done it for decades, dating to the early part of the 20 th century, when modern medical advances were still in their infancy. Most states that had licensure at that time later rescinded it , after it became clear that rational medicine is in the public's best interest. In two states, Tennessee, and South Carolina, naturopathy is illegal. A few states have granted licensure to naturopaths relatively recently, without a ny real consideration of the content of naturopathic claims and practices, as though somehow th e exercise of codifying an otherwise illegitimate practice will make it safe fo r the public. This is what the licensure effort in Massachusetts attempts to do, and why there is no mention of the realissues involved, i.e., naturopathic claims and practices, in the pro-licensure report.27The Arizona report, as previously descri bed, illustrates the fo lly of naturopathic licensure in a state that has a re latively large numbe r of practitioners. Licensure of Naturopaths is Foster ed by Disingenuous Business Interests The recent, successful licensure effort in at least one state, Utah, was financed by the multi-billion dollar dietary supplements industry, which stands to profit fromthe promiscuous overselling of supplemen ts by naturopaths. This documented on p.20 of the Naturopathy Monograph , and is typical of the unethical business interest that exis ts between naturopaths and purveyors of supplements and \"natural medicines.\" 11. Public Demand for Naturopathy Naturopaths and their patrons claim that there is an increasing public demand for \"complementary and alternative medici ne\" that justifies the licensure of naturopaths at this time. Response : The Demand for Naturopathy is Small While there may be a public interest in \"CAM\" that is more noticeable now than several years ago, this does not reflect an increasing demand for naturopaths . Surveys of CAM use in the past decade have documented that most of it consists of relaxation techniques, massage, and casual self-treatment with dietary supplements, readily available to all c onsumers in the wake of the 1994 Dietary and Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA). The largest recent survey of actual use of CAM practitioners , also the most representative of the American population, found that about 8% of American s (not 44% as stated in the press) seek such consultation, and this is mo stly accounted for by chiropractors and massage therapists. Naturopathic consultatio ns of any sort were too infrequent to be mentioned, and must be assumed to be included in the category labeled \"other,\" which accounted for 0.4%.21 Even many states with licensing have had little demand. New Hampshire, for example, currently licenses only twenty-sixnaturopaths, although licensure has existed there since 1993. Interest Alone Does Not Justify Licensing Prior to Investigation The recent public interest in \"CAM\" has been fueled, undoubtedly, by DSHEA and the abundance of irresponsible claims made for various implausible methods. The public would like to know if thes e claims might actually be true. Enthusiasm for \"alternative\" methods does not imply that every claim be given carte blanche by the state to be portr ayed to the public as safe and effective prior 21 Druss BG and Rosenheck RA. Association between use of unconventional therapies and conventional medical services. JAMA . 1999 Aug 18;282(7):651-6.28to investigation. Dr. Edzard Ernst, Director of the De partment of Complementary Medicine, School of Postgraduate Medici ne and Health Sciences, University of Exeter, England, has echoed this point. Dr. Ernst is enthusiastic about \"alternative medicine\" but believes that it must be evaluated according to strict, scientific criteria. In a statement that seems di rected at this debate, he writes: Those who would prefer to bypass rigorous research--for example, by shifting the discussion towards patients'preference--and hope to integr ate unproved treatments into routine health care are unlikel y to succeed in the long run. Those who believe that regu lation is a substitute for evidence will find that even the most meticulous regulation of nonsense must still result in nonsense. 22 Evidence-Based Medicine will Inev itably Incorporate Proven Methods The demand for \"alternative\" practices can be met, and already is, without a state- sponsored promotion of naturopathy or any other unproven, implausible, and dangerous method. In particular, res ponsible studies of various herbal preparations are in progress in many setti ngs, and to the extent that these prove useful they will inevitably be incorporated into medical practice. A Title Protection Act is not Designed to Meet Demand It is not at all clear, in any event, that a \"title protection\" act would increase the numbers of naturopaths in Massachusetts, ev en if it resulted in an increase in the number seeking licensure. If it also result ed in a flight of other naturopaths who, at present, number approximately 70 here , the result could be a net reduction in the number of naturopaths. If the patrons of licensure seriously believe, as stated in their report, that the goal is to fu lfill popular demand, they will have defeated their own intent. It seems lik ely that the real goal is to persuade government to favor one group of naturopaths over another, thus limiting competition. Why not License Heroin Dealers? Rational thinking dictates that even if there were a significant demand for the services of an inherently dangerous practice, this would not automatically translate to any legisla tive action favoring such a practice. Otherwise, why wouldn't the legislature seek to license heroin dealers? 22 Ernst E. The Role of Complementary and Alternative Medicine. British Medical Journal 2000;321:1133- 1135 ( 4 November ). (Italics added)29The Nature of the Evidence Offered to the Commission by Advocates of Naturopathy We reiterate that the only comprehensive i nvestigations of the beliefs and claims of naturopathy heard by the Commission were t hose prepared by the Massachusetts Medical Society and the Board of Registration in Medicine. The pro-licen sure report includes several assertions regarding naturopathic treatments and popularity that are false. Here are two examples: \"Evidence presented to the Commissi on shows that the science supporting naturopathic medicine is evolving a nd demand for treatment is increasing.\" \"If delivered by well-trained practitioners, modalities employed by naturopathic doctors are successful in treating a variety of health conditions.\" The Commission heard no evidence to support ei ther of these assertions. Legislators might consider challenging natu ropathic advocates to provide even a single example of a method, specific to naturopathy, that has been proven to \"successfully treat\" any disease. The naturopathic representatives provi ded only two \"expert \" witnesses: Amy Rothenberg, a naturopath who is editor of the New England Journal of Homeopathy , and Dr. Alan Trachtenberg, a medical doctor w ho had taught at one of the naturopathic schools during the 1980's. Ms. Rothenberg's presentation mentioned a fe w naturopathic clinical practices, which were the only ones presented by advocates. These included the use of various \"natural medicines\" for the treatment of real diseas es, for which there is no evidence of efficacy (see the Naturopathy Monograph , pp.13-22, and appendix I); the use of homeopathic for which there is neither ev idence nor plausibility; and a few innocuous practices of dubious value, such as \"wrapping the feet with wet bl ankets to draw the congestion out of the ear.\" It is clear to me dical experts that the real effect of such ministrations is to offer comfort to na\u00efve patients. There is nothing wrong with offering comfort, of course, but the naturopathic claim is that these practices cure real diseases. Ms. Rothenberg assured the Commission that naturopaths know when to refer patients to medical doctors. Her lack of training in ev idence-based medicine, together with her unwavering confidence in naturopathic ministrations, suggested otherwise. Ms. Rothenberg avoided discussion of th e more obviously disturbing naturopathic practices, such as enemas for \"detoxificati on,\" \"aromatherapy\" for the treatment of the acute stroke patient, manipulation of the bones of the skull to treat childhood learning disorders, gems and minerals \"worn as je welry, or placed around the home in special places\" for the treatment of asthma, referrals of cancer patients to Mexican clinics for Laetrile and other illegal or discredited tr eatments, \"electrical cu rrent in the form of positive galvanism, applied transrectally\" for cancer of the prostate, and many more.30Dr. Trachtenberg did not discuss the actual practices of naturopaths. He did belie their claim to be primary care physicians when he stated that they \"compare favorably to nurse practitioners and physician's assistants.\" We note that in Massachusetts, nurse practitioners and physician's assistants are no t given the scope to practice independently, but must practice under physician supervisi on. These practitioners, furthermore, are distinctly more qualified than naturopath s. Any comparison between naturopaths and nurse practitioners must acknowledge that th e latter understand that there is a rational, ethical basis for the practice of medicine , while the former do not. Dr. Trachtenberg failed to make this distinction. Dr. Trachtenberg also made the following as sertions, excerpted minutes: \"The pre-clinical, basic sciences curr icula at naturopathic medical schools is at least as rigorous as that for chirop ractors, who are already subject to state licensure.\" \"The scientific evidence about the efficacy of naturopathic medicine is mixed.\" (He offered no examples) \"Some naturopathic interventions are actually superior to commonly-accepted and commonly-used conventional medi cal interventions.\" (He offered no examples) The first statement is irrele vant, but suggests that the basic science curriculum at naturopathic schools lacks rigo r; the other two are false. Dr. Trachtenberg betrayed a na ivet\u00e9 concerning naturopathic claims when he suggested to the Commission that naturopaths could be the \"learned intermed iaries\" that the public needs to make sense of the myriad \"natural remedies\" that are freely available because of the Dietary and Supplement Health and Educ ation Act of 1994. In fact, naturopaths lack the scientific expertise and the will to cri tically evaluate these materials, but promote them anyway. Naturopaths typically sell these ag ents, at a considerable profit, directly to patients. These points are ex tensively documented in the Naturopathy Monograph (pp.13-22 and appendix I). The Majority on the Commission did not Wish to Evaluate Naturopathic Claims The Commission did not Solicit Expert Opinions It is worrisome that the signatories of th e pro-licensure report seemed uninterested in evaluating the claims of na turopaths according to accep ted scientific and ethical standards. For example, we must assume that they were skeptical of Dr. Atwood's critique, perhaps imagining that it represente d the slanted view of organized medicine. If so, why did not these members seek independe nt verification? Why, for example, didn't they ask for a pulmonary specialist to exam ine naturopathic claims regarding asthma? Why didn't they seek a pediatrician to discu ss ear infections? Why di dn't they consider a physiologist, who needn't have been a me dical doctor, to discuss naturopathic31pretensions to understanding ba sic science? Why didn't they ask for a public health specialist, readily available from the DPH (which was represented on the Commission), to address childhood vaccinations , food allergies, and \"toxins ?\" Why didn't they consult an ethicist to consider the conflict of inte rest at work when naturopaths sell herbs and vitamins to their patients? That is a problem with far worse implications, both for healthand for commercial fraud, than is suggested by the pro-licensure re port. Suggestions such as these were made by us to the Commission, but were unheeded. Conjecture vs. Fact We are concerned that several members of the Commission viewed the arguments merely as differing points of view, with each side ha ving equal validity. This is false. The basic disagreements between medical scientists a nd naturopaths are not matters of conjecture but of fact. The skin can't absorb enough oxyge n to help a victim of acute asthma, any more than a lead brick dropped from the top of the Prudential Center will go to the moon. Laetrile doesn't work. An infa nt with a temperature of 101 \u00b0 F needs urgent medical attention. There is no relation be tween the skin's electrical resistance and the presence of a parasite infection. \"Ozone enemas\" have no role in the treatment of cancer. Squeezing a child's skull cannot cure a learning disorder. These are not examples of \"paradigm\"differences or political pref erences or turf protection or closed-mindedness. These are matters of fact. Another disturbing assertion made repeatedly by advocates for naturopathic licensure was that the lack of scientific evidence for naturopathy and other \"alternative\" practices doesnot distinguish them from evidence-based me dicine, because \"only 15% of conventional medical practices have been proven scientifica lly.\" This is also false, and was misleading to those members of the Commission who are not medically knowledgeable. 23 Misrepresentations such as these are unbefitting a state Co mmission whose charge is to advise the legislature concerning matters of health and safety. The Effect of Licensing Health Professions Public Perceptions State licensing of a profession inevitably le ads to increased publ ic acceptance of the services offered by that profession. In hea lth care, this implies that the government assures the validity of the claims made by the licensed profession. Thus the government has a covenant with its citizens to act with the utmost care and integrity with regard to the licensing of health-related fields. Health Insurance Licensing is also a necessary precursor to in surance coverage. The appearance of state endorsement encourages unscientific practitio ners to pressure both public and private institutions for reimbursement for ineffective methods. All private insu rers in the state of 23 The evidence for standard medical practices is st rong, and growing stronger all the time. See, for example: Imrie RH, Ramey DW. The Med 2001;5:(2)108-108 . See, also, pp. 45-48 of the Naturopathy Monograph for a further discussion of this point.32Washington, for example, must now reimbur se naturopaths by force of the \"every category of provider\" law.24 This outrageous law turns the concept of \"freedom of choice\" on its head: the vast majority of subscribers, who recognize the folly of pseudoscientific claims, are now required to subsidize the small minority who don't. The insurers themselves, who should respect the ethical code of the profession (medicine) that makes their existence possible, are for ced by law to violate that code. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts s hould resist this state of a ffairs with every fiber of its legislative being. Public Safety The public derives benefits from licensure of a health profession only when it can be demonstrated that the profession operates acco rding to established ethical and scientific standards, that deviation from these standard s will result in public harm, and that the state has the capacity to oversee the work of li censed providers. Naturopathy fulfills none of these criteria. During the course of our deliberations, one of us (Dr. Atwood) corresponded with William Jarvis, Ph.D., the executive direct or of the National Council Against Health Fraud and a professor of public health at Lo ma Linda University. He has been studying naturopathy for years. Here is what he wrote: I believe that it is a disservi ce to the public to give ND's the look of legitimacy by licensure. True believers will goto ND's whether they are licensed or not. Licensure placesin jeopardy relatively unsophisticated members of the general public who cannot be blamed for thinking that state licensure indicates validity and trustworthiness. Previous Investigations of Naturopa thy have Reached Similar Conclusions The 1968 Medicare Report In 1968, naturopaths asked the U.S. Departme nt of Health, Education and Welfare to consider Medicare reimbursement for thei r practices. The department conducted a thorough investigation and returned an unfa vorable decision. The HEW report concluded: Naturopathic theory and pr actice are not based on the body of basic knowledge related to health, disease, and health care that has been widely accepted by the scientific community. Moreover, irrespectiv e of its theory, the scope and quality of naturopathic education do not prepare the practitioner to make an adequate diagnosis and provideappropriate treatment. 25 24 Insurance Coverage at Bastyr Center for Natural Health. http://www.bastyr.edu/clinic s/bastyr/info/insurance.asp 25 HEW Report on Naturopathy (1968). Available at: http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryR elatedTopics/Naturopathy/hew.html33The Most Recent Large Study Little has changed since that time. A recen t treatise on naturopathy came to similar conclusions: In our research for this chapter, we provided naturopaths and their professional associations ample opportunity to refute the conclusions of several major commissions ofinquiry over the years that deemed their therapeutic rationale lacking in scientif ic credibility. None of our informants was able to convince us that the field had takenthese earlier critiques to heart; in fact, precious few seemedto recognize that a problem still exists. [O]ur ownbibliographic searches failed to discover any properly controlled clinical trials that supported claims of the profession, except in a few limited areas wherenaturopaths' advice concurs with that of orthodox medical science. Where naturopathy a nd biomedicine disagree, the evidence is uniformly to the detriment of the former. We therefore conclude that c lients drawn to naturopaths are either unaware of the well-established scientific deficiencies of naturopathic practice or choose willfully to disregard them on ideological grounds. 26 Government should not License Belief Systems Naturopathy is best understood as a cult. It is based not on science but on a mix of beliefs and testimonials. Naturopaths from differe nt schools disagree on what is included in naturopathy, other than a beli ef in \"the healing power of nature.\" The Commonwealth of Massachusetts does not and should not license cults, belief systems, or philosophies. The Commonwealth does not lic ense psychics or astrologers, for example. To do so would be unwarranted, because their claims are evidenced only by the testimonials of their clients but are contradicted by facts. Su ch claims are remarkably similar to those of naturopaths, and there is likewise a clear , if small, public demand for psychic and astrologic \"services.\" We maintain that to license naturopaths would be equivalent to licensing psychics or astrologers, who have training programs, pe riodicals, continuing education courses and other trappings of legitimacy, and who make similar claims regarding \"healing.\"27 26 Beyerstein BL and Downey S.

The majority on the Commission was curiously uninterested in the actual content of naturopathic practices. Why this may be escapes us, for it is this considerati on that bears most on public safety. Conclusions Naturopathy After conducting extensive research, we are steadfastly opposed to the licensure of naturopaths. It is obvious to us that doing so would legitimize, in the eyes of the public, a dangerous and unethical pr actice. Naturopaths themselves have presented data showing that in some states in which licensure has been implemented, their numbers have rise n rapidly, and the pressure for more legitimacy, e.g., insurance covera ge, is intense. We view su ch results as a threat to public safety, and maintain that the co ntinuation of the cu rrent status of non- licensure, together with laws proscribi ng the illegitimate practice of medicine, is the best way to protect the public. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts must not be in the business of promoting quackery, even if it occurs as a result of well-intentioned efforts to provide regulation. Health care misrepresentatio ns by naturopaths, including the several mentioned above and many more discussed in the accompanying documents,abound in the public domain. No legislation can reach into the Internet or censor popular books to refute such misconceptio ns. Licensure would only appear to legitimize it. Self-regulation by naturopath s is a classic example of \"the fox guarding the chicken coop.\" Wisdom dict ates that the best course for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is to de ny official endorsement of naturopathy and let it remain the relatively insignifi cant, fringe practice that it has always been. \"Complementary and alternat ive medicine\" in General 1. \"Complementary and alternative medicin e\" (CAM) is not a si ngle entity, but a huge, eclectic assortment of beliefs and cl aims about health care. These include the traditional, prescientific health belief s of various cultures and other, relatively modern initiatives stemming from many sources. Many are the fanciful musings of one or a few charismatic figures, frequently from 19th century Europe or America: examples are homeopathy, the s ubluxation theory of chiropractic, and naturopathy itself. If there is any common thread that binds these widely disparate claims, it is their lack of scientific va lidation: many have already been disproved, others have not been scientifically evaluated, and many are incompatible with biological and physical facts. Thus it is not reasonable to make blanke t statements favoring \"CAM\" as a general concept. Those who do so are either na \u00efve or are ideologues. Each CAM claim35must be evaluated according to its own merits. Any future Commission formed to study nonstandard medical claims should consis t of a majority that is interested in a fair and expert evaluation of such cl aims. It should not consist of ideologues. 2. There will always be fanciful health claims that range from the relatively innocuous to the outright dangerous. Most of these will inevitably fall through the regulatory cracks, in spite of the best intentions of government. It would be impossible to regulate all of them, a nd unwise to try. Existing laws governing consumer fraud, assault, and the illegit imate practice of me dicine should be invoked when necessary. Licensure and registration schemes, however wellintentioned, tend to encourage illegitimate health practices, rather than to limit them. 3. The best way for government to help citizens make sense of nonstandard health claims, while respecting freedom of choi ce, is through education. We recommend that the legislature direct the Departme nt of Public Health and the Office of Consumer Affairs to collaborate on an educational program. We recommend that in doing so, these agencies seek counsel not from advocates, but from experts. There are numerous experts in Massachus etts, covering every medical field, who could help with such a project. There ar e also organizations of experts who are familiar with nonstandard claims and have already applied scientific scrutiny tomany of them. Examples are the National Council Against Health Fraud, nowheadquartered in Peabody, MA, and the C ouncil for Scientific Medicine, whose membership includes several from the medical schools in Massachusetts. We note that the OCA has already made a good start with its link to the FTC/FDA statement on fraudulent health claims, as described above, but a more comprehensive effort is needed. "}
