Vaccine hesitancy is defined as 'a behaviour, influenced by a number of factors including issues of confidence (level of trust in vaccine or provide r), complacency ( do not perceive a need for a va ccine, do not value the vaccine), and convenience (access) . Vaccine -hesitant individuals are a heterogeneous group that are indecisive in varying degrees about specific vaccines or vaccination in general. Vac cine-hesitant individuals may accept all vaccines but remain concerned about vaccines, some may refuse or delay s ome vaccines, but accept others, and some individuals may refuse all vaccines ' [1]. The aim of the rapid literature review is to bring together knowledge and research related to vaccine hesitancy in the EU and in EEA countries into a format that is easy to understand and follow. The review focuses on identifying what is known about: who the hesitant populations are what are e nablers and b arriers to vaccination uptake for these hesitant p opulations what is known about successful interventions targeting these populations; especially, interventions provided for and by healthcare providers (HCPs). The results of this review are summarised in this document which lists all key references (peer reviewed and grey literature) with columns on country, targeted population, specific vaccine(s), identified determinants of hesitancy, intervention (if proposed) , as well as an indication of whether the interventi on was evaluated. Gaps in knowledge identified will be used to inform the development of a qualitative study in three countries. Knowledge gained from the rapid literature review and the qualitative study will be used to inform the development of a 'Let's talk about hesitancy ' supplement to the ECDC 'Let's talk about protection ' guide. Methods for the rapid literature review The methodology chosen was a rapid assessment of the literature rather than a systematic literature review. What differentiates this rapid assessment from a systematic review is the method used to screen for articles. The most relevant a rticles were selected through a rapid screen of titles and abstracts by one reviewer rather than in a systematic manner with multiple reviewers. In orde r to ensure that the search was as inclusive as possible, a search for articles was performed using a 'systematic review ' method: searching through multiple general databases using a detailed search strategy with keywords and MeSH terms. The initial select ion of articles was done by removing duplicates and excluding articles published before 2004. Initially selected a rticles were then screened based on agreed criteria for final inclusion in the study The search strategy was developed in Medline and then ada pted as required by differential indexing across several multidisciplinary mainstream and regional databases including: Embase Classic & Embase, Global Health, Scopus, Web of Science, and OpenGrey. The strategy included an extensive list of keywords (Table 1) and related MeSH/subject headings in an effort to capture the many dimensions and expressions of vaccine confidence, trust and hesitancy. All articles in all languages were included in the search but only articles in English, French, Greek or Croatian were kept after sorting through all selected articles. These were selected to match the countries which responded to ECDC's call for interest in participating in the 'Comprehensive expert opinion on motivating hesitant population groups to vaccinate ' project. The reviewer chose to restrict articles to these languages with the aim of informing the development of the qualitative study, to be conducted in France, Greece and Croatia. The search was performed across al l databases during the period 3 -4 November 2 014. In addition, various experts in the field were contacted with a request for relevant literature; and na tional and international organis ations' websites (ECDC, World Health Organization , National Institiute for Public Health and the Environment - Nethe rlands , and the United Nations Children's Fund ) were searched for additional relevant documen ts in English as well as in languages of countries within which qualitative studies will be conducted , such as French.

Articles were included if they were published between 2004 and 2014 in Europe (with exception noted below), and if they focused on the following topics: vaccine hesitancy, public trust/distrust, perceptions, concerns, confidence, attitudes, beliefs about vaccines and vaccination programmes by individuals (such as parents, healthcare workers), groups or communities. Articles were excluded if they were not about human vaccines, were about vaccines that are not yet available (such as the HIV vaccine) , or were publications on research and development (unless about public trust, confidence , concern or hesitancy). A decision was made to include a selection of highly relevant articles from other parts of the world so as to reinforce the quality of the review. These articles were identified through communication with experts (see PRISMA flow d iagram in Annex 2). Box 1.

TECHNICAL REPORT Rapid literature review on motivating hesitant population groups in Europe to vaccinate 3 Box 2. Inclusion criteria applied to grey literature studies Data from the selected articles was extracted, coded and analysed by country, hesitant popu lation, vaccine, determinants of vaccine hesitancy , intervention and target audience, and e valuatio n of interventions (see Tables A1-A3). Results of the rapid literature review A total of 7 492 articles w ere gathered through the initial database search, w hich was complemented by four articles imported from other sources. After removing duplicates, there were 5 024 articles left, out of which 2 673 were excluded based on publication year (published before 2004). A rapid assessment of the remaining 2 899 articles was performed by screening titles and abstracts. Based on the agreed exclusion and inclusion articles, 226 articles were selected for fuller screen ing and 29 articles were included in the full data extraction phase. Final selection of the 29 articles were made and agreed by two reviewers based on the relevancy and importance of articles. As this was a rapid assessment of the literature, only the most highly relevant articles, agreed by both reviewers, were kept for data extraction. Articles were exclu ded which were not on currently available human vaccines , and which did not focus on vaccine hesitancy, trust, confidenc e or concern (see full list in B ox 1 and 2). Out of the 29 articles, five were from the Netherlands, five from the UK, two from Sweden, two from the US, one from Romania, one from Germany, one from France, one from Greece, one from Poland, and one from Hungary. Three articles looked at hesitancy in the world, two in Europe and four studied various countries at once (England, Romania, Russi a, Norway, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Germany and Belgium). There were 10 articles looking specifically into the seasonal influenza vaccine, four into the HPV vaccine, two into the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) vaccine, one into the herpes zoster vaccine, and one into the pertussis vaccine. In addition, seven articles studied all types of vaccines and six focused on childhood vaccines. Study populations The literature review identified several study populations, in which determinants of vacc ine refusals or hesitancy were ascertained : parents [2,3,1,4,5,6 -9], mothers [10], religious communities [11,12,13 ], healthcare workers [14,15,1,16 -18], immigrants [19], social media users [20], pregnant women [21], patients with chronic diseases [22,23 ], and the elderly [24]. Although no article focused entirely on 'hesitant populations ', researchers detected vaccine hesitant populations within each of their study populations. While no study group was found to be entirely hesitant, researchers raised conce rns about the possible formation of clusters of vaccine hesitant populations which might expand and affect the general public [25]. For instance, Lehman raised the concern that when a high proportion of vaccine providers and doctors are hesitant, this migh t impact vaccine uptake , and other studies have shown that this is especially the case if doctors in these communities are perceived as the most trusted source of information [14,15,16,17,18 ]. Determinants of vaccination (enablers and barriers) The term 'determinants of vaccination ' incorporates all the concepts of vaccine hesitancy; including, barriers and enablers for uptake, reasons for vaccine refusal, beliefs and attitudes towards vaccination, and vaccine acceptance procedures. In order to capture all these concepts, it was decided to substitute the broader term determinants for enablers and barriers of vaccination. This review has adopted the conceptual framework developed by the World Health Organization Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) working group as a way of grouping and classifying 'determinants' identi fied in the literature review (see Figure 1). This framework identifies three categories of determinants; contextual, individual and group influen ces and vaccine and vaccination specific issues. The reviewer attempted to provide some quantitative notion of how frequently each determinant appeared in the literature. The following section summarises all the determinants of vaccination retrieved by the rapid literature review, and provides th e number of times each one appears in the articles reviewed (see Table 2 and Figure 2). This quantification method was found to be a convenient, although a statistically limited, way of obtaining a broader picture of the range and importance of determinant s of vaccine hesitancy in the European literature.

Contextual influences include historic, social, cultural, environmental, economic, politica l and institutional factors which might influence vaccine hesitant populations. The most common 'contextual influence ' reported in the reviewed studies (seven mentions) w ere conspiracy theories, which include a fear that vaccines are introduced to serve th e economic and/or political interests of pharmaceutical companies [10,20 ], Western countries [10,20 ], governments [20], and a belief that vaccines are implemented as a strategy to reduce world population [10]. Religious fatalism [2,19,20,13, 8] was reported five times and included beliefs that 'God's decisions are to be trusted ' [2,13] or that human s are created as they should be [19] and that vaccines are not needed. Three articles mentioned negative exposure to the media as a determinant of hesitancy [2,1,4]. This includes hearing, reading or seeing negative rumours and myths about vaccines in the general media. The perception that vaccines are being forced u pon the population and violat ed human rights , was listed three times as a determinant [10,20]. TECHNICAL REPORT Rapid literature review on motivating hesitant population groups in Europe to vaccinate 5 Individual and group influences include personal perceptions or beliefs of the vaccines and influences from the social environment. The most common determinant of non -vaccinatio n was the belief that vaccines are unsafe, and more specifically that they can cause severe diseases and side effects [2,3,11,10,14,26,15,20,21,22,,27,13,4 ,16,5,17,18 ,22,24,8, 9], that their long -term effects are unknown [3,26,20,5 ], that risks outweigh benefits [2,10], and that they contain dangerous adjuvants [2,12,20,27 ]. These belie fs were encountered 31 times in 22 articles and were the most common determinants found amongst all categories. There were twelve reports of a lack of information and knowledge about either the vaccine or the disease, which sometimes lead to misperceptions about vaccination or targeted diseases, as a common determinant of vaccine hesitancy [3,11,26,1,27,4, 29, 16,18,28 ]. The belief that there is a very low risk of getting the disease or suffering severely from its symptoms was found 10 times in the literatu re [2,11,12,27,29,17 ,24]. Perceptions that the vaccine is not effective and does not prevent the disease was also found 10 times [2,15,12,16,29,16,5,17,18,23,28, 8]. There were nine reports of a general mistrust in institutions, and more specifically in the provision of health services and health systems [3,10,26,12,5 ,24]. Only one article, reviewing HPV vaccination acceptance amongst mothers in Romania, reported a mistrust in doctors due to their lack of objectivity and commercial interests m [10]. The revi ew recorded nine mentions of the belief that individuals are healthy enough and that their immune system is strong enough not to require vaccination [2,12,16,23 ]. Social norms and pressure from friends and family [14,15,4,29,16, 8] were reported six times a s a determinant of hesitancy , and not prioritising vaccination [14,15,4,29,16, 8] was also reported six times. Social norm influences include discussions and informal talks with friends, family members, peers, co -workers or community members. Six articles f ound that hesitant populations can be against vaccination in general [27,4,29,5,18 ,24]. The belief that vaccination is not natural and an expressed preference for alternative prevention methods such as homeopathy was recorded five times [20,22,16,5, 8]. Four articles reported that individuals sometimes believe that diseases can be beneficial for building resistance and should therefore not be prevented [3,1,4,14 ]. Fear of injection was found four times [11,26,5,28 ] and so was having previously had a negative experience with vaccines (personal or from friends and families) [2,29,16, 8]. The fear and belief that children's bodies are not strong enough to fight the effects of vaccines was mentioned in three articles [2,10,5 ], and a feeling of responsibility if so mething were to happen to children after vaccination was mentioned in one study [10]. Vaccine and vaccination specif ic issues include nine results which showed that some individuals did not perceive a medical need for the vaccine [11,14,21,27,13,29,5,18,8]. The problem of access (timing or availability of vaccines) was encountered seven times [14,19,1,22,4,24,8]. Two of these articles were looking at healthcare workers [14] and patients with chronic diseases [4] in the UK, two were looking into immigrants [19] and the elderly [24] in the Netherlands , and one was looking at chronic disease patients [22] in France. Access issues were encountered regarding the influenza vaccine (seasonal or pandemic) and childhood vaccines. T he issue of financial cost was foun d to be a determinant six times [26,1,22,29,23,28]. A lack of recommendation s from providers was encountered four times in the literature [4,18,24]. Two studies focused on refusals in response to the novelty of the vaccine [22,5], and a consequent fear of insufficient testing and knowledge . Two other studies pointed to the impact of inconsistent advice from healthcare providers [3,22].

Interventions targeting the influenza vaccine, for instance , have mostly been focused on healthcare workers [27,17,18,25], high risk groups [21,22,27,4,29,25], and the elderl y [27,25]. The ones aiming to improve childhood vaccines coverage rates have focused on parents [2,11,25,6,9 ]; and those targeting the HPV and rubella vaccines have focused on young people [26] and their parents [27,29,5,25]. Settings Interventions to reduc e vaccine hesitancy were found to take place in healthcare facilities such as hospitals [21,25], primary care centres [22,17,23,25,9], or nursing homes [25]. Only a sm all number of interventions were reported in schools [26,25], in the workplace [18,25] or in the community [26,25]. The choice of settin g was found to be determined by the specific needs and requirements of the country or region where the intervention t ook place [11]. For instance, Oscarsson recommends that in countries where young people have very little contact with healthcare profession als, HPV vaccination training and educational campaign s should take place within youth centres or schools [26]. Virtual on -line settings provide a means of targeting multiple hesitant groups at the same time and/or to respond to each groups' particular de mands and claims [20,7]. According to the United Nations Children's Fund ( UNICEF ), online communication strategies appear to be most effective when combined with more traditional methods such as face -to-face interactions or the use of leaflets and posters [20]. Content of communication strategies Some of the articles identified by the rapid literature review looked into the content of messages and communications strategies aimed at reducing vaccine hesitancy (see Table 3). These studies advised decision - makers and vaccination policy implementers to design communication campaigns targeted at patients and healthcare workers with informational and educational messages on: the risk and consequences of diseases, the risk of not being vaccinated, the safety of vac cines, effects of vaccines on the immune system, and alternative modes of prevention and how they compare to vaccination [2,22,5,18,23]. However, Sampson and Cairns both recognised that this list is not exclusive and content has to be specific and adapted to the identified determinants of vaccine hesitancy of various populations [18,25]. Various studies recommend using health needs assessments to look into what type of information people would like to receive on vaccination , and using existing national or regional social networks to tailor communication strategies [3,11,4]. Oscarsson and Kardas recommended involving hesitant populations in the design and implementation of communication strategies, through co -operative and interactive discussions. They also n oted the importance of creating clear and effective messages, which are easy to find for everyone [26,23]. One study insisted that in order to achieve successful results, it is essential to organise a continuous provision of information to the public, with regular updates and monitoring [22]. UNICEF provides some guidelines for the development of online communication campaigns and interventions. In terms of content of messages, UNICEF advises not criticising hesitant populations but rather empowering them to ask doctors questions , and providing them with clear and easy -to-understand facts on vaccination. They also stress the importance of highlighting parents' ability to protect children in their environment and region, and of underlining that they have the right but also the responsibility of choosing to vaccinate their children. UNICEF's report also provides recommendations on the design of such strategies. For instance, they suggest multiple methods, including search engine optimisation, to improve visibi lity and ensure content can be easily found online. They also advise that information is provided in a transparent manner, acknowledging past errors and vaccine side effects, and giving examples of current successful cases, such as the elimination of certa in diseases. Finally, UNICEF stresses the importance of monitoring hes itant populations and websites continuously in order to detect potential changes in beliefs and the development of new deter minants of vaccination refusals [20].

The first one involves setting up a mass communication campaign , which consist s of the distribution of comprehensive but no n-specific information, to the entire population. No particular hesitant group are targeted and the content of these campaigns can include a wide range o f messages, from specific information on the need for the influenza vaccine for example, to the bene fits of vaccination in general [17,18,25]. A more personalised communication campaign is another approach, which targets specific hesitant populations and their needs or requirements. This can include individually addressed correspondence, and was often found to entail direct contact with hesitant individuals , for instance through medical consultations [20,23,25]. Training and educational interventions are another alternative for relevant stakeholders. These focus on training and informing hesitant populations and health professionals such as vaccines providers on the needs for vaccination, as well as addressing concerns of hesitant populations and determina nts of vaccine refusal. These can be implemented at an individual or population level [25]. Cairns notes that these interventions will most likely not be effective by themselves and an effective communication strategy targeting vaccine hesitancy would have to combine all three types of campaigns [25]. Although no channel (posters, letters, leaflets, online tools) of communication was found to be more effective than another when use d independently, d'Alessandro stresses that the targeted audience should rece ive information continuously, from various stakeholders and channels [22]. Evaluation of interventions The review of selected studies found mixed evidence on the effectiveness of interventions targeting vaccine hesitancy. This is partly due to the specific ity of such interventions to the audience, particular culture, country and vaccine. An intervention to improve influenza vaccination might be successful in a particular country, population, or even time frame (outbreak of pandemic influenza) but unsuccessf ul in another [26,27,25]. Interventions which solely promoted favourable attitudes to vaccination were not found to improve attitudes [25]. Furthermore, strategies aimed at improving knowledge (education and training) were successful in general but the eff ect on vaccine uptake was not always positive [25]. Finally, interventions focusing on improving knowledge of healthcare workers were mostly found to have a positive impact on vaccine uptake [17,25,6,7,9]. Opel also confirmed that communications from provi ders of vaccination are more successful when they are presumptive (assuming that patients will get vaccinated) rather than participatory (asking patients ho w they feel about vaccination) [6]. TECHNICAL REPORT Rapid literature review on motivating hesitant population groups in Europe to vaccinate 9 Example of an effective intervention The Parent Attitudes About Childhood Vaccines (PACV) Survey was designed by Opel et al to measure vaccine hesitancy in parents of the general population. It includes three major categories of questions: immunisation behaviour, safety and efficacy, and general attitudes and trust (see Table 4). Parents' responses to these questions allow the calculation of the 'PACV score ' by assigning two points for every 'hesitant response ', one point for 'don't know ' or 'not sure ' answers and 0 point for 'non-hesitant responses '. Points are then s ummed up and converted to a scale from 0 -100 to provide the PACV score, which is then compared to delay in immunisation. Based on this tool of vaccine hesitancy measurement, the research group designed an intervention to respond to hesitancy. The intervent ion, which was proven successful, consisted of administrating the PACV survey to parents before appointments with health supervision visits. The PACV score, easily calculated , would then be used to inform healthcare providers on the possible hesitancy of p arents. It allows healthcare workers to tailor and adapt their messages and communication strategies to address specific claims and inform patie nts on areas of misperceptions [6,9]. Table 4. Questions of the PACV survey, by category (adapted from Opel 2011 [26]) Immunisation behaviour Have you ever delayed having your child get a shot for reasons other than illness or allergy? Have you ever decided not to have your child get a shot for reasons other than illness or allergy? How sure are you that followi ng the recommended shot schedule is a good idea for your child? It is my role as a parent to question shots. If you had another infant today, would you want him/her to get all the recommended shots? Overall, how hesitant about childhood shots would you consider yourself to be? Beliefs about vaccine safety and efficacy Children get more shots than are good for them. I believe that many of the illnesses shots prevent are severe. It is better for my child to develop immunity by getting sick than to get a shot. It is better for children to get fewer vaccines at the same time. How concerned are you that your child might have a serious side effect from a shot? How concerned are you that any one of the childhood shots might not be safe? How concerned are you that a shot might not prevent the disease? Do you know of anyone who has had a bad reaction to a shot? General attitudes and trust The only reason I have my child get shots is so they can enter day care or school.

Discussion and general recommendations for developing interventions to reduce vaccine hesitancy The articles selected for review recommend every communication intervention to be based on clear and comprehensive frameworks combining an array of concepts: knowledge, attitudes, acceptance, perceptions, beliefs, or behaviour. They advise prioritising inte rventions that can target the most common population groups and behaviour , and leave smaller scale interventions to fill the gaps and address specific hesitant populations. Various studies agree that messengers have to be perceived as credible and trusted sources by hesitant populations and this trust needs to be reinforced by using effective and transparent arguments [2,3,11,20]. Boedeker and Cairns note that ideally, vaccine providers are to be used as advocates of vaccination, but interventions can use a range of stakeholders as long as they have expertise in communication design, delivery, and evaluation [21,25]. They also mention that optimally, healthcare workers are to be included as receivers of information, training and education. Determinants of v accine hesitancy need to be addressed specifically and us e methods and types of interventions relevant to the issue and the context . Based on its own extensive experience and the work of well -known experts in the field such as Brendan Nyhan, the Vaccine Confidence Project has developed a matrix to help and inform the design of interventions based on these determinants ( see Figure 3). Certain determinants such as individual beliefs in risks of vaccination and low risk of getting the disease can be addressed through discussions , information , and educational interventions. Others, such as mistrust in institutions, require interventions that will build trust in health systems and vaccines. Certain determinants simply require logistical interventions: for instanc e, reducing costs or improving access. Rapid literat ure review on motivating hesitant population groups in Europe to vaccinate TECHNICAL REPORT 10 The challenge lies in hesitant populations with determinants and beliefs which are difficult to control or alter . These include religious beliefs or people with conspiracy theories. Although there are ways to work wi th these populations, for instance, by collaborating with religious or community leaders, t hese determinants are based on strongly rooted ideologies which constitutes one of the most difficult type of behaviour change. These type of behaviour might not be tackled effectively by short -term, general interventions. Figure 3.

Two studies mentioned the need for more information on the influence of demographic factors on vaccine hesitancy rather than vaccine uptake , such as: gender [1,10,26,27], socioeconomic status [11,26,27,16], educational level [12], or age [27]. ECDC also underlines the need for such type of demographic information on a country and European level when comparing hesitancy across countries [27]. Some researchers mentioned that it is important to incl ude both parents who refused and parents who accepted vaccination in order to ensure a balanced discussion [10,26]. Studies on influenza also acknowledge the potential interest of conducting more research on the link between hesitancy for pandemic and seas onal influenza vaccination [15,27], and to measure trends in hesitancy as it changes over time [12,7] as well as before and after pandemics [22]. More practical barriers also require further research such as forgetfulness, distance between individuals and health centres, or registration with local health institutions [2,19,29]. Regarding population groups, further studies could be conducted on individuals who do not receive W estern medicine [11], and who for instance opt for homeopathic therapies, or tradit ional Chinese medicine. These populations are not included in studies identifying study parti cipants through health centres . Many researchers agreed that results from interviews or focus groups should be quantified in some manner , for instance, by asking i ndividuals to rank factors that might affect their decision -making by order of importance [12,16]. This will allow a deeper understanding of which determinants are most important and should be prioritised during interventions. In terms of interventions, mo re research was requested on the potential need to tailor communication strategies to hesitant populations [2,12] or social groups [11], as well as on how communication strategies can address beliefs and hesitancy and how they can make use of social networ ks and digital interactive technologies [25,7]. Sadaf mentions that there is insufficient evidence on the link between hesitancy and quantifiable outcomes such as vaccination rates, intent to vaccinate or change in attitudes [7]. Finally, Larson stressed t he importance of conducting more research into multi -level factors which can contribute to vaccine hesitancy and whether hesitant behaviours are influenced by individual or a collection of factors. She also highlights the lack of research on contextual fac tors and the lack of established metrics which could assess the presence or impact of vaccine hesitancy [1]. Based on the gaps in knowledge mentioned above , and the tools for measurement of vaccine hesitancy used across all studies, the Vaccine Trust Group identified themes and areas which could be included in a future European comprehensive qualitative research in vaccine hesitancy (see Box 3). These themes were grouped according to the following categories: 'demographic information ', 'immunisation behavio ur', 'information sources and content ', 'attitudes ', and 'trust'. In conclusion, two main themes and areas for actions emerged from the literature review. Based on the reviewed articles, the most common determinant of vaccine hesitancy in Europe is concer ns or fears about vaccine safety. This includes many specific beliefs, such as the fear of adjuvants or side effects , but is overall a problem of risk perception. Qualitative studies addressing vaccine safety and risk perception in Europe would bring consi derable value and benefits to currently available evidence. The second issue identified was the problem of hesitant vaccine providers and healthcare workers. There is a lack of information on the proportion of hesitant providers across European countries a nd its link to the perceived individual trust in providers as a source of information. More studies are therefore needed on the complex interaction between providers and individuals in terms of vaccine hesitancy. Questions to be addressed could include: Wh at is the impact of provider hesitancy on vaccine uptake? Are providers hesitant to specific vaccines, and if so, which ones? How can interventions address this issue and improve vaccine uptake amongst both hesitant providers and individuals?

Overall how satisfied were you with your (last) vaccination appointment? Have you ever chosen not to give your child a vaccine that you have been offered? Have you ever had any doubts about having your child vaccinated? Have you ever had worries about the safety of a vaccination? Would you have your child vaccinated with vaccines offered to you in the future? Who do you trust the most to give health advice and information about v accination?

Have you had the seasonal Flu vaccine since September 2010? Yes/No IF NO: what was your SINGLE most important reason for not having the seasonal Flu vaccine in the 2010/11 Flu season? (Please tick only ONE answer). It was n ot offered to me/I simply didn't have the time to go for it/The location for vaccination was not convenient for me/Vaccination was offered at inconvenient times of the day/Vaccination was by appointment only. I needed a drop -in session/I intended to have i t, but I forgot to go/I did not think that I was eligible to get it/I did not think that I was at risk of getting flu/I did not think that I was at high risk of getting complications of flu, even if I got the illness/I have had Flu vaccine before and it ma de me feel ill/I was not convinced about its clinical effectiveness/I was worried about side effects/I was concerned that the vaccine itself could cause me to get flu/I have a specific medical contraindication to this vaccine/I was not given enough informa tion about the vaccine/I am very hygienic in my practice, so I present no risk to others and therefore I do not need vaccine/I am a healthy person with a good immune system/I believe that natural infection provides me with stronger immunity than vaccinatio n/I just do not trust vaccines/I was pregnant at the time and was concerned about the vaccine's safety in pregnancy/Other Individual and group influences Concerns regarding safety, Uncertainty about effectiveness Not enough information Vaccine/ vaccination specific issues Logistical issues: inconvenient times, no time Not offered the vaccine No medical need 22 Self-administered survey The survey was based on a 28 -item questionnaire, especially constructed for this purpose Including questions (in most case s open -ended) assessing patients' knowledge of influenza (12 items, including 8 open - ended questions), attitudes toward influenza vaccination (5 items, including 2 open -ended questions), practice of influenza vaccination (4 items), and patients' characteri stics (7 items). Individual and group influences Good health Lack of trust in vaccination effectiveness Vaccine/ vaccination specific issues Cost of vaccination 23 Self-administered questionnaire The items in the questionnaire inquired about HPV awareness, attitudes and beliefs concerning screening and vaccinating in general, HPV vaccination (importance, financial aspects) in particular.

Have you ever decided not to have your child get a shot for reasons other than illness or allergy? How sure are you that following the recommended shot sche dule is a good idea for your child? It is my role as a parent to question shots. If you had another infant today, would you want him/her to get all the recommended shots? Overall, how hesitant about childhood shots would you consider yourself to be? Safety and efficacy: Children get more shots than are good for them. I believe that many of the illnesses shots prevent are severe. It is better for my child to develop immunity by getting sick than to get a shot. It is better for children to get fewer vaccines at the same time. How concerned are you that your child might have a serious side effect from a shot? How concerned are you that any one of the childhood shots might not be safe? How concerned are you that a shot might not prevent the disease? Do you know of anyone who has had a bad reaction to a shot? General attitudes and trust: The only reason I have my child get shots is so they can enter daycare or school. I trust the information I receive about shots. I am able to openly discuss my concerns about shot s with my child's doctor. All things considered, how much do you trust your child's doctor? PACV score compared to delay in immunisation N/A 27 Systematic review N/A 28 Survey In general, how much confidence do you have in immunisation/vaccines? Nationa l Health Services (GP surgeries, hospitals, dentists)? Emergency services? Community health workers (health visitors, midwives)? Family planning? Do you have any children? How old is your youngest child? Have you ever hesitated/been reluctant to have your youngest child vaccinated? You said you were reluctant/hesitant to get your youngest child vaccinated but did you eventually have him/her vaccinated or missed the vaccine? (not needed, too far away, timing inconvenient, not possible to leave work, did not think the vaccine was effectives, did not think the vaccine was safe, religious reasons, other beliefs/traditional medicine, bad previous experience or reaction, bad experience with previous vaccinator, someone else told me that their child had a bad reaction, someone else told me that the vaccine was not safe ) In your opinion, how many people in your community get their children immunised? After the last time you went to the toilet, did you wash your hands with soap, wash them with water, or not wash them at all?

improve vaccine uptake in both HCWs and in patient risk group) Patient at risk groups (for influenza) Elderly (for influenza) Parents (for childhood vaccines) Young people (for HPV, rubella) Communication methods: Mass communication (distribution of universally targeted information to undifferentiated population) Personalised communication (make a personally relevant appeal to individuals using direct contact or individually addressed correspondence Training and education Need a combination of all - only mass communication can be effective by itself No channel has higher effectiveness (posters, letters, leaflets) Need multiple contacts rather than one -off with the target audience Settings: Hospitals, nursing homes, general practice centres, and other healthcare facilities Small number in community or schools Recommendations and strategic implications: Communication interventions should be based on clearly stated theoretical frameworks (vaccine related knowledge, attitudes, perceptions and behaviour are useful indicators of effectiveness) Communication interventions that can support population scale behaviours are a priority (understand individual choice perspectives as well as social dynamics that shape social norms, values and culture) Immunisation advocacy: build support and trust in vaccination by using credible and trusted champions for immunisation and visible proof of action. Use informed and motivated healthca re workers as advocates. Multi -method campaigns with various stakeholders Information provision: knowledge improvement is associated with higher vaccination uptake. Need personalised information exchanges, face to face communication Communication strategy and information content should be based on formative research and systematic piloting Education and training for HCWs: effectiveness enhanced when combined with improved service delivery (make vaccines more available) Expertise in communication: need profe ssional experience in design, delivery and evaluation of promotional communications Mixed evidence for all interventions Intervention promoting favourable attitudes to immunisation Did not report improvements in attitudes Message framing had small -scale positive effects Interventions improving knowledge were successful but did not always have a positive effect on vaccine uptake Interventions aimed to improve knowledge of HCWs through education and training reported improved rates of vaccine uptake 26 Let providers be presumptive (it's time to start all those vaccines) rather than participatory (how do you feel ure review on motivating hesitant population groups in Europe to vaccinate TECHNICAL REPORT 28 Reference Intervention and target audience Evaluation 27 Passage of state laws (introduction of personal belief /philosophical exemption laws for school immunisation requirements) Increase in nonmedical exemptions, decrease in proportion of medical exemptions Statement and school -level implementation of laws (procedural complexities of obtaining nonmedical exemption s and school policies for immunisation requirement) Inverse relationship between increasing difficulty of processes for obtaining nonmedical exemptions and exemption rate of state/school Parent -centred immunisation information or education 8/15 studies eva luating impact of educational information on parents' attitudes towards vaccination reported a significant improvement (6 of these tested an educational brochure) Culturally tailored interventions increased parental acceptance of HPV vaccine but no differe nce in parents intentions to vaccinate Web based decision aid: improvement in parents attitudes towards MMR Out of 10 studies evaluating impact of educational information on parents intention to vaccinate: 5 significant positive impact on intentions (4 te sted educational pamphlet, 1 tested a presentation on HPV) Out of the 5 studies that showed no different in parents intentions: 3 tested brochures, one a multicomponent parent meeting, 1 a \"Radionovela\" No convincing effective interventions Few studies mea sure outcomes linked to vaccine refusal, such as vaccination rates, intention to vaccinate, change in attitudes Most studies scored low on GRADE criteria Increasing options for obtaining nonmedical exemptions increase overall likelihood of a child obtaini ng exemptions Brief educational pamphlets seemed to be the most tested and comprised most of the effective interventions Need for study: tests effectiveness of delivering information to parents through different media to better inform PH awareness initiati ves; develop interventions that can influence perceptions about vaccines; research on changing behaviour 29 If administered before appointments with health supervision visits, the PACV scores can be used to augment a providers' understanding of where a p arent lies on the immunisation acceptance continuum and to shape the discussion positively by allowing providers to structure a visit efficiently to ensure adequate time to discuss concerns and offer tailored advice The study assessed that the PACV survey was a valid tool ECDC is committed to ensuring the transparency and independence of its work In accordance with the Staff Regulations for Officials and Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of the European Union and the ECDC Independence Policy, ECDC staff members shall not, in the performance of their duties, deal with a matter in which, directly or indirectly, they have any personal interest such as to impair their independence.
