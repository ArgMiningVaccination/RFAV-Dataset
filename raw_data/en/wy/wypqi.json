The world has enthusiastically responded to the mission of ensuring the survival of society's most vulnerable members. Children are surviving at a rate never seen before, and fewer women are dying during the prime of their lives due to complications from pregnancy and childbirth. Increasingly, developing countries with growing economies are investing more in health spending, helping bridge the gap in life expectancy between poor and rich nations with support from an energized global health community. The results are heartening. Around the globe, 17,000 more children will live and 650 more mothers will survive childbirth every day this year than in each day in 1990. We must now build on that progress and end preventable child and maternal deaths for good. No family should lose a child in the first days of life. No child should lose their mother during delivery. And for those mothers and babies who survive the birthing process, none should suffer the dire consequences of malnutrition, or suffer infections and diseases that we know how to prevent and treat. With that in mind, the world rallied behind the Child Survival Call to Action in 2012, determined to end preventable child deaths within a generation. The mission was later expanded to include maternal mortality. T o help meet this ambitious goal, the world reconvened in 2014 around Acting on the Call, a United States Agency for International Development-led initiative that specified results-oriented action plans for two dozen countries. T ogether, these high priority countries account for 70% of all child and maternal deaths. This year, as the Millennium Development Goals give way to the Sustainable Development Goals, we present this report to demonstrate our progress, hold ourselves accountable, and recommit to doing what is needed to meet these targets. Ending preventable child and maternal deaths is a bold vision. There are countries which are making incredible strides. India, for instance, now has more than 750 facilities in 264 districts across 11 states that offer postpartum family planning services for new mothers \u2014 up from 34 facilities in 26 districts in 2010. Reaching women soon after they give birth helps prevent rapid, repeat pregnancies that can expose mothers to life-threatening complications. Bangladesh also stands out as a \"best performer\" by several measures. The number of women attending four or more antenatal visits in that country jumped to 31% last year from 25% in 2011. Meanwhile, the share of births taking place in a health facility rose to 37% from 29% in that time frame; and the share of births attended by a skilled specialist climbed to 42% from 32%. Despite this high achievement, not all of Bangladesh's outcomes exceed expectations. Although stunting decreased from 41% to 36%, exclusive breastfeeding of up to six months, although still relatively high at 55%, decreased from 64%. Additionally, facility deliveries remain lower than would be indicated given that maternal deaths have declined significantly. Looking into this, we find that reductions in the total fertility rate (TFR), strong investment in community-based programs, promotion of research and in-country capacity for research and innovation, promotion of NGO programs, and support and partnership of the national governments contribute to success. 1 In other countries, we still have work to do to scale up interventions as well as these enabling factors. Around the globe, 17,000 children under the age of five and 800 mothers die each day. Where we are on track, we continue to push forward to accelerate our progress. Where we are not on track, we review what is not working and push forward to chart a more effective course of action. The past year has demonstrated the power of data, and we will use it to hold ourselves and our partner countries accountable. While maternal and child survival is enjoying an unprecedented level of support, there is a significant funding gap to end preventable child and maternal deaths by 2030. T o address this gap, the World Bank and several partners have come together to establish this year a Global Financing Facility for Every Woman Every Child that will leverage domestic resources, private capital and results-based financing to accelerate and sustain progress in priority countries. The world has come together under the banner of ending preventable child and maternal deaths \u2014 eager to improve health services in some of the world's poorest communities, and help governments focus their spending on the most pressing health needs. The ultimate goal is to make sure that children live to celebrate their fifth birthdays, and that their mothers live to see them grow.1 CONTENTS I.

Improved access to vaccinations, breastfeeding, diarrhea treatment, handwashing, and other basic interventions can improve health and nutrition to save millions of lives in areas with an outsized share of the world's maternal and child deaths. Leveraging USAID's expertise, the United States Government (USG) has invested over $15 billion since 2009 in a series of innovative measures designed to accelerate reductions in mortality rates, working closely with countries and partners. T o date, the commitment has helped spare the lives of 2.4 million children and almost 200,000 mothers in two dozen countries with high mortality rates. Since 2009, the death rate dropped 3.9% a year for children under age five in those countries, and 3.5% a year for mothers. This decline marks an acceleration from the 1990 through 2008 period, when the same countries collectively reported annual reduction rates of 3% for under-five mortality and 3.3% for maternal mortality. With continued progress in this direction, the global community's ambitious goal of ending preventable child and maternal deaths (EPCMD) within a generation is achievable. Now, sustaining our momentum is paramount. Slashing the death toll does more than alleviate needless human suffering. The survival of mothers and children contributes to the economic stability of families and, by extension, the productivity of their communities and the global economy at large. Recognizing this fundamental connection, the world came together in June 2012 at the Child Survival Call to Action, and pledged to end preventable child and maternal deaths in a generation. Two years later, determined to accelerate the initiative's progress, USAID unveiled a roadmap outlining how it plans to help 24 high priority countries meet a 2035 target date for this goal. This effort \u2014 Acting on the Call: ending preventable child and maternal deaths (AOTC) \u2014 uses the Lives Saved T ool (LiST) to model which high-impact interventions will yield the most significant results in terms of contribution to lives saved by 2020 on a country-by-country basis. Speeding up adoption of the highest impact interventions could save 15 million children and 600,000 mothers through 2020. This report chronicles the progress made since USAID launched the roadmap a year ago and provides additional detail on the roadmap for saving maternal lives. Pathways to success often include forming new partnerships and strengthening existing ones, as well as using the best science available to determine the most high-impact, life-saving strategies. Reining in costs, BUILDING ON PROGRESS: KENYA'S COMMITMENT TO ENDING PREVENTABLE CHILD AND MATERNAL DEATHS In Kenya, mortality rates for children under age five have dropped by 30% from 72 to 54 per 1,000 live births since 2009, according to the most recent Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). T o build on its progress, the Government of Kenya has committed to providing free maternity services throughout the country, and in 2014 Kenya's First Lady launched the \"Beyond Zero\" campaign to mobilize additional resources towards ending preventable child and maternal deaths. Through the Ministry of Health's technical working groups and various inter-agency meetings, key development partners align their investments to reduce duplication of efforts and increase efficient use of resources. Those partners include: the UK Department for International Development (DfID), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). In addition, Kenya has invested in high-impact, life-saving interventions, such as use of insecticide-treated nets (ITN) to protect children from malaria. As Kenya's experience shows, strong government commitment, implementation of appropriate policies and alignment of resources are important approaches for reducing child and maternal deaths.6 Photo: Amy Fowler/USAID measuring progress and responding to changing impact data is also essential. All of this is made possible by identifying the resources needed \u2014 both domestic and international \u2014 to run programs, build capacity, and train the necessary health workers. USAID's AOTC roadmap is informed by the documented successes of countries that have adopted effective interventions, and buoyed by the momentum to reach the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and preparation for the upcoming Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). USG contributions to global efforts are demonstrated in the millions of child and maternal lives saved during the past six years. In USAID's 24 priority countries, 770,000 more children survived and 35,000 more maternal deaths were averted in 2013 alone, compared to 2008.Similar achievements have been made in the quest to reduce the number of babies who die in the first 28 days of life. The two dozen priority countries have decreased newborn deaths at a faster pace than the world as a whole (3.05% annual rate of reduction per year in USAID priority countries vs. 2.88% globally from 2000-2013). Despite this success, neonatal mortality still accounts for nearly half of the deaths among children under five-years old \u2014 and USAID's priority countries contributed more than two-thirds of those deaths in 2013. Ensuring that babies survive those first days of life remains a top priority for Acting on the Call. Vaccines are another critical life- saving intervention. Recently, six of the 24 priority countries reached the important Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP) milestone of maintained coverage for three consecutive years of more than 90% of children receiving their third dose of the diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (DTP) vaccine. Achieving timely coverage of all three doses required for the DTP vaccine is a standard indicator of the strength of the routine immunization system. By last year, many of the 24 priority countries had adopted new and under-utilized vaccines into their routine immunization systems: 17 introduced pneumococcal vaccine, 13 introduced rotavirus vaccines, and 12 introduced a second dose of measles vaccine in the second year of life. Current efforts focus on establishing the systems and ground work needed to introduce these vaccines in all 24 countries. Under-nutrition contributes to almost half of all the deaths of children under five by undermining all aspects of their health and development. A stunted child is 4.6 times more likely to die from infectious diseases compared to a non- stunted child. The problem is difficult to tackle because many factors from health to agriculture and overall development influence stunting. Y et, USAID and the Feed the Future Initiative worked together and reduced stunting by nearly 2% in 19 nutrition focus countries that are part of the Feed the Future Initiative from 2013 to 2014. Under-nutrition also poses grave risks for pregnant women, increasing their chances of maternal anemia, which is associated with 20% of maternal deaths globally and contributes to adverse birth outcomes, including premature birth and low birth weight. Last year, USAID helped nutrition priority countries decrease maternal anemia by close to 3%. Improvements in water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) have significant health impacts as well. The four proven high-impact WASH interventions \u2014 improved water supply, hygienic drinking water storage, safe feces disposal, and hand washing with soap can dramatically reduce childhood diarrhea, a leading post-neonatal killer. These interventions also help health facilities control infections, including maternal and neonatal sepsis, which are leading causes of maternal and newborn mortality. Last year, 16 of USAID's 24 priority countries expanded access to sanitation using best practices such as Community-Led T otal Sanitation and sanitation marketing. Twenty priority countries have programs that highlight point-of-use water treatment and hand washing with soap. Family planning continues to drive down both maternal and child mortality by enabling families to achieve healthy timing and spacing of births. Countries are advancing toward the global goal of meeting 75% of demand for modern contraceptive methods. Currently, half of the priority countries have reached 50%, and six of these are meeting more than 60% of family planning demand. This is due, in part, to progress in expanding access to family planning services. An annual one percentage point increase in modern contraceptive method use means that out of every 100 women, one more is using a modern contraceptive. Across a population, a one percent annual increase in modern contraceptive method use is the standard for good program performance and indicates rapid progress. Thirteen of the priority countries have achieved an annual increase in modern contraceptive method use greater than one percentage point and, of these, six have recorded an annual rate of increase greater than two percentage points (Rwanda, Kenya, Madagascar, Ethiopia, Zambia, and Senegal). With results such as these, the goal of ending preventable child and maternal deaths is not only possible, but an historic opportunity to transform the world in a generation.

In order to reach our goals we must track and monitor progress closely and adjust programs as necessary. The Acting on the Call: ending preventable child and maternal deaths (USAID, June 2014 2) roadmap serves as the benchmark against which we review country progress. As new data becomes available, results are compared against our modeled estimates to identify challenges in meeting AOTC targets. We use these results to help determine what more can be done to accelerate progress in these areas. USAID has also developed a series of management dashboards to review and evaluate programmatic data. These data enable us to understand which interventions are being supported by USAID in a country, and at what scale. They help us track the interactions that USAID has with other partners and donors, including the country governments. The choices around which interventions to support and which areas to work in are often a result of these broader coordination efforts. Finally, over the past year, USAID has worked to better understand the interventions that have the most impact on maternal and newborn lives. Newborn deaths represent an increasingly high share of all under-five deaths both globally and in USAID's 24 priority countries. Likewise, maternal mortality remains stubbornly high in many of the priority countries. While we know the interventions that save maternal lives, for some we do not have enough data on their use in the field, which makes it difficult to model their potential impact, despite demonstrated effectiveness. Understanding where information exists and where it is lacking can be an important tool in strengthening programs. One thing we do know is that increasing the availability of and access to higher-level services benefits both women and their babies. USAID must continue to promote universal coverage of these services and push for increased availability of and access to more comprehensive services.Reducing missed opportunities to provide services is important to advancing coverage and quality. For example, when a mother brings her new baby to a health facility to get immunized, she should also be referred to family planning services, and receive counseling on breastfeeding or complementary feeding if the child is over six months, as appropriate. Deliberately integrating key high- impact services where feasible will reduce these missed opportunities. Examining differential intervention coverage at sub-national level allows the identification of programming opportunities for integrated delivery of high impact interventions. For example, if routine immunization services are effective but family planning uptake is low, then increasing referrals at the point of immunization service delivery may help accelerate uptake of contraceptive use. Likewise, if both exclusive breastfeeding and immunization are low in some areas, this may indicate the need to redouble outreach efforts in those regions through community health workers (CHWs). TRACKING PROGRESS AND RESPONDING TO EVIDENCE: On these pages we provide an update on USAID efforts to track and sharpen progress on child lives saved based on new data and/or management analysis, and we highlight how we have responded to the available data. The best performer models for potential lives saved are ambitious projections, yet it is still important to aim high and understand our progress against these ambitions. We also recognize that in already high performing countries (e.g., Bangladesh), significant changes become less feasible on an annual basis. The following pages also provide new visualizations for sharpening maternal and newborn interventions. Building on the \"best performer\" analysis 3 presented for child health interventions in the Acting on the Call report last year, we have broken down the maternal lives saved by key intervention. Our goal is to better understand how to galvanize local communities around the push to reduce maternal mortality, ensure that health services provide respectful and quality care to mothers, and align services so that they are available to all women who need them.11 5 44 2 23 32 Population Under 5 Interventions % OF USAID PRIORITY INTERVENTIONS SUPPORTEDSanitation Interventions Drinking Water Interventions Policies Adapted HSS Interventions Improving Service Delivery CHILD Policies Adapted HSS Interventions Health Worker Interventions Community Interventions2013T otal Population Under-5 Deaths /Year Births Under-5 Mortality Rate Per 1,000 Live BirthsMaternal Mortality Ratio Per 100,000 Live Births ACTING ON THE CALL: PROGRESS SINCE LAST JUNE In collaboration with the Government of Afghanistan and other partners we have: \u007f Introduced pneumococcal vaccine and integrated it into the nationwide Expanded Program of Immunization. \u007f Approved scale up of self-administration of misoprostol after delivery to prevent postpartum hemorrhage. \u007f Introduced iron folate supplementation collaboration with UNICEF. \u007f Kicked-off Afghanistan's first ever Demographic Health Survey.USING DATA TO TRACK AND SHARPEN IMPLEMENTATION In Afghanistan, USAID has prioritized child health interventions given that the opportunities to save lives are greatest in this area. Due to country context, it is appropriate to emphasize support to fewer key interventions at a time so that we can focus on solid implementation. Given the importance of utilizing data to monitor and improve services, USAID will support the government to institutionalize tools, such as the accountably framework scorecard for reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health (RMNCH) to identify high performing provinces and districts and promote lessons learned across the country. Promising practices will be shared and promoted to improve low-performing districts.

Despite this significant and rapid rate of progress, indicators reported in the 2014 DHS for antenatal care, health facility delivery, and oral rehydration solution (ORS) are behind modeled results expected for 2014 based on LiST projections. Importantly, the coverage of key interventions such as the percent of children with diarrhea given ORS remains high at 77%. Through public, NGO, and private sector programs, the country has continued to promote the use of oral rehydration therapy (ORT) for diarrhea.

The current priority is to reestablish health services and bring overall service delivery back to pre-ebola status so that the country can continue building on recent progress. Prior to Ebola, recent national household survey data has revealed that Liberia was on track to meet the coverage projections modeled in the Acting on the Call report for maternal and child health interventions. This previous success may be attributed to scale up of key program areas, including expansion of family planning in underserved areas and increased coverage of the expanded program on immunization (EPI), as well as to the strength of ongoing programming such as Feed the Future. ACTING ON THE CALL: PROGRESS SINCE LAST JUNE In collaboration with the Government of Liberia and other partners we have: \u00dfBegun to rebuild the health system after the devastating Ebola crisis of 2014 -2015. \u00dfExpanded and strengthened Primary Health Care at the community level, including increased capacity for service delivery for sustainability. This includes a strong WASH and nutrition component. \u00dfConducted Periodic Intensified Routine Immunization (PIRI) activities as a response to recent measles outbreaks and aimed at improving vaccination coverage in all counties (post-Ebola catch-up strategy). \u00dfIntroduced a number of new vaccines into the national EPI strategy, e.g. rotavirus vaccine, Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccine and Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine (IPV). Expanded the capacity of health system responders and front line health workers through strengthening pre-service education and developing in-service training programs. This will include updating national standards, protocols and incorporating them into curricula and in-service training programs. \u00dfEstablished systems to prevent or minimize another outbreak of Ebola or other pandemic diseases. \u00dfInitiated plans for an infection prevention unit within the Ministry of Health as well as a surveillance system to monitor for outbreaks of Ebola and other pandemic threats.

Prior, however, USAID assisted the Republic of Yemen Government to provide quality maternal and child health (MCH) care and family planning, and reproductive health (FP/RH). In addition national level capacity building, activities were being implemented in four focus governorates. Despite geopolitical challenges that delayed activities, USAID Yemen had prioritized efforts around health systems strengthening in an effort to enhance national capacity to improve and manage the supply chain systems and commodities such as oral rehydration solution and contraception.

NOTE: Yemen is a conflict-affected, impoverished state struggling through a post-revolutionary transition. A >aidi Shia insurgent group known as the Houthis employed military force to annex significant areas of the country throughout 2014, and eventually took full control of Sana'a in early February 2015. The Houthi takeover further delayed Yemen's precarious political transition and has significantly complicated USAID/Yemen operations. On February 11, 2015, U.S. Embassy in Sana'a was closed, and all remaining American diplomatic staff w ere evacuated to Washington, DC. This followed an ordered departure of non-emergency U.S. government staff that began on September 22, 2014. USAID development activities have been suspended for one year. There are currently no American staff in Yemen and FSN staff do not have access to the USAID Offices in the US Embassy.

Acting on the Call represents USAID's commitment to improve our programs and projects in the field to ensure that we are doing everything possible to get the best outcomes from our investments. Our modelling, based on achieving rates of change equal to what had previously been achieved by top performing countries, allows us to focus on the highest impact interventions and ensures our implementation corresponds to the best practices known to the field. Additionally, as new evidence emerges or new implementation approaches are proven effective, USAID swiftly incorporates what it has learned into its strategies at the country level. The following pages illustrate, by technical intervention area, new evidence generated over the past year and/or new ways to ensure that state of the art evidence is incorporated into our field programs. Health Systems Strengthening Evidence on the performance of health systems strengthening (HSS) interventions has been scarce, scattered and not widely disseminated. In 2014, USAID identified a subset of HSS interventions that have helped reduce morbidity and mortality. These interventions included: Bringing health services closer to patients, Training health workers to improve service quality, Service integration, Task sharing, E-health interventions, Health insurance, Performance-based financing (PBF), Conditional cash transfers, Vouchers, Contracting out, and Promoting community and provider engagement. Evidence indicates that community-based maternal and/or newborn care, for example, has significantly lowered perinatal and neonatal mortality rates. Further, community-based distribution of contraceptives has expanded women's access to a broader range of methods. In addition, conditional cash transfers have demonstrated positive effects on a number of maternal and child health behaviors and outcomes. USAID continues to assess all possible interventions to decide what is most appropriate for the Agency to support.Countries 4 that achieved the most progress in saving the lives of women and children regularly encourage partnerships within local communities and civil society. They also have invested in high-impact health interventions and adopted good governance strategies. For instance, evidence and country experience demonstrate that community-based approaches, such as well-performing community health workers who are supported by communities, health systems, and health promotion groups (e.g., participatory women's groups, care groups), are effective in improving coverage at both low cost and with equity. 5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12NEW EVIDENCE-BASED APPROACHES TO HELP ACCELERATE PROGRESS SCALING UP ON INNOVATION: COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS IN NEPAL For almost three decades, Nepal's 50,000 Female Community Health Volunteers (FCHVs) have played an integral role in improving RMNCH and nutrition intervention coverage. FCHVs deliver services, engage communities with the formal health system, and promote healthy behaviors and practices in households and communities. These strategies have helped reduce the deaths of children under age five by more than 50% in the last 15 years.13,14 For example, to prevent deaths from umbilical cord infection, one of the major causes of neonatal deaths in Nepal, FCHVs contribute to increased application of chlorhexidine to the cord during home visits immediately after birth. This life-saving intervention has been scaled up to 49 of the 75 planned districts, reaching approximately 45 to 50% of newborns in Nepal.1560 HEALTH EXTENSION PROGRAM: FAMILY PLANNING SUCCESSES IN ETHIOPIA Ethiopia, the second most populous African country with 92 million people, is a family planning success story: over the last 10 years modern method contraceptive use increased from 15% to 40% and TFR declined from 6.4% to 4.8%. The government's Health Extension Program (HEP) is credited with this success. The HEP is a network of 38,000 frontline health workers stationed at 15,000 health posts throughout the country, and 3 million volunteers (the Health Development Army) who bring health information to households. A recent survey found overall satisfaction with HEP services to be over 60%, with family planning services rated the highest.16 A USAID issued global call for cases documenting how health systems strengthening contributes to EPCMD goals yielded 145 examples. One of the top HSS cases documented the creation of a PBF system implemented in over 250 health facilities in 12 of Liberia's 15 counties. This incentive system inspired front-line community health workers to meet EPCMD service delivery targets. outcome data showed that the proportion of deliveries conducted in a facility by a skilled birth attendant increased from 29% to 51% and the proportion of pregnant women who were tested for HIV at their first antenatal visit and counselled increased from 26% to 81%.USAID and partners \u2014 including the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the European Union and the World Health Organization (WHO) \u2014 introduced a new System of Health Accounts methodology (SHA) to better track spending on health conditions. The SHA includes Photo: Thomas Cristofolettia breakdown of expenditures into reproductive, maternal and child health categories. USAID has worked with WHO to introduce this new SHA methodology in 16 priority countries. 17 The evidence this new method provides will assist with country-level advocacy and increase focus on priority interventions. For example, understanding trends in expenditure levels and relative allocation to RMNCH along with data on progress and outcomes can help health ministries advocate for higher budget levels. Family Planning Investment in voluntary family planning is linked to transformational benefits in health and development. Estimates indicate that by enabling women, youth, and couples to prevent unintended and high-risk pregnancies through increased use of family planning services, child and maternal deaths will decrease by 25% and 30%, respectively. 18 Y et a recent publication by the Guttmacher Institute 19notes that family planning services fall short of need in all developing regions. It also found that for every dollar invested in family planning, $1.47 is saved in maternal and newborn health care. USAID continues to advance under-resourced issues that remain important drivers of mortality. Globally, neither child marriage (defined as marriage under the age of 18) nor the proportion of 18-24 year olds having their first birth before age 18 have measurably declined. 20 Y et an adolescent's newborn is at significantly increased risk of pre-term birth (Figure 1), compared to newborns of older mothers, and some evidence indicates that younger adolescents (ages 15 and under) experience a higher risk of maternal mortality and severe morbidity compared to older adolescents. 21 USAID-supported research found that a significant proportion of women (7%-12%) in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda still report that their first birth occurred before age 16. The study found that due to a lack of disaggregated data, early adolescent childbearing is a largely hidden problem, rarely recognized in policy and programs. It is estimated that, in low income countries, up to 2.5 million girls under 16 years of age give birth annually.22 These births are largely excluded from most official estimates of adolescent fertility and maternal mortality. 23T o incentivize country-level innovations in reproductive health, USAID established The Resolve Award. In 2014, the award's special focus was the reproductive health needs of adolescent girls. While six countries nominated programs to receive the award, in the end, the Resolve Award Committee gave the award to two countries: Tanzania, in recognition of their innovative, peer-educator approach to reach young girls; and Peru, in recognition of their cross-cutting Multisectoral Plan to Prevent Adolescent Pregnancy. T o reach adolescents and all women, USAID and partners have now introduced or are planning to scale-up postpartum family planning services in Haiti and 18 African countries \u2014 Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea, Madagascar, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, T ogo, Tanzania, Kenya, Ethiopia, The Ebola outbreak in West Africa highlighted for the world the importance of HSS for EPCMD and other USAID global health priorities. The health systems of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone struggled to withstand the overwhelming stress of the epidemic, while continuing to provide essential services. The related health systems disruptions dramatically reduced coverage of essential services, including routinely recommended vaccinations, antenatal care, and assisted deliveries. T o counteract the disastrous effects of the outbreak, USAID launched a partnership on post-Ebola HSS among donors, technical agencies, and country leaders to plan collaboratively for building resilient health systems in the three Ebola-affected countries and ultimately across the West Africa region.62 Liberia, Senegal, Uganda, Zambia, and Nigeria \u2014 as well as four Asian countries \u2014 Bangladesh, India, the Philippines, and Afghanistan. T o make progress in financing these and other family planning services and commodities, and in collaboration with ministries of health and civil society partners, USAID has supported the development of broad-based, country-owned, costed national family planning implementation plans (CIPs). Family planning CIPs are concrete, specific plans that include all the costs necessary for achieving the goals of a national family planning program over a set number of years. The CIP details the program activities needed to meet national goals, their specific associated costs, and requisite donor and domestic resources. With USAID support, the following countries have completed costed implementation plans in 2014: Benin, Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea, Mali, T ogo, and Zambia. T o date, as a result of the CIP analyses, Burkina Faso, Mauritania, and Niger have allocated US$961,422, US$51,000, and US$384,567, respectively, in their national budgets for the purchase of contraceptive commodities. USAID has developed tools that contribute to preventing unintended and high-risk pregnancies. These include: T o address the gap in availability of quality, postpartum family planning services, USAID and partners developed the Guide for Planning and Implementing Social and Behavior Change Communication (SBCC) Activities for Postpartum Family Planning, and an associated e-Learning course.24 In collaboration with the Reproductive Health Supplies Coalition, USAID trained five African country teams to use a newly-developed tool, Enhancing Contraceptive Security through Better Financial Tracking: A Resource Guide for Analysts and Advocates to enhance government accountability. 25 USAID sponsored several key studies in 2014 to better understand approaches to prevent unintended and high-risk pregnancies: Analysis of Pregnancy Risk and Contraceptive Method Use among Postpartum Women: Found that prospective unmet need for family planning by postpartum women has not changed demonstrably since 2001 and is universally high at 61%. The analysis demonstrates the magnitude of missed opportunities for programmatic intervention for the postpartum population. 26 Healthy Fertility Study: Found that the integration of family planning with a community-based, maternal and newborn care program significantly increased contraceptive use and reduced rapid, repeat pregnancies and short birth intervals within the 24 month postpartum period, without adversely affecting the performance of the maternal newborn care program.

These findings support investments in programs which consider the contexts of young people's lives and address broad social and environmental factors. 28Maternal Health Despite progress over the past two decades, 289,000 women die every year due to pregnancy or delivery related complications. Seventy percent of these deaths occur in the AOTC priority countries. USAID's recently released Maternal Health Vision for Action lays out how USAID will contribute to ending preventable maternal mortality. Over the past year, significant progress has been made in a number of areas: Recognizing that infectious diseases are a major indirect cause of maternal and perinatal/newborn death, USAID contributed technical and intellectual leadership to reviewing the evidence and integrating infectious disease and maternal and newborn health programs. USAID advanced understanding of the global burden of tuberculosis in pregnancy, 29 presented data that shows HIV and malaria are major causes of maternal mortality in some southern African countries, 30 and identified key systemic and individual barriers to comprehensive care for HIV infected pregnant women. 31,32 Respectful Maternity Care has become a \"hot topic\" globally, with USAID-supported research providing data on prevalence and yielding tools and interventions that can assist in tackling this difficult problem. This work has spawned action by other organizations.

The activity began in 2010 in 34 facilities. By 2014, postpartum family planning services had expanded to 264 districts and more than 750 facilities (Figure 2). USAID partners, while working in six Indian states, extended technical assistance to hundreds of facilities to support the scale-up. By 2014, the Government of India had assumed over half of the cost of the activity, private sector partners' support had increased, and USAID assistance had declined substantially (Figure 3). SCALING UP: POSTPARTUM FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES IN INDIA 65 and organizations. Globally, communities of practice around advocacy are active and the media is now reporting on incidents cited by community members \u2014 with governments starting to pay attention. Working with the UN Commission on Life Saving Commodities for Women and Children, changes in the WHO Essential Medicine List wording on magnesium sulfate \u2014 a critical tool in the prevention and treatment of eclampsia, a leading cause of maternal death have recently been approved to reduce the number of acceptable presentations, clarify the labeling and, thus, reduce the barriers to use by health care providers. Multiple manufacturers of magnesium sulfate as well as misoprostol and oxytocin (uterotonic drugs to prevent and treat postpartum hemorrhage) have received technical assistance to develop quality-assured, life-saving commodities and receive WHO prequalification, which is an important step to becoming widely available in priority countries. One misoprostol and one oxytocin manufacturer have been prequalified with this assistance. These are the first prequalified products in these categories, a significant achievement towards increased availability of quality commodities. An advanced analysis of evidence on financial incentives for maternal health was published in a supplement of the Journal of Population, Health and Nutrition. 33 In the analysis, public health specialists and economists suggested that performance-based incentives (PBIs), health insurance, user fee exemption programs, conditional cash transfers, and vouchers can increase the quantity and quality of maternal health services and address health systems and financial barriers that prevent women from accessing and providers from delivering quality, life-saving maternal healthcare. For example, in Senegal, USAID works with the government and the World Bank to pilot performance based incentives for delivery of a package of services to improve maternal and child health care. Similarly, in Liberia, USAID helped the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare establish a PBF unit. The unit has supervised PBF implementation in 250 health facilities in 12 of Liberia's 15 counties. The facility-based payments have empowered health clinics to make infrastructure improvements and organize community-based outreach to promote healthy behavior among pregnant women. In October 2014, USAID announced a five-year expansion of the Saving Lives at Birth Partnership. USAID will leverage partners \u2014 the Government of Norway, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Grand Challenges Canada, and DfID \u2014 to invest an additional $50 million to continue efforts in support of the development and scale-up of potentially transformational innovations to catalyze EPCMD progress. T o date the first iteration of our Saving Lives at Birth Grand Challenge has supported 81 game-changing innovations, including the Odon device for obstructed labor, a uterine balloon tamponade for postpartum hemorrhage, and a bubble continuous positive air pressure device for acute respiratory distress in newborns. These innovations have benefited over 1.5 million women and newborns, and saved at least 4,000 lives. Because maternal deaths are often difficult to predict, good information on where they occur is key to achieving further reductions in maternal mortality. The USAID-sponsored global technical consultation on Reporting and Mapping of Maternal Deaths ignited an effort to encourage use of data for decision making and to influence policy changes for maternal health. Newborn Health Newborn deaths account for nearly half of under-five mortality. The percentage of under-five deaths that occur in the neonatal period keeps increasing even as the cases of pneumonia, diarrhea, and other common child-killing ailments decrease. Most of these deaths occur in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa and are avoidable through prevention and timely access to care. T o reach the goal of ending preventable child deaths, the global community must continue to increase its focus on this vulnerable period.66 Photo: Amy Fowler/USAIDAlmost a quarter34 of the 3 million neonatal deaths annually are the result of severe infections like sepsis \u2014 a fast-progressing, life-threatening illness in newborns that requires rapid treatment. In high-mortality/ low-resource settings, sepsis may cause half of all newborn deaths. In countries with high mortality rates and weak health systems, high-impact approaches to diagnose and treat newborn sepsis must be as accessible to those most in need. T o address this major newborn killer, USAID has invested in learning about and scaling up high-impact interventions to prevent and treat infections. Chlorhexidine (CHX): USAID is accelerating efforts to introduce chlorhexidine, an antiseptic that can reduce neonatal mortality by 24% when applied to a newly cut umbilical cord. This is predicted to save 160,800 newborn lives in high burden countries by 2019. USAID and other partners supported efficacy and effectiveness testing through the Saving Lives at Birth Grand Challenge initiative. These efforts have resulted in the new WHO-issued guidelines recommending the daily application of chlorhexidine to the cord stump for the first week of life in high neonatal mortality settings. The WHO-recommended standard for treating newborns with severe illness is hospitalization and treatment with injectable antibiotics for seven to 10 days \u2014 a treatment regimen that is fraught with financial and logistical barriers for many impoverished families in low resource settings. New research from trials in Asia and Africa, supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and USAID, offer evidence that simpler treatment regimens (i.e., fewer injections followed by antibiotics) can be just as effective as the standard regimen and address many of the barriers when access to health facilities is not possible. This simplified regimen enhances the feasibility and acceptability of the treatment by bringing it closer to the infant's home. USAID is concurrently supporting research to better understand care seeking and referral patterns for severe maternal and newborn infections with a goal to help guide the roll out of this new life-saving approach. Prematurity is the number one cause of death among children under five, accounting for 15% of deaths. 35 Every year, roughly 15 million babies \u2014 more than one in 10 \u2014 are born prematurely, and about a million die from complications associated with preterm birth, accounting for 35% of newborn deaths. In 2014, USAID began an effort to focus specifically on preterm birth. It intends to address the issue of premature births through implementation research on barriers and solutions, and technical assistance in countries. USAID supported the assessment of implementation and scale-up of facility-based Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) in five Asian countries \u2014 Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and the Philippines. KMC includes continuous skin-to-skin contact, breastfeeding, and close follow-up after discharge from a health facility \u2014 all of which contribute to reducing preterm mortality and morbidity. The global rollout of KMC is at a nascent stage with better uptake in Latin America and Africa than in Asia. A 2014 study in Africa systematically evaluated the implementation status of facility-based KMC services in four African countries \u2014 Malawi, Mali, Rwanda, and Uganda. The study found that across the four countries, 95% of health facilities assessed demonstrated some evidence of KMC practice. 36 T o address low global coverage of KMC in health facilities, USAID is an active partner in a KMC Acceleration Group that has been established under the leadership of Save the Children and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation with the aim of accelerating the global rollout of KMC as standard of care for preterm newborns. Birth asphyxia accounts for nearly one million deaths per year. Recognized as one of 13 lifesaving commodities, newborn resuscitation equipment is increasingly available in our priority countries. Analysis (Figure 4) indicates that seven countries \u2014 Bangladesh, Cambodia, Colombia, Ethiopia, Malawi, Tanzania, and Uganda \u2014 have now begun to implement Helping Babies Breathe in over 40% of health facilities where births take place. Facility readiness was relatively high 68 Figure 4100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 BANGLADESH CAMBODIA ETHIOPIA MALAWI TANZANIA UGANDAFACILITY READINESS AND ACCESS TO RESUSCITATION (2013-2014)PERCENT % Facility Delivery % Staff Trained to Resuscitate % Facility with Resuscitation Equipment Access to 25 Source: Bangladesh Service Provision Assessment Survey 2015.

Across these countries, 53% to 88% of facilities were equipped with resuscitation devices, and 44% to 75% of health providers were trained in neonatal resuscitation. Overall access to resuscitation \u2014 ranging from 8% to 50% \u2014 continued to be hampered by low coverage of facility births.Immunization This year the U.S. Government through USAID renewed our commitment to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, by pledging a historic $1 billion to the alliance over four years. The U.S. contribution will support Gavi's plan to immunize 300 million additional children and save between five to six million lives by 2020. USAID leverages Gavi by helping country governments increase timely coverage of all recommended vaccines. USAID supplements our investment in Gavi by working to identify new approaches to improve the quality of immunization services, including engagement at the community level. USAID also works to strengthen components of the routine immunization system, such as logistics management, improved cold chain, provider training, and supervision. HELPING BABIES BREATHE: A GLOBAL PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP USAID plays a leadership role in supporting the global rollout of newborn resuscitation using Helping Babies Breathe, a simplified training program for skilled birth attendants developed by the American Academy of Pediatrics. This global public-private partnership has supported the introduction of HBB in 77 countries. At least 52 country programs were led and coordinated by national governments, many of which were galvanized to change national plans, policies, and guidelines, and supported programs to increase the number of trained providers and equip health facilities with resuscitation devices. Program reports from several countries indicate a high rate of successful resuscitation, ranging from 79% to 89%, among babies that do not breathe at birth.69 In Uganda, USAID focused implementation efforts on the Reaching Every Child strategy with an enhanced focus on the use of quality improvement methods. The methodology allows management teams to identify the root causes of low coverage and introduce small, rapid, feasible changes that can be quickly tested and vetted for adoption, adaptation, or abandonment. These quality improvement methods help communities understand that immunization is part of the continuum of care for babies, beginning with good antenatal care and continuing with growth monitoring and immunization through age two. After implementing this in five districts, USAID is partnering with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to enable its expansion to five additional districts, and to support its uptake at multiple levels of the health system. In the arena of improving immunization management and community engagement for immunization, USAID works to identify approaches for improving feedback to the community. In a program called My Village My Home, a visual display of information in a format meaningful to villagers and health workers has been used in India to achieve improvements in both immunization timeliness and coverage. The tool is easy to construct. A Community Health Worker (CHW) draws the frame of a house on a piece of paper. After conducting a headcount, he or she draws a \"plank\" at the foundation of the house for each child in the village and then shades in a plank for each child vaccinated. Just as more bricks make the foundation of a real home strong, more vaccinated children make a village healthier. By using a house illustration, community health workers can easily identify unvaccinated children. In Kenya and Uganda, the establishment of regular feedback mechanisms to district-level civil authorities on the status of routine immunizations are being successfully used to inform resource allocation. These feedback mechanisms with key district level decision makers have helped build grassroots support to promote the allocation of local resources to cover the recurrent operational costs associated with routine immunization. Recurrent operational costs are often neglected, but they are the backbone of a sustainable program. Such recurrent costs include transportation to distribute vaccines, fuel to power refrigerators that store vaccines, outreach services to get vaccines to those far from health facilities, and supervision of health workers. USAID is also working to establish immunization as part of the overall continuum of care. Novel approaches include: in India, connecting newborns to immunization through systematic screening and referral processes, and in Liberia, using routine vaccination visits as an opportunity to refer mothers to family planning services. As USAID strives to optimize investments in immunization, we look to scale up promising tools and strategies to further our goals in support of the GVAP in this \"Decade of Vaccines\" and to achieve a world free of vaccine preventable diseases. Case Management for Child Illness USAID supports care and treatment of children at all levels of the health care system. This includes support across the USAID priority countries and President's Malaria Initiative countries for integrated case management of childhood illnesses at both facility level (IMCI) and community level (iCCM), as well as training and supervision of health care providers, provision of commodities, supply chain management strengthening, and monitoring and evaluation. USAID provides robust technical assistance and program support to iCCM and/or IMCI in three quarters of our priority countries. T o reach people with limited or no access to facility-based care, USAID supports iCCM as a way to strengthen and extend life-saving health services to underserved populations. USAID's contribution to this program has grown over the past several years. USAID's work contributes to national strategies to deliver high impact interventions, particularly integrated case management of malaria, diarrhea and/or pneumonia as necessary in iCCM packages across our priority countries. Ensuring the highest quality of case management is sustained remains a paramount priority for USAID.70 Under the Global Fund's new funding mechanism (NFM), announced last year, eligible countries are allowed to include support for integrated case management of childhood illness (IMCI and iCCM) program platforms in their malaria or health system strengthening concept notes. This represents a key opportunity for addressing childhood illnesses by funding key case management activities such as training and supervision of CHWs, malaria commodities, and supply chain system strengthening and health information system costs. The iCCM Financing Task Team, of which USAID is a member, supports 18 African countries with their Global Fund applications by providing global iCCM guidance documents 37 and targeted technical assistance to countries incorporating iCCM into their Global Fund concept notes. USAID directly supported technical assistance for five countries. Of the 18 countries the iCCM Financing Task Team supported to include iCCM in their concept notes, seven countries' concept notes have been approved as of May 2015. In addition, a total of $167 million has been mobilized for iCCM through the Global Fund, as well as from co-financing leveraging from national governments and other donors and trust funds, including USAID. USAID hosts the secretariat and participates on the steering committee of the global iCCM Task Force, which coordinates bilateral, multilateral and non-governmental partners in the implementation of iCCM worldwide. USAID supports countries to integrate and take action on key frontline iCCM findings, based on the latest evidence which was further highlighted this year in a special supplement of The Journal of Global Health. 38 Additionally, iCCM provides a platform for diagnosis, treatment and referral as needed for malaria, pneumonia and diarrhea \u2014 as well as screening and referral for cases of malnutrition \u2014 by trained CHWs using standardized treatment algorithms. The iCCM package as well as the aspects of the package that require technical assistance can differ based on country contexts. IMCI provides appropriate life-saving treatments to children who come to a health facility. Photo: Thomas CristofolettiPhoto: Amy Fowler/USAIDthe iCCM Task Force recently issued The Indicator Guide: Monitoring and Evaluating Integrated Community Case Management, a publication to help countries take a consistent and streamlined approach to planning and monitoring their iCCM programs. Further, USAID and UNICEF together developed tools to support costing of country iCCM plans, and identification of barriers to policy adoption and sustainability of the iCCM approach; these tools proved useful for Nigeria's successful Global Fund application and therefore, the tools are currently being adapted for use in other countries. Nutrition On an annual basis, under-nutrition contributes to nearly half the deaths of children under age five, and has devastating consequences for a pregnant mother. Since many factors affect nutritional health, combating under-nutrition requires a multi-sectoral approach. USAID works to understand these multi-sectoral effects and enhance the most effective health interventions. Through its efforts, 12.6 million children under the age of five received nutrition services last year. USAID now has a Multi-Sectoral Nutrition Strategy for 2014 through 2025 in the priority countries, one that combines the efforts of the U.S. government's Feed the Future and Global Health initiatives with its Office of Food for Peace development programs. Evidence suggests that taking iron-folic acid tablets when pregnant is one of the most effective ways to prevent anemia. While many countries have provided these supplements to pregnant mothers for decades, the expected reductions in rates of anemia have not been fully realized. In some cases, women do not take the tablets consistently due to uncomfortable side effects, or the tablets themselves disintegrate due to harsh environmental conditions. Something as simple as re-packaging the tablets to protect them can help overcome the environmental challenges, and good counseling to reduce intestinal discomforts caused by the supplements can help to improve consistent use. With its partners, USAID is conducting an operational research study to determine whether providing the tablets in blister packs versus traditional envelopes would affect acceptability, compliance, and hemoglobin levels. This simple customer-oriented packaging may increase adherence and reduce anemia prevalence. In order to achieve scale with effective nutrition programming, it is critical to know not only what interventions work, but how countries actualize the process of scale-up, and how to measure success. T o this end, USAID is supporting in-depth case studies in Uganda and Nepal to examine how increased country commitment to multi-sectoral nutrition programming translates into increased funding for nutrition at increased scale. The results of this work will provide concrete guidance for country programs. This work has highlighted the fact that scale-up should not only be defined in terms of expanded program coverage, but also in terms of broadening engagement of stakeholders at local, national and global levels, and through integrated work across sectors. The Multi-Sectoral Nutrition Strategy recognizes that combating under-nutrition requires coordination and input from several different sectors both within the health field through water, sanitation, and hygiene and promotion of birth spacing, but also from other development sectors including agriculture, climate change, and food security. With this strategy, USAID aims to decrease chronic malnutrition by 20% through the U.S. Government's Global Health and Feed the Future initiatives, the Office of Food for Peace development programs, resilience efforts and other nutrition investments. Within Feed the Future targeted inventions areas, USAID will concentrate resources and monitor impact to reduce the number of stunted children by a minimum of 2 million. In humanitarian crises, USAID aims to mitigate increases in acute malnutrition with the goal of maintaining Global Acute Malnutrition below the emergency threshold of 15%. Healthy Behaviors Interventions to save women and children are largely known and widely available. Ensuring they are used correctly and consistently requires social and behavioral changes. USAID-supported programs aim to achieve measureable public health impact and build on clear indicators and measures of behaviors rather than just knowledge or attitudes. USAID has incorporated 73 Photo: Morgana Wingard 10 accelerator behaviors \u2014 behaviors that have low uptake but impact major causes of child and/or maternal mortality, into the programming guidance for all 24 priority countries. USAID also provided high-level technical assistance to EPCMD missions for enhanced social and behavior change impact by working in partnership with the White House Social and Behavioral Science Team. With USAID support, best practices in social and behavior change are already being rolled out to achieve better nutrition outcomes. Across several countries in the Sahel and in India, USAID and its partners are testing whether distributing low-cost educational videos throughout communities would improve the nutritional health of mothers and their children, increase handwashing, and alter other care practices for the better. In Nigeria, USAID and its partners are studying the traditional ways in which caretakers are trained to feed infants and children, and assessing cultural and social norms, costs, as well as changes in caregivers' knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and practices. In Haiti, USAID is funding research evaluating alternative training strategies for health facility staff to improve promotion of good infant and young child feeding.USAID is working closely with the Catholic Medical Bureau in Northern Uganda to educate faith-based clinics about the appropriate treatment of pediatric diarrheal disease. In Ethiopia and Mozambique, the President's Malaria Initiative helps local NGOs develop simple, but life-saving, messages about malaria prevention and treatment. Some of the NGOs \u2014 including the Health, Development and Anti-Malaria Association and Programa Inter-religioso contra a Malaria \u2014 reach out to the community through religious seminars or door-to-door volunteer campaigns.An end to preventable child and maternal deaths is a global vision. It requires all development partners to work with country governments toward achieving the targets outlined in USAID's Acting on the Call . The Agency has been a global leader in this space over the past year, producing strategic technical documents aimed at gathering a growing consensus toward high impact interventions. We have also created or expanded partnerships with public, private, and multilateral entities so that all interested parties can play a meaningful role in achieving results. June 2014 USAID's Maternal Health Vision for Action identifies 10 strategic drivers that can be used by national governments, USAID missions and development partners to assess facility and health systems environment; to initiate or sharpen targeted activities appropriate for local epidemiology and health system capacity; and to improve measurement and continuous learning for ongoing program improvements. The evidence base that underlies this vision for action supported development of global targets toward Ending Preventable Maternal Mortality (EPMM.) 39 The Every Newborn Action Plan, released at the PMNCH Partners' Forum, articulates a global target of 12 or fewer newborn deaths per 1,000 live births, and 12 or fewer stillbirths per 1,000 births by 2030. As a result, 15 of the 18 countries that were categorized with the highest burden of neonatal death have taken concrete actions to advance newborn health.Global targets and a strategic framework for EPMM were also endorsed by the member states as an Annex to the Every Newborn Action Plan resolution. The annex calls on countries to achieve a global average of less than 70 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births by 2035. USAID released its 2014-2025 Multi- Sectoral Nutrition Strategy, reaffirming its commitment to global nutrition and addressing both direct and underlying causes of malnutrition. It is aligned with the 2025 World Health Assembly Nutrition Targets. 40 The Survive and Thrive alliance announces a special initiative to help save 100,000 newborn lives in India, Ethiopia and Nigeria in partnership with national health professional associations. July 2014 African Heads of State and Government committed to ending preventable child and maternal deaths on the continent at the African Union Summit held in Malabo, Equatorial Guinea. They reaffirmed commitments made to achieve universal access to quality MNCH services across the continent primarily by developing a 20-year Pan-African MNCH roadmap. The summit also agreed to strengthen implementation of the \"Campaign for the Accelerated Reduction of Maternal Mortality in Africa,\" a flagship program aimed at accelerating reduction of mortality in the Africa region.August 2014 At the African Leaders Summit in Washington, D.C., the United States agreed to work with African leaders to save eight million children and 350,000 mothers, reaffirming its commitment to the Acting on the Call initiative, which called for accelerating the push to reduce child and mortality deaths. September 2014 A joint statement released during the Third Global Symposium on Health Systems called for health systems in sub-Saharan Africa to be directly accountable to ordinary people and more responsive to clients. The statement was crafted after sub-Saharan African countries shared information about the healthcare delivery system in their regions, and their efforts to address disrespect and abuse during childbirth. The symposium took place in Cape T own, South Africa. The Global Financing Facility in support of Every Woman Every Child (EWEC) was announced at the U.N. General Assembly as a strategic effort to address how to close the financing gap so that countries can effectively and sustainably reduce preventable maternal and child deaths. USAID's leadership in the area of the respectful care during childbirth resulted in 2014 in a statement published and disseminated by WHO on the elimination of disrespect and abuse during facility based child birth.GLOBAL LEADERSHIP 75 USAID published a special supplement of the Journal of Health Communication41 on Population-Level Behavior Change to Enhance Child Survival and Development in Low and Middle-Income Countries: a Review of the Evidence. This strengthened the evidence base and optimal use of information for effective social and behavior change interventions within child health and development strategies October 2014 USAID Global Call for HSS Cases identifies 145 case studies \u2014 many from the 24 priority countries \u2014 from USAID missions and implementing partners that show work to strengthen developing country health systems in support of EPCMD goals. 42 USAID and partners announced a five-year expansion of the Saving Lives at Birth Partnership. USAID will leverage partners: the Government of Norway, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Grand Challenges Canada, and DfID \u2014 to invest an additional $50 million to continue efforts in support of the development and scale-up of potentially transformational innovations to catalyze EPCMD progress. November 2014 USAID, in collaboration with DfID, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Pfizer, the Children's Investment Foundation Fund and Path, reached agreement to make a new, innovative, three-month, injectable contraceptive called Sayana Press available to developing countries for $1 which is lower than market price. Delivered in the Uniject, single-use injection system, Sayana Press allows injections to be delivered by health care workers to women at home. Its pre-filled design overcomes logistic and safety challenges of other methods. The Second International Conference on Nutrition (ICN2), the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) Movement Global Gathering, and the release of the first ever Global Nutrition Report called attention to the fact that although many countries have made good progress in improving nutrition outcomes, the world is not on track to meet international nutrition targets. USAID joined forces with GAIN (Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition) to convene a gathering of global social and behavior change communications thought leaders to develop a strategic research and implementation agenda. The conference, resulted in a report titled \"Designing the Future of Nutrition Social and Behavior Change Communication (SBCC): How to Achieve Impact at Scale,\" a strategic agenda for nutrition SBCC to streamline priorities and investments by nutrition stakeholders in order to maximize the contribution of SBCC in reaching global nutrition targets. December 2014 President Obama signed into law the Water for the World Act which solidifies and renews the United States' global WASH efforts by reinforcing USAID's Water and Development Strategy objectives; highlighting the life-saving importance of WASH interventions; and aligning with the global community's work toward the Sustainable Development Goals.Recognizing the maternal mortality risk associated with high parity and advanced maternal age, USAID engaged 12 domestic and international reproductive health organizations to issue a Consensus Statement on Permanent Methods of Contraception in support of increased access to quality, permanent methods of contraception; universal access to voluntary family planning; and the provision of a broad method mix. January 2015 Germany hosted the replenishment conference for Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, where the U.S. Government through USAID pledged a historic commitment of $1 billion to Gavi over four years. The U .S. contribution will support Gavi's plan to immunize 300 million additional children and save between five to six million lives by 2020. February 2015 USAID brokered a new partnership in India with Nokia Life (overseen by HCL Ltd.) to make available two text messaging services to 350,000 customers: a free service that provides family planning and fertility awareness information in 12 languages across the nation; and CycleTel, subscription service that facilitates use of the Standard Days Method, a fertility awareness method of contraception. Using evidence from USAID evidence base, Strategies toward EPMM released by WHO and other U.N. agencies and partners aligns global community around plan to end maternal deaths.76 Photo: Amy Fowler/USAID The President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) launched its next six-year strategy for 2015-2020 to work with PMI-supported countries and partners to further reduce malaria deaths and substantially decrease malaria morbidity, toward the long-term goal of elimination. The strategy is in line with the draft Roll Back Malaria Partnership's second Global Malaria Action Plan and WHO's draft Global Technical Strategy. March 2015 USAID and UNFPA, along with DfID and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, brought together donor and government representatives from 31 countries that have made pledges to shared FP2020 goals to strengthen relationships at the country level, build a common understanding of FP2020 goals, provide practical tools for advancing their countries' FP2020 commitments and provide opportunities for learning from other developing countries. The Mobile Alliance for Maternal Action (MAMA) announces it has reached and empowered more than two million women and families with its timed and targeted information through its country programs in Bangladesh, South Africa and India. April 2015 USAID, with WHO and other partners and in coordination with PMNCH and EWEC, launched the first steps in the development of a framework for the production, reporting, synthesis and assessment of the evidence for social and behavioral interventions in global health with a focus on MNCH. The purpose of the guidance is to ensure that social and behavioral sciences in global health rigorously inform practice, policy and investment decisions by and in LMICs to end preventable maternal, newborn and child deaths and improve maternal, newborn and child health and development. May 2015 USAID developed an immunization strategic plan to guide and articulate USAID's strategy for the next five years (2015-2020) in strengthening routine immunization systems to ensure the effectiveness of vaccination programs throughout the 24 countries and moreover, leverage significant investments in global partnerships such as Gavi. USAID in collaboration with UNICEF seeks to further accelerate progress in health by announcing a call for promising solutions to integrate and scale up community health approaches into local and national health systems.Photo: Jane Silcock/USAIDData Sources: The information presented on the country pages comes from common, publicly available sources as described below. Sources were chosen to maximize ability to compare across countries in a single year and based on common methodologies for estimation. Therefore, the numbers presented may vary from recently released data and/or from the official numbers used within countries. Total Population, Population Under-Five, Number of Births: http://www.census.gov/population/ international/The US Census Bureau's International DataBase (IDB) estimates and projections (funded by USAID) are provided for each calendar year beyond an initial or base year, through 2050. The estimation and projection process is conducted by the statisticians and demographers of the US Census Bureau's International Programs Center, and involves data collection, data evaluation, parameter estimation, making assumptions about future change, and final projection of the population for each country. The Census Bureau begins the process by collecting demographic data from censuses, surveys, vital registration, and administrative records from a variety of sources. Available data are externally evaluated, with particular attention to internal and temporal consistency. The resulting body of data in the IDB is unique because it exists for every country and is updated annually; these single year estimates reflect the demographic impact of sudden events, such as earthquakes, wars, and refugee movements. The UN maintains the only other similar source of estimates for all countries, but updates its data less frequently; its estimates do not yet reflect the precise timing of sudden events. *The Census International Data Base did not have estimates for India, South Sudan or Y emen. For these countries data on total population and population under-five from 2010 was taken from the UN Population Division http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/unpp/panel_population.htm. Data on Number of Births was calculated using the Under-Five Mortality Rate and the number of Under-Five Deaths (see sources below). Under-Five Mortality Rate and Under-Five Deaths: http://www.childmortality.org/Estimates produced by the Interagency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (IGME). IGME, established by the UN, has a membership of leading academic scholars and independent experts in demography and biostatistics who review mortality data and publish annual country level estimates of under-five mortality. T o do so, IGME compiles all available national-level data on child mortality, including data from vital registration systems, population censuses, household surveys and sample registration systems, and weights these data based on quality measures. In order to reconcile differences caused by estimation technique, error rates and overlapping confidence intervals, the Technical Advisory Group of the IGME fits a smoothed trend curve to a set of observations and then uses that to predict a trend line that is extrapolated to a common reference year, in this case 2013 Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR): From Trends in Maternal Mortality: 1990 to 2013. Estimates by WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, The World Bank and the United Nations Population Division: www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/monitoring/maternal-mortality-2013/en/index.html The 2010 round of UN estimates (World Health Organization et al., 2010) provided an integrated evaluation of maternal mortality over the full interval from 1990 to 2008, utilizing all available data over this period. A key goal of this analysis was to create comparable estimates of the MMR and related indicators for 172 countries (or territories), with reference to 5-year time intervals centered on 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2008. The methodology for 2013 estimates is similar to that for 2008 and 2010 estimates. However, given that the global database used for the current 2013 increased in country-years of data by 5%, estimates of total female deaths in the reproductive age group were updated, and the number of countries increased from 181 to 183, the current estimates should be used for interpretation of trends in maternal mortality from 1990 to 2013, rather than comparing to or extrapolating estimates from previously published estimates.ANNEX 79 Lives Saved and \"Best Performer\" Methodology: The Lives Saved T ool was used to estimate the potential impact in terms of mortality reduction as a result of expanded coverage of selected maternal and newborn health interventions. Analyses were conducted based upon projected scale-up of selected interventions in each country. Data Sources The LiST module relies upon updated details including mortality rates, causes of death, baseline health status, and coverage levels for effective interventions in order to create country-specific projections. For baseline maternal mortality, estimates were drawn from the report, \"Trends in Maternal Mortality: 1990 to 2013. Estimates by WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, The World Bank and the United Nations Population Division\" Maternal cause of death profiles are derived from data tables (unpublished) from \"Say L, Chou D, Gemmill A, et al. Global causes of maternal death: a WHO systematic analysis. Lancet Glob Health 2014; 2:e323-33.\" Estimates for under-five mortality and deaths are produced by the IGME, and cause of death profiles are from data tables (unpublished) from \"Liu L, Johnson HL, Cousens S, et al. Global, regional, and national causes of child mortality: an updated systematic analysis for 2010 with time trends since 2000. Lancet 2012; 379:2151-61.\"Indicators of baseline health status and coverage measurements for key health interventions were abstracted from the most recent nationally-representative survey datasets which were available. Data sources include the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) which are reanalyzed using a standardized approach to ensure consistent reporting of coverage measures across time and countries. Coverage Change The lives saved methodology provides estimates for child and maternal lives that could be saved over current coverage rates. These lives saved are calculated by comparing different scenarios based on projected coverage rates of effective interventions. Coverage trends were projected from the historical rates by analyzing the trends in coverage of interventions and contraceptive prevalence for the period 1990 to 2010, from the nationally-representative surveys that provide coverage data for these interventions. 43 Country-specific projections of coverage changes were then developed for key maternal newborn and child health interventions from the most recent measurement to 2020. There were two variants of these projections. First, the \"historical trend\" projects coverage of the interventions based on the country-specific historical information. The second projection was the \"best performer\" 44 scenario where coverage change for each intervention was not based on the country data but rather based on the best performing country (within categories). The best rate of change achieved by any country with a similar level of coverage at baseline for each of the three grouped interventions was selected and applied to produce these \"best performer\" scenarios. Interventions with inadequate data to ascertain baseline coverage or track historic trends over time could not be stratified and scale-up was not included in the analyses. Coverage for some interventions lacking a reliable indicator was calculated using related proxy measures that were adequately reported in nationally-representative surveys. This projection yields much higher scale up of coverage than the \"historical trend\" scenario but is limited to rates of coverage change that have been achieved in the past by countries at similar levels of development. In addition to estimated coverage change, for introduction and coverage of new vaccines we used the Gavi country-specific roll out plans. 45 The information presented on the country pages reflects the \"best performer\" scenario since it allows analysis of expected impact vis-a-vis current coverage rates under optimal conditions. However, comparisons between \"best performer\" projections and historical projections were also used to understand the net effect of our planned action plans over and above current progress and are reflected in top-line messaging.80 Photo: Amy Fowler/USAIDMaternal Analyses The lives saved information on the country pages provides estimates for maternal lives that could be saved over current coverage rates for maternal health interventions. Where maternal health interventions also have an impact on newborn mortality, we have included newborn lives saved; however, these data do not represent the universe of newborn lives saved including lives saved due to newborn interventions. T o model the effective scale-up of care for women in order to reduce the number of maternal deaths worldwide, LiST assumptions were applied based upon the country-specific percentage of births which occur in a facility and/or are delivered by a skilled attendant. Births were categorized as occurring either: (1) at home (with or without a skilled attendant), (2) at a facility which offers minimal or basic emergency obstetric care, or (3) at a facility with comprehensive emergency obstetric care available. The increasing proportion of institutional deliveries was projected to follow a \"best performer\" trend starting from baseline in 2012 and continuing to 2020. The projected decline in maternal mortality is presented by the WHO categories for cause of maternal death and maternal deaths due to indirect causes, such as those related to HIV and pre-existing medical conditions, have been excluded. Maternal deaths caused by embolism have been included in the category with \"Other direct causes.\" The decrease in maternal deaths is calculated based upon the increased coverage of an intervention multiplied by the effectiveness of the intervention and adjusted for the proportion of cause-specific mortality that is affected by the specific intervention. Interventions to support women's care across the continuum from pre-conception to postpartum are presented with coverage levels after scale-up in 2020 and impact estimates reflect the number of stillbirths, neonatal deaths, and maternal deaths averted. Coverage assumptions for interventions provided during labor and childbirth are derived from calculated estimates based upon the national percentages of facility births and deliveries attended by a skilled attendant. Impact for \"other labor and delivery management\" as an intervention incorporates all appropriate assessment and treatment that is standard for care at a prescribed location of birth (e.g. facility that offers or is capable of providing basic or comprehensive emergency obstetric care) but excludes interventions (e.g. MgSO4 for management of eclampsia) which have been listed separately.The LiST analysis presented here does not include components related to the relative cost to scale interventions, the quality of service delivery, or sub-national differences in prioritization. These dimensions, therefore, must be considered along with other variables in determining programming priorities going forward. Intervention Coverage Estimates and USAID Implementation Intervention coverage rates were abstracted from the most recently available DHS, MICS, and MDG survey reports. In the case of 12 countries with nationally representative household survey datasets published between May 2014 and April 2015 (and therefore not incorporated into the 2014 Acting on the Call analyses), these data have been presented as compared to the intervention targets that would be suggested for the same survey year based on the LiST best performer methodology and as reported in the 2014 USAID Acting on the Call Report. For the coverage maps, sub-national estimates for immunization and infant feeding were presented at the lowest disaggregate available from these data and abstracted from the most recently available DHS, MICS and MDG survey 82 Photo: Jane Silcock/USAID reports. Recent analyses using LiST projections suggest that integrating key health promotion activities, such as breastfeeding with immunization service delivery may help to save more lives. Viewing data visually helps to determine what the opportunities are for such integration. USAID implementation of high impact interventions was estimated from internal reporting of program activities. Denominators for proportion of high-impact interventions implemented included USAID priority interventions for each technical area. In general, USAID priority interventions by technical area can be found in the technical chapters from the 2014 Acting on the Call: ending preventable child and maternal deaths report (e.g., interventions to improve service delivery for maternal health include: antenatal care screening and treatment; use of uterotonic in the third stage of labor; treatment of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia with magnesium sulfate; monitoring of fetal heart rate during labor; provision of respectful maternity care and; post-partum family planning). While these data provide a snapshot of USAID programming, there are many reasons why USAID may not be implementing all interventions. For example, certain interventions may be covered by other partners, or depending on country context certain interventions may have been prioritized over others.Photo: Morgana Wingard84 1 The Lancet.
