Most of us aren't familiar with the natural hormone phases associated with the menstrual cycle and how they are designed to change over time. Learning how to skillfully ride the predictable, normal hormonal waves leads not only to greater comfort but also to better health. To get there, one needs a basic understanding of the hormone cycle and how to support the mind and body through each phase. More and more people are starting to care about how to feel better and age well. We are curious about how to eat, how to get better sleep, and how to reduce stress for longevity and a good life. As we get older, people who menstruate would do well to learn about the hormone cycles and how they affect mood, energy, and the aging process. The sooner we understand hormones and get familiar with how we feel in each phase of the menstrual cycle, the better informed we will be to support ourselves in the moment and over time as [natural hormonal changes](https://chopra.com/articles/ask-dr-sheila-ayurvedic-stages-of-life-and-menopause) occur. In her book, Hormone Intelligence: The Complete Guide to Calming Hormone Chaos and Restoring Your Body's Natural Blueprint for Well-Being, Yale-trained, board-certified family physician and women's health expert [Aviva Romm, MD](https://avivaromm.com/), shares the ancient blueprint that is meant to orchestrate our hormones. Explaining life cycles, Romm lays out the arc that begins in puberty, carries on into the twenties and thirties, might shift a bit in the late thirties and forties, and shifts greatly in the mid-to-late forties and early fifties during [perimenopause](https://chopra.com/articles/make-menopause-marvelous-with-ayurveda). Hormones regulate so much, including: Romm explains that the menstrual cycle is so significantly intertwined with our lifelong health that it can be used as \"our sixth vital sign, after temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and pain.\" The menstrual cycle begins with menstruation, the shedding of the uterine lining. In this phase, the hormones estrogen and progesterone are at their lowest. While it's normal to feel mild signs in the body to signal that the period is about to begin, pain is not normal. Expect to feel low energy during this time. During the second phase, the follicular phase, estrogen is dominant, progesterone begins to rise, increasing energy levels, sexual drive, and mental clarity. The third phase is ovulation, usually midcycle. It leads into the beginning of the fourth phase, the luteal phase. During the start of the luteal phase you can feel energized, enjoy optimal sleep, and feel mightily productive. These feelings start to decline toward the end of this phase, leading to the first phase of the cycle again: menstruation, when energy drops to its lowest. Over time, as you get to know how your own body feels and what it craves in each phase, you will be able to ride the waves in greater harmony and provide support for yourself. Of course, always reach out to your physician if anything concerns you or feels different than it did before. It's normal to have energy highs and lows during the cycle and to notice mild signs before your period starts. In order to become familiar with what precisely happens for you, checking in with yourself on a regular basis is the best way to recognize your needs. Here are some ways to check in: Becoming aware of the attributes of each phase of the menstrual hormonal cycle and noticing how you feel during each one will help you know which practices can help you remain in balance.
