However, this is not always possible, especially in respiratory allergies. Symptomatic treatment Other measures would be using drugs to treat symptoms. The drugs most commonly used in the allergic process are antihistamines, corticosteroids, nasal decongestants, eye drops, etc. Taking these drugs to treat allergic diseases manages symptoms on a temporary basis.
