The digital gift cards are available to the public for purchase online with e-delivery. If you're a merchant with a brick and mortar commercial location anywhere in Detroit and would like to be a part of The Spirit Card program, please apply to join by clicking the button below \u2014 scroll to the bottom of the page, input the required information and watch your email inboxes (and spam/junk folders) for an activation link from our technology partner, Yiftee. You'll have to run a simple 10-cent charge (or whatever is your minimum) on this prepaid MasterCard. Even if the transaction is rejected, this will confirm your participation in the program and your consent to the Yiftee Merchant Agreement, which can be found here: [https://app.yiftee.com/gift-card/the-spirit-card--detroit-detroit](https://app.yiftee.com/gift-card/the-spirit-card--detroit-detroit). Please Note: Eligible merchants include small businesses - restaurants and retailers - that are operating in commercial buildings in the City of Detroit. Online and home-based businesses and contractors providing services primarily off-site are not eligible for participation. The DDP will determine merchant eligibility based on the stated criteria. Your business will only be listed on the site once you complete the \"Activation Card\" transaction, which will be shared with you via an email sent to the address you provided Yes, as long as there is a remaining balance, the card may be used at any participating location. See [list of locations that accept the The Spirit Card](https://app.yiftee.com/gift-card/the-spirit-card--detroit-detroit/locations). The card can be used at any location that has signed up for the program. Additional businesses are being added every day! Yes \u2014 just as refunds would be applied to your credit card, they can also be applied to your gift card. Check your gift balance here: [Check Balance](https://c.yiftee.com/check-gift-balance). If your card is declined, it could be because: In the event that your purchase exceeds the amount in your balance, purchases will need to be split up separately with the card balance being paid first and then using a separate payment method. The card is keyed in manually into a business' POS or terminal systems as a credit card. It cannot be swiped. There are no plastic cards available. The card is available electronically or if you choose you can print it in a piece of paper. The card purchaser pays an eDelivery fee to cover processing costs ($1.00 per card and 5.0% of the total value of the gift amount), unless this has been paid by a third party. The card recipient and merchant receive the full value for the card, providing maximum benefit to local businesses. In the event that your purchase exceeds the amount in your balance, you will need to have a separate form of payment to cover the difference of the purchase amount. These gifts are intended to be used in store or over the phone with the listed participating merchants. They will not work with delivery services who cannot specify a participating merchant's point of sale system (e.g. Grubhub, Doordash, Uber Eats, Postmates) because enabling those third parties would allow gifts to be redeemed outside your community. Online purchases will be declined if the purchase amount is greater than the current card balance; e-commerce engines don't take multiple cards. Online purchases and chain or franchise locations where the merchants are not a part of your community may not be permitted by your community card organizers.
