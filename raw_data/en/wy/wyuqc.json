As part of the campaign, MS Dhoni features in a newly released video which draws a parallel with hitting a six in cricket and explains how the 6 in 1 vaccination for infants provides protection against six diseases in one injection. The tagline of the campaign encapsulates the key benefits of the combination vaccine: less injections, less pain. Speaking about his involvement in the campaign, India's former international cricket captain, Mahendra Singh Dhoni said, \"As parents, my wife and I look for ways to give our daughter a good foundation for life. We have always believed that vaccination is an essential component of that foundation. However, watching my daughter go through the pain due to multiple injections during infancy was difficult for us both. I was eager to join GSK in raising awareness about 6 in 1 vaccination. Combination vaccination means that infants get the same kind of protection but with fewer injections. Less pain for them. And I am sure all parents would agree - less pain for us too!\" Speaking about the need for 6 in 1 vaccination, Dr. Rashmi Hegde, Executive Vice President - Medical Affairs, GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Limited, said, \"Every child should be vaccinated in a timely manner. Vaccines build children's immune memory and help to protect them from diseases. The 6 in 1 or hexavalent vaccine helps to protect infants against 6 serious diseases. 6 in 1 or hexavalent vaccination has helped protect millions of infants in India and across the world and has a proven record of safety and efficacy.\" The campaign will run across multiple media formats including videos on TV, [digital videos ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTSeU-6pYEQ)on YouTube, a [website,](https://www.myvaccinationhub.in/en/awareness-initiatives/6-in-1-vaccination) and at paediatricians' clinics. Parents should consult their paediatrician to know more about 6 in 1 vaccination. About the 6 in 1 vaccination The 6 in 1 vaccination protects against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), poliomyelitis, haemophilus influenza type B, and hepatitis B. Without the combination shot, children would have to take more injections, which increases the likelihood of pain for not only the child, but also the parents.
