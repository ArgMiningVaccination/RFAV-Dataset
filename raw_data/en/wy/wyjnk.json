The Benefits and Effects of Chiropractic Therapies during Addiction Treatment A person's spine includes lots of essential neurotransmitters. These are vital to receiving and sending information to the brain and the body. The spine is a vital part of the body and plays a much bigger role than people know. Emotions, feelings, pleasure, and pain are all transferred along the same lines. This is why having a misaligned spine can cause issues. In the spine, there may be small misalignments (also known as subluxations). These can cause pressure and damage to the spine. The nerves of the spine can also take damage as a result. This can cause numerous problems for a person's body and mind. This can be a result of exercise, an accident, traumatic activity, or a variety of reasons. This misalignment can end up impacting a person's neurotransmitters. This, in turn, results in dysregulated emotions and reactions. Let's take a look at some of the benefits and key factors of chiropractic care. Fixing Misalignments/Subluxations in the Spine As mentioned, misalignments in the spine can cause more damage than you think. It can also affect the way you process and react to your emotions. This is why it can make a big difference when recovering from a drug addiction (during proper addiction treatment). Chiropractic care is one of the only effective ways to correct these misalignments. This process can help relieve the pressure and tension in the spine, which helps reprogram your neurotransmitters. These signals can be sent correctly and more efficiently than with a misaligned spine. When these neurotransmitters work as intended, those struggling with addiction may have fewer drug cravings and have a higher chance of recovering. A Feeling of Relaxation Another great benefit to chiropractic care is the sense of relaxation during recovery. Holistic practices like meditation and relaxation techniques are typically used for addiction treatment. Having a relaxed and focused mind can be the key to reaching sobriety and recovery. Chiropractic care is no different and can provide a sense of relaxation. After chiropractic therapy sessions, people tend to feel refreshed and revitalized (both in the mind and body). Chiropractic care is also safe and effective when done by a professional. Staying relaxed can go a long way when dealing with life's stresses, possible cravings, and negative thoughts during recovery. A Great Addition to Treatment While chiropractic therapy approaches are not enough to 'cure' an addiction right away, it is great when used with other therapies and treatment options. During your recovery, you can keep a healthy mind and spirit through chiropractic care. This can go a long way in reaching long-term sobriety and self-care. Along with specialized therapy and other treatment methods, chiropractic care can help relieve stress and help your body work better. Does Chiropractic Treatment Work? Chiropractic treatment is an excellent option during addiction treatment and can work as a supplement to sobriety. Research has shown that those who undergo chiropractic treatment during recovery see much higher rates of improvement than those who don't.
