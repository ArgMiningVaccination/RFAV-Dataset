About30% of the world population is affected. Typical allergic symptoms of the immune system's reaction to allergens are runny nose, red eyes or skin reactions like itching, eczema, urticaria, as well as more severe symptoms like asthma and anaphylactic reactions. The overall aim of this thesis was to identify and characterize new pet allergens and to use these to improve diagnostics and p rediction of pet allergy. Furthermore, to provide a relevant platform, a mouse model reflecting chronic asthma, for the development of novel treatment strategies for cat allergy. In the first paper we studied dog saliva as a source of new allergen molecu les for improved diagnostics of allergy to dog. We show that there are at least 12 protein bands in dog saliva that are recognized by IgE antibodies from dog -allergic patients. Several of those bands were not identified in dog dander extract. Furthermore, we demonstrate that about one -fifth of patients with symptoms to dog, but lacking IgE antibodies to dog dander, were IgE positive to saliva. Dog saliva was shown to be a significant allergen source that should be taken into account for improved diagnostics of dog allergy. Combining dog dander and dog saliva or spiking dog dander extract with dog saliva would be beneficial for developing enhanced dog allergy diagnostics. In the second paper of this thesis we investigated the prevalence of sensitization to t he novel cat allergen Fel d 7 in 94 cat -sensitized patients and elucidated Fel d 7's allergenicity and cross - reactivity with the homolog major dog lipocalin allergen Can f 1 on an epitope level. More than a third of the Swedish cat dander -sensitized patien ts, 39%, were IgE positive to Fel d 7 and we could show that Fel d 7 is a biologically active allergen. Our results demonstrate that Fel d is cross - reactive with Can f 1 and indicate that Fel d 7 has epitopes in common with Can f 1 which contributes to the co-sensitization observed in patients with allergy to cat and dog. Also, Can f 1 peptides spanning the Can f 1 sequence were used to map Fel d 7 binding epitopes in a 3D model based on the known structure of a human lipocalin homolog. Paper III describes the association between sensitization patterns to individual cat and dog allergen molecules during childhood and symptoms to these furry animals up to 16 years of age. We investigated sensitization to individual cat and dog allergen mol ecules in childhood through adolescence using the BAMSE (Barn/Children Allergy/Asthma Milieu Stockholm Epidemiologic study) birth cohort. Sera and questionnaire data from 779 randomly collected children at 4, 8 and 16 years were examined. IgE reactivity to cat and dog allergen molecules were analyzed with the MeDALL (Mechanisms for the Development of ALLergy) chip. This is the first study to elucidate the usefulness of analyzing the individual cat and dog allergen molecules as predictors of cat and dog allergy development from childhood to adolescence. We report that IgE to Fel d 1 is as good as IgE to cat extract for diagnosis of cat allergy and IgE to Can f 1 is superior to IgE to dog allergen extract for diagnosis of dog allergy. Thus, molecular -based allergy diagnostics may offer new opportunities for improving diagnosis of pet allergy and in particular allergy to dog. The last paper presents a relevant model for cat allergen -induced asthma in mice, exhibiting features of human chronic disease. Female BAL B/c mice were presensitized with rFel d 1 adsorbed to Alum and subsequently challenged intranasally (i.n.) with cat dander extract (CDE) three consecutive days per week during five weeks. The new animal model displays hallmarks of chronic allergic asthma m imicking human disease, e.g. airway hyperresponsiveness, a mixed neutrophilic and eosinophilic inflammatory response in the lung, proinflammatory cytokines and remodeling in lung tissue. This paper provides a relevant model for studying chronic allergic di sease induced by a natural airway allergen. Thus, the model is suitable for testing novel strategies for cat allergy vaccination, for evaluating and developing new treatments of human disease.LIST OF SCIENTIFIC PAPERS *Shared first authorship Dog saliva -an important source of Allergy, 2013, Hamsten\u00b1 and Marianne van Hage \u00b1. \u00b1Shared last authorship The novel cat lipocalin Fel d 7 and its cross -reactivity with the dog lipocalin Can f 1: Structures, *Shared first authorship, Shared last authorship Sensitization to Fel d 1 and Can f 1 in childhood predicts symptoms of cat and dog allergy in adolescence -a BAMSE/MeDALL study MANUSCRIPT IV.Jeanette *Shared first authorship.

The word 'immunity' comes from the Latin immunis and means 'cannot be touched'. Immunity to disease was noted as early as 430 BC by Thucydides in Athens, where plague survivors resisted repeated infection after their initial exposure. However, it was not until the 1500thcentury that the Turks and Chinese, and finally Edward Jenner in 1798 in England, deliberately i nduced immunity to smallpox by inoculation with dried smallpox virus and cowpox virus, respectively. Since this advancement, medicine has become even more aware of the importance of our immune system.[1] 1.2 INNATE AND ADAPTIVE IMMUNITY 1.2.1 TheInnate immune system The immune system is comprised of two parts working together; the more primitive innate immunity and the later, evolved adaptive immunity. The innate immunity is encoded in our genes and specializes in protecting and quickly eliminating common pathogens by physical, chemical and molecular barriers. To our immediate help against pathogens, we have an outer barrier of epithelia on our skin and mucosal surfaces inside our body together with a protective bacterial layer, microbiome, on all surfaces including healthy bronchus. If a pathogen brea ches the outer defense, our innate immunity forms a first line of defense with anti-microbial substances, phagocytosis, cellular responses, cytokines and the complement system that respond within seconds to hours. The response is mainly inflammatory, and inflammation is characterized by increased vascular permeability and blood flow leading to heat, pain, redness and swelling, or calor,dolor,ruborandtumorin Latin. This inflammation gives access to infiltrating immune cells to the attacked area. Key cel ls in the innate immunity are Natural killer (NK) -cells, Neutrophils, Macrophages (M) and Dendritic Cells (DCs). [1] A new and lesser explored group of innate immune cells are innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) that are divided in types similar to T -cell classification , described later .The most we ll-known ILCs is the NK -cell (ILC1), ILC2s are related to T helper type 2 cells and relevant for allergies[2,3].The innate immunity uses preformed receptors to quickly initiate a primary immune response when stimulated by their ligands. These are more primitive pattern recognition receptor s (PRRs) that respond to damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) receptors (TLRs), are germline encoded and inherited as an evolutionary protection against known pathogens [4]. However, the pathogens often mutate to adapt and escape our innate immune sy stem.[5]21.2.2 The Adaptive immu ne system Through the parallel evolution with microorganisms we have developed a second immune defense, the adaptive immune system, with T-cells and B -cellsandthe ability to recognize almost any foreign antigen by having random antigen receptors. When ly mphocytes are developed, B -cells in the bone marrow and T -cells in the thymus, combinations of hundreds of gene segments of variable regions of their antigen receptors are joined. This creates thousands of variations of the variable regions on the heavy an d light chains of the receptor that is unique to every cell. The variation is further amplified by junctional diversity because nucleotides are added or subtracted in the gene segment -joining process. Hundreds of millions of combinations are created by thi s combinational diversity of the antigen receptor. Most B and T -cell receptors (BCRs and TCRs) will not recognize anything, but when a pathogen is recognized by the receptor these cells undergo selection and proliferation. However, before any pathogen or a ntigen (Ag) can be recognized they need to be presented to the receptors. The presentation bridges between the innate and the adaptive immunity. Macrophages, some B -cells and especially DCs are specialized to effectively monitor their surroundings by const antly engulfing, or phagocytizing, it and are termed \"professional antigen presenting cells\" (pAPCs ). Many cell types, especially during inflammation, have the ability to function as APCs but are less effective. The antigens are taken up, processed enzymatically and presented by Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I and class II to T-cell recep tors in the lymph nodes, which may start an adaptive immune response. [1] Pathogensif in the cellcytosolare processed and presented to on MHC class I on all nucleated cells initiating CD8+ cytotoxic T -cell response to damaged cells.In exogenous pathway, p hagocytized pathogens are presented to CD4+ helper T -cells on MHC class II on pAPC only. TheCD4+-cells can then differentiate into manyfunctions including -cells,memory T -cells, HUMORAL AND CELLULAR IMMUNITY 1.3.1 Humoral immunity Adaptive immunity is divided in humoral -and cellular immunity. Humoral immunity is antibody-based. Na\u00efve B -cells undergo a selection process durin g development in the bone marrow (however their origin in birds, bursaof Fabricus , was discovered earlier and gave rise to the name \"B\" -cell) that leads to the expression of a singleBCR, i.e. a membrane boundantigen-specificimmunoglobulin. [1]Na\u00efve B-cells have not found their specific Ag and have not been activated yet. Circulating in secondary lymphatic tissues (lymph nodes and spleen), theyare activated upon encounter of antigens binding to a specific BCR and enter germinalcenters where they undergo affinity maturation toward the Ag and class switch recombination (CSR) to an immunoglobulin (Ig) isotype (see below). Orchestrated by presentation of extra cellular antigen on MHC class II, CD4+ T -helper-cells activate B -cells via their BCRs which differentiate into either plasma cells th at produce antigen specific3antibodies or into long -lived B-cells with specific BCRs recognizing the Ag and make our defense both faster and stronger at subsequent encounters. [7]This immunologic memory is the basics of vaccination inT-cell dependent B -cell response .B-cell receptors are membrane bound immunoglobulins (Ig) of five classes or isotypes; IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM. There are antigens that can evoke T-cell independent B -cell response but only IgM an d no memory response. Immunoglobulins are glycoproteins that consist of two light chains joined by disulfide bonds with two heavy chains forming a Y -shape. Variable regions on the tips of the heavy and light chains form the antigen -binding site and bind th e antigen, while the constant region of the heavy chain defines the class ,which in turn determines the effector mechanism of the different Igs. All mature B -cells start by expressing IgM, but binding of the antigen together with co -activation from T -cellsactivates the B -cells to class switching into more specialized IgA, IgG or IgE antibodies better suited to fight particular antigen s. Secreted Igs, orantibodies (Ab), are central in immune recognition and in mounting immune responses to pathogens. [1] 1.3.2 Cellular immunity The other part of adaptive immunity is the cell -mediated immunity that does not rely on antibodies ,but onT-cells ofphagocytes helper 1 T -cells (Th1) that are able to kill cells infected by intracellular viruses or bacteria. S pecific CD8+ T cell responses are primed by APCsin secondary lymphatic tissues .This activation is orchestrated by MHC class I presenting intracellular antigen to na\u00efve CD8+ cytotoxic T -cells recognized TCRs. CD4+ Th1 -cells are activated via MHC class II, leading to IFN production, which in turn activates macrophages and increases their microbicidal activity. One imp ortant part of the immune system and cell mediated killing in particular is tight control. Mechanisms like feedback loops and homeostasis usually protects the body from our immune system going out of control. [3] 1.3.3 Th1/Th2 paradigm Since the original presentation of the Th1/Th2 paradigm in 1986[8]the helper T -cells have been divide d into, and seen as a balance and competition between, two Th subsets. These Th subsets, Th1 and Th2, are focused on protecting the host against intracellular microbes and extracellular helminths etc., respectively. Th1 immunity consists of cells with the linage marker Tbet that typically produce the cytokine IFN, while Th2 immunity consists of cells expressing the linage marker GATA -3 that typically produce IL -4, IL-5 and IL-13, which induce anti -body production. Lately, it has become more and more clear that this classification is oversimplified. More subclasses have been identified and the plasticity among Th subsets is greater than it was first thought to be. The Th17 subset is a third distinct butplastic linage with RORt positive cells that produce t he signature cytokine IL -17 and are specialized in fighting extracellular bacteria and fungi. [3,9]Other Th-cell subsets that have been established are producing the signature cytokines IL -9 and4IL-22, respectively, and expressing the transcription factors IRF4/PU.1 (Th9) the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) (Th22). [3] 1.3.4 T-regulatory cells Tolerance, as mentioned earlier, is a key concept in the immune system . T-regulatory (Treg) cells arecommonly defined as and CD127 negative T - cells[13]. These mainly refer to thymus -derived, or natural, Treg cells. Peripheral induced, or adaptive, Treg cells may be Foxp3 positive or negative. Treg cells have the ability to end an inflammatory state to keep homeostasis , influence (i.e. dampen) other cells and maintain peripheral tolerance . Tregs regulate o ther immune cells co -stimulatory molecule s.[14] 1.4 ALLERG Y 1.4.1 History of allergy Allergic diseases have been described already in 900 AD when the Persian physician Rhazi described seasonal rhinitis [15], but it took a long time before the modern nomenclature was coined. In 1902, the French physiologists Richet and Portier observed that dogs experience immediate anaphylaxis and even death when exposed to a second dose of a small protein toxin of sea anemo nes. Instead of giving protection, or phylaxis, as expected, the prior injections made the immune system hypersensitized. [16]The term allergy was finally introduced in 1906 by the Austrian pediatrician Pirquet, and refers to allos 'other' and ergon 'work'.[17]IgE, which is central in allergic disease, was first described as 'reagin' in 1922 and characterized as IgE in 1966.[18,19] 1.4.2 Types of allergy The prevalence of allergy is ab out30%.[20-24]Typical allergy symptoms arerunny nose, red eyesor skin reactions like itching, eczema,urticaria,as well as more severe symptoms likeasthmaand anaphylactic reactions .The nomenclature for al lergic diseases has been unified to allow scientists and different medical disciplines, as well as the public, to correctly address allergic and hyper -reactivity problems. [25] Allergy is a hypersensitivity initiated Therearenon-allergic hypersensitivit iesand allergic hypersensitivit ies; the latter is referred to as allergy. Allergic hypersensitivity is in turn divided into IgE -mediated allergy and non IgE -mediated allergy (Fig.1).Atopy is connected to allergy and refers to individuals who are genetically predisposed to produce IgE antibodies in serum to normally harmless environmental agents, allergens. The definition of atop y is: \"A personal or familial tendency to produce IgE antibodies in response to low doses of allergens, usually proteins, and to develop typical symptoms such as asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis, or eczema/dermatitis.\" [25,26]IgE-mediated5allergy is the most common type of allergic hypersensitivity and the majority of patients are atopic.There arehoweversomeexceptions ;for example ,wasp allergy is not linked to ato py. Allergic contact dermatitis is an example of non IgE mediated hypersensitivity. [25,27] Figure 1. Classification of hypersensitivities and allergies. with .[25] 1.4.3 Allergic sensitization The up-to-dateexplanation of allergy is that when certain individuals that are most often atopic encounter an allergen for the first time, various parts of their immune system start to overreact. Allergic reactions are overly -powerful, or faulty, responses to normally h armless environmental antigens, or allergens. It is not known why some proteins become allergens. PRRs like TLRs on APCs have been shown to interact with some allergens, possibly mistaking them for pathogens. APCs migrate and present the allergen to T cell s in the lymph nodes.[1]The immune res ponse depends on the location, the cytokine milieu around the cell and the co -stimulatory signals. The IgE antibody production in allergy requires Th2 cells and is inhibited by Th1 cells and INF. [5,28]Also the route and dose to the allergen exposure have importance. A low dos e favors an allergic Th2 response and m any common allergens are inhaled and del ivered to the lungs in low dose .[1,29]DC mediated priming of na\u00efve Th cells into Th2 are very important in deciding over induc tion of Th2 -cells and production of proinflamatory cytokines in the induction of allergic reactions .[30]Th2 cells expand and produce cytokines like IL -4, IL-5and IL-13that further promotes allergic inflammation, Th2 expansion, B cell class switch to production of IgE, recruitment, differentiation and 6maturation of basophils, mast cells and eosinophils. In this sensitization phase, IgE antibodies aresecreted into circulation andbind to the -chain of the high-affinity receptors for IgE (i.e. FcRI) on the surface of mast cells and basophils. This results in these cells and the persons becoming sensitized to that allergen. [1]In healthy individuals, Tregs help to suppress reactions towards allergens, whereas allergic individuals have been shown to have an impaired Treg response to allergens due to a Th2 cytokine milieu that inhibits Treg developmen t.[31] 1.4.4 Early phase reaction In the effector phase of allergy, a new encounter with the allergen cause scross-linking ofIgE antibodies on sensitized mast cells and basophils . These cells are activated andwithin a few minutesdegranulate to releasepreformed and newly with chemokines released and stimulate the production of more cytokine sandchemokines while the degranulated mast cells and basophils start producing leukotrienes and prostagla ndins. The inflammatory response is characterized by increased vascular permeability and blood flow, which leads to heat, redness and swelling. This causes bronchoconstriction, airway mucus secretion, itching, rashes and possible systemic anaphylaxis vasodilation.[1]Anaphylaxis or anaphylactic shock is not the most common allergic symptom but is the most severe. Systematic effects give an acute fall in blood pressure followed by contraction of smooth muscles with stress on the heart and lungs that can be fatal within minutes of contact with the allergen.[32,33] 1.4.5 Late phase reaction Severalhoursafter allergen exposure , the activation of allergen -specific T -cells can in some patients induce a late phase allergic reaction withedemaof the skin (after a skin pri ck test), blockage of the nose, and narrowing of the and hypersecreti and resident mast cells. [1]Anaphylaxis can also be delayed and occ ur during the late phase. [33] 1.4.6 Chronic phase If the allergic inflammation is sustained over a n extended period of time,extracellular matrix and structural cells can be affected to the point thatchronic inflammation can lead to tissue remodeling and fibrosis ,coupledwith thedevelopment of allergic asthma. [33]The sustained state withexcessof e.g. IL-4 and IL-5starts a processwhereexcess of extra cellular matrix production and fibrousconnective tissueforms a scared area and fibrosis permanently damageto the lung tissue. [28,34]This damage leads to progression of asthma and decrease of flexibility of the lung with asthma symptoms as result.71.4.7 Etiology 1.4.7.1Genetics and epigenetics About half the western urban population is atopic and the majority of people with allergy are atopic.[35]Atopic families and individuals have a concentration of genes or gene variants in areas related to endogenous induction of inflammation associated with allergic asthma. Allergic rhinitis, grass sensitization andcat allergy ha vebeencoupled with other genes typically related to Interleukins and MHC/HLA.However, as in all complex diseases ,the genetic contribution is only one partof the reason why symptoms occur ; it ispossible to develop allergies without being atopic .Another part is epigenetics, first used by Conrad H al Waddinton in 1940 for the layer above the genes reg ulating somatic gene expression modifications. [36]Environmental exposures can influence the epigenome effecting e.g. pro - inflammatory cytokines related to allergic disease and the changes can be inherited. [2,37] However, inherited factors alone cannot explain the etiology of allergic disease. 1.4.7.2Hygiene hypothesis There has been a marked increase in allergic diseases in children and young adults [38]that has reached epidemic proportions wor ldwide, and the incidence of these diseases is continuing to increase in association with a western metropolitan lifestyle. [35,39,40] Environmental exposure to potential allergens early in life or during pregnancy probably has a key role in the development of allergy [41,42]. Increased prosperity, health, new diets and environment are all hypothesized to contribute to the increasing number of allergic diseases due to under -stimulation of the immune system, making it over -sensitive. This explanation is referred to as the 'Hygi ene hypothesis'. Countries now experiencing the development seen in the western world a few decades ago are also accompanied by increases in allergic diseases, e.g. the Baltic countries and, more recently, China. Now more and more data supports the hygienehypothesis. [43-45] 1.5 ALLERGENS 1.5.1 Allergen families There are major and minor allergens. The definition of a major allergen is that IgE sensitization to the allergen is found in over 50% of the patients allergic to the allergen source it originates from. Minor allergens have a prevalence of sensitization of less than 50%. [46, 47]Allergens are named after the Latin names of their origin and are, as a rule, numbered according to the order they were discovered and reported to WHO/ International Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS).[46,48,49]Allergens are proteins or glycoproteins, typically globular proteins and often with enzymatic activity. The enzymatic activity can be protease activity, as in the major mite ( Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus )allergen Der p 1, by which e.g. tight junctions are digested facilitating the allergen access across epithelial barriers. [50- 52]Other allergens have enzymatic activity that stimulates other paths. Many allergens are8similar to their human counterpart proteins, while they need to be different enough to be allergenic. With respect to mammalian allergens, lipocalins is the largest allergen family, and more than 50% of the total allergens identified from furry animals belong to this protein family.[53]They are found in many body fluids and secretions including urine, tears, saliva, serum and dander. All lipocalins share a conserved structure and folding pattern, even if they often only share some sequence identity. [54-56]The only other main pet allergens not belonging to the lipocalin family are the major cat ( Felis domesticus ) allergen Fel d 1, major dog ( Canis familiaris ) allergen Can f 5, a urinarykallikrein[59].Serum albumin is another common allergen family that is present in most pets. [40,60-65] 1.5.2 Allergen Extracts Allergen extracts are mixtures of allergens and non -allergenic material, e.g. enzymes and other proteins extracted from an allergen source. Pet allergen extracts are typically prepared by extracting proteins from hair and ski n scrape i.e. dander. Saliva, and urine to some extent, are transferred to fur and can often be found in these kinds of extracts. Someallergensmay be poorly represented in crude allergen extracts among non-allergenic molecules or unproportional amounts o f other allergens from the same source .[66]Smaller animals such as mites or ticks, or food and plant allergens that are often present in the allergen source, may be present in the extract andpetextractshave been shown to cause false positive results, due to contamination .[67-69]These impurities can even lead to new sensitizations during treatments with extracts. [70]The advantage of extracts is that they resemble the allergen sources in composition and are similar to how we are exposed to the allergens in real life. Unfortunately, even with attempts to standardize production the content and the quality of allergen extracts have shown great variability. [66] to cats ( Felis domesticus ) is the second most common indoor allergy in the western world for both children and adults. The major cat allergen is Fel d 1, which is a salivary uteroglobin protein ,[58,71]is a very dominant cat allergen . Up to 95% of all cat -allergic patients have IgE against Fel d 1. [72-74]Fel d 2 is a serum albumin, Fel d 3 a cystatinand Fel d 4 a lipocalin. Fel d 5 i s cat IgA and Fel d 6 cat IgM, which contains the carbohydrate galactose--1,3-galactose (alpha -Gal)[75].The newly identified Fel d 7 and Fel d 8 belong to the lipocalin and salivary latherinfamily, respectively. [76,77]The prevalence of IgE reactivity among patients allergic to cat for Fel d 2 is around 20%, Fel d 3: 10%, Fel d 4: 60%, Fel d 5: 40%, Fel d 6: NA, Fel d 7 38% and Fel d 8: 20% , summarized in ( Canis familiaris ) allergen Can f 1 together with Can f 2, Can f 4 and Can f 6 belong to the lipocalin family. [54,78-81]Can f 3 is serum albumin [82]and Can f 5 is prostatic kallikrein. Can f 5 derived from dog urine was identified as a major allergen in 2009 and reported to be recognized by up to 70% of dog -sensitized patients. [59]The importance of Can f 5 as a diagnostic marker for dog allergy is however questionable. The lipocalin Can f 6 is the most recently di scovered dog allergen. [59,78]The prevalence of IgE reacti vity among patients allergic to dog for Can f 1 is around50%, Can f 2: 25%, Can f 3: 20%, Can f 4: 20%, and Can f i.e. IgE -binding to similar epitopes in different protein or to homologous proteins, isoften found among lipocalins and serum albumins in pets. The fact that allergens from different furry animals often belong to the same allergen families has raised questions about cross reactivity. Investigations have determined that these lipocalins and serum albumins are respo nsible for most of the cross reactivity that isseen.[54,78,83- 86]The largest possibility to find cross activity is when the allergens have more than 60% sequence identity. [78] Epitope spreading is related to the progression of allergic disease and, much like cross reactivity, is caused by IgE receptor presenting an allergen with a shared epitope to which the allergic individual is already sensitized. This process can lead to sensitization to new adjacent epitopes and new allergens if some epitopes are shared the different allergens. [87, 88] 1.5.6 Recombinant allergens Advances in molecular biology during the recent decades have enabled the generation of recombinant allergens, with well -defined molecular, immunological and biological characteristics. [89-91]The first allergen to be cloned was Der p 1in 1988. [92-94]This opens up possibilities to produce standardized products of reliable purity. Genes of the allergens are cloned into expression vectors and transformed in to Escherichia . Coliproduction systems like e.g. BL -21.Recombinant (r) proteins can be produced consistently and with very high purity, and are therefore very attractive for diagnostics as well as treatments and can help in increasing specificity. [83,95]Recently, allergenic molecules from the most important allergen sources have become available as recombinant proteins. 1.6 ALLERGY TREATMENT 1.6.1 Symptomatic treatment The first approach to relive allergic symptoms is avoidance of the allergen source, but some allergens are hard to avoid. As a next step, a variety of medications are utilized for10symptomatic therapy, e.g. anti -histamines, anti -leukotrienes and inhaled ste roids.[1]These kinds of treatments onl y give short term relief from the symptoms and lifelong treatment is often needed. Acute anaphylaxis is treated by intramuscular adrenalin (epinephrine) injections that relax respiratory smooth muscles and acts on the heart. [32]A drug given exclusively in special cases such as severe allergic asthmawith high IgE levels is the humanized monoclonal antibody Omalizumab (Xolair). Its specificity is against circulating IgE and works by blocking the IgE from binding to the IgE receptors on the mastcells and basophils. [96]However, a lifelong treatment regime isnot ideal. 1.6.2 Curative treatment The word vaccination springs from 'vacca ,' Latin for cow ,and originates from the phenomena of transferred immunity. It was described by E. A. Jenner in \"An Inquiry into the Cause and Effects of the Variolae Vaccinae\" in 1798. [97]Allergen Specific Immunotherapy (ASIT), lately termed allergy vaccination, is the only treatment that can cure allergic disease , and it has been performed for over 100 years [98]. In 1911, the BritishscientistLeonardNoon treated grass pollen allergic patients with grass extract. He injected patients with the extract over several weeks in increasing amounts and successfully alleviated hay fever symptoms. [99]ASIThasbeen proven to be aclinically e ffective treatment for allergic disease. It is the only disease -modifying therapy that can reduceallergic inflammation and prevent the development of chronic disease. [100]Typically an adjuvant is used in ASIT to increase to effect of ASIT. Alum is currently the adjuva ntused insubcutaneous ASIT (SCIT), but our research group and others has also evaluated other adjuvants and approaches for better and safer ASIT. Alum mainly promotes Th2 immune responses [101], which is not ideal in an allergy context, and its main function in allergy vaccines is to prevent systemic spreading of the allergen. Moreover, a common adverse side effect to SCIT is granuloma formation at the injection site, caused by alum [102].The aimwith an adjuvant in ASIT is to modify the allergen -specific immune response to tolerate an allergen by changing the immune response to the allergen from allergic Th2 to tolerogenic Treg or Th1 induction of IgG that hinder allergen binding to IgE. [103-105]Most commonly, ASIT is performed by subcutaneous injections of the allergen extract (SCIT). Newer (ILIT) [108]where tablet/drops are given orally or injections in to lymph nodes, respectively. In the latter, sine it is given directly into the lymph node, only a very small dose needs to be given reducing the risk of side effects. The oral route t is convenient since patients can administer the tablets/drops themselves, but has shown to be less efficient compared to SCIT. However, traditional ASIT protocols similar to the SCIToriginal protocol by Noon are long, up to five years, as well as time -and resource -consuming and areassociated with risksof both early and late adverseside effects. [109]In order to make the treatment attractive for more patients that would benefit from ASIT, new safer and shorter treatment strategies with11fewer injections and new administration routes are currently under development and assessment. [95,110-117]Weimplement the knowledge into a future treatment of allergy via mouse models . Most mouse model are acute, meaning that they model the acute phase of allergic disease but a few, including our, are chronic models that also mirror the chronic stages of human allergic disease.132THESIS AIMS The overall aim of this thesis is toidentify and characterize new pet allergens and to use the findingsto improve diagnostics and theprediction of pet allergy. Andfurthermore ,toprovide a relevant platform,a mouse model reflecting chronic asthma, for the development of novel treatment strategies for cat allergy. The specific objectives of the four papers are: Specific aims: Paper I:To evaluate dog saliva as a source of new allergen molecules for improved diagnostics of allergy to dog. Paper II: To investigate the prevalence of sensitization to the novel allergen Fel d 7 in a European cat -sensitized population and elucidate its allergenicity and cross -reactivity with the dog allergen Can f 1 on a n epitope level. Paper III: To investigate the association between sensitization patterns to cat and dog allergen molecules during childhood and symptoms to these furry animals up to 16 years of age. Paper IV: To establish a relevant model for cat allerg en-induced asthma in mice, exhibiting features of human chronic disease.153METHODS The methods used in the different papers included in this thesis are briefly described in this section with reference to the papers where they are applied. Each paper contains a section with detailed descriptions of the material and methods. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) ELISA was used to determine the content of e.g. antibodies or cytokines in fluids, e.g. sera or BAL. Different types of ELISAs were used where an antigen or an antibody was coated. Inhibition ELISAs were conducted with serial dilutions of inhibitors mixed with serum prior to the ELISA. A reference standard for e.g. IgE or IgG was used when quantifying absolute levels. ELISA was used in paper I, II and IV. ImmunoCAP A routine diagnostic method, ImmunoCAP, was used for determining allergen -specific IgE (ImmunoCAP System; Phadia/Thermo Fisher, Uppsala, Sweden) in which an allergen molecule or allergen extract is coupled to a solid phase. The allergen -specific IgE levels are given in kUA/L. This method was used in paper I, II and IV. Luminex Luminex is a techn ique reminiscent of ELISA but that simultaneously measures and quantifies multiple protein targets in a single fluid, e.g. serum, sample. This method was used in paper IV. MeDALL chip The MeDALL (Mechanisms for the Development of ALLergy) microarray is ba sed on the, ISAC technology. The values are given in ISAC Units (ISU -E). This method was used in paper III. Protein production and purification Genesof allergens of interest; Fel d 1, Fel d 7 and Can f 1, were cloned into expression plasmids and transformed into Escherichia. Coli production systems. Bacterial pellets were solubilized and purified by e.g. His -tag specificity on immobilized metal chelate affinity chromatography (IMAC) and size. These methods were used in paper I, II and IV. Biochemical characterization Allergen proteins were analyzed by SDS -PAGE to verify molecular size and purity. Some gels were used for immunoblotting or 2D -PAGE before mass spectrometry. These methods were used in paper I and II. Immunoblot Proteins of interest were transferred from SDS -PAGE gels to membranes and detected using specific antibodies and a secondary enzyme-conjugated detecting antibody.This method was used in paper I Mass spectrometry Protein extracts from different sources were separated by 2D -PAGE. Protein dots of interest were excited, by LC -MS/MS (Liquid chromatography -Tandem mass16spectrometry or) for identification. This method was used in paper II. Mouse model Different protocols were used in which mice were presensitized subcutaneously with alum - adsorbed recombinant cat allergen Fel d 1, followed by intranasal challenges with cat dander extract spiked with recombinant Fel d 1 or PBS. For reference, mice were presensitized and challenged with ovalbumin following the same protocol. This method was used in paper IV. Airway hyperresponsiveness measurements Airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) was analyzed by a direct invasive method, using a small animal ve ntilator, FlexiVent. The airway response to increasing doses of metacholine is recorded using computerized measurements of pressure and air flow. From these data lung physiological parameters such as resistance and elastance can be calculated. This method was used in paper IV. Bronchoalveolar lavage Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed directly after AHR measurement to assess the inflammatory response to AW challenge. Lungs of mice were flushed with PBS to collect BAL cells and fluid (BALF) for diff erential cell counting and cytokine measurements, respectively. This method was used in paper IV. Lung remodeling analyses At the end of the mouse protocol ,lungs were subjected to histological analyses of inflammation and tissue remodeling. Paraffin -embedded lung sections were stained by hematoxilin/eosin (HE) and periodic acid -Schiff/Alcian blue reaction (PAS) for detection of infiltrating cells and mucus and with Masson's trichrome for analysis of connective tissue. This method was used in paper IV. Quantitative PCR At the end of the mouse protocol ,lung tissue cDNA was amplified from mRNA expression of particular genes e.g. Th2 cytokines (IL -4 and IL-5 mRNA expression) analyzed and quantified in comparison to a reference gene. This method was used in paper IV. Basophil activation test In the basophil activation test (BAT), basophils were tested for reactivity and sensitivity to different stimulants. Whole blood samplesfrom allergic patients were incubated with serial dilutions of allergen and then s tained for the basophil marker CD203c and the degranulation marker CD63. This method was used in paper I and II. Rat basophil leukemia assay Rat basophil leukemia (RBL) cells transfected with the human high -affinity IgE receptor FcRI were incubated with sera from sensitized patients and stimulated with different concentration of allergens. Release of -hexosaminidase from RBL cell was measured in ELISA. This method was used in paper III. Circular dichroism spectroscopy Far and near U V circular dichroism (CD) -spectrawereperformed to obtain information on17secondary and tertiary protein structures for protein characterization and to compare structures between proteins. This method was used in paper II. 3D modeling Sequences of allerg en molecules of interest were compared using SWISS -MODEL to predict the 3D structure. This method was used in paper II. Rabbit immunization Peptide-specific IgG antibodies were obtained by immunizing rabbits three times with Can f 1 - derived synthetic pep tides. This method was used in paper III . Statistical analyses Association between sensitization patterns to allergen molecules and symptoms were analyzed for e.g. Odds Ratios (OR) and Positive/Negative predictive values (PPV/NPV). Results from treatment groups from the mouse asthma model protocol were compared by Mann -Whitney U -test. These methods were used in paper III and IV, respectively. In addition Spearman Correlation test (in paper I,II) and linear regression as well as t -tests (in paper III) were used. Ethical statement All human studies and animal experiments conducted in paper I, II, III and IV were approved by the local ethics committees. Written consent was obtained from all patients recruited for the basophil experiments.184RESULTS AND DISCU SSION 4.1 IDENTIFICATION OF DO G SALIVA ALLERGENS A ND THEIR IMPROVMENT OF DOG AL LERGY DIAGNOSTICS [I ] In this paper, we studied dog saliva as a source of allergens for improved diagnosis of allergy to dog. We compared dog saliva and dog dander extracts in western blot and observed that the dog-allergic patients had IgE specific to many salivary proteins. T here was a greater abundance and diversity of IgE -binding proteins in dog saliva compared to dog dander extract (Fig. 2). In dog dander extract, most of the patients recognized protein bands at positions corresponding to sizes of known dog allergens. Contr astingly, at least 12 IgE - binding proteins were detected in dog saliva and several of those were of molecular weight sizes not recognized in the dog dander extract (Fig. 2). Figure 2SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analyses of dog saliva (S) pool (n = 14) and dog dander (D) extract (Allergon). Immunoblot was developed with single dog -allergic patient's sera. m, Molecular weight markers; c, control (buffer); lanes 1 -13, patient sera. We looked further into the IgE binding in dog dander and dog saliva by a 2D -PAGE by using a pool of dog allergic patient's sera (n=13). The seven most prominent IgE binding spots detected among dander (five) and saliva (two) samples were cut out, trypsin in -gel digested, analyzed and identified by LC -MS/MS sequencing of peptides an d database searches. From the saliva sample five spots were analyzed, and Can f 1, 2, 3 and 6 peptides were identified in one or more spots. We also found four new saliva allergen candidates in the dog saliva. These were two BPI fold proteins and dog IgA h eavy chain constant region. From the dog dander extract two spots were analyzed, and Can f 1, 2, 3, 4 as well as Can f 6 together with BPIFA1 peptides were identified in one or both spots. Verifying the known allergens strengthen the data on the new allerg en candidates. The majority of dog dander positive patient sera (44 of 59) were also IgE positive to dog saliva in ELISA. More than one -third of these patients (23/59; 39%) had a higher IgE reactivity to saliva than to dander. Among 55 dog dander negative patients with symptoms to dog, 20% were IgE positive to dog saliva. As diagnosis of dog allergy in daily practice relies on the clinical history of the patient together with diagnostics bas ed on dog dander extract, 19our results have important clinical implications . We observed that the correlation between IgE responses to saliva and dander in ELISA was r2= 0.48 (P<0.0001) (Fig. 3), reflecting that the two allergen sources are related, but mo re interestingly, that they also differ in their allergen content. This gives the potential to utilizedog saliva for future improved diagnostics of dog allergy. One approach would be to spike dog dander extract with dog saliva. Since saliva is full of deg radation enzymes and unstable, another option would be to apply the newly identified dog allergens from saliva in component resolved diagnostic to get data on the individual allergen molecules. Figure 3Correlation between IgE reactivity to dog dander (y -axis) and dog saliva (x -axis) (n = 59); OD -optical density, r2-correlation factor. The allergenic activity of saliva was confirmed by basophil degranulation in three patients, emphasizing that saliva is an allergen source. Interestingly, one of these patients was low or non-responding to dog dander extract. Dog saliva gave rise to similarorhigherbasophil activation than dog dander in all three patients. The results strengthen the importance of improving dog dander based diagnostics by dog saliva. Other allergen sources, such as urine, might also hold undiscovered dog allergens. A rece ntly discovered urinary major dog allergen is Can f 5. However, Can f 5 is deposited on male dog hair and dander [59]. We analyzed saliva from different dog breeds and noted that there are great variations in the IgE-binding profile where some h ad fewer IgE binding bands and the amount of different proteins varied. Overall, a greater abundance and diversity of IgE -binding proteins was found in dog saliva compared to dog dander extract. We showed that there are many false negative results in currentdog allergy. About one -fifth of patients with symptoms to dog, but lacking IgE antibodies to dog dander, were IgE positive to saliva. Taken together ,we show that there are at least 12 protein bands in dog saliva that are recognized by IgE antibodies from dog -allergic patients. Furthermore, we demonstrate that about one -fifth of patients with symptoms to dog, but lacking IgE antibodies to dog dander, were IgE positive to saliva. Thus dog saliva was shown to be a significant allergen source that should be taken into account for improved diagnostics of dog allergy. Combining dog dander and dog saliva or spiking dog dander extract with dog saliva would be beneficial for developing enhanced dog allergy diagnostics. 204.2 ALLERGENIC CHARACTER IZATION OF THE CROSS -REACTIVE LIPOCALIN CAT ALLERG EN FEL D 7 [II] In this paper, we studied the newly discovered cat lipocalin allergen Fel d 7 and report that it is an important allergen in a Swedish cat sensitized population. As the primary structure of Fel d 7 ha s a high sequence similarity and identit y (63%) with Can f 1 we also investigated its cross-reactivity with Can f 1. In SDS -PAGE we noted that both proteins appeared mainly as monomers in line with earlier reports . The near and far UV circular dichroism (C D)-spectra of rFel d 7 and rCan f 1 revealed similar secondary structure and tertiary structures. More than a third of the Swedish cat dander -sensitized patients (37/94 individuals) were IgE positive to rFel d 7. The figure is similar to the one reported a mong cat allergic patients from Australia. The result shows that the newly identified lipocalin Fel d 7 is an important allergen in a Swedish cat sensitized population in addition to the very dominating major cat allergen Fel d 1 . The Fel d 7 -positive sera were also analyzed for IgE to rCan f 1 and the majority, 34 (89.2%), had IgE reactivity to rCan f 1 as well. We found a modest correlation (r =0.58, P < 0.001) between the IgE levels to Fel d 7 and Can f 1 ,indicating that there is IgE cross-reactivity between these two lipocalins. Even though Fel d 7 has been accepted as an allergen by the WHO/ International Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS) allergen nomenclature committee since 2011 [76], its biological activity has so far not been elucidated. We investigated the allergenic activity of rFeld 7 by basophil activation test (BAT) using blood from cat allergic patients who were IgE positive to Fel d 7 and found that Fel d 7 was able to stimulate basophil degranulation. Thus, Fel d 7 is a biological active allergen. To further strengthen our fi nding we looked into the biological activity of Fel d 7 in relation to Can f 1 by analyzing sera from 11 patients IgE - positive to both rFel d 7 and rCan f 1 in a rat basophil leukemia (RBL) assay. We noted that the allergens induced a varying degree of deg ranulation that was independent of the allergen - specific IgE levels. We further explored the allergenic cross -reactivity between Fel d 7 and to Can f 1 by inhibition ELISA using sera sensitized to rFel d 7 and rCan f 1. We found that the degree of cross -reactivity varied between patients. Can f 1 was able to completely inhibit the IgE binding to rFel d 7 in two out of five sera, whereas rFel d 7 was able to inhibit the binding to rCan f 1 to 70% in two sera. The other sera showed lower degree or no inhibiti on. The results indicate that Fel d 7 has epitopes in common with the major dog lipocalin allergen Can f 1 which contributes to co -sensitization observed in patients with allergy to cat and dog. We then aimed to identify the cross -reactive epitopes on Fel d 7 and Can f 1. Sera from rabbits immunized with five overlapping Can f 1 peptides spanning the Can f 1 sequence were used. We observed that peptides covering the C -and N-terminal epitopes gave rise to a stronger binding to rFel d 7 thanthe other antise ra. Based on the results we created a 3D model, SWISS -MODEL, on the known model of human tear lipocalin/von Ebners gland protein (VEGP). Figure 4shows that the main epitopes shared between Fel d 7 and Can f 1 are located at the C -and N-terminus (highlig hted) which is consistent with our results from the Can f 1 peptide antisera (Fig. 4B). As Fel d 1 has shown not to account for all IgE21binding to cat extract, a larger cat allergen panel is needed in diagnostics. With respect to Feld 7,we have shown th at it is an important allergen in 39% of cat sensitized patients, and contributes to the co -sensitization noted between cat and dog allergic patients.

Sera and questionnaire data from 779 randomly collected children at 4, 8 and 16 years were used . IgEreactivity to cat and dog allergen molecules wereanalyzed with the MeDALL (Mechanisms for the Development of ALLergy) chip .Allergy was defined as reported rhinitis, conjunctivitis or asthma at exposure to cat or dog. We first investigated t he prevalence of IgE sensitization to cat and dog extract (ImmunoCAP ) and found that it increased over time ,from 6.8% at 4 years to19.8% at 16 years for cat and from 5.1% to 22.9%for dog.Likewise, a llergic symptoms to cat and dog increased during the same period from 4.8% to 11.2% for cat and from 3.1% to 5.5% for dog. We also found that the prevalence of IgE to any of the cat or dog allergen molecules increased and reached nearly 15% and 22% at age 16 for any of dog or cat allergen molecules, respectively. Interestingly, sensitization to Can f 5 (1.9 -12.6% at 4-16 yrs) was more common than to Canf 1 (1.9-5.5% at 4-16 yrs), but Can f 1 induced the highest IgE levels. 22We next investigated IgE reactivity cross -sectionally and found that the IgE levels to Fel d 1 were significantly higher at each time poin t among children with symptoms to cat compared to asymptomatic children. Even though 81%of children sensitized to a single dog allergen molecule at 16 years had IgE reactivity to Can f 5, only about 10% of them reported symptoms. We calculated positive pr edictive values (PPV) for symptoms among subjects with IgE reactivity to cat or dog allergen extract or to the different pet allergen molecules. We observed that IgE to Fel d 1 and to cat extract had similar PPV for cat allergy . However, IgE to Can f 1 sho wed a higher PPV for dog allergy than IgE to dog extract. Th us,IgE testing with just one cat allergen molecule, Fel d 1, is as good as testing IgE to cat allergen extract and IgE to Can f 1 seems to have advantages over dog allergen extract. The results have implication for diagnosing cat and dog allergy. Next we elucidated IgE reactivity to the pet allergens longitudinally in relation to symptoms. Only IgE to Fel d 1 at 4 and 8 years was significantly associated with increased risk of symptoms to cat at 16 yrs (OR=13.7, 95% CI 8.3 -22.7after adjustment for the other cat allergen molecules ) (Fig.5, lower part ).With respect to dog allergen molecules ,sensitization to Can f 1 at 4 and 8 years was the only dog allergen significantly associated with symptoms to dog at 16 years (OR=8.0, 95% CI 2.3 -27.7 adjust mentfor other dog allergens) (Fig.5, lower part) .Furthermore, we noted that sensitization to more than one pet allergen at 4 or 8 years significantly increased thelikelihood of having pet a llergy symptoms at 16 years (Fig.6). Thus, sensitization to Fel d 1 and Can f 1 at 4 and 8 years are risk markers forcat and dog allergy at 16 years. Figure 5Longitudinal logistic regression.

N=779. *Adjusted for concomitant sensitization to the other cat or dog components, respectively. 23Figure 6Likelihood (y -axis: percentage) of reporting symptoms to cat/dog at 16 years of age depending on the number of IgE -reactive cat (Fel d 1, Fel d 2, Fel d 4) or dog (Can f 1, Can f 2, Can f 3, Can f 5 and Can f 6) allergens and ImmunoCAP cat or dog extract sensit ization (x -axes) at 4 years. This is the first study to elucidate the usefulness of analyzing individual cat and dog allergen molecules as predictors of cat and dog allergy development from childhood to adolescence. For diagnosis of cat allergy ,IgE toFel d 1 is as good as IgE to cat extract and IgE to Can f 1 is superior to IgE to dog allergen extract. Thus,molecular-based allergy diagnostics may offer new opportunities for improving diagnosis of petallergy and in particular allergy to dog. 244.4 DEVELOP MENT OF A MOUSE MODE L FOR CHRONIC ALLERGIC ASTHMA [IV] In Paper IV ,we aimed to develop a protocol for induction of chronic allergic disease in mice, in order to obtain a relevant model for studying novel treatment strategies for allergy to cat. Female BAL B/c mice were presensitized with rFel d 1 adsorbed to Alum and subsequently challenged intranasally (i.n.) with cat dander extract (CDE) three consecutive days per week during five weeks in the main optimized protocol (Fig. 7). As a reference, one group of mice was subjected to the same protocol using chicken albumin (OVA) for sensitization and i.n. allergen challenge. rFel d 1 sensitized and PBS -challenged mice served as negative controls. Both the cat allergen and OVA models generated AHR in response to m etacholine and inflammation as demonstrated by histological analyses of the lung tissue. The OVA model displayed typical signs of Th2 allergy with predominant influx of eosinophils and lymphocytes in BAL, and elevated levels of Th2 cytokines in lung tissue (IL-5 protein levels and IL-4 and IL-5 mRNA expression). In contrast, our cat allergen induced asthma model showed a mixed type of allergic response, with enhanced total numbers of lymphocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils in BAL, increased lung tissue IL -17a levels and elevated relative mRNA expression of IL -17a, IL-4 and IFN -in the lung tissue. In a separate protocol ,AW inflammation and tissue remodeling was specifically studied by histological analyses of lung tissue. Both the cat allergen -and OVA se nsitization and challenge protocols resulted in high inflammatory scores and both models exhibited signs of AW remodeling (Fig.8). Finally, the allergen-specific antibody response was of a mixed Th1/Th2 type in the cat allergy model, with elevated levels o f IgE (not significant, p=0.56), IgG1 and IgG2a to Fel d1 compared to PBS-challenged control mice. Figure 7 Presensitization (s.c. Alum -Fel d 1) and challenge (i.n. CDE) protocol. We havepreviously developed an acute mouse model of allergy to cat .[118]The present model displays hallmarks of chronic allergic asthma, such as AHR, a mixed neutrophilic and eosinophilic infiltration in BAL similar to that in human allergic asthma, expression of the proinflammatory Th17 cytokine IL -17a and signs of remodeling in lung tissu e.A chronic model for a chronic disease that is against a natural airway allergen , Fel d 1,and that more closely resembles natur ali.n.exposure is a big advancement in allergy models. Earlier models were short acute models and/or with unnatural exposure by injections and/ allergens 25like OVA. Mouse models with OVA are skewed towards producing Th1 cytokines thatdo not reflect human allergic , Th2,diseasewell[119].This paper provides a relevant mo del for studying chronic allergic disease induced by a natural airway allergen. Thus, the model is suitable for testing novel strategies for allergy vaccination (i.e. ASIT) for evaluating and developing new treatments of human disease. Figure 8Inflammation and tissue remodelling in lungs from mice (n = 4). a)Total inflammation score based on the sum of scores (max score = 12) for the degree of inflammatory cell infiltration, amount of inflammatory infiltrate, and of macrophages and the area inv olved in lesions in HE -stained sections (left).

We found at least 12 prot ein bands in dog saliva that were recognized by IgE antibodies of dog -allergic patients ,and several of those were not found in dog dander. This means that saliva has a greater diversity of IgE -binding proteins than dog dander, in which only a few IgE -binding proteins corresponding to already known dog allergens were detected. In dog saliva ,four interesting new allergen candidates (BPIFA2, mucin-5B and angiopoietin -related protein 5 -like (ANGPTL5) and IgA heavy chain constant region) were identified alongs ide known allergens. We also showed that current diagnostics for dog allergy, using dog dander extract, generate many false negative results. About one - fifth of patients with symptoms to dog, but lacking IgE antibodies to dog dander, were IgE positive to s aliva. Thus,dog saliva was shown to be a significant allergen source ,and the shortcomings of dog dander extracts can be improved by adding dog saliva to the diagnostics of dog allergy. Paper II: We investigated the novel allergen Fel d 7 and showed that it is a frequently recognized allergen in a Swedish cat sensitized population. IgE antibodies to Fel d 7 were found in 39% of cat sensitized patientsand 89% of these were also sensitized to the major dog allergen Can f 1. Thus, cross -reactivity between these homologous lipocalin allergens was indicated. Fel d 7 was indeed shown to have a similar structure and to share B -cell epitopes with Can f 1. The biological activity of Fel d 7 was confirmed in basophil activation assays in cat all ergic patients. We conclude that Fel d 7 may contribute to the co -sensitization noted in cat and dog allergic patients. Our data will be important for aiding diagnosis of allergy to dog and cat. Paper III: We investigated the association between sensitizat ion and symptoms to cat and dog allergens in children up to 16 years of age using the BAMSE birth cohort. The data showed that sensitization to Can f 1 and Fel d 1 during childhood was associated with significant increased risks of symptoms to dog and cat, respectively, at 16 years after adjusting for other dog/cat allergen molecules. In addition, we found that IgE to Fel d 1 had similar positive predictive values (PPV) for cat allergy as cat extract did. However, IgE to Can f 1 showed a higher PPV for dog allergy than IgE to dog extract. Even though IgE to Can f 5 was more prevalent during childhood than Can f 1, it showed weaker associations to dog allergy. Thus, we showed how to intrepret sensitization to individual cat and dog allergens and use thereof in pet allergy diagnostics.27Paper IV: We aimed to establish a mouse model for cat allergen -induced asthma that resembles human disease more closely than current cat allergy models. We could show that a protocol comprising pre -sensitization with Fel d 1 /alum followed by repeated intranasal challenges with cat dander extract resulted in a model that displayed hallmarks of chronic allergic asthma. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the nature of the allergens used for sensitization and challenge in the mode l was critical for the outcome of the immune -and inflammatory response. While the commonly used model allergen OVA produced a typical Th2-type of response, we observed that i.n. administration of cat allergen extract generated a mixed response characteriz ed by neutrophilic and eosinophilic inflammation and both Th2 - and Th17-type cytokine production in the lung. The cat allergen induced asthma model will be a valuable tool for evaluating novel treatment strategies for cat allergy. In the longer run by improving ASIT regimes we hope that they will induce long lasting cure anddiminish the need of symptomatic treatment.286FUTURE PERSPECTIVES Future allergy diagnostics will be based on individual allergen molecules reflecting the natural allergen source. Thes e allergen molecules will help to increase accuracy in allergy diagnosis and prognosis. In paper 1 ,we showed that dog saliva is a significant allergen source that should be added to dog dander for improved diagnostics of dog allergy. In the future ,it would be of great interest to investigate the usefulness of dog saliva in other populations. Furthermore, whether children and adults with symptoms to dog have different IgE reactivity to dog saliva would be another valu able question to elucidate forincreasingour knowledge regarding dog saliva in diagnosis. However, there are concerns with safety and protein stability of dog saliva due to degradation of proteins. Therefore, proceeding with the allergen candidates to identify novel proven allergens would be beneficial. Then, having had confirmed one or many new dog saliva allergens that could be cloned and produced recombinantly ,would enable spiking dog dander extract with relevant recombinant dog allergens instead. The result of such an extract spiked with stable, characterized and well purified proteins would address the safety and stability issues and be able to be implemented in routine diagnostics ,and in the future also for ASIT if we can improve the extract . Cat allergy is a major problem worldwide. In paper II we show that Fel d 7 is an important cat allergen in a Swedish cat sensitized population. It would be of great interest to investigate its importance for asthma due to cat among children ,which is an important pediatric problem. As Fel d 7 shar es epitopes with the lipocalin Can f 1 it would be valuable to elucidate its role in cross-reactivity with lipocalins from other furry animals. Other lipocalins that are similar to Fel d 7 is one in Panda with 68% identity and horse and pig VEGP with62%and 58% identity, respectively [76]. Thesehaveabout as much sequence identity as Can f 1 and Fel d7 do,and could be interesting in terms of cross -reactivity.The horselipocalinismostrelevant for further studies in pet allergies. This would increase our understanding of how cross - reactivity may translate into polysensitization. Our 3D model reveals that the epitopes shared between Fel d 7 and Can f 1 are mainly exposed on the N and C terminus of the proteins. Since the antibodies to linear peptides only show linear surface antigens and cannot reach inside the structures or morecomplex conformational epitopes, where different non-linear sequences form a surface epitope, these would be interesting to explore. The 3D-model with the cross -reactive epitopes is a starting point for further studies into the allergens, and their exact st ructure should be determined by X-ray crystallography, where you also are able to visualize the interaction between conformational epitopes and antibodies. Crystalstructure and data on Fel d 7 will be important for further investigations in the structureand help in diagnostics, respectively. However, sinceFel d 1 is so dominant the interest of Fel d 7 in diagnostics would mainly be in finding cat sensitization in the few Fel d 1 negative patients and in pet cross -reactivity patients. Further studies are needed to elucidate the clinical importance of Fel d 7.29Using recombinant and natural purified allergens in molecular -based allergy diagnostics, instead of extracts, offers not only new opportunities for improving diagnostics of allergy but also fordeterminingprognosis. We show that IgE to Fel d 1 and Can f 1 in childhood are useful markers of cat and dog allergy in Swedish teenagers. Whether this holds true for birth cohorts from other countries needs to be elucidated. Such results are of major clinical importance with respect to treatment and avoidance. Our finding that some allergens, in particular Fel d 1 and Can f 1, can be used as strong prognostic risk markers for the development of allergy changes the future for doctors and ultimately patients to m ake wise decisions in pet allergen avoidance that could help protect people from developing allergies in the first place. One topic to follow up onisifinformation about earlymarkers of future pet allergy, the allergen component sensitization in childho od, can improve the outcome in avoiding allergy development. The presented mouse model for cat allergen -induced asthma exhibits hallmarks of chronic allergic asthma and will provide a relevant platform for development of new treatment strategies. As anext step,we would like to continue to test treatment regimes against cat allergy in this model. The effect of allergy vaccines may be enhanced by adding an adjuvant. One candidate Fel d 1 vaccine that we would like to evaluate is Fel d 1 produced by virulence-attenuated Listeria monocytogenes (Lm). We have prepared a Fel d 1 vaccine candidate, in which Fel d 1 is carried by an Lm vaccine vector, Lm -Fel d 1, in this way. The gene for rFel d 1 has been cloned and transformed into Lm so that rFel d 1 is produced in vivo in the host receiving intraperitoneal immunizations. This novel vaccine candidate could be evaluated both in our previously established acute model for cat allergy [118]and more carefully in the new chronic mouse model of cat allergy. The stimulation from Lm could possibly be able to break the Th2 state o f allergic disease sinceit is a strong immunomodulatory agent ,whichis complex but partly inhibits Th2 response and induces a Th1 response with IFN production. [120-123]Additionally , comparing the efficacy of Lm - Fel d 1 with the traditional ASIT adjuvant Alum, Alum -Fel d 1, could be performed side -by- side in our mouse models i. e. as in paper IV . To conclude, this thesis is based on the application of pet allergen molecules ,and spans from allergen characterization to prediction of symptoms and to the development of an allergy model for chronic airway disease. Paper I and II describe the usefuln ess of aforgotten allergen source from dog and the allergenic relationship between lipocalins from different allergen sources. Paper III shows how sensitization is linked to symptoms by analyzing multiple allergen components, implicating that diagnostics and prediction of future symptoms can be improved. Paper IV presents a new chronic mouse model of cat allergy for evaluation of new treatments. In the longer run ,improving ASIT regimes will induce long lasting cure anddiminish the need of symptomatic treatments.307POPUL\u00c4RVETENSKAPLIG svenska katt sensibiliserade hadeIgEantikroppar mot Fel d 7 och vi kunde visa att Fel d 7 \u00e4r 1 kunde vi dessutom visavilka ytstrukturer som Fel d 7 binder till i en 3D -modell som skapa des f\u00f6ljt barn fr\u00e5n till Blodprover och enk\u00e4tdata fr\u00e5n 77 9 allergisksjukdom hos m\u00e4nniskor.338ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I owe thanks to many for helping me finishing this thesis.
