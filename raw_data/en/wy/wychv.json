Catalog Home The Johnson State College Undergraduate Catalog is the official source of information about JSC undergraduate academic programs, courses, policies and procedures. It should be used as a guide in planning a course of study and meeting graduation requirements. It should not be regarded as a contract between students and Johnson State College, as JSC reserves the right to make changes in course offerings, degree requirements, charges, regulations and procedures as educational and financial considerations require. This catalog takes effect July 1, 2017, and remains in effect until superseded by a new issue. (To view the JSC Graduate Catalog, select that option from the drop-down menu at upper right.) Course offerings and requirements are continually examined and revised, and not all courses in this catalog are offered every semester. JSC publishes a Course Bulletin each semester listing the courses to be offered that semester, along with times, locations and other pertinent information. Because changes may occur after the Bulletin is published, students are advised to check \"Search for Course Sections\" on the MyJSC Portal for the most up-to-date information. The JSC catalog is published annually by the Office of the Academic Dean. The online catalog contains a number of features to assist users, including advanced search options, intuitive navigation and a personal \"Favorites\" folder where you can store favorite programs and courses. For earlier versions of either the graduate or undergraduate catalogs that are not available via the drop-down menu at upper right, contact the Office of the Registrar at 802-635-1677.

Johnson State College 337 College Hill Johnson, VT 05656-9464 802-635-2356 800-635-2356 Fax (802) 635-1230 Admissions@jsc.edu www.jsc.edu History & Mission Johnson State College: A Brief History The history of Johnson State College dates back to 1828 when John Chesamore, a village cobbler, gave his shoe shop to the village of Johnson for a much-needed elementary and secondary school. Dr. Carpenter, a Chelsea, Vermont preacher became the schoolmaster when the school was chartered in 1832 as Johnson Academy. In 1836, five communities incorporated as the Lamoille County Grammar School Association to support the school. In 1866, the State designated Johnson Academy as one of three new \"Normal Schools,\" institutions specifically for teacher training. The Johnson Normal School offered one-, two- and three-year teacher training programs until 1947 when the State approved a four-year teacher-training program, and the school became Johnson Teachers College. By an act of the 1961 Legislature, the Vermont State Colleges Board of Trustees was created to oversee the state college system. This new board assumed control on July 1, 1962, and Johnson Teachers College became Johnson State College. This new name signaled a change in the College's mission from a single-purpose teacher-training college to a multi-purpose liberal arts college. Since that time, the College's curriculum in the liberal arts and sciences, its enrollment and its facilities have expanded dramatically to meet this new mission. In recent years, the College has embarked on an ambitious plan to transform the campus to enhance teaching, learning and community gathering spaces. In 2008, a $7 million renovation of Stearns Student Center was completed. This renovation transformed the building into a true student union with community gathering spaces, a performance space, a cinema and excellent dining facilities. In 2009, the College completed a major renovation of its athletics facility with the creation of a new fitness center, spinning studio, yoga/exercise rooms and a transformed varsity gymnasium. In the summer of 2011, major renovations to Bentley Hall, home to JSC's environmental and health sciences programs, were completed, resulting in a new molecular lab, a fully renovated and expanded Earth sciences lab and a dedicated research lab for upper-level students conducting their senior-level thesis projects. And in the winter of 2012, the fully renovated Visual Arts Center was reopened, featuring rejuvenated studios classrooms, dedicated work spaces for BFA students, updated classrooms and offices, a new gallery and a Mac lab. The College has come a long way from that first class of 16 students in a converted cobbler's shop. Johnson State's modern, dozen-building campus spreads over 330 hilltop acres and serves nearly 1900 students from Vermont and around the country. The College is accredited as a multi-purpose public institution by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges and is approved as a degree-granting institution by the Vermont State Board of Education. The Johnson State College Mission Johnson State College believes in the power of a liberal arts education to transform lives. We express this belief by providing high-impact, interdisciplinary learning experiences that cross academic and experiential boundaries; by creating opportunities for students to extend their classroom learning to the field, the laboratory, the studio, the community and the local and wider world; by recognizing and supporting the diverse starting points, backgrounds and goals of students; and by sustaining high standards, active participation, vigorous debate, and mutual respect. The Mission of the Vermont State Colleges For the benefit of Vermont, the Vermont State Colleges provide affordable, high-quality, student-centered and accessible education, fully integrating professional, liberal arts and career study. This integrated education, in conjunction with applied learning experiences, assures that graduates of VSC programs will: 1. Demonstrate competence in communication, research and critical thinking. 2. Practice creative problem-solving both individually and collaboratively. 3. Be engaged, effective and responsible citizens. 4. Bring to the workplace appropriate skills and an appreciation of work quality and ethics. 5. Embrace the necessity and joy of lifelong learning. The Vermont State Colleges also offer numerous opportunities for others to engage in continuous learning to meet their specific goals. College-\u00adWide Policies VSC Policies 311 & 311A: Non-Discrimination & Prevention of Harassment and Related Unprofessional Conduct The Vermont State Colleges (VSC) and each member college, including Johnson State College, do not discriminate based on race, color, creed, ancestry, ethnicity, national origin, place of birth, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, age, veteran status, marital status, HIV status or any other status protected by law. Sexual harassment, racial harassment and harassment based on other protected categories also are forms of discrimination and are not tolerated. Further, inappropriate sexual relationships between staff and students are prohibited even if they do not rise to the level of sexual harassment. This policy of non-discrimination applies to the application processes for admissions and employment, academic and residential programs, employment practices and policies, scholarship and loan programs, and all programs and facilities, including athletics. JSC is an equal opportunity employer. Sexual misconduct, which includes sexual harassment and sexual violence is a form of sex discrimination and therefore is a violation of VSC Policy 311 as well as federal (Title IX) and state law and the JSC Code of Conduct, which can be found in the JSC Student Handbook. VSC Policy 311-A, adopted in September 2014, relates to sexual misconduct, domestic violence, dating violence, stalking and related conduct. It calls for prompt and appropriate remedial action to stop the misconduct, including student suspension, dismissal or expulsion of students; suspension or termination of employment; and referral for criminal investigation and prosecution under Vermont law. VSC Policies 311 and 311-A can be read in their entirety by selecting \"Student Affairs Policies\" in the Policies & Procedures section of the VSC website at www.vsc.edu. To initiate a formal or informal complaint of discrimination or harassment, or for further information, contact Assistant Academic Dean Jo Ann Lamore, JSC's Policy 311 coordinator, at 802-635-1243 or by email to JoAnn.Lamore@jsc.edu. For accommodations in order to apply for admission, please contact the Office of Academic Support Services at 802-635-1264; for accommodations relative to employment, please contact the Dean of Administration at 802-635-1208. Title IX Title IX is a federal law that prohibits discrimination based on gender in any educational program or activity. The law states that \"no person in the United States shall on the basis of sex be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.\" The amendment in 1987 expanded the definition of program or activity to include all the operations of an educational institution, governmental entity or private employer that receive federal funds. Sexual misconduct, including domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking, are prohibited by Title IX as well as by state law and by VSC and JSC policies. The Title IX Campus Coordinator is Associate Dean of Students Michele Whitmore, who can be reached by phone at 802-635-1200 or via e-mail at Michele.Whitmore@jsc.edu. Family Educational Rights & Privacy Act (FERPA) The Family Educational Rights & Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) affords students certain rights with respect to their educational records. The primary rights afforded to each student include but are not limited to the right to inspect and review their education records, the right to amend incorrect records and the right to limit disclosure of information from the records. In accordance with federal law and regulations issued by the Department of Education, the Vermont State Colleges System (\"VSC\") has adopted policies and procedures for each of its Colleges. The Colleges within the VSC are: Castleton University, Johnson State College, Lyndon State College, Vermont Technical College, and the Community College of Vermont. The purpose of this VSC policy is to provide guidance on the rights of inspection and the prohibitions against unauthorized dissemination of educational information. The VSC's FERPA policy is available on the MyJSC Portal under VSC Public Info and Data (see VSC Policy and Procedures / Student Affairs / Policy 312) and at the Advising and Registration Center.

Academic Departments Behavioral Sciences Faculty / Staff Susan Green, Professor, Department Co-Chair Gina Mireault, Professor, Department Co-Chair Leslie Johnson, Associate Professor Kimberly Donovan, Assistant Professor Leona Jochnowitz, Assistant Professor Daniel Weigel, Assistant Professor Vicky Sanborn, Staff Assistant Programs in the Behavioral Sciences Department explore the ways humans behave, both as individuals and as groups, and the impact of this behavior on society. Each major provides a different lens through which to view these topics. Anthropology examines cultural differences and similarities; sociology examines the relationships and interactions between humans and social structures; psychology examines individual human behavior and intelligences. The Wellness & Alternative Medicine major combines aspects of all three of these disciplines with the study of biology, chemistry, anatomy and other sciences to deliver a practical education in a variety of healing and health practies used throught the world. The Behavioral Sciences Department offers courses with the following designators: ANT (anthropology), CRJ (criminal restorative justice), CSV (community service/volunteer), PSY (psychology), SSC (social science), SOC (sociology) and WAM (wellness & alternative medicine). See full Course Descriptions. The department also offers a Master of Arts program in counseling; refer to the JSC Graduate Catalog for information. (To access the graduate catalog, chose it from the drop-down menu at upper right.)

Anthropology & Sociology (B.A.): Criminal Justice concentration This concentration in the B.A. in Anthropology & Sociology program goes beyond the study of law and crime to explore complex issues of social justice related to crime, punishment and victimization, including race, class, gender and sexuality. Students explore current trends and controversies and gain cross-cultural competencies needed to work successfully with diverse populations. A distinguishing feature of this program is its emphasis on the growing field of restorative justice, a technique that involves working with victims as well as offenders. Students graduate with a B.A. in Anthropology & Sociology with a concentration in Criminal Justice. The Anthropology & Sociology major itself develops in students an understanding of diversities and social structural arrangements among people affect the distribution of power and the ability of people to live meaningful, sustainable lives and co-exist in a fair and socially just world. (Note: Criminal Justice also is offered as a concentration in the B.A. in Political Science.) The multidisciplinary concentration in criminal justice draws on JSC's rich liberal arts tradition and commitment to high-impact education -- \"learning by doing\" -- to explore the relationships of crime, law and social justice. It also cross-cultural competency, preparing students to communicate and work with those from a wide range of backgrounds and with disparate life experiences. Supported by a network of community partner organizations, the program offers internships in the field of criminal justice, particularly in the arenas of restorative justice and victim advocacy as well as in border patrol and other areas of law enforcement. Students complete these internships in their junior or senior year along with a concurrent senior seminar. A range of disciplines are brought to bear on criminal justice, including anthropology, political science, psychology and sociology. The program prepares student for a careers in law enforcement and criminal investigation, crime analysis, juvenile justice, victim advocacy, restorative justice and community development, social justice and public policy. A criminal justice background also prepares students to pursue careers in law, from working as paralegals and legal assistants to attending law school. Learning Outcomes In addition to meeting the learning outcomes of the B.A. in Anthropology & Sociology, upon completion of the concentration in criminal justice, students should be able to: 1. Critically evaluate key theories about crime and criminal behavior. 2. Critically assess existing criminal justice systems with the aim of improving their condition and function. 3. Identify and assess alternative solutions to problems associated with existing models of crime control. 4. Develop and demonstrate sufficient self-awareness to understand the influence of personal biases and values in interacting with diverse groups. 5. Identify and analyze ways in which oppression, privilege, discrimination, and social and economic disadvantage contribute to inequalities and injustices within criminal justice systems. 6. Understand key issues and approaches in the field of criminal justice, including mental health, substance abuse, youth development, trauma-informed care, and results-based accountability. 7. Demonstrate familiarity with key skill sets in the field of criminal justice, including effective communication and conflict resolution and de-escalation. 8. Apply understandings of research methods and data collection techniques for conducting research in criminal justice. 9. Apply understandings of criminal justice policy and key controversies to field experiences.

Psychology (B.A.) Psychology Programs at JSC Students in the B.A. in Psychology program explore a wide range of theories concerning human behavior, development, thought, emotion, learning, intelligence, personality, group dynamics and abnormal behavior. Through coursework, fieldwork and research opportunities, students apply the knowledge gained in class to the real world and are encouraged to use what they learn toward understanding themselves and their relationships. Students have the opportunity to work as research assistants during the school year and in the summer. An internship is required. Elective options help students explore career possibilities, such as working with the chronically mentally ill, with children and families, and in the areas of organizational psychology, addictions, art therapy, forensic psychology and more.

Wellness & Alternative Medicine (B.S.) Launched in 2000 and updated in spring 2014 to reflect advances in medical knowledge and contemporary practice, the B.S. degree in Wellness & Alternative Medicine at JSC is based on the scientific protocols set by the National Institutes of Health's National Center for Complementary & Alternative Medicine and Bastyr University's Naturopathic Medical School program in Seattle, Wash. An interdisciplinary collaboration between JSC's Behavioral Sciences and Environmental & Health Sciences departments, the program employs societal, cultural, biochemical and global frameworks to investigate the history, principles and scientific evidence for the safety and effectiveness of diverse modalities to heal disease and to create wellness. It provides the scientific knowledge and practical skills needed to make informed healthcare decisions and lifestyle choices and to prepare for careers as state-of- the-art healthcare professionals, veterinarians and doctors. Students study conventional, allopathic medicine in the U.S. as well as alternative medical models from around the world. On-campus and EDP students may elect to co-enroll in approved certification programs to become massage therapists, yoga instructors, reiki masters and Ayurvedic consultants. (This option is not available to students enrolled in this program through JSC Online.) Graduates are prepared for initial positions in the wellness and fitness industry, hospital employee-assistance programs, social-assistance programs, the diet and supplements industry and as assistants to alternative medical practitioners. Many graduates go on to graduate and medical schools to become physicians, nurses, chiropractors, naturopathic physicians, Chinese medical doctors, ayurvedic physicians and homeopathic doctors. The curriculum for this program was reviewed in 2012 by Dr. James S. Gordon, director of the Center for Mind-Body Medicine Program at Georgetown University, former chair of the White House Commission on Complementary & Alternative Medicine and a member of the Advisory Council for the NIH National Center for Complimentary & Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), and in 2004 by Dr. Joseph Jacobs, former director of NCCAM. Their comments and suggestions have guided the curriculum that takes effect in fall 2015. Learning Outcomes for Wellness & Alternative Medicine Majors 1. Students will demonstrate interdisciplinary knowledge of the behavioral and biological evolution, principles and scientific evidence for the healing claims of conventional allopathic medicine and of diverse multicultural alternative health care systems. 2.

EDP was built on a partnership between JSC and the Community College of Vermont (CCV) and their shared mission to serve adult learners throughout Vermont. This forty-year tradition continues by providing Vermonters with the opportunity to work with advisors at their local CCV locations while they complete their bachelor's degree through distance learning (DL) courses from Johnson. In addition to working face-to-face with their advisors, EDP students also have physical access to CCV and JSC campuses in order to access support services and resources. JSC Online grew out of a desire to extend Johnson's Distance Learning Programs to students outside of Vermont. Because these students are geographically distributed, they need access to advising and other support services without coming to a campus. Subsequently, support for JSC Online students is provided through online and remote resources. Students enrolled in Distance Learning Programs are generally restricted from participating in and/or gaining access to certain college activities, events, and facilities. They are eligible for certain student services related to their program such as advising, career planning, etc., as well as ohter student support services. Support services available to distance learning students include but are not limited to: Academic advising Bookstore Disability services Financial aid Library Tutoring Activities, events, and facilities not available to distance learning students: Campus housing College transportation services including the Badger Bullet Bus and Morrisville Shuttle Participation in campus-based clubs and organizations SHAPE Fitness & Athletics Center Student Government Association Varsity Athletics Wellness Center EDP vs JSC Online The key differences between EDP and JSC Online are how students access advisors and resources, what types of courses the students can take, and the tuition model. The differences exist at the student level, not the course level. Subsequently, all Johnson DL courses are available to all EDP and JSC Online students. EDP students, however, are also eligible to take face-to-face campus courses, while JSC Online students are not. EDP students pay tuition at standard in-state and out-of-state rates based on their residency status. JSC Online students living outside of Vermont are eligible for a scholarship that reduces their tuition to an in-state tuition rate and applies only to online courses sponsored through Johnson. The scholarship/in-state rates for out-of-state students do not apply to any face-to-face Johnson courses or to courses of any type taken from other Vermont State College institutions. Refunds and Add/Drop/Withdrawal Policies Add/drop/withdrawal policies vary by institution. While students can add, drop, or withdraw from a course based on the deadlines of their home institution, the refund policy of the institution offering the course will apply. For example, if a student is taking a CCV course that has an earlier drop deadline than Johnson, the student can drop the course based on Johnson's deadlines but that may affect whether or not the student receives a refund of tuition. External Degree Program Johnson's External Degree Program (EDP) serves adult students throughout Vermont who have already completed 60 or more credits of acceptable, college-level work. Each student works closely with an advisor who has an office at the student's local Community College of Vermont site or on campus at JSC. The advisor helps the student develop and carry out a plan to earn the remainder of the credits needed for a B.A. degree. A minimum of 30 credits must be earned while in the program. Students can take courses in a variety of formats and at various locations, including: JSC courses held on Saturdays or Sundays once a month throughout Vermont, 15-week online courses, accelerated weekend and online courses in a 7-week format, courses on campus at Johnson State, and courses at other colleges. The following degree programs are available statewide through the External Degree Program. Additional programs are available to students who can attend classes on the JSC campus. B.A. in Business (accounting or management concentrations) B.A. in Childhood Education (with Elementary and Special Education endorsement) *See note below. B.A. in Interdisciplinary Studies (self-designed) B.A. in Professional Studies (self-designed) B.A. in Psychology (general psychology or pre-professional counseling concentrations) B.S. in Wellness & Alternative Medicine *All programs, except Childhood Education, are available entirely online as well as in the classroom or through a combination of online and classroom-based courses. The Childhood Education major requires courses in the student's final year that may necessitate weekly travel to the Johnson campus. For information on specific requirements, please refer to the departmental and General Education Curriculum sections of this catalog. JSC Online JSC Online allows students to complete selective majors via an entirely online format, and whether you live in Vermont or miles away from our Green Mountain state, you'll pay in-state rates! This is possible through a scholarship that effectively lowers the out-of-state tuition rate to in-state rates for online courses through Johnson. The in-state rate does not apply to any face-to-face JSC courses or to courses of any type taken from other Vermont State College institutions. JSC Online offers 15-week, semester-long online courses and 7-week, accelerated online courses. This provides flexibility for students based on when they enter the program and provides options relative to work and personal commitments. The following degree programs are available through JSC Online. B.A. in Business (accounting or management concentrations) B.A. in Childhood Education (with Elementary and Special Education endorsement) *See note below.

Our professors have the theoretical and practical background to help students become outstanding teachers and influential leaders in their field. Working as a teacher in a public school in Vermont requires a Level I Professional Educator's License with an endorsement in a specific discipline at a designated level. The license is issued by the Vermont Agency of Education to candidates who successfully complete a Teacher Education Program and are recommended by their institution. Educators' licenses issued in Vermont are accepted by more than 40 other states, districts and territories through association with the National Association of State Directors of Teacher Education & Certification. The JSC Education Department offers several Teacher Education Programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels. The undergraduate programs are: Childhood Education (B.A.), which provides licensure endorsement in both K-6 elementary education and K-8 special education. All Childhood Education majors complete a liberal arts and sciences endorsement concentration. Secondary Teacher Licensure Endorsement, which prepares graduates to teach English, mathematics, science or social studies in grades 7-12. Students must earn an accompanying bachelor's degree in their area of endorsement. Unified Arts Teacher Licensure Endorsement, which prepares graduates to teach art, dance, music, physical education or theater arts in grades PreK-12. Students must earn an accompanying bachelor's degree in their area of endorsement. Note: Acceptance into a Teacher Education Program at JSC requires a separate application. Being accepted by Johnson State College, declaring a major or beginning a program of study does NOT constitute admission or acceptance into a Teacher Education Program. Accreditation All Teacher Education Programs at JSC are accredited by the Vermont Standards Board of Professional Educators. The accreditation process assures that candidates who are recommended for licensure meet all state standards for the license and the endorsement. Theoretical Framework & Learning Pursuits Applying to a Teacher Education Program at JSC Advancing through a Teacher Education Program at JSC The Education Department offers courses with an EDU designator. See full Course Descriptions. The department also offers an M.A. in Education; refer to the JSC Graduate Catalog for information. (To access this catalog, chose it from the drop-down menu at upper right.) Majors & Concentrations Childhood Education (B.A.); with endorsement in Elementary & Special Education The B.A. in Childhood Education prepares students to become teachers licensed in both Elementary Education (K-6) and Special Education (K-8). With careful planning, a full-time student can complete the degree and earn both licensure endorsements in just four years. Graduates who successfully complete the degree become candidates for a Level I Professional Educator's License issued by the Vermont Agency of Education. This license is required in order to work as a public school teacher in Vermont; it also is recognized and accepted by more than 40 other states, districts and territories. Through courses and practicum experiences, students learn the theories, research, standards and practices that provide a solid foundation for educators who are passionate about teaching, inclusive and progressive in their practices, modern and up to date in their techniques, and committed to social equity and the delivery of education to diverse learners. Careful attention is given to the growth of children as individuals whose perceptions, interests, joys, strengths and challenges are formed within a community and through meaningful engagement with others. Students who intend to teach in grades K-6 must declare Childhood Education as their academic major and apply to JSC's Teacher Education Program in Inclusive Elementary Education after completing their first education course. Important: Declaring a major in Childhood Education is not the same as being accepted into this Teacher Education Program; see Applying to a Teacher Education Program at JSC below. Most courses must be taken in a specific order; students should check advisement forms, program evaluations and prerequisites for details. Students must earn a B- or better in all courses with an EDU designator.

Music Education (B.M.E.) The Music Education major assists students with the application for State of Vermont Certification for all specializations in Music, grades PK-12. This program guides students through the licensure procedures from the earliest levels of their collegiate education through to the completion of the student teaching internship, and includes requirements in instrumental, choral, and general music methods. The hallmark of the program is the comprehensive nature of the major supported by strong curricular sequencing of the course work. The Music Education Department of Johnson State College endeavors to create an inviting learning environment that provides a systematic, experience-based curriculum in the areas of self-reflection, curiosity, and enthusiasm in its future educators. Successful music educators exhibit personal qualities of leadership, intellectual curiosity, and social commitment. They approach life, music, and the teaching profession in a positive, creative, and enthusiastic way. Musicians are most successful as teachers if they understand current structures, systems, and practices in education. The music educator in this age of educational change and accountability must be able to express knowledge of teaching and learning through verbal communication and through overt, demonstrable high-level musical and teaching skills. Johnson State College graduates plan and implement effective, developmentally-appropriate lessons and curricula based upon sound principles of content knowledge, skill development, and pedagogy. They employ the National Standards in Music Education and use appropriate materials and strategies to develop students' critical thinking, problem solving, and performance skills, all while conveying their deep love of music. Johnson State College faculty are dedicated to preparing its candidates for careers as professional music educators and to emulate and convey the following principles: pursuing excellence in education; a commitment to diversity and cultural awareness; and excellence in musicianship, pedagogy, research and scholarship. Music educators from JSC enter the field with the skills, knowledge, confidence, and enthusiasm to successfully provide their future students with a complete and fulfilling musical experience. Learning Outcomes: Music Education majors have student learning outcomes provided in the B.A. in Music program, the Department of Education, and those provided below specific to the Music Education major. These learning outcomes are consistent with guidelines from the National Associations of Schools of Music and licensure requirements for the State of Vermont. 1.

Political Science (B.A.): Criminal Justice concentration This program goes beyond the study of law and crime to explore complex issues of social justice related to crime, punishment and victimization, including race, class, gender and sexuality. Students explore current trends and controversies and gain cross-cultural competencies needed to work successfully with diverse populations. A distinguishing feature of this program is its emphasis on the growing field of restorative justice, a technique that involves working with victims as well as offenders. Students graduate with a B.A. in Political Science with a concentration in Criminal Justice. The Political Science major itself develops in students an understanding of diversities and social structural arrangements among people affect the distribution of power and the ability of people to live meaningful, sustainable lives and co-exist in a fair and socially just world. (Note: Criminal Justice also is offered as a concentration in the B.A. in Anthropology & Sociology.) The multidisciplinary concentration in criminal justice draws on JSC's rich liberal arts tradition and commitment to high-impact education -- \"learning by doing\" -- to explore the relationships of crime, law and social justice. It also cross-cultural competency, preparing students to communicate and work with those from a wide range of backgrounds and with disparate life experiences. Supported by a network of community partner organizations, the program offers internships in the field of criminal justice, particularly in the arenas of restorative justice and victim advocacy as well as in border patrol and other areas of law enforcement. Students complete these internships in their junior or senior year along with a concurrent senior seminar. A range of disciplines are brought to bear on criminal justice, including anthropology, political science, psychology and sociology. The program prepares student for a careers in law enforcement and criminal investigation, crime analysis, juvenile justice, victim advocacy, restorative justice and community development, social justice and public policy. A criminal justice background also prepares students to pursue careers in law, from working as paralegals and legal assistants to attending law school. Learning Outcomes In addition to meeting the learning outcomes of the B.A. in Political Science, upon successful completion of the concentration in criminal justice, students should be able to: 1. Critically evaluate key theories about crime and criminal behavior. 2. Critically assess existing criminal justice systems with the aim of improving their condition and function. 3. Identify and assess alternative solutions to problems associated with existing models of crime control. 4. Develop and demonstrate sufficient self-awareness to understand the influence of personal biases and values in interacting with diverse groups. 5. Identify and analyze ways in which oppression, privilege, discrimination, and social and economic disadvantage contribute to inequalities and injustices within criminal justice systems. 6. Understand key issues and approaches in the field of criminal justice, including mental health, substance abuse, youth development, trauma-informed care, and results-based accountability. 7. Demonstrate familiarity with key skill sets in the field of criminal justice, including effective communication and conflict resolution and de-escalation. 8. Apply understandings of research methods and data collection techniques for conducting research in criminal justice. 9. Apply understandings of criminal justice policy and key controversies to field experiences.

Registration Students pursuing a bachelor's or associate's degree from Johnson State College must be formally accepted through the Admissions Office before they may be registered for courses. Continuing undergraduates are expected to pre-register for their courses in November for the following spring semester and in April for the following summer and fall semesters. Students are notified of exact dates and instructions via email one to two weeks prior to the registration period. Distance Learning (DL) students (JSC online and EDP) receive registration materials well before the start of each semester. DL students confer with their advisors who can register them for classes. When registering for courses at institutions outside of the Vermont State Colleges, DL students submit a tuition transfer form available from the DL/EDP Office. A late fee may be assessed for registrations after the published deadline. Class attendance does not in itself signify registration. Students must properly register for each of their courses in order to receive academic credit for work completed. All students must meet state immunization requirements and must be cleared by Student Financial Services (see Payment Procedures section for details) in order to register for classes. Dual-Enrollment Consortium Agreement! Students matriculated at Johnson State College (their home institution where they have been officially accepted) and enrolled in JSC courses may simultaneously enroll in courses at two or more VSC institutions. With the exception of the summer term, students follow the home institution's procedures for course selection, course add/drop/withdrawals, advising, financial aid and billing. This agreement does not supersede existing Distance Learning arrangements; these arrangements remain unchanged by this agreement. For the full Vermont State College Consortium Enrollment Agreement, see \"Board of Trustees\", \"Policies and Procedures\" and then on the VSC website, www.vsc.edu. Class Membership Students are classified for academic class membership and administrative purposes on the basis of semester credits earned according to the following schedule: Number of Credits Earned Academic Class 0-29.9 30-59.9 60-89.9 90 or more Freshman Sophomore Junior Senior Auditing Courses No credit or grades are assigned for audited courses. A per-credit tuition fee of one-half of in-state or out-of-state rates, whichever applies, is charged. Courses that are audited do not count toward a student's credit load and are not eligible for financial aid. Students wishing to audit a course should follow normal registration procedures, indicating AU as their grade option at the time of registering. The choice to audit a course must be made prior to the end of the add/drop period, and it does not apply to programs/courses with already reduced tuition rates (i.e., Extension courses). Basic Skills Recognizing that basic writing and mathematic skills are essential to successful completion of college-level work, and in accordance with the Vermont State Colleges' Basic Academic Skills policy, Johnson State College assesses the skill level of all new students in these two areas. On the basis of this assessment, students who do not possess college-level skills in either or both of these areas are directed into courses designed to address their skill deficiencies. These courses should be taken during the student's first year at Johnson State College. Please note that basic skills courses whose course number begins with a \"0\" (i.e., MAT-0410, Fundamentals of Algebra) do NOT count toward total credits required for graduation, although they do count in determining full-time status and semester grade point average. Class Attendance Students who register for a course prior to the first week of the semester or during the first day of the semester are expected to attend at least one of the first two class sessions. A faculty member may fill absent places with students wishing to enter the course and refuse entry to absent students when they appear. Faculty members may also refuse to admit a student to the class after the beginning of the semester, if they believe the student cannot complete missed work. In this case, the registered student is responsible for dropping the course from his/her schedule. For EDP weekend courses, please note that attendance is MANDATORY at all Saturday and Sunday classes. Students should not register for these weekend courses if they know before the semester begins that they cannot attend all classes. Course Add/Drop/Withdrawal Students approved for online registration may add courses online until the start of the semester and drop courses online until the end of the second week of the semester, except for the summer semester, in which case students should refer to the policies and procedures specific to that program. With the exception of summer courses, all students may add or drop a course until the end of the second week of the semester by completing a Registration Adjustment Form and submitting it to the Advising and Registration Center. Second-half semester courses may be added or dropped until the end of the second week of the second half of the semester. If a course is dropped, it will be removed from the student's academic record and may result in an adjustment to a student's bill and financial aid. Students are encouraged to contact the Student Financial Services Office before dropping a course. After the second week of the semester and until the end of the ninth week of the semester, a student may withdraw from a course by completing a Registration Adjustment Form and submitting it to the Advising and Registration Center. If a student withdraws from a course, the course will appear on the transcript with a \"W\" grade and will not affect a student's grade point average. In most cases, a withdrawal from a course does not affect a student's bill or financial aid award. Students withdrawing or dropping all courses will be considered as departing from the college and must complete the Student Exit Notification and Leave of Absence Form. Please see Johnson State College's Refund Policy within this catalog. Students registered through JSC for courses at other non-VSC institutions must drop or withdraw from courses at both colleges. Students will be charged for any tuition and fees that the other institution charges JSC. Formally Declaring a Major Campus-Based Students Students who did not declare a major at the point of admission to the college must do so after earning 45 credit hours in a bachelor's degree program, or 12 credit hours in an associate's degree program, by submitting a Change of Major/Academic Advisor Form to the Advising and Registration Center, if they have not already done so. Transfer Students: Students transferring in 45 credit hours or more for a bachelor's degree, or 12 credit hours for an associate's degree program, must declare a major within the first semester of their program by submitting a Change of Major/Academic Advisor Form to the Advising and Registration Center. A student may declare any major officially in existence at the time the student declares a major. The Program Evaluation available on Web Services outlines all graduation requirements, including the requirements in the student's major, and monitors the student's progress toward completion of these requirements. Distance Learning (DL) Students (JSC online & EDP) DL students may choose from the following majors: business (accounting or management concentrations), childhood education (with both elementary education and special education endorsement, also referred to as inclusive elementary education, may require taking some courses on campus), interdisciplinary studies (self-designed), professional studies (self-designed), psychology (general psychology or pre-professional counseling concentrations), and wellness and alternative medicine. Other JSC programs, including elementary and secondary teaching endorsement, are available if students can take courses on the JSC campus. For details on degree requirements, see the sections in this catalog on particular academic departments. Students majoring in professional studies or in interdisciplinary studies must prepare an individualized degree plan with the help of advisors during their first semester. Students in these majors may not graduate until their degree plans have received approval by the DL Academic Review Board. If a student has not submitted a degree plan by the last review meeting of the second semester in the program, the program's director may recommend administrative dismissal for one semester. Discontinued Majors The following provisions apply with regard to discontinued majors: Students who have previously formally declared a major may not at a later time switch into a major designated as discontinued. Students failing to make a formal declaration of a major by the end of their sophomore year, as is required, may not at a later time declare a discontinued major. Former students who are not on an approved Leave of Absence and have returned may not pursue a discontinued major. Grading Johnson State College employs letter grades as indicated below: Grade Explanation Grade Points A+ High competence 4.00 A High competence 4.00 A- High competence 3.70 B+ Good competence 3.30 B Good competence 3.00 B- Good competence 2.70 C+ Moderate competence 2.30 C Moderate competence 3.00 C- Moderate competence 1.70 D+ Minimum acceptable competence 1.30 D Minimum acceptable competence 1.00 D- Minimum acceptable competence 0.70 F Failing 0.00 I Incomplete (See Incompletes below) P or NP Pass/No Pass NG No grade indicates that no grade has yet been submitted. The grade will be recorded upon course completion. TR Transfer credit CR Credit granted (non-course work) W Withdrawn* AU Audit *Withdrawals are recorded by the Registrar's Office only after receipt of an authorized course withdrawal. In general, faculty grades are due at the Advising and Registration Center 48 hours after each course's final examination. Pass/No Pass Option Students may elect to be graded on a Pass/No Pass basis. The Pass/No Pass option is designed to encourage students to take courses that they otherwise would not take for fear of receiving low grades. For performance of D- work or better, a grade of P (Pass) is recorded on the student's record. Credit is received for P grades, but the grades do not affect the student's grade point average. Failing work is recorded as NP (No Pass). NP grades do not earn credit nor does the grade affect the student's grade point average. Students select this option by indicating P/NP as their grade option when they register. Courses taken with a grade of P do not count toward requirements of the General Education Core Curriculum, EDP General Education requirements, or in general, the requirements of a student's major or minor. In addition, students may NOT take Basic Skills courses as Pass/No Pass. Incompletes The grade of Incomplete (I) may be given to work of satisfactory quality when the amount of required work has not been completed because of illness or other reasons beyond the control of the student. A grade of I is not to be used instead of the grade of F in situations involving a student's lack of ability or negligence. Grades of I will automatically revert to an F if a final grade, or alternate default grade, is not submitted to the Registrar's Office prior to the Incomplete deadline submitted by the instructor. In general, grades of Incomplete are to be completed by the end of the seventh week of the semester immediately following the semester in which the Incomplete grade was given. Courses carried through with an I into the following semester do not count toward the student's credit load for tuition billing purposes or for additional credit toward graduation. Not Graded Work The grade of NG may be given for a course when an instructor has not yet assigned grades for the course. This may happen when a course is still in progress at the semester deadline for grade submission. Course work carried into a second semester with a grade of NG does not count toward a student's credit load for tuition billing purposes or for additional credit toward graduation in the second semester. Repeat Course Option Students may repeat, once, any course* that they have previously taken to attempt to earn a higher grade. When a course has been repeated within the Vermont State College system (VSC), the initial grade remains on the transcript but is taken out of the student's cumulative GPA. The most recent grade will be the only one computed in the student's cumulative average. Credit in the course may be earned only once. If the credit value of the course has changed, the repeated course is worth the new credit value. A student must petition the Registrar to repeat a course more than one time. When repeating a course at another institution outside of the VSC, the initial grade remains on the transcript but is taken out of the student's cumulative GPA. The grade from the repeated course being transferred to JSC will show as a transfer but will not be counted in the student's cumulative GPA. Students may choose to use the Pass/No Pass option when registering for a repeat course, except for courses in their major or minor, in the General Education Program, or for basic skills courses (see Pass/No Pass option). If a grade of NP is earned, however, the repeat will not count. If a course was originally taken under a prior grading system, the effect on the student's average will be determined by using the new system. *Some courses as indicated in the Course Descriptions section of the catalog may be taken multiple times for credit. Auditing a Course No credit or grades are assigned for auditing courses. For additional information, refer to the previous section on auditing courses. Credit Granted (CR) for Non-Course Work Students who are granted credit on the basis of CLEP examinations, military credit, lifetime experience portfolios, AP courses or other similar circumstances (as determined by Johnson State College) will receive a CR in the grade field. CR distinguishes the credit from TR, which is used for credits that are transferred in from another college or university. Graduation Application for Degree The responsibility for your education ultimately rests in your own hands. Likewise, the timely completion of the paperwork associated with the award of your degree is your responsibility as well. Failure to take the required steps for application for degree may delay your graduation, even if all other graduation requirements have been completed. Students should access their program evaluation (via Web Services on the Portal) regularly to see where they stand in relation to degree completion. Only students who are currently matriculated may graduate. Students absent from the College, and not on a Leave of Absence, who are seeking to complete a degree with Johnson courses must apply for readmission. A student who anticipates completion of his/her degree requirements should file a Graduation Application through Web Services. After receiving the Graduation Application, the Registrar's Office will carry out an official degree audit. This may allow time for the student to pick up additional courses or complete outstanding paperwork during his/her last semester if necessary. In completing the degree audit, the Registrar's Office will identify where the student stands in relation to completion of degree requirements. The results of the degree audit will be given to the student and to his/her advisor. Note: A Graduation Application/Application for Degree fee will be charged to the student's account upon submission of the Graduation Application. Conferring of Degrees Degrees are conferred once each year in a Commencement ceremony at the end of the spring semester. Diplomas are dated August, December or May for students completing studies in summer, fall or spring semesters respectively. Students will receive their diplomas in the mail after completion of all degree requirements is verified by the Registrar's Office. Participation in Commencement Only students who have completed all degree requirements will be allowed to participate in the Commencement ceremony. The College recognizes that there may be occasions when special circumstances arise. Under such unusual circumstances, students may petition the Provost or his/her designee to participate in Commencement. Students must, however, be within 6 course credits or a single experience (such as an internship or a Graduation Standard) of completing all graduation requirements. No other exceptions will be considered. The decision of the Provost or his/her designee is final and may not be appealed to the President. Students participating in the Commencement ceremony will be required to wear a cap and gown, which can be ordered through the College bookstore. Graduating with Distinction Effective for the graduating class of spring 2006, of the total credits required for graduation, at least 30 graded credits for a two-year degree and 60 graded credits for a four-year degree must be earned within the Vermont State Colleges by the end of the previous fall semester. (Credits earned before 2002 are not used in this calculation unless earned from Johnson State College.) Graduating students who have earned a cumulative grade point average of 3.90 or better through the fall semester of their graduation year will be awarded their degree \"summa cum laude.\" Those who earn a 3.70 average will be awarded degrees \"magna cum laude.\" Those who earn a 3.50 average will be awarded degrees \"cum laude.\" (If the above standards are obtained by the end of the spring semester of the graduating year, the appropriate distinction is recorded on the diploma and transcript but is not acknowledged at Commencement.) Graduation honors for certificate programs require final, cumulative GPA as follows: honors, 3.00-3.49; high honors, 3.50 or above. Academic Honesty Students are expected to conform to the highest standards of academic honesty in all of their academic work at Johnson State College. Academic dishonesty in any form is prohibited and unacceptable. Acts of dishonesty for which a student may be disciplined include, but are not limited to, receiving or providing unauthorized assistance on an examination and plagiarizing the work of others in writing assignments. The American Heritage Dictionary defines plagiarism in the following way: \"To steal or use (the ideas or writings of another) as one's own.\" Students are responsible for knowing what specific acts constitute plagiarism; if students are uncertain as to whether a particular act constitutes plagiarism, they should consult with their instructors before turning in assigned work. Any faculty member who suspects that a student has committed an act of academic dishonesty will bring this suspicion to the attention of the student and provide the student with an opportunity to respond. Should the faculty member subsequently determine that the student has committed an act of academic dishonesty, he/she will assign a penalty for the offense, which may be a failing grade for the specific work submitted or a failing grade for the course. The faculty member will notify the student in writing of his/her decision, as well as the penalty associated with the act of academic dishonesty, and submit a copy of that letter to the Academic Dean's Office. The student may appeal the penalty in writing to the Academic Status Committee (for campus-based students) or the Academic Review Board (for EDP students). Upon receiving any such appeal, the Academic Status Committee/EDPAcademic Review Board will consider evidence relative to the charge and determination, and will affirm, reverse or modify the finding and/or penalty of the faculty member. Decisions of the Academic Status Committee/EDP Academic Review Board may be appealed, in writing, to the Provost or his/her designee. The decision of the Provost or his/her designee is final and may not be appealed to the President of the College. Records of all incidents of academic dishonesty will be maintained in the Academic Dean's Office. Repeated incidents of academic dishonesty will subject a student to dismissal from the College. Academic Standing Good Academic Standing A student who has 30 or more earned or GPA credits, whichever is higher, and whose cumulative grade point average is 2.00 or above (1.75 for students with fewer than 30 earned or GPA credits, whichever is higher) is considered to be in good academic standing. The cumulative and semester averages are calculated by including only the graded credits (A, B, C, D, F) earned during the current and past semesters. These averages do not include courses bearing other grade designators (i.e., grades of Incomplete). Incomplete Grades in Relation to GPA/Good Standing Calculation of a semester or cumulative grade point average does not include any Incomplete grade that a student has earned during the semester. Students who receive an Incomplete grade in one or more courses during a semester are held academically liable for the completion of the course. Students who have an Incomplete grade for a semester will not be eligible for the Dean's or President's Lists until a final grade has been submitted for that Incomplete. Academic Warning A student whose cumulative average is in good standing or above but whose semester average is below good standing (see above) will receive a letter of warning from the College. There are no punitive aspects to this warning status. Academic Probation Academic probation serves as an official warning from the College that a student's performance has been substandard. A student whose cumulative GPA falls below good standing (see above) shall be placed on academic probation. Students remain on academic probation until they raise their cumulative grade point average to good standing or until they fall below the dismissal standard (see \"Academic Dismissal.\") Students on academic probation who have less than 30 earned or GPA credits, whichever is higher, must work with the academic probation counselor to create a plan for academic success. When a student voluntarily withdraws from the College while on probation status or is academically dismissed and later readmitted, he/she will return on probation. Academic Dismissal Students will be academically dismissed under the following conditions: Any new, first-year student with no previously earned credits who fails to achieve a grade point average of at least 0.70 in the first semester will be academically dismissed. Students on academic probation will be academically dismissed if they fail to achieve a semester grade point average of 2.00 having 30 or more earned or GPA credits, whichever is higher (1.75 having fewer than 30 earned or GPA credits, whichever is higher), during the semester on probation. Students academically dismissed may reapply for admission generally after two regular semesters of absence. Students must follow the regular procedure for application to the College for re-admission and will remain on probation upon their return. Appeal Process for Academic Dismissal A student who has been academically dismissed may appeal his/her academic status by writing a letter to the Academic Status Committee (for campus-based students) via the Advising and Registration Center or to the EDP Academic Review Board (for EDP students). This letter of appeal should include any mitigating or extenuating circumstances that may have contributed to the poor academic performance. Decisions of the Academic Status Committee/EDP Academic Review Board may be appealed to the Provost or his/her designee, then to the President of the College. Students who successfully appeal academic dismissal may be placed on stipulated probation and may be required to sign a contract to abide by conditions set forth by the Academic Status Committee or the Provost or his/her designee. Failure to comply with any portion of the contract/stipulations may result in immediate dismissal from Johnson State College. Academic Progress Alerts Faculty teaching 1000- and 2000-level courses complete online Academic Progress Alerts during the third week of the semester on all freshmen in those courses. The purpose of the alerts is to let students know early on how they are doing in their classes so that they can take corrective action if necessary. Using the Academic Progress Alerts, faculty give both positive and negative feedback relative to class attendance and participation, homework assignments, tests, etc. Academic Forgiveness Johnson State College recognizes that some academically able students for various reasons have poor previous academic records. A student who has been out of college for at least two academic years may appeal to the Provost or his/her designee at the end of the first semester of subsequent attendance in good standing (generally a 2.00, see Good Academic Standing policy within this catalog) at JSC to have a previous semester set aside. The decision of the Provost or his/her designee, will be final and may not be appealed to the President of the College. Setting aside a previous semester is done by notation on the permanent JSC transcript, not by removing any previous course or grade. Grades of C and above, and the credits derived from those grades, will remain. Grade history will be removed from cumulative totals only, and grades cannot be ameliorated if they have already been included in calculations for awarding a degree. Academic Honors (President's/Dean's List) Matriculated (degree-seeking) students who complete 12 or more Vermont State College graded credits in a single semester and who have no Incomplete, NP, F or blank grades are eligible for the President's and Dean's List under the following standards: Students who achieve a 4.00 semester average will be placed on the President's List. Students who achieve between a 3.50 and 3.99 semester average will be placed on the Dean's List. Honors Convocation Every spring, the College hosts Honors Convocation, an event at which the College and departments award prizes and scholarships to students who have distinguished themselves in the classroom, in the community and on the playing field. Transfer of Credit Transfer within the Vermont State Colleges System College-level credits earned with a grade of C- or better at any VSC degree-granting institution prior to summer 2002 are fully transferable to JSC. These transfer credits do not count in a student's GPA. Credits earned at any VSC degree-granting institution during and after summer 2002 are not considered transfer credit but rather institutional credit, and, therefore, grades earned are counted in a student's GPA. Each credit taken in fulfillment of a GEC requirement at another VSC institution counts toward fulfillment of GEC requirements at JSC in appropriate categories. If a student leaves one VSC institution while on academic probation and is accepted at another VSC institution, his/her academic probation status goes with him/her. Transfer of Credit from Other Institutions (See \"Transfer Credit Policy and Procedures\" at www.jsc.edu/TransferCreditPolicy.) In order to be eligible for the transfer of credits from other institutions, you must be a matriculated (degree-seeking) student at Johnson State College. Matriculated students at Johnson State who wish to take courses at other institutions and have credits transferred to Johnson State are encouraged to have a conversation with their academic advisor before registering. Transfer credits will not be accepted from non-matriculated students. Transfer credit may be granted by Johnson State College for college-level courses completed with the equivalent of a grade of C- or better at regionally accredited or officially approved institutions of higher education. Credit for a D in a course may be granted if the second semester of a two-semester, sequential course is completed with a C- or better. In addition, for transfer students holding a two-year associate's degree from an accredited institution, credits applied to that degree will be accepted as transfer credit. Credits earned in a quarter system count as two-thirds of a semester credit. The grades attached to credits accepted in transfer are not calculated in a student's cumulative grade point average. Johnson State requires that a student accumulate at least 39 credits of upper-level work in order to graduate. Transfer credits are normally accepted as lower-level credits. Students who believe that transferred credits were upper-level work should present documentation (usually in the form of a catalog from the transferring institution) to the Registrar's Office for consideration. Credits accepted for transfer are not necessarily accepted as meeting requirements in a student's major or for General Education requirements. The Registrar will evaluate credits for experiential learning and credits from unaccredited institutions to determine their applicability toward graduation requirements. Other Ways to Earn Academic Credit Assessment of Prior Learning Learning acquired through work or other non-college experiences may be assessed for college credit. Students can take one of two courses through Community College of Vermont (CCV) that guides students through the process of describing and documenting their experiential learning in a portfolio. This document is then reviewed for credit by an Advance Standing Committee composed of appropriate faculty and professionals. Approved credits, which are awarded through the Office of External Programs, are considered transfer credits, and do not count toward a student's grade point average. The Registrar, in consultation with faculty and staff of the appropriate departments, will evaluate these credits to determine their applicability toward graduation requirements. The two CCV courses that help students through the portfolio process are listed below. EDU-1225, Focused Portfolio Development (1 cr.), is the better option for students who may have more focused or limited experience and are looking to request no more than 12 credits in a single academic area. EDU-1240, Assessment of Prior Learning (3 cr.), is more suited for students who may have many years of experience in more than one field and are expecting to request more than 12 credits. EDU 1225 - Focused Portfolio Development Credits: 1 This course provides students with the opportunity to request credit for college-level learning gained by professional experience, training, or independent study. Students will explore, articulate, and document their learning by developing a focused portfolio requesting up to twelve course credits and four practicum credits in a specific academic discipline. Credit requests will be reviewed by the VSC Office of External Programs. Recommended prior learning: English Composition or equivalent writing skills, and fundamental computer skills. Students must consult an academic advisor before enrolling. Prerequisites: Students must meet basic skills policy requirements. No other course prerequisites required. *Before enrolling, students should consult the Academic Support Services Office in Dewey Hall at 802-635-1259. EDU 1240 - Assessment of Prior Learning Credits: 3 This course provides an opportunity for students to earn college credit for prior learning acquired either on the job, through independent study, or in other settings. Students explore past learning experiences and identify future educational goals. Students develop an individual portfolio describing and documenting college-level prior learning. Upon successful completion of the course, students may submit their portfolios to the VSC Office of External Programs for review of credit requests. Recommended prior learning: English Composition or equivalent writing skills, and fundamental computer skills. Students must consult an academic advisor before enrolling. Prerequisites: Students must meet basic skills policy requirements. No other course prerequisites required. *Before enrolling, students should consult the Academic Support Services Office in Dewey Hall at 802-635-1259. Credit by Examination Students attending one of the five institutions of the Vermont State Colleges, or members of the military, can sign up for one of two testing options which are offered through the Prior Learning Assessment office in Montpelier as follows: The College Level Examination Program (CLEP) offers more than 30 tests in areas such as composition, literature, history, social sciences, science, mathematics, business, and world language. Check www.clep.org (http://www.clep.org) for more information. The DSST Program (formerly DANTES Subject Standardized Tests) helps you receive college credits through more than 30 exams in college subject areas such as social sciences, mathematics, applied technology, business, physical sciences, and humanities. Check www.getcollegecredit.com (http://www.getcollegecredit.com) for more information. Testing is straightforward and reasonably priced. You pay only the testing fee per test. Tests carry three to six credits. Check the list of available tests and make your testing appointment by calling 802-828-4064. Tests are computer-based and are administered at the Prior Learning Assessment Office in Montpelier. Pre-testing practice materials are available to help you test successfully. Most test outcomes are available instantly. Note: Students who are granted credit on the basis of College Level Examination Program (\"CLEP\") examinations, military credit, lifetime experience portfolios, AP courses, or other similar circumstances (as determined by the institution where the student is matriculated) shall receive \"CR\" in the grade field. CR distinguishes the credit from TR, which is used for credits that are transferred in from another college or university. Internships Internship placements exist for matriculated students who wish to gain practical experience in a particular field. Internships are individually designed to meet the needs of students. Each student is assigned a faculty member from JSC and a site supervisor to ensure successful completion of the work experience. The eligibility requirements for participation in an internship are established by the faculty in each academic department. Internships in every major, at both upper and lower levels, are available for one through 12 credits; each credit hour represents a minimum of 40 work hours (except for HTM internships, which require 80 hours per credit). Internships are graded on a Pass/No Pass basis only. In addition to regular, per credit tuition charges, a $45 internship fee will be assessed and charged to the student's account. [Students should make arrangements for their internship and submit the completed internship application in the semester prior to the semester in which the internship begins.] Independent Study Independent studies are more academic and research-based in nature and often replace a regular course. Each student pursuing an independent study works under the direct and regular supervision of a faculty member. The goals, objectives and performance measures for independent studies are defined in a formal contract between the faculty supervisor and the student, and approved by the Provost or his/her designee. For all students, a maximum of 21 credits of independent study can be taken during pursuit of a bachelor's degree. In addition to regular per credit tuition charges, a $30/credit fee will be assessed and charged to the student's account. Students receiving veterans' educational benefits must comply with specific V.A. regulations with regard to independent study. (See Veterans' Benefits) Summer Course Offerings Johnson State College offers courses online, in the community, and on campus during the summer. See the Summer Bulletin and the JSC website for specific course information, rates and registration procedures. Tuition for summer is charged at the regular in-state rate for Vermont residents and at 150 percent of the in-state rate for all out-of-state students. National Student Exchange The National Student Exchange (NSE), coordinated out of the Advising & Registration Center, is a network of nearly 200 institutions of higher education in the United States and Canada. Through NSE, JSC students who meet eligibility requirements can spend a semester or a year at one or more of these institutions, earning credits toward their JSC degree. In addition, international exchange opportunities are available through participating institutions that open their study abroad programs to NSE exchange students. Following a semester or year exchange, students return to JSC to complete their degrees. Taking Courses as a Non-Degree Student Non-degree students are students who wish to take one or more undergraduate courses at JSC for college credit but who are not formally admitted as matriculated (degree-seeking) students. To be eligible to enroll in courses as a non-degree student, students must have a high school diploma or a GED. Students who wish to enroll as a non-degree student should request registration information from the Advising and Registration Center. Non-degree students may enroll in all courses listed in the catalog, if space is available. In most cases, non-degree students are ineligible for state, federal or college-sponsored financial aid; however, they may be eligible for the VSAC non-degree grant. (Graduate courses are generally available only to students who have completed a 4-year degree.) Extension Courses The College occasionally offers special courses to selected audiences at various locations. These courses are not listed in this catalog but are separately advertised or sponsored through agencies or other institutions. Exiting from the College A student voluntarily exiting from the College must do so formally and in writing by completing a Student Exit Notification & Leave of Absence Form. The transcripts of students exiting the College after the beginning of the semester and prior to the withdrawal deadline (week nine) will show W grades for all courses enrolled in that semester. The transcripts of students exiting the College after the ninth week will show earned grades of A-F submitted by their instructors at the end of the semester. Students who exit from the College and who are not on an approved Leave of Absence (see below) may reapply by making formal application with the Admissions Office. The W grades received will be used in making an admission decision. For refunds on room, meal plan and tuition charges, see the Refund Policy in this catalog. Leave of Absence Students in good academic standing (minimum 2.00 GPA if 30 or more earned credits; minimum 1.75 GPA if fewer than 30 earned credits) may take a leave of absence from the College for up to three consecutive semesters (including summer). Students who have not enrolled for four consecutive semesters at the College are considered inactive and must reapply for admission prior to re-enrollment. Inactive students who subsequently return to the College may be subject to the applicable catalog degree requirements of the semester of their re-enrollment. Students who do not have any earned JSC credits, or whose cumultive GPA is not in good standing, are not eligible for a leave of absence and must reapply to the College when they would like to resume their studies. Requesting a Transcript Johnson State College uses Parchment Exchange as our trusted agent for processing transcript requests as well as delivering official academic transcripts electronically. This is a \"green initiative\" that provides the fastest delivery time and enables tracking of delivery and receipt. For more information, see http://www.jsc.edu/offices-non-academic-departments/registrars-office/transcripts/. Transcripts for students with past-due bills or other obligations to any of the Vermont State Colleges will not be released until all bills are paid. Students requesting a transcript toward the end of any semester should indicate whether they want it sent immediately or whether it should be held until final grades are recorded. In the latter case, transcripts will not be sent out until at least the third week following the end of the semester. Appeal of Academic Policies Students may appeal any academic regulation or decision to the Academic Status Committee of the Faculty Assembly (for campus-based students) or the Distance Learning (DL) Academic Review Board (for EDP and JSC Online students) and then to the Provost or his/her designee. The decision of the Provost or his/her designee is final and may not be appealed to the President unless otherwise noted. ACADEMIC PROGRAMS Majors & Concentrations Anthropology & Sociology (B.A.) With integrative study in anthropology and sociology, students investigate and learn to appreciate how diversities and social-structural arrangements among people affect the distribution of power and the ability of people to live meaningful, sustainable lives and co-exist in a fair, socially just world. Anthropology explores the range of cultural and biological differences and similarities among all peoples; topics include evolution, environment, symbolism, values, art, healing, religion and consciousness. Sociology investigates social interaction, the societal forces of inequality and power, and how social structures, economics, politics, education, religion, technology and the media affect the way we behave, interact and view the world. Learning Outcomes Anthropology & Sociology graduates should be able to demonstrate: 1. Knowledge of the concepts, theories and methodologies of cultural and social forces and their impact on personal life choices, community relationships, national issues and globalization. 2. Holistic, interdisciplinary critical thinking in a way that integrates oral, written, visual, geographic, computer-based and media literacy skills, to evaluate and communicate the \"bigger picture\" of societal institutions and multi-cultural forces on our personal choices, our societal arrangements and our global involvements. 3. Cultural diversity skills that acknowledge the many beliefs, values, languages, norms, sanctions, symbols and technologies that inform lifestyles across the globe. 4. Informed knowledge of the power of social and cultural forces to bear upon both personal life choices and on civic responsibility and accountability to co-create a socially just, diverse and sustainable world. 5.

Anthropology & Sociology (B.A.): Criminal Justice concentration This concentration in the B.A. in Anthropology & Sociology program goes beyond the study of law and crime to explore complex issues of social justice related to crime, punishment and victimization, including race, class, gender and sexuality. Students explore current trends and controversies and gain cross-cultural competencies needed to work successfully with diverse populations. A distinguishing feature of this program is its emphasis on the growing field of restorative justice, a technique that involves working with victims as well as offenders. Students graduate with a B.A. in Anthropology & Sociology with a concentration in Criminal Justice. The Anthropology & Sociology major itself develops in students an understanding of diversities and social structural arrangements among people affect the distribution of power and the ability of people to live meaningful, sustainable lives and co-exist in a fair and socially just world. (Note: Criminal Justice also is offered as a concentration in the B.A. in Political Science.) The multidisciplinary concentration in criminal justice draws on JSC's rich liberal arts tradition and commitment to high-impact education -- \"learning by doing\" -- to explore the relationships of crime, law and social justice. It also cross-cultural competency, preparing students to communicate and work with those from a wide range of backgrounds and with disparate life experiences. Supported by a network of community partner organizations, the program offers internships in the field of criminal justice, particularly in the arenas of restorative justice and victim advocacy as well as in border patrol and other areas of law enforcement. Students complete these internships in their junior or senior year along with a concurrent senior seminar. A range of disciplines are brought to bear on criminal justice, including anthropology, political science, psychology and sociology. The program prepares student for a careers in law enforcement and criminal investigation, crime analysis, juvenile justice, victim advocacy, restorative justice and community development, social justice and public policy. A criminal justice background also prepares students to pursue careers in law, from working as paralegals and legal assistants to attending law school. Learning Outcomes In addition to meeting the learning outcomes of the B.A. in Anthropology & Sociology, upon completion of the concentration in criminal justice, students should be able to: 1. Critically evaluate key theories about crime and criminal behavior. 2. Critically assess existing criminal justice systems with the aim of improving their condition and function. 3. Identify and assess alternative solutions to problems associated with existing models of crime control. 4. Develop and demonstrate sufficient self-awareness to understand the influence of personal biases and values in interacting with diverse groups. 5. Identify and analyze ways in which oppression, privilege, discrimination, and social and economic disadvantage contribute to inequalities and injustices within criminal justice systems. 6. Understand key issues and approaches in the field of criminal justice, including mental health, substance abuse, youth development, trauma-informed care, and results-based accountability. 7. Demonstrate familiarity with key skill sets in the field of criminal justice, including effective communication and conflict resolution and de-escalation. 8. Apply understandings of research methods and data collection techniques for conducting research in criminal justice. 9. Apply understandings of criminal justice policy and key controversies to field experiences.

Music Education (B.M.E.) The Music Education major assists students with the application for State of Vermont Certification for all specializations in Music, grades PK-12. This program guides students through the licensure procedures from the earliest levels of their collegiate education through to the completion of the student teaching internship, and includes requirements in instrumental, choral, and general music methods. The hallmark of the program is the comprehensive nature of the major supported by strong curricular sequencing of the course work.

In these ways, the Integrative Perspectives become active tools for personal development and engagement with community and life as a whole. The four perspectives are: Aesthetic, Global, Social & Historical, and Civic.

The Creative Audience: All entering JSC students must complete two semesters of Creative Audience programming at 0.5 credits each, for a total of 1 credit.

The goals and outcomes of the GEC are designed to equip graduates with the skills to flourish in a world marked by constant innovation and global interdependence. As the mission statement for the College's GEC states, \"In order to help students enrich their lives and become fully engaged citizens of their world, the Johnson State College General Education Program strengthens the foundations of written and oral communication, mathematics and quantitative reasoning, and understanding of the scientific method. It complements the depth of the [student's chosen] major with a breadth of experiences that cross disciplinary boundaries and emphasize connections between the student and the community.\" Essential Learning Outcomes for Students: 1. Broad knowledge of human cultures and the natural and physical world, including social sciences, natural sciences, mathematics, humanities, histories and the arts; 2. Intellectual and practical skills, including effective writing, inquiry, quantitative and information literacy, and teamwork and problem solving; 3. Integrative learning, including the capacity to adapt knowledge, skills and responsibilities to new settings and questions. (Adapted from College Learning for the New Global Century, Association of American Colleges and Universities, 2007) There are two General Education programs in place at Johnson State College: General Education Curriculum for Campus-Based Students General Education Curriculum for Distance Learning Students (JSC Online and EDP) Degree Requirements Johnson State College offers students three pathways to an undergraduate degree: On campus at JSC, students can choose among dozens of bachelor degree programs, several associate degree programs, two certificates and several teacher-education programs that provide endorsement for a Vermont teaching license -- all while taking advantage of the College's many services, programs and activities. Off campus, through JSC's External Degree Program, students with at least 60 credits can complete a bachelor's degree in one of our undergraduate majors available statewide, earn their teaching endorsement, and/or complete a Certificate of Proficiency in Accounting to earn state licensure and prepare to sit for the national Certified Public Accountant (CPA) exam. Classes are offered online, on weekends at Community College of Vermont academic centers throughout Vermont, and on the JSC campus. Multiple course starts throughout the year, flexible scheduling options and EDP's maximum use of transfer credits make this program a popular option for adult learners. Nationwide and internationally, through JSC Online, students can complete a bachelor's degree in one of JSC's undergraduate degree-completion programs available entirely online. All classes are taught online, with any internship requirements arranged through the student's JSC Online advisor and completed in the student's local area. As with EDP, adult students are attracted to the program's multiple course starts, flexible scheduling options, and liberal transfer-credit policies. Requirements for a Bachelor's Degree For Campus-Based Students Completion of at least 120 credit hours of work (not including basic skills credits). Achievement of a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.00 (on a scale where A equals 4.00). Completion of the General Education Curriculum. Completion of bachelor-level Graduation Standards. Completion of all course work in the major. At least 30 credits applying toward the degree must be earned from Johnson State College. At least 39 credits must be at the 3000/4000 (upper) level. For Distance Learning (DL) Students Completion of at least 120 credit hours of work (not including basic skills credits). Achievement of a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.00 (on a scale where A equals 4.00). Submission and approval of an individualized degree plan (for Professional Studies and Interdisciplinary Studies majors only). Completion of the DL General Education Requirements. Completion of bachelor-level Graduation Standards. Completion of all course work in the major. At least 30 credits applying toward the degree must be earned from Johnson State College. At least 39 credits must be at the 3000/4000 (upper) level. Requirements for an Associate's Degree Completion of at least 60 credit hours of course work (not including basic skills credits). A minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.00 (on a scale where A equals 4.00). At least 30 of the credits applying toward the degree must be earned from Johnson State College. Students in the Associate of Arts (A.A.) in General Studies program must complete the First-Year Seminar Course, Creative Audience, all of the Foundational Skills components of the General Education Curriculum (GEC), and six credits each from the Aesthetic, Global and Social & Historical perspectives (see General Education curriculum). Students in all other associate's programs must complete the First-Year Seminar Course, Creative Audience, the Foundational Skills -Written Expression and Foundational Skills-Natural Sciences components of the GEC, one math course from the Foundational Skills-Mathematics component of the GEC, and three credits each from the Aesthetic, Global and Social & Historical perspectives (see General Education curriculum). Completion of associate-level Graduation Standards. Requirements for Earning a Second Degree A Second Bachelor's Degree Students who already hold a bachelor's degree from another institution or from Johnson State College may earn a second degree by completing the following requirements: Completion of at least an additional 30 credits through Johnson State College. Completion of the requirements of a major unique from the first bachelor's degree major. Achievement of a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.00. Note that requirements for double majors also may apply. A Second Associate's Degree Students who already hold an associate's degree from another institution or from Johnson State College may earn a second degree by completing the following requirements: Completion of at least an additional 15 credits at Johnson State College. Completion of the requirements of a major unique from the major of the first associate's degree. Achievement of a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.00. Note that requirements for double majors also may apply. Requirements for a Double Major Students wishing to earn a degree with a double major must meet the following requirements: Completion of degree requirements as listed under Requirements for a Bachelor's Degree. Completion of the requirements of two unique majors. For baccalaureate degrees, at least 30, and for associate's degree, at least 15, of the credits used to complete each major must be in courses not used to meet the requirements in the other major. Requirements for Academic Minors An academic minor consists of a minimum of 18 credits in a discipline or field, at least six of which are at the 3000/4000 level. In general, students may not use the same courses used to satisfy requirements in a major to also satisfy requirements in a minor. Any questions should be referred to the department chair of the department sponsoring the minor. (See list of Academic Programs.) Graduation Standards Johnson State College strives to ensure that all students achieve and be able to demonstrate their mastery of important skills. This commitment is consistent with the mandate of the trustees and presidents of the Vermont State Colleges (VSC), including Johnson State College, that all students must satisfy graduation standards in four areas: writing, quantitative reasoning, information literacy and oral communication. As a mandate of the Board of Trustees and the Council of Presidents, the requirement to satisfy graduation standards supersedes all other catalog statements concerning academic regulations and requirements. Successfully fulfilling graduation standards at one VSC institution is accepted as fulfilling the standards at any other VSC institution for an equivalent associate's or bachelor's degree. All students must satisfy the following graduation standards in order to graduate: Writing: All baccalaureate- and associate-level students must pass ENG 3999, the Writing Proficiency Exam, or ENG 2005 The Self-Sufficient Writer course. The Writing Proficiency Exam is offered every semester on a pass/no pass basis. Students should take the exam when they have accumulated between 15-60 credits to ensure completion of this standard. Students who fail the exam once may attempt it a second time; those who fail twice must take and pass ENG 2005 The Self-Sufficient Writer . Quantitative Reasoning: All baccalaureate- and associate-level students must pass the Quantitative Reasoning Assessment (QRA) or MAT 1080 Introduction to Quantitative Reasoning. In addition, all baccalaureate-level students must pass one course designated as \"quantitatively enriched.\" (Courses identified with a \"QE\" prefix are approved as quantitatively enriched.) Note: Unlike MAT-1080, the QRA does not count toward the \"Foundational Skills: Mathematics\" component of the General Education Curriculum. Information Literacy: All baccalaureate- and associate-level students must complete GRS 3000, the Information Literacy Tutorial (TILT) and score 80% or higher on each of the accompanying quizzes. TILT and the quizzes are available to students on the VSC Moodle site after registering for a section of GRS-3000. It is recommended that students take TILT during their first year at JSC. Oral Communication: All baccalaureate- and associate-level students must receive passing scores on the Oral Communication Grading & Evaluation Form. Baccalaureate students must complete two oral presentations, each at least five minutes long; associate-level students must complete one oral presentation. Currently enrolled students may obtain comprehensive information about JSC graduation standards by consulting \"JSC Graduation Standards,\" on the MyJSC Portal at http://MyJSC.jsc.edu. In addition, JSC occasionally may email students via their JSC email addresses about the required graduation standards and the steps required to satisfy them. "}
