For years I've seen Yogi Bhajan's melon fast and wanted to do it but never had the time. Consider getting your friends to join you. It's a lot easier when you do it in a group and have support. About The Melon Diet, Yogi Bhajan says: \"This diet is suitable to use in the hot weather of the spring and summertime. It will thoroughly cleanse the large and small intestines, which otherwise cannot be properly cleansed. The diet lasts about a month, but considering that there are 25 feet in the small intestines alone, this isn't too long.\" HERE'S HOW IT GOES - three days of eating only cantaloupe, then... - three days of only watermelon - three days of papaya, then... - three days of only water with lemon and honey, then... - one day of only water (*don't drink anything ice cold*) Then you reverse the diet as follows: - one day of only water - three days of lemon honey water - three days of papaya - three days of watermelon - three days of cantaloupe Don't freak out... there's a shortened version. Instead of three days of everything, you do one day each. Long version is 26 days; Short version is 10 days. | || | THE EFFECTS: - Cantaloupes are warming and laxative. - Watermelons will cleanse the liver and kidneys and is a cooling food. - Papayas will work on the intestines and digestion. - lemon-honey water resolves deficiencies and rids the body of excess mucus. To Break The Fast: Start with other fruit at first, then add yogurt if desired and then vegetables. Then move to a complete diet. ***Do not eat nuts and grains right away or you will suffer. WHAT YOGI BHAJAN SAYS ABOUT THE MELON DIET: \"This is a good diet for losing weight, and it replaces all the body liquids. It is a wonderful cleansing diet. It is desirable during these days to massage the body with almond or olive oil. During the time of fasting it is best to remain positive, so work also on the cleansing exercises that you know. You will find at the end of the fast that you will be a new person inside and out, and you will have a great appreciation for the body you have been given and for what you put in it.\" JOIN US?
