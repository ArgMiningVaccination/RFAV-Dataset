BRALLEY (Under the guidance of Diane K. Hartle) Abstract Muscadine skins and seeds of two varieties were analyzed for tota l phenolic content and antioxidant ability. Extracts were then screened for abilities to directly inhibit hyaluronidase activity in vitro. Hyaluronidase is an enzyme responsible for the depolymerization of hyaluronic acid, a major component of the extracellular matr ix of soft connective tissues including the synovial membrane and fluid. Its activity is implicated in in flammatory diseases such as osteoarthritis, facilitating the degradation of cartilage, and stimulating further inflammatory mediators. Similarly, a variety of sorghum bran s versus other common grain brans were tested for total phenolic content, antioxidant activity, and anti-hyaluronidase activity in vitro . In other studies, extracts of muscadine skin, seed and pomace, and Polygonum cuspidatum , an herb rich in trans -resveratrol, were screened for anti-inflammatory activity in vivo . In the phorbol myristate (TPA) inflamed mouse ear edema model, markers of both acute and chronic inflammation were measured after treatment with each test extract. Finally, muscadine skin extracts were tested for the ability to decrease inflammation in the trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) colitis model in rats. Results : Hyaluronidase activity was inhibited by both muscadine seed and skin fractions. The seed fraction was 2- 3 times more potent than skins on a wt/wt basis. Hyaluronidase activity in both corr elated directly with total phe nolics and antioxidant activity of the extracts. Sorghum bran inhibited hyaluroni dase m ore potently than other bran. Sum ac sorghum bran had the greatest inhibitory activity. Inhibition again correla ted with total phenolics and antiox idant activity in each bran. Commonly us ed wheat and rice bran had weak inhibito ry activ ities r elative to the high pheno lic containing grain sorghum bran s. In the TPA model of ear inflamm ation, extra cts of muscadine skin, seed, a nd bination tr eatm ents sign ificantly reduced ear edem a, ear biopsy weight and pol ymorphonuclear infiltration com pared to TPA vehicle control. Polygonum cuspidatum extract also inhibited both acute and chronic inflamm ation in the TP A model in a dose-de pendent m anner, and was more potent than trans- resveratrol when tested at com parable doses. In the TNBS model of colitis, m uscadine-enriched diets d ecreased neutrop hil inv asion into th e colo nic tissue, edem a and macroscop ic scores. Inflamm ation in the co lon was elim inated in rats receiv ing the muscadine enem a treatment. In these, TNBS produced no significant change s in m arkers from healthy anim als. Conclusions : Muscadine grape skin/seed, sorghum bran, and Polygonum cuspidatum extra cts hav e high to tal phenolics, high antioxidant abilities, a nd are highly anti-inflammatory in both in vitro and in vivo screening system s. These quali ties support use of these bioac tive botanicals and/or their fractions in functional cosm eceutical E.

CONCLUSIONS.................................................................................................... .....160 viii CHAP TER ONE INTRODUCTION AND LITERATURE REVIEW There is g rowing inte rest in th e pote ntial health be nefits of diets enriched with f ruit, v egetab les, and whole grains. Many studies re port an inverse association w ith intake and chronic disease developm ent including cardiovascular disease, can cers, diabetes, and other inflamm atory disease states 1-4. Steinm etz and Potter reviewed 206 hum an epide miologic studies and 22 anim al studies looking at the relationshi p between fruit and vegetable consum ption and the risk of cancer and reported a highly c onsis tent pro tectiv e effect 1. Num erous studies have reported a protective effect of fruit, ve getable and whole grain intake against card iovascular d isease 5, 6. The First National Health and Nutrition Exam ination Study (NHANES I) Epidem iologic Follow- up Study ( = 9,608) rep orted a s trong inverse relationsh ip between m ortality from cardiov ascular disease an d fruit and v egetab le consum ption when just comparing 3 servings of vegetables and fruit per day to 1 serving 2. Epidem iologic studies report that whole grain consum ption is associated with decreased risk of heart disease and cancer possibly due to a combination of dietary fiber and phytochem icals in the bran fractions 3. The overwhelm ing evidence that consum ption of fruits, vegetabl es and whole grains is health-prom oting is undisputed and these correlations have led to United States diet ary guidelines that recomm end 5- 10 fruits and vegetab les a day and replacem ent of d ecorticated grain prod ucts with wh ole grains. The research presented in this ation focuses on the health-prom oting, anti- inflamm atory benefits of a fruit, a grain, and a m edicin al herb: the rotundifo lia) have been enjoyed for centuries for their tas te and their use for wines, jam s and sauc es. The English explor er, Sir W alter Raleigh, discovered m uscadines in America in 1584 describing them as being \"on th e sand and on the green soil, on the hills as on the plain, as well as on every little shrub...also cl imbing towards the top of tall cedars...in all the world like abundance is not to be found.\" The gr ape is native to southeastern United S tates but extends north to Delaware, and west along the G ulf of Mexico to eastern Texas. Georgia is its largest com mercial producer with over 1100 acres. The grapes require a long growing season of 100 days to m ature fruit. Grown in loose cl usters of up to 40 grapes, the grapes ripen individually over an extended harv est period. The fruits are about 1-1.5 inches in diam eter, 5-15 g, and have a thick, tough skin a nd several hard, oblong seeds. The Vitis rotundifo lia species differ fro m Vitis vinifer a (table grape) in m any ways incl uding the anatomy and m orphology of the vine and fruit, the ability of latent buds to produce new shoots and roots, and the physical and chem ical characteristics of the fruit, juice and win e 7. Muscadine grapes also have an additional pair of chro mosom es compared to table grap es (2n = 40 for muscadine grapes and 2n = 38 for other grapes). Only a sm all percen tage of m uscadines are m arketed as fresh fruit, and 80 % is pro cessed for juice, wine, jellies and jam s. Bec ause of the thick, tough skins, there is a low juice yield leaving abo ut 40-50% skins, pulp and seed (po mace) as a waste bypro duct. More recen tly th e industry h as begun using the dried skin, seed s and pom ace in food supplem ents and food products as a way to increase the m arket valu e per ton harvested, expand the uses of the muscadine beyond the traditional ones, and, coincident ally, decrease the cost of waste disposal. 2 Interest in th e nutraceutical prop erties of muscadine grapes b egan because of their abundance of beneficial phytochem icals and their antioxidant capaci ty. Muscadine grapes have a high total phenolic acid content characterized m ainly by high e llagic acid com pounds, gallic acid, resveratrol are the m ost abundant phenolic s in the skins, while gallic acid, catech in, epicatech in and oligom eric proanthocy anidins (OPC's) are abundant in the seeds 10. The deep co lor of the grape skin in red, purple and black cultivars is attributed to anthocyanins that include delphinidin, cyanidin, petunidin, peonidin, and the Muscadine Grape Anti-Cancer Activ ities Yi et. al. stu died the anti cancer activities of m uscadin e grape crude ex tracts, and fractionated polyphenolics in vitro 13. Cell-prolif eration and apoptosis w ere measured after exposure of two colon cancer ce ll lines (HT-29 and Caco -2) to m uscadine grape fractions. m uscadine extract (1-7 m g/mL) inhib ited cancer cell proliferation by 50%, and the phenolic acid fractions were m ore potent with an IC 50 of 0.5 -3 mg/mL. DNA frag mentation, a marker of apoptosis, was increased 2- to 4-fold upon exposure to m uscadine grape fractions, with the anthocyanin fraction being the m ost potent. Aqueous extracts of m uscadine pom ace po ssess ed significan t anti-cancer activ ity in vitro by suppressing m utagenesis in Salmonella typhimurium cultures, stim ulated by 2- aminoantracene, a potent m utagen 14. Each extract tested had hi gh antioxidant activity and also inhibited m atrix m etalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9 activities. MMPs are involved in angiogenesis, recruitm ent of growth fact ors, and tum or growth and establishm ent 15, 16. 3 Hudson, et. al. studied the chem opreventive pr operties of muscadine grape skin extract (GSE) against four hum an prostate cancer ce ll lines 17. In each line, m uscadine GSE inhibited prostate tum or cell growth and induced significan t morphological changes in the cell. Apoptosis was induced by 24 hours. They compared GSE with resveratrol, and in each cell line, resveratrol inhibited prostate tum or cell growth, but the m echanism was different. Resveratrol, instead of inducing apoptosis, arrested the cell cycle in the G1 phase. Anti-Diabe tic Activ ities Muscadine grape seed and sk in extracts inhibited the form ation of advanced glycation end (AGE) products in vitro 18. AGE product form ation has been linked to the pathogenesis of diabetes, and can lead to an enhanced for mation of reactive oxygen sp ecies and activation of nuclear factor- B (NF-B) 19. The muscadine s eed extract wa s a m ore potent inhibitor of AGE product form ation than the skin extract, and correl ated with the total phe nolic content in each extra ct. Muscadine wine intak e by diabetics with each m eal for 28 days decreased several metabolic in dicato rs associated with diabetic con ditions inc luding lower leve ls of blood glucose, insulin, glycated hem oglobin, sodium and chloride 20. Red blood cell m embrane saturated fatty acids were decreased and m ono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids were increased by m uscadine wine intake, indicating improved membrane fluidity. Liver function m arkers were also im proved in diabetic patients consum ing m uscadine wine (150 m L/meal). Anti- inflam matory Activities Muscadine grapes have been show to be highly antioxidant as assessed by ORAC (oxygen radical absorbance capacity ) and FRAP (ferric reducing an tioxidant potential) assays 11, 12, 21. In addition to the antioxidant potentional, our laborato lamm atory effects both in vitro and in vivo 22. For exam ple, the releas e of superoxide f rom inhib ited by the addition of muscadine skin extract. Secondly, the release of the cytokines TNF- , IL-6, and IL-1 was lipopo lysaccharide-activated perip heral b lood mononuclear cells. In fed a diet of 5% powdered muscadine grape skin had 50% less paw edem a than control anim als fed a regular c how diet when injected with carrageenan in to the foot pad 22. Sorghum Grain Grain sorgh um is native to Africa an d has been eaten as a food grain since 6500 B.C.. Because of its drought-tolerant capabil ities, it was dom esticated aroun d 2000 B.C. As a source of a reliable harvest in sem i-arid regions, sorghum spread to sim ilar regions of China and India 23. To date, sorghum is the fifth in worldwide cerea l grain production behind m aize, wheat, rice, and barley with over 58,000,000 m etric tons produced 24. Sorghum was introduced to the United States in the 1700s by Benjam in Franklin. Cu rrently the US cereal sorghum production ranks third behind m aize and wheat, with 11,554,970 metric tons produced m ainly in the Southern Great Plains region 24. Although half of the sorghum grown worldwide is used for hum an consum ption, the United States prim arily uses it domestically for anim al feed and ethanol, but it exports almost half of its yearly production. Sorghum grain consum ption for hum an food has increased in recen t years due to the n eed for thos e with Celiac diseas e or gluten allerg y, to find a gluten-free flour source. Sorghum is also be ing used to produce fuel ethanol for industrial applic ation s and autom obile f uel. 5 The genus sorghum is genetically diverse with over 400 species. Som e sorghum varieties have extremely high contents of phenolic com pounds and antioxidant potential that aid in the natural defense agains t pest and diseases 25. Sorghum phenolic com pounds are m ainly located in the bran fraction and fall into three categor ies: phenolic acids, fl avonoids, and condensed phenolic acids are benzoic or ci nnam ic acid derivatives. polym ers of flavan-3-ols, usually catechin and epicatechin 30. The high levels of phytochem icals in se lect sorghum bran indicate significant nutraceutical potential. Today, th e high tannin varieties are only a sm all segm ent of the sorghum industry used as pollinators and forage. Comm ercially preferre d sorghum varieties have been developed w ith reduced tannin content m ainly because of the bitter flavor th e tann in brings to th e whole flour and bran and the fact that the ph enolics d ecrease fermentatio n rate f or the beer and ethanol industry. Biological activities of S orghum grain Cardiovascu lar Disease (CVD) Prot im plicated in CVD ri sk reduction potentially due to the p hytoste rol, polyphenolic and fiber fractions. Cholesterol-lowering effects were seen in guinea pigs fed a low-tannin sorghum grain as 58% of the diet a nd the effect was greater than that produced by wheat, rolle d oats, or pe arl m illet 31. In a dose-dependant m anner, hexane extracts of sorghum grain inhibited the enzym e 3-hydroxy-3-m ethylglutaryl CoA (H MG-CoA) reductase from rat liver m icrosom es 32. In the sam e study, rats fed whole sorg hum grain as 30% of the diet had an increased fecal bile acid secreti on and an increase in HDL choleste rol, without a change in total cholesterol, im plicating an ove rall anti-cholesterolem ic effec t. Burdette et. al. found that 6hamsters fed a high cholesterol di et had a sign ificant dec rease in pla sma total cho lesterol and plasm a triglyceride concentration when supplem ented with 20% sorghum bran 33. Aside from its cholesterol-lowering effect s, sorghum grain m ay be potentially cardio- protective by way of m aintaining red blood cell (RBC) integrity. Hem oglobin-catalyzed- oxidation of linoleic acid was inhibited in m ullet fish fed a diet of high-tannin sorghum 34. This inhibitory activity significantly improved RBC mem brane integrit y and blood-thinning ability. RBC he molysis induced by H 202 was reduced, m aintaining norm al blood fluidity. The authors attributed th ese effects to the polyph enols presen t and their resulting anti-oxi dant capabilities. Anti-Diabe tic Activ ites Sorghum bran extracts inhibited the for mation of advanced glycation end (AGE) products in vitro 35. AGE product form ation has been linked to the pathogenesis of diabetes, and can lead to an enhanced for mation of reactive oxygen species and activation of nuclear factor- B (NF-B)19. The high total phenolic, and antioxidant sorghum bran extracts were m ore potent inhibitors of AGE product form ation than the lower tannin so rghum s. Wheat, rice, and oat bran did not significantly inhibit AGE product form ation. In num erous studies, high tannin sorghum s have been reported to decrease weight gain in rats, pigs, rabbits and poultry 36-39. While this is an undesirable characteristic in m eat anim al production, it m ay be desirable in th e hum an diet to help reduce obesi ty, a risk factor for diabetes and heart dis ease. Tannins are large molecules th at have a high binding af finity for proteins and may decrease the nutritive value of the foods. The tannins m ight also bind directly to digestive ylase, trypsin, chymotrypsin, and lipase 36, 40-42. High tannin sorghum s are slowly digested, ther eby increasing the period of satiet y or fullness after a m eal. 7 Anti-Cancer Activ ities Epidem iological studies from Africa, Russia, India, China, and Iran found that sorghum consum ption consistently correlated with lower incidences of esophageal cancer wheat and corn-flour consum ption correlated with increased incidences 43, 44. Grimm er et al reported that the polyphenol-rich fractions of sorghum grain acted as antim utagens when coincubated with standard mutagens 45. In another in vitro study, sorghum tannins increased m elanogenic activ ity, a process that protects ag ainst ultraviolet irradiation damage. Anti- inflam matory Activities Little research has been done to stud y the anti -inflammatory effects of sorghum bran. Recently, our lab reported inhibition of inflammation after phorbol-m yristate acetate application to the mouse ear treated topically with sorg hum bran extrac t 46. Sorghum bran extract also inhibits TNF-, IL-6, and IL-1\u00df release from hum an mononuclear cells activated with LPS 46. Polygonum cuspidatum Polygonum cuspidatum (PC), commonly called Japanese knotweed or Mexican bam boo, is a m ember of the polyg onaceae family th at is widely dis tributed in Asia and North Am erica. In traditional Chinese m edicine, PC is called Hu Zh ang. It is us ed as an analgesic, antip yretic, diuretic, and an bronchitis, and/or hypertension 47. PCE (PC extract) is now in m any nutraceutical p roduct formulations because of its high con centration of trans -resveratrol, a polyphenolic trans-stilben e (3, 4'-5-trihydroxystilbene)48, Other resveratrol analogs in PC root mainly include side 8- O-glucopyranoside. Biological activities of P olygonum cuspidatum While m ost PC research to date h as been done on individu al chem ical constitu ents PC E extracts are widely u sed in nutraceutical and cosm eceutic al products. Biological testing of the PCE in test sy stem s has yielded som e interes ting experim ental data m ostly from in vitro screening tests. PCE is suggested to be cardiopro tective because it decreases cellu lar cho lestero l ester content in HepG2 cells by inhibiting acyl-coenzym e A-cholestero l acy ltransf erase a ctivity 53. Resveratrol and em odin com ponents isolated from PC are both protein tyrosine kinase C inhibitors 54, 55. These kinases play an important role in regu lation of cell growth and transfor mation and are effects as demonstrated by its inhibition of growth of three prostate cancer cell lines 56. PCE also possesses som e anti-viral properties by inhibi ting the production of the hepatitis B virus 57. To date, th ere h as been little in vivo testing of PCE. Phytochemicals Many phytochem icals are responsible for the health-p romoting effects of diet s rich in vegetable and fruit. T hese phytochem icals are grouped accordi ng st ructures (Figure 1.1) 58-60. 9FIGURE 1.1 Classification of dietary phytochemicals Liu, R. H. J. Nut r. 2004;134:3479S-348 5S Copyright \u00a92004 American Society for Nutrition Flavonoids Flavonoids are the m ost abundant group of plant polyphenols and provide m uch of the flavor and color of the food. There have been over 4000 struct urally unique flavonoids identified in plants sources, and they are important components of pl ant physiology. They are light-responsive, and can control the level of auxin, a horm one res ponsible for plant grow th and differentiation 61. Flavonoids act as antifungal and an tibacterial agents, and can act as anti-feedants to rum inants and other foraging animals and insect s by m aking the plants distasteful 62, 63. Pollina tion can b e affected by inhibiting or stim ulating the insects to feed 63. Flavonoids can also chelate m etals making it possible for plants to grow in contam inated so ils, as well as pro tect against o xidant insult and UV radiation 64. 10 In the norm al US diet, less than 1 g of fla vonoids is generally consum ed daily, with the highest fraction com ing from cocoa, coffee, tea, beer and wine (420 m g). The estim ated s, its and ls (catechin, epicatechin) and the distribution of flavonoids in the di et is 44 m g from cereals, 79 m g from potatoes, bulbs and root 45 m g from peanuts and nuts, 162 mg from vegeta bles and herbs and 290 mg/day from fru juice s 65. Most flavonoids enter the diet as glycosides. Of the six major classes of flavonoids (Fi gure 1.2), the botanicals in this Quercetin Quercetin (3,3',4',5, 7-pentahydroxyflavone) is one of the m ost widely distributed flavonoids and is found in highest amounts in apples, tea, oni ons, red grapes, citrus f ruits, broccoli and other leafy greens, cherries, an d a variety o f berries 66. Quercetin is the aglycone for m of ot her flavonoid glycosides such as rutin and quercitrin, but is found to be m ore biologically active. The biological activities are broad and include anti-cancer, an tiviral, anti-inflammatory, and cardioprotective properties. Quercetin was initially thought of to be m utagenic in initial in vitro assay system s 67, 68. Consequently further study was done in vivo . FA SEB reports from 17 feeding studies perform ed in rats, m ice, and ham sters supplem ented with 0.25 - 10% quercetin in the diet gave no evidence towards carcinogenicity with the exception of Ertuk et al. who f ound increased bladder tum ors in rats 69, 70. The National Cancer Inst itute screened over 200 naturally occurring flavonoids and quercetin w as reported as increasing th e lifespan of m ice with P-388 leukem ia 71. Quercetin administered as 4% of the diet prevented nuclear injury in m ice induced by an intrarectal dose of 13benzo[]pyrene possibly by binding to the DNA 72. In m ice treated with phorbol m yristate (TPA), a tumor prom oter, initiation and prom otion of skin carcinogenesis was blocked with quercetin topical adm inistration 73. Mamm tumor induction by the carcinogens dimethylbynzanthracene or N-nitrosom ethyl urea was reduced by dietary quercetin with no toxicity or w eight loss seen in the anim als over a 20-week period 74. Num erous antiviral activ ities of quercetin have been report ed in such enveloped viruses such as herpes sim plex 1, respiratory synctial, pseudo rabies, parainflue nza type 3 and Sindibis 75, 76. Quercetin has been found to be able to bind to viral protein and inte rfere with viral nucleic acid synthesis 77. Antiviral activity of interferon a nd 5-ethyl-2-deoxyuridine was enhanced by quercetin 78. As an anti-inflammatory quercetin was found to inhibit lipoxygenase (LOX) and cyclooxygen ase (COX) enzym es resulting in subs equent inh ibition of inflammatory m ediato r formation such as prosta glandins and leukotrienes 79. Quercetin was also found to be a phospholipase A 2 inhibitor in hum an leukocytes thereby reducing arachidonic ac id, the substrate for LOX and COX, release from cellular m embranes 80. The phorbol m yristate-induced respiratory burst was reduced in neutrophils expo sed to quercetin with a decreased production of superoxide anion and H 2O2 81, 82. Nuclear Facto r-B (NF- B) activation was inhibited in a dose- dependent anner by quercetin in rat IL-1 The cardioprotective of quercetin can b e ted m ainly to latelet idant ability the oxidation of LDL 85, and its anti-inflam matory ability. 14Myricetin FIGURE 1.4 Structure of Myricetin Myricetin is one of the more abundant flavonoids found in the mu scadine grape. It is a potent antioxidant 86. In hum an lymphocytes, m yricetin decreased oxidant-induced DNA strand damage 87. Myricetin w as found to be neuroprotectiv e, acting as an antioxidant and reducing calcium -induced increas e in oxidativ e metabolism of rat brain neurons 88. In endothelial cells activ ated with TNF- , myricetin suppressed the ar transcription factor, NF- B, by inhibiting the kinase responsible fo r cleaving the inhibitory protein, I B 89. Myricetin was found to possess anti-diabetic properties by mimicking insulin. It can also stimulate lipogenesis and glucose transport in rat adipocytes 90. This would facilitate gluc ose uptak e in the absence of a fully functio nal insu lin recepto r. 15Catechin/Ep icatechin FIGURE chem ical c onstitu ents in teas and win es and have been studied extensively for their health-promoting capabilities. Crespy and William son summarize numerous studies reporting the an ti-cancer effect of catechins in in vivo models 91. Catechins were found to be cancer-protectiv e in organ system s including inte stine, lung, liver, prostate, and breast. The cardiop rotective p roperties of th e catec hins are associated with their antioxidant ability. However, catechins have also been shown to increase the activity of superoxide dism utase, decrease platelet a ggregation, and decrease absorption of triglycerides and cholesterol in vivo 92, 93. Catechin supplem entation can decrease total cholesterol and plasm a triglycerides, althoug h there are som e discre pancies am ong studies. Catechin can lower LDL cholesterol and increase HDL cholesterol in apo lipoprotein-E deficient mice94. Catechins m ay be useful in treatm ent and prev ention of type 2 diabet es.

In norm al rats, green tea catech ins decreas ed plasma insulin and trig lyceride leve ls after Phenolics Oligomeric proanthocyanidins Oligom eric proanthocyanidins (O PCs) are high molecular w eight polymers of basic flavanol units, often catechin and epicatechin, with an average polym erization between 4 and 11. Synonym s for OPCs include condensed tannin s, procyanidins, leuc oanthocyanins, and pycnogenols. In plants, they serve as an im porta nt protection against pred ators because of their astringent flavor. It is that sam e flavor that is enjoyed in wines, juices, and teas. OPCs are not readily digested in the sm all in testine, however the sm all amount that is absorbed into the bloodstream has been shown to significantly enhance plasm a antioxidant capacity 99. The biological activities of OPCs are broad a nd include antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticarcinogenic, and antiviral. A large percentage ontinue, undigested, to the large intes tine. OPCs can inhibit lipid per oxidation, DNA fragmentation, and subsequent apoptosis in hepatic and brain tissue of mice 100. Cardioprotective activities of OPCs i nclude a vitam in E- sparing effect, stim ulation of endothelium -depende nt relaxing activity, iron and copper chelators to reduce the oxidative dam age to the m yocardi um, and OPCs can decrease incidence of foa m cells 101-103. OPCs from grape seeds have been shown to inhibit peroxide for mation by macrophages in vitro 104. In anim al studies, OPCs can inhibit the form ation of IL -1\u00df, vitro studies found OPCs ar e cytotoxic to a variety of cancer ce ll lines while r emaining non -toxic to no rmal hum an cell lin es 106. OPCs inhibit tum or prom otion and for mation in the phorbol m yristate indu ced skin tum or model 107. In one hum an clinical trial, oral administration of OPCs decreased dam age from excessive exposure to ultravio let rays 108. HIV infection was shown to be inhibited by OPCs in vitro , by preventing 17binding of the HIV virus to cell receptor sites on norm al white blood cells preventing infection 109. Resveratro l FIGURE 1.6 Structure of Resveratrol Resveratrol belongs to a class of pol yphenols called stilbenes. In pl ants, resveratrol is useful as a response to stress, injury, fungal infection, and ultraviolet radiat ion. It is found m ost commonly in grapes, red wine, purple grape ju ice, peanuts, som e berries, and Polygonum cuspidatum. The study of the potential health benef its of resveratrol has gained in terest after speculation that it may be responsible for \"The French Paradox\". In France, the observation was m ade that mortalitity from coronary heart disease is low de spite rela tively high leve ls of dietary saturated fat and cigarette sm oking. Regular consum ption of red wine m ight provide protection from cardiov ascular disease. Trans- resveratro l and its de rivatives have been studied extens ively f or their hea lth prom oting qualities, including its anti-inflamm atory activity. Resverat rol and analogues of resver ll inh ibit hu man TNF-, and LPS-induced activation of NF- B 110, 111. Resveratrol can inhibit prostaglandin E 2 release f rom hum an peripheral blood leukocytes 112. In a model of early colonic ated plasm a levels of prostaglandin D 2 and decreased the expression of COX-2 113. Resveratrol also inh ibits the TPA- 18induced dorsal inflammatory NF- B and activator protein-1 (AP-1) m odulation 114, 115. Ellagic Acid FIGURE 1.7 Structure of Ellagic Acid Ellagic acid is found in the bl ackberry, raspberry, walnuts, pecans, green tea, bayberry, egranate and m uscadin es. The m uscadine is unique am ongst other grape species in that it has a sign ificant am ount of ellagi c acid. It can occur in its free for m, as glycosides or as ellagitannins. Ellagic acid possesses an ticarcinog enic activities and has been shown in vitro to induce cell cycle arrest and apo ptosis in a variety of can cer cell lines 116-119. Lung and esophageal tum or prom otion and for mation in rats was inhibited by ellagic acid 120. A United States patent was subm itted re lating the us e of ellagic acid to the treatm ent of intestinal d isorders su ch as constipation, heartburn, non ulcer dy spepsia, GE RD, and/or esophagitis 121. Summary of Phytochemical Biological Activities Evidence of the health benefits of a diet enriched with fruits, vegetables and whole grains is large, and is due, in m ain part to its phyt ochem ical constituents. The flow chart below summarizes the health-prom oting effect s of phytochem icals in the diet. 19FIGURE 1.8 Possible mechanisms of action of dietary ph ytochemicals Nijveldt RJ , Flavonoids: a r eview of pr obably mechanis ms of action and potential applications. American Jo urnal of Clinical N utrition 2001; 74: 418-423. Inflammation and Arachidonic Acid Metabolism Chronic system ic infla mmation is a com ponent of m any age-related diseases such as Alzheim er's, arthr itis, as thma, colitis , cancer, d art disease, ob s troke a nd psoriasis 122, 123. Pro-inflammatory cause or contribute to the pathog enesis of thes e age-related diseas es. Other inflammatory mediato rs such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes produced from the m etabolism of arachidonic acid (A A) via cyclooxygenase (COX) (LOX) tes that release hist amine and bradykinins 124. 20 AA is a 20-carbon fatty acid that is a major com ponent of cellular m embrane phospholipids. Inflammatory m ediators stim ulate a variety of G-protein- coupled receptors, and consequent signal transduction causes calcium mobilization a nd activates phospholipases. The phospholipases free AA from membrane phospholipids allowing the AA to be m etabolized by either the C OX pathway, or the LOX pathway (Figure 1.9). FIGURE 1.9 Arachidonic acid metabolism Sigal E : The molecular biology on mammalian ar achidonic acid metabolism . American Journal of P hysiology, Lung Cellular an d Molecular Physiology 1991; 260: 13- 28.

They al so potentia te the v ascular perm eability chang bradykinin venules, enha nce m ucus s ecretion, an d can act as eosinophil chem oattractants 125. Polyphenols have been reported in num erous studies to inhibit phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2), COX and 5- LOX. In hum an and rat leukocytes, quercetin w as found to inhibit PLA 2 80 . Inhibition of COX and LOX enzym es by polyphenol s can occur either directly, or at the transc riptional level via (NF-B) is a nuclear transcrip tion facto r that is s equestered in the cytosol by its inhibitory protein, I B. A variety of substances includi ng bacterial toxins, free esters timulate the activation of I B kinases that phosphorylate I B (Figure 1.10). Phosphorylation of I B causes its degradation, and the p50 and p65 subunits of NF- B are able to tra nsloca te into the nucle us where the in duce transcription of a broad range of genes. NF- B activation induces the expression of over 200 genes that range in function from suppression of apoptosis, inductio n of cellular transfor mation, proliferation, invasion, m etastasis, and inflamm ation. Its activation has been li nked to a num ber of diseases including cancer, atherosclerosis, m yocardial in farction, diabetes, asthm a, arthritis, and other inflamm atory diseases 131. Many phytochem icals have been shown inhibit NF- B curcum 128, 132- 22134. Activation of NF- B and its subsequent transcription of a variety of inflammatory cytokines is hallm ark in inflamm atory diseases such as osteoarthritis. FIGURE 1.10 NF- kB_activation.jpg Hyaluronid ase and Osteoarthritis In the norm al join t, cartilage is a dyn amic tissue that m aintain s a delicate balance b etween synthesis and degradation, and is in a constant state of flux (F igure 1.11). Chondrocytes are the main regulatory cells, and are under the influe nce of circulating r eactive oxygen species, prostag landins, and cyto kines. In pathogenic co nditions such as osteoarthr itis (OA), this balance is disrupted leading to cartil age degradation and subsequent loss of joint function due to a dram atic inc rease in inf lammatory mediato rs, oxi and en zymes such as hyaluronidase. 23FIGURE 1.11 Hom eostasis Hyaluronan acid, HA), is a sim ple, linear glycosam inoglycan (GAG) that is found in almost all vertebrate organs, with th e largest proportion found in the extracellular matrix of soft connective ti ssues including the synovial m embrane and the synovial fluid135. It is composed of repeating d isacch aride units of D-glucuronic acid and N-acetyl-D-gluco samine, whose m olecular s ize can reach 107 kDa.

High m olecular weight (HM W) HA is re sponsible for tissue hydration, lubrication, structural integrity, free ra dical sequestration, and distri bution of plasm a proteins135, 137. It form s the backbone of cartilage to which large proteogl ycan aggregates such as aggrecan attach and interact with collag en to aid in inte rnal osm otic swelling p ressure tha t maintains the load-bea ring capacity of the join t tissu e138. HA is synthesized in m any cells including fibroblasts, endothelial cells and keratinocytes inte gral protein, and is extruded into the extracellular space139-141. Low molecular w eight (LMW) HA is typically fragm ents of HM W HA generate d under conditions of inflamma tion, tumorigenesis, or tissue injury as a result of activity142 or oxidation143. Hyaluronidase (EC 3.2.1.35) is HA, and creates LMW HA fragm ents. It is found in m ammalian organs a nd body liquid s, leech heads, invasiv e bacteria, and venom s of bees, snakes, and scorpions144. It is im portant in degr ading tissue and a cts as a 'spreading factor' by accelerating venom absor ption and diffusion into the tissues145. In the 25human genom e, there are six genes encoding for hyaluronidase146. The gene products have widely dispersed biological functio ns that are still under consider able debate. Hyal-1, Hyal-2 and Hyal-3 are expressed in synovocytes and ch ondrocytes and play an important role in cartilage developm ent and destruction147. In the presence of IL-1 and TNF- , Hyal-2 and Hyal-3 are both up-regulated, and are correlated with a decrease in HA concentration 147, 148. In OA patien ts, a p ositive correlation was found betwee n hyaluron idase activity and severity of the pro tein concen tration and p latelet coun t in the synov ial fluid 149. In a study reported by O hno-Nakahara et. al., L MW HA fragm ents produced from hyaluronidase treatm ent of cultured chondrocyt es up regulated gene expression of the CD44 recep tor, a cell su rface recepto r for HA, and al so m atrix m etallop roteinases (MMPs connective tissue m atrices150. CD44 is linked to regulation o f a variety o f biological events inclu ding cell ad hesion and trafficking, surface expression of other adhesion m olecules, leukoc yte activation, production been sh own to up-regulate the ex pression of the CD44 receptor as we ll 151, 152. Therefore, it is indicated that LMW HA fragm ents resulting from hyaluronidase activity can play an im portant role in cartilage des truction in pa thological join ts by accelerat ing the v icious circle of CD44 expression. Various individual flavonoids inhibit hyaluro activity have been shown to have anti-hyaluronidase activity as we ll as an ti-collagenase and som e anti-elastase activ ity 157. 26Ulcerative atory Bowel Diseas e (IBD) that is the cause of illness for 1 - 2 million A mericans. It is char acterized by the ulceration of the innerm ost lin ing of the colonic mucosa, usually in the rectum and sigmoid colon anifes ts as peri-anal irritations, fissures, hemorrhoids, fistulas, ulcers and abscesses. Th e origin of UC is unknown, but dietary, genetic, environm ental, and immunological f actors are all suggested causes 158. Regardless of the lack of understanding of its etiology, there are m any pathol ogic features seen in the progression of the disease. A mong these include genetic predispos ition, increase in inflammatory m ediators, increased oxidative stress, im balance in gut m icroflora, abnorm al glycosam inoglycan content of the m ucosa, and decreased oxidation of short chain fatty acids 158. Prim ary lesions in UC begin with neutrophi l invasion in areas of inflammation (Figure 1.13). Because the m ucous layer is thinnest in th e rectum and sigm oid colon, the disease is m ost pronounced in these areas. Tissue dam age develops into sm all erosions and eventually ulcers caused by inflammatory cytokines released fr om leukocytes, m acrophages and neutrophils. Further dam age leads to abscess form ation in crypts, necrosis, and ragged ulceration of the mucosal lay er. 27FIGURE 1.13 Pathology of Ulcerative Colitis Disregulation of i mmune func tion is thought to be a m ajor contributing factor in the progression of UC 159. In the norm al gut, the gastrointestin al tract acts as a barrier to foreign antigens from food and intestinal bacteria and their byproducts. The \"controlled inflammation\" that occurs is necessary to m aintain mucosal homeostasis and eradicate the pathogens. Once the harmful antigen is gone, the local im mune response m ust be attenuated, and this is done by either CD4+/CD25+ cells produced by the thym us, or by apoptosis of T lym phocytes, the m ajor cell- mediated immune response cells 160, 161. In a diseased colon, th is attenuation of the immune response is absent, and a vicious cycle of inflamm ation occurs.

TNF- amplifies the inflamm atory response by auto-regulating its transcription and increasing IL-1\u00df and IL-6 m ainly via activation of the nuclear-factor kappa B (NF- B) pathway. TNF- also increases the expression of adhesion molecules, and proliferation of fibroblasts 163, 164. The exogenous antigens also directly stim ulate production of cytokines such as IL-1, IL- 6, and TNF- from the intestinal epithelium 165. These cytokines also amplify the immune response by enhancing the prolif eration of T stage in the inflamm atory process 166. Neutrophils reduce m olecular oxygen to the superoxide anion radical. Through the enzym e myeloperoxidase (MPO), the potent cy totoxic oxidant, hypochlorous acid, is form ed from hydrogen peroxide and chloride ions 167. Cytokines also play a direc t role in the inflamm atory response by rapidly 168-171. and necrosis are induced by reactive oxyg en species by peroxidation of m embrane lipids, protein denaturation, and DNA d amage. Current drug treatm ent includes corticostero ids and immunomodulator s. Corticosteroids bind to th e cytosolic glu cocorticoid recepto rs and inhibit the arachidon ic acid cas cade, thus inhibiting activation of certain tr anscription facto rs such as IL -1, -6, and interferon-gamma. The therapy is designed for short-term , but if used chronically, side effects co uld include cataracts, osteoporosis, m yopathy, and conditions associat ed with imm une suppression and adrenal insufficiency. Immunomodulator y drugs m ainly inhibit TNF- activation thus inhibiting the T- 29lymphocyte activity decreasing th e cell-m ediated immune response. Patients see a faster recovery rate than with corticosteroids and a longer rem ission, but the chance for serious side effects is increased. Immunom odulators prom ote activation of latent infections such as tuberculosis, and increase the vulnerability to active infection s. There is a decreased immune vigilance, w hich can increase early tum or formation. Other side effects include dem yelination and other neurological dam age, aplastic anem ia, intestinal perforations , and congestive heart failure. Phytochem icals have been shown to modul ate many m etabolic pathways and signaling pathways th at alter immune gene ex pression, m ainly by inh ibiting NF-B. These m odulato ry effects m ay be especially im portant in the ga strointes tinal tract becau se it is a focus of immunological defense and it is exposed to the highest concentrations of phytochem icals found anywhere in the body. T he study of phytochem icals as a treatm ent for UC is not novel and is warranted due to the harsh side effects of curre nt drug treatm ent.

Resveratro l, another phy tochem ical in the m uscadine gr ape, has been shown to inhibit TNF- activation of NF-B in vitro and is protective against TNBS-induced co litis due to im pairm ent of neutrophil function, decrease in NF- B activation, and stim ulation of apoptosis in colonic cells 173, 174. 30HYP OTHE SES TESTE D In Chapter Tw o the following hypothesis was tested: Muscadine s kin and seed fractions wi ll anti-hya luronid ase ac tivity in vitro .

Up regulation of hyaluronidase activity occurs in chronic inflamm atory conditions, e.g., inflamm atory join t disease. P rior work demonstrated that muscadine s kin extracts possess s ignificant in vitro and in vivo anti-inf lammatory activities. In this study, we tested the ability of muscadine sk in and seed extracts to inhibit hyaluronidase activ ity in vitro . Ethano l extra cts (1:9 wt/vol 50% ethanol) were prepared f rom dried skins and seeds of Early Fry (bronze) and Ison (purple ) muscadine v arietie s. Each extra ct inhibited hyaluronidase activity. Seed extracts were 2-3 times more potent per unit weight than skin extra cts. Th e IC 50s of the Ison seed, Early Fry seed, Is on skin, and Early Fry skin were 0.3, 0.6, 1.0, and 1.0 mg/ mL, respectively. Hyaluronidase inhibition correlated po sitively with total phenolic and FRAP (fer ric reducing antioxidant power) values, but not with anthocyanin content. In addition to anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, the results of this study show that polyphenolics in m uscadine grapes inhibit hyalur onidase. T hese three bioactivities are important f or g healthy co nnectiv e tiss ue rmine whether p lant cons tituents can modulate the of extrace llular m atrix during aging, infl ammation, and joint Balanced metabolism of the m atrix glycosam inoglycan, hyaluronan or hyaluronate (H A), is particularly vital. HA contains repeating un its of D-glucuronic acid and N-acety l-D-glucosam ine and is synthesized by sy nthase in fibroblasts, endothelia l cells and keratinocytes. It is degraded by several enzym es in the hyaluronidase fam ily (EC 3.2.1.35) 5-8. HA polym ers nstitu the extracellular m atrix of connectiv e tissu es including cartilage and the synovial m embrane and synovial fluid of joints 9. HA has several im portant structural and biol ogical functions that depend on its size, which can reach 107 kDa 10. High molecular weight HA is responsible for tissue hydration, lubrication, structural integrity, free radical sequestration, an d distribution of plasm a proteins 9, 11. Low m olecular weight HA fragments are generated by hyal uronidase activ ity 12. These smaller fragm ents act signaling molecules that intens ify proces suppressing proteoglycan sulfation 13, 14. In connective tissue, rate s of HA synt hesis and degradation vary over tim e. An imbalance caused by increased degradation or de creas ed synthesis is seen in inflamm atory situa tions su ch as osteo arthritis 15. Imbalances can be attributed to increased oxidative stress, increased form ation of inflammatory m ediator s, decreased production of HA, and increased degradation of HA 16. Increased hyaluronidase activity c ontributes to degenerative changes in 55connective tissues. The cells, enzym es and si gnaling pathways involved in these changes m ay be therapeutic targets for dietary, pharm aceutical and nutraceutical m (Vitaceae) is a unique p lant of the southeastern United States that is tolerant to heat, hum idity and various pests. Relatively few bioactivities of the m uscadine have been repo rted. However, we observed that m uscadine extra cts hav e anti-inf lammatory ef fects bo th in vitro and in vivo 17. For exam ple, the release of superoxide f rom phorbol m yristate acetate-activ ated inhib ited by the addition of muscadine s kin extract. The release of the cytokines TNF- , IL-6, and IL -1 skin extract in lipopolysaccharide-acti vated peripheral blood m ononuclear cells. In addition, rats fed a diet of 5% m uscadine grap e skin showed 50% less paw ede ma than control anim als fed a regular ch ow diet when inje cted w ith carrageenan into the foot pad 17. Extracts of muscadine s eeds and skins also inh ibit top m yristate acetate 18. The anti-inflammatory properties of muscad ine g rapes lead o ne to ask wh ether the flavonoids that are concentrated in the grape sk in and seeds m ight affect other inflamm atory processes. These parts of the grape are discarded during processi ng to make juices and wines, and it would be useful to identify activities that could add value to thes e by-products. Individual phytophenolics of several classes have been s hown to have effects on enzym es regulating extra cellula r matrix m etabolism inclu ding hyalu ronidase 19-22. In this work, we tested whether extra cts of muscadine s kins and see ds inhibit hyaluron idase 56Materials Methods Materia ls Muscadine Products Corporati on at Paulk Vineyards (W ray, GA) donated Ison and E arly Fry muscadine grapes obtained at norm al harvest Type I-S hyaluronidase from bovine testis , re purchased from Sigm a-Aldr ich (S t. Louis, MO). Preparation of Muscadine Seed and Skin Extracts Skins and seeds from Ison and Early Fry m uscadine grapes w ere separated from the pulp. Skins and seeds were dried at 120\u00b0C in a Napco vacuum oven. The dried skins and seeds were ground in a coffee/spice m ill for 60 sec. Phytoch emicals were extracted f rom the dried powders by adding one gram of powder to 9 mL of 50% ethanol and stirring for one hour at room temperature. The m ixtures were centrifuged ( 1500 rpm for 10 m in) and the supernatants were used in this study. Hyaluronidase Assay Hyaluronidase determ ined hyaluronan and onium brom 23. a stable absorbance that is proporti onal to the am ount of undigested hyaluronan remaining in solution as m easured by the absorb ance at 400 nm. Inhibition of hyaluronidase by plant extracts is indicated by a slower loss of absorbance co mpared to h yaluron idase alone. The initial ethanolic extracts were diluted with acetate buffer (0.2 M sodium -acetate- acetic acid, pH 6.0, containing 0.15 M NaCl) to yield 1 :100 extracts (d ry wt/volum e of diluent). Stock solutions of HA ( 0.5 m g/mL) and hyaluronidase (1 m g/mL) were m ade fresh in the acetate 57buffer. The assay m ixture contained acet ate buffer, acid, \u00b5g hyaluronidase, and 0-70 \u00b5L of diluted m uscadine seed or skin extracts in a final volume of 0.5 mL. The m ixtures were incubate d at 37\u00b0 C for 15 m in, and the reactions were stopped with the addition of 2 m L 2.5% CTAB in 2% NaOH (pH 12). All assays were perfor med in duplicate. After 10 m in, the optical density of each sa mple was read at 400 nm (Beckm an DU 650 Spectropho tometer) ag ainst a blank contain ing 0. 5 mL acetate buffer and 2 m L CTAB. The concentration of HA without ex tract gave an absorbance of 0.8-1.2 units in the undigested reaction m ixtures, and this d ecreased to the presen ce of 30 \u00b5g Polyphenolic pounds in the diluted extracts abso rbed a sm all amount of light at 400 nm . The results have been corrected for this absorbance. Ethanol did not affect hyaluron idase activ ity at the dilutions used here. Measureme nt of Total Phenolic Ac id Total pheno lic acid content of each extract was measured by the m ethod of Slinkard and Singleton 24 with m inor modification s. Triplicate sam ples (20 \u00b5l) of each extract and each gallic acid standard were added to 1.58 mL of distille d water in a 3 m L, 10 mm polystyrene cuvette. 100 \u00b5l of 2 N Folin-Ciocalteu reagent was added and the sample was m ixed well. Within 10 min, 300 \u00b5L of saturated sodium carbonate solution (200 g Na 2CO 3 in 1 L distilled w ater) was added and mixed. Sam ples were incubated for 2 h at room temperatu re. A bsorbance w as measured at 765 nm on a Beckm an DU 650 Spectr ophotom eter. A phenolic standard curve was constructed using gallic acid (0-500 mg/L). Phenolic acid c oncentrations were expressed as gallic acid equivalents per gram of dried seed or skin powder. Measurement of FRAP (Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power) 58The was on its ab ility to reduce ferric tripy ridyl-s-triaz ine com plex to its f errous form as described by Benzie and Strain 25. In a 3 m L, 10 mm polystyrene cuvette 10 \u00b5L of each sam ple or ferrous s ulfate standard, 30 \u00b5l of distilled water and 300 \u00b5l of FRAP reagen t were added. FRAP reagent was maintained at 37\u00baC and m ade by m ixing 25 m L acetate buffer (300 m M, pH 3 .6), 2.5 m L TPTZ solution (10 m M 2,4,6-tri[2- pyridyl]-s-triazine dissolved in 40mM HCl), and 2.5 m L of 20 m M ferric chloride solution. The solution s were incub ated for six m in, and then 0.34 m L of di stilled water was added to each cuvette. The absorbance of the sample was re ad imm at 593 nm . FRAP values were calcu curve of ferrous su lfate (0-1 mm ol/L) and the s eed and skin extra ct antioxidant power was expressed as mmol ferrous sulfate equ ivalents/100 g dry weight of fruit fraction. Measurement of Anthocyanin Concentration The m ethod is based on the pH-dependent change in absorbance of cyanidin-3-glucoside, a major anthocyanin of muscadine grapes. At pH 1.0, anthocyanins exist in the highly colored flavilium form. Therefore, m uscadine extracts w ere diluted in a potass ium solution, pH 1 (62.5 mL 12 N hydrochloric acid, 3.7 g potassium chlo ride in 1 L of water). Samples were m ixed thoroughly and incubated for 15 m in. They were centrifuged to rem ove any precipitate, and absorbance was read at 510 nm . Total anthocyanin concentrati on was calculated based on using m olar extinction coefficient (29,600 of cyanidin-3-glucoside, and expressed in mg anthocya nin/g dried powder. Results Extracts of dried m uscadine seeds an d skins of Ison and Early Fry varieties each inh ibited hyaluron idase (Table 2. 1 and Figure 2.1). Inhi bition p er volum e of extract was greater with 59seeds than w ith th e skins of both varieties, indicating that seeds contain m ore inhibitory compounds than skins w hen com pared per g of initial dry weight. The IC 50s of the Ison seed, Early Fry seed, Ison skin, and Early Fry sk in were 0.3, 0.6, 1.0, and 1.0 mg/m L, respectively (Table 1). This translates into extract dilution factors of 1:3000, 1:1700, 1:1000, and 1:1000, respectively. The concentration of total phenol ics per unit of dry weight w as higher in extracts of seed powder compared to extracts of skin powder in bo th varieties (Table 2.1). Ison seeds contained the highest amount of phenolics. Antioxidant po wer (FRAP value) was also greater in the seeds than the skin s in both va rieties. Tota l phenolic co ntent co rrelated directly with the m easured FRAP antioxidant activities (R2 = 0.97). As expected, the ant hocyanin content was highest in the skins of the purp le muscadine (Is on) variety a nd very low in the seeds of both grape varieties and skins of the Early Fry grape (Table 2.1). Percent hyaluronidase in hibition correlated with total phenolic content (R2 = 0.99) and FRAP value (R2 = 0.97) of each m uscadine fraction (Figur e 2.2). Althoug h the Ison sk ins had 7 times more anthocyanin content than Early Fry skins, there was no diffe rence in anti- hyaluronidase activity between the two (Table 2.1). Discussion We tested the hypothesis that m uscadine phytoc hemicals would inhibit hyaluronidase, an enzym e involved in norm al tissue remodeling. An imbalance between synthesis of hyaluronan and its destruction by hyaluronidas e contributes to joint d isease a nd other types of inflammatory conditions. The results of our study show that skins and seeds of the m uscadine grape contain compounds that inhibit hyaluronidase in vitro a nd have potential to m odulate tissue m etabolism when consum ed as part of diet. Hyaluronida se inhib ition corre lated p ositively with the to tal d FRAP values. There was anthocyanins are m inor constituents of muscadin e seeds and skins of the bronze varieties. The data indicate that seve ral polyphenolic com pounds inhibit hyaluronidase but do not exclude an inhibito ry effect of anthocyanins. Various individual flavonoids Muscadine skins of the Early Fry and Ison varieties contain ellagic acid, m yricetin, querceti n, kaem pferol and resveratrol 27 while the eds of each contain (-)-epicatechin, (-)-c atechin a nd gallic ac id as m ajor phenolic s 27. Anthocyanins occur in both the skins and th e seeds, but purple skins have a m uch higher content than bronze skin or the se eds of any varie ty (Pastrana -Bonilla et al. , 2003). acid, ellagic acid glycosid es and ellagitannins are abundant in muscadine g rape skin s and seeds 29. Ellagic acid glycosides in clude rhamnosides, xylosides and glucosides and the ellagitannins are of at leas t four different s pecies (Lee et al. , 2005). Procyanidins have been shown to have anti-hya luronidase activity as well as an ti-collagenase and som e anti- elastase a ctivity 21. Muscadine seeds had higher anti -hyaluronidase activity than muscadine skins com pared per unit dry weight, bu t skins were as high as seeds when norm alized on the basis of total phenolic content and FRAP value. The balance between synthesis of HA and its degradation by hyaluronidase is a key feature of norm al connective tissu e 30. During inflamm ation, the balance between synthesis and degradation of matrix compone nts including collagen, glycosam inoglycans, and proteoglycans can be affected adversely. It has been hypothesized that hyaluroni dase is secreted by inflamm atory cells and by invasive bacteria su ch as streptoco cci 31, 32, which increases the 61turnover of glycosam inoglycans in inflam ed tissues 33. Increased HA synthesis also occurs in pathological conditions and enhan ces infiltration of i mmune c ells 34, thereby increasing potential for accelerated tissu e dam age. This occurs dur ing autoimm une diseas es such as colitis 35 and degradation of HA alters tissue integrity and de creases th e integrity of epithelial barriers 36, 37. HA prevents penetration of large m acrom olecule s through the lum ys and signaling pathways that alter gene expression 39-41. These m odulatory effects m ay be especially im portant in the gastrointestinal tract because it is a f ocus of immunological defenses that can produce enteritis or colitis. The gastrointestinal tract is exposed to the highest concentration of phytochem icals found anywhere in the body. Muscadine phytoche micals are known to alter m onocyte responses to inf lamm atory cy tokin es lipopolysacch aride 42. Muscadine phytochem icals have been reported to alter intestinal apoptosis a nd growth processes related to colon cancer 2, 4, 43. Our results show that m uscadine phytochem icals have the potential to inactivate hyaluronidase, which could m odify tumo r formation or invasiveness. For exam ple, it has been postulated that hyaluronidase stim ulates angiogenesis and facilitates tum 44. com pounds also inhibit expre ssion of m atrix m etalloproteinases that are involved in tum or invasiveness 45, 46. Currently, treatm ent of osteoa rthritis involves m anipulati ng the balance of cartilage remodeling and destruction. This is done by in jecting high molecular weight HA into joints, consum ing nutraceuticals such as glucosam ine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate to enhance glycosam inoglycan synthesis, and prescribing non -steroidal anti-inflamm atory drugs. A fourth strategy that has not been fully em ployed is inhibition of hyaluronidase. Not only does 62hyaluronidase degrade high m olecular weight H A to cause structural breakdown, it also produces low m olecular weight fragm ents th at stim ulate inf lamm ation. Th e results of this study support the need for further studies to docum ent in vivo enhancem ent of joint and cartilag e health in humans who are com pliant with regim ens of drugs or food supplem ents. Muscadine grape juice is sold commercially and is also used in the wine industry. The pomace (m uscadine sk ins and seeds ) contain s most of the grape's polyph enolics and is a byproduct o f the juicing process. Bioactiv ities found in pomace could ad d value th at would benefit vineyard econo mies. The phenolics in pomace have anti-inflamm atory activ ity are known to inhibit hyaluronidase and m atrix metalloproteinases 47. Our data suggest that extracts of whole m uscadine pom ace should b e tested in an imal models for efficacy in reliev ing joint disease. W e conclude that seeds and skin s of both purple and bronze m uscadine varieties significantly inhibit hyaluronida se activity. High antioxidant, anti-inflamm and anti- hyaluron idase activities are a co mbination of activities that m ay prove useful in nutraceutical products supportive of balanced synthesis a nd degradation of extr acellular m atrix in inflamm We thank Mr. Chris Paulk of Muscadine Products Corporation for gifts of fresh m uscadine grapes from Paulk Vineyards.

Up-regulation of hyaluronidase activity occurs in chronic inflamm atory conditions, e.g., inflamm atory joint dis ease. In this study, we tested the ability of brans from several grain sorghum variet ies to inhibit hyaluronidase activity in vitro . Ethanol extracts (1:9 wt/vol 50% ethanol ) were prepared f rom brans of six sorghum varieties. Each extract inhibited hyaluronidase activity in the order of Sum ac >Shanqui Red >Black sorghum >Mycogen with and FRAP (fer ric reducing antio xidant power) valu es for each b ran extract. A variety of other common brans and whole grains were tested and com pared with the grain sorghum brans. Comm only used wheat and rice br an had weak inhibitory activities relative to the high phenolic containing grain sorghum brans. Since hyaluronidase activity is important in conditions such as osteoarthritis and skin ag ing, these varieties dese rve consideration f or functional f ood, functio nal beverage, food suppl ement, nutraceutical and hyalur onan, hyaluronidase, inflammation, joint disease, Sum ac sorghum bran, Sha nqui Red, Black sorghum, polyphenolics. 74Introductio n Population studies indicat e that diets containing significant levels of phytochem icals and fiber are asso ciated with lower incide nce of num erous disease states 1, 2. For exam ple, whole grain consum ption is associated with decreased inciden ce of heart disease, d iabetes, and o ther chron ic diseases. This is due to a com bination of lo wer glycem ic index and the full com plement of dietary fiber and phytochem icals in the bran fractions 3, 4. These correlations have led to United States dietary guidelines that recommend increased consum ption of whole grains and decreased consum ption of decorticated grai n products that provide m ostly high glycem ic index starch. Grain sorghum is a drought-tolerant food cr op that can provide a reliable harvest in semiarid regions. It has been a staple part of the diet in parts of Indi a, Africa, and China for millennia 5, 6. Som e sorghum varieties have extrem ely high contents of phenolic compounds and antioxidant potential that aid in the n atural defen se agains t pest and dis eases 7. These phenolic compounds are m ainly located in the bran fraction 6. Grain sorghum phenolic com pounds fall into th ree m ajor categories: pheno lic acids, f lavonoids and condensed tannins. The phenolic acids are benzoic or cinnam ic of ually catech in and epicatechin 11. Many comm ercially successful sorghum varieties have been developed with reduced tannin c ontent. However, the high levels of phytochemicals suggest that select sorghum brans may have significant nutraceutical potential. Enzym es and other regulatory m olecules are possible targets for plant polyphenolics. One enzym e that is invo lved in tissue odeling extracellular m atrix of c onnective tissues, including cartilage, the synovial membrane and synovial fluid of joints 16. Hyaluronan contains repe ating units of D-glucuronic acid endothelial tinocytes and is degraded by a fam ily of enzymes called hyaluronidases (EC 3.2.1.35). Many phytophenolics exert effects on enzym es regulating ex tracellular m atrix metabolism , and these include hyaluronidase 17-20. In this work, we tested the anti- hyaluron idase activity o f multiple varieties of grain sorghum bran and co rrelated tho se activ ities with total ph enolic s and antiox idant content of the bran. Th e results provide rationale for developm ent of select sorghum bran in the m anagement of inflammatory diseases associated with elevated hyaluronidase activity. Materials and Methods Materials Sorghum brans were gif ts from Dr. Lloyd Rooney of Texas A&M University and Dr. Scott Bean, USDA, Manhattan, KS. The non-sorghum brans and grains w ere purchased commercially from the bulk food section of a health food store in Athens, Georgia. Type I-S hyaluronidase from bovine testis , hyaluron ic re purchased from Sigm a-Aldr ich (S t. Louis, MO). Preparation of Bran Extracts Phytochem icals were extracted from the dried po wders by adding one gram of powder to 9 m L of 50% ethanol and stirring for one h at room temperature. T he mixtures were centrif uged (1500 rpm for 10 m in) and the supernatants were used in this study. Hyaluronidase Assay 76Hyaluronidase determ ined hyaluronan and onium brom 21. a stable absorbance that is proporti onal to the am ount of undigested hyaluronan remaining in solution as m easured by the absorb ance at 400 nm. Inhibition of hyaluronidase by plant extracts is indicated by a slower loss of absorbance co mpared to h yaluron idase alone. The initial ethanolic extracts were dilute d with acetate buffer (0.2 M sodium acetate- acetic acid, pH 6.0, containing 0.15 M NaCl) to yield 1 :100 extracts (d ry wt/vol of diluent). Stock solutions of HA ( 0.5 m g/mL) and hyaluroni dase (1 m g/mL) were m ade fresh daily in acetate buffer. The assay m ixture co ntained acetate buffer, 200 \u00b5g hyaluronic acid, 3 0 \u00b5g hyaluronidase, and 70 \u00b5L of diluted bran extracts in a fina l volum e of 0.5 m L. A dos e-response assay was perform ed with sum ac bran extract ov er a broad concentration range. The m ixtures were incubated at 37\u00b0 C for 15 m in, and the react ions were stopped with the addition of 2 m L 2.5% CTAB in 2% NaOH (pH 12). All assays w ere performed in duplicate. After 10 m in, the optical density of each sample was read at 400 n m (Beckm an DU 650 Spectropho tometer) against a blank contain ing 0.5 m L acetate buffer and 2 m L CTAB. The concentratio n of HA without extract gave an absorban ce of 0.8-1.2 units in the undigest ed reaction m ixtures, and this decreased to 0.3-0.5 in the pres ence of 30 \u00b5g hya luronidase. The absorbance of polyphenolic compounds in the diluted extracts at 400 nm was also determ ined and the results have been corrected fo r this absorb ance. Ethan ol did not affect hyaluronidase ac tivity at the dilu tions employed with th ese s tudies. All s amples were run in trip licate. Measureme nt of Tota l Phenolic Ac id Total pheno lic content in each extract was m easured by the method of Slinkard and Singleton 22 with m inor modification s. Triplicate sam ples (20 \u00b5l ) of each extract and each gallic acid standard 77were added to 1.58 m L of distilled w ater in a 3 mL, 10 mm polystyrene cuvette. 100 \u00b5l of 2 N Folin-Ciocalteu reagent was added and the sam ple was m ixed well. W ithin 10 m in, 300 \u00b5L of saturated sodium carbonate solution (200 g Na 2CO 3 in 1 L dis tilled wate r) was added and m ixed. Samples were incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Absorbance was m easured at 765 nm in a Beckm an DU 650 Spectrophotom eter. A phenolic st andard curve was cons tructed using gallic acid standards (0-500 mg/L) (Sigm a Chemical Com pany, St. Louis, MO). Phenolic acid concentratio ns are exp ressed as gallic acid eq uivalents per gram of dry bran weight. Measurement of (Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power) The antiox each s ample was determ on its ab ility to reduce ferric tripy ridyl-s-triaz ine com plex to its f errous form as described by Benzie and Strain 23. In a 3 m L, 10 mm polystyrene cuvette 10 \u00b5L of each sam ple or ferrous s ulfate standard, 30 \u00b5l of distilled water and 300 \u00b5l of FRAP reagen t were added. FRAP reagent was maintained at 37\u00baC and m ade by m ixing 25 m L acetate buffer (300 m M, pH 3 .6), 2.5 m L TPTZ solution (10 m M 2,4,6-tri[2- pyridyl]-s-triazine dissolved in 40mM HCl), and 2.5 m L of 20 m M ferric chloride solution. The solutions were incubated for 6 m in, and then 0.34 mL of distilled water was added to each cuvette. The absorbance of the sample was re ad imm at 593 nm . FRAP values were calcu curve of ferrous su lfate (0-1 mm ol/L) and the bran extract antioxidant power is expressed as mmol ferrous sulfate equivalents/100 g dry weight of bran. 78Results Effect of Grain Sorghum Bran Extracts on Hyaluronidase A ctivity Sumac sorghum bran extract contained the m ost hya luronidase inhibitory activity of any variety tested, and the inhib ition occurred in a dose-resp onse manner (Figure 3.1 ). An extract of 700 \u00b5g dry weight S umac variety totally inhibited hyaluronidase. The IC 50 was 90 \u00b5g dry weight of the bran per assay volum e. Sorghum bran (Sum ac va riety) had a total phenolic content of 75.5 m g/g of dry weight and a FRAP value of 68.2 m g/g of dry weight. Extracts of five other sorghum brans were also screened (Figure 3.2) for anti- hyaluronidase activity. Sum ac sorghum had the highest anti-hya luronidase activity. Total phenolic content and antioxidant ac elated positive ly with anti-h yaluron idase activ ity (Figure 3.3). inhibition of hyaluroni dase was: Sum ac >>> Mycogen > Fontai nelle > W hite sorghum (Figure 3.2). In all extracts, tota l phen olic con tent corre lated directly with m value (R2 0.95). Percent hyaluronida se inhibition correlated with total phenolic content (R2 = 0.97) and FRAP value (R2 = 0.90) (Figure 3.3). Comparison of Whole Indian Mille t, Whole Glutinous Indian Mi llet, Whole Flaxseed, Whole Quinoa, Wheat Bran and Rice Bran Extr acts on Hyaluronidase Activity The percen t inhibition of hyaluron idase of these g rains is repo rted in Figure 3.4. Indian m illet, Glutinous seed and Quinoa showed m oderate inhibition, s imilar to som e of the less active grain sorghum extracts. Interestingl y, tw o of the m ost comm on br ans used in f ood products are wheat and rice bran. These had very low anti-hyaluronidase activities, phenolic content and FRAP values com pared with brans from Sum ac varieties of grain sorghum (Table 3.1). 79Discussion We tested the hypothesis that sorghum phytochem icals would inhi bit hyaluronidase, an enzym e involved in norm al tissue rem odeling. A chroni c imbalance between synthesis of hyaluronan and its destruction by hyaluronidas e contributes to joint d isease a nd other types of inflammatory conditions 24. Inhibition of hyaluronidase activity is an im portant target for m anaging imbalances in hyaluronan m etabolism. The results of our study show that high total phenolic/high FRAP sor ghum bran extrac ts inh ibit hya luronidase in vitro. These brans were more potent on a wt/wt b asis th an oth er comm on brans (whea t and r ice) a nd higher th an m illet and flaxseed whole grains. HA has several im portant structural and bi ological functions that depend on its size, which can reach 107 kDa 25. High molecular weight HA is responsible for tissue hydration, lubrication, structural integrity, free radical sequestration, an d distribution of plasm a proteins 16, 26. Low m olecular weight HA fragments are generated by hyal uronidase activ ity 27. These smaller fragm ents act as signaling molecules th at intens ify the inflamm atory process by up- regulating C D44 recepto rs, various cytokines, an d matrix m etallop roteinases, while su ppressing proteoglycan sulfation 28, 29. The balance between synthesi s of HA and its degradation by hyaluronidase is a key f eature of norm al connective tissue 30. During joint inflamm ation, the balance between synthesis and degradation of matrix com ponents in cluding collagen , glycosam inoglycans, a ffected adversely. Inhibition of hyaluronidase activity could aid in the restoration of tissue hom eostasis. Various individual flavonoids inhibit hyaluronidase activity in pferol, luteo lin, catechin and ep icatechin ; all are in the b ran fraction of grain sorghum 9, 17, 18, 20, 31. Sorghum bran's are a rich source of flavonoi ds, with anthocyanins being the m ajor class 80studied 9. As m ain contributors to their co lor, the most common anthocyanins in sorghum are inhibitors of hya luronidase, collagenase and elastase, the three main enzymes regulating the structural components of the ex tracellular m atrix 19. Unlike the flavonoids, condensed tannin is not the m ain pheno lic consituent in m any brans. In this study, the sorghum brans with the greate st inhibitory capac ity (Sumac and Shanqui Red) were the ones with the h ighest to tal ph enolic v alues and anti oxidant abilities. W ith the exception of black sorghum bran, the brans with the highest anti-hy aluronidase activity are also considered 'high tannin' sorghum brans. OPCs are also found in abundance in grape se eds and pine bark and have been studied extens ively f or their h ealth-p romoting capabilitie s. OPCs have high antioxidant potential and have been show to inhibit chem ically-i nduced lipid peroxidation, DNA fragm entation, and subsequent apoptosis in hepatic and brain tissue of mice 32. As an anti- inflammatory agent, th ey have been shown to inhibit pe roxide generation by macrophages in vitro 33. In ulation in the carageenan- induced hind paw edem a model 34. Currently, treatm ent of osteoart hritis involves various com binations of anti-inflamm atory agents to decrease inflammation with an increase of various s ubstrates for glycosoam inoglycan synthesis, i.e., chondroitin sulfate, m ethylsulf onylm ethane and glucosam ine. Injections of hyaluronan approved for treatm ent of oste oarth ritic joints. Th ese injections provide temporary relief of pain in som e patients. A complem entary strategy is to inhibit excessive hyaluronidase activity. Inhibi ting h yaluron idase activ ity wo uld sim ultaneously decrease high m olecular weight glycosam inogl substrates The lts of this study support the need to docum ent the in vivo enhancem ent of joint and cart ilage health in hum ans who are compliant with regim ens of drugs or food supplem ents. We conclude that high phenolic/high FRAP grain sorghum brans inhibit hyaluronidase activ ity to a significan tly greater ex tent than wh eat bran and rice bran. Previously we have reported that high antioxidant grain sorghum extract s are highly anti-inflammatory in a m odel of ear inflammation 35. The com bination of high anti oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti- hyaluronidase activities m ake selected sorghum brans attractive in gredien ts for nutraceutical and functional food and beverage pr oducts, as w ell as for food ingredients. The anti-hyaluronidase activity we dem onstrated in this study supports further development work on products that will sup port cartila ge and extracellular m atrix health for nu merous conditions in vivo. In addition, hyaluronan is a naturally occurr ing polym er in the skin and is gaining increased po pularity as a cosm eceutical in that it aids in sk in regeneration and wound healing 36, 37. Our previous work on the sum ac sorghum brans indicated high anti -inflamm atory topical activ ity35. We therefore predict that the properties of sorghum bran extracts m ay be useful in cosm eceutical products.

In this regard, the muscadine grape ( Vitis rotundifo lia) is native to the southeastern Unit ed States and th ere is consid erable potential for extraction of biologically active compounds from its skin and seeds 4, 5. Muscadine berries have thick, tough skins and several hard, oblong seeds. Their berries grow in loose clusters of up to 40 grapes, and ri pen individually over an extended harvest period. Vitis ro tundifolia is distinguished from Vitis vin ifera by 20 pairs of chromosom es in the for mer vs. 19 pairs in the latter. Pa rtly for this reason, botanists assign the grape to the genus, Muscadinia 6. Muscadine grapes have a high total phenol ic acid conten t mainly ch aracterized by high ellagic acid com pounds, gallic acid, and an thocyanin 3,5-diglucoside concentrations 7-11. Ellagic acid, m yricetin, querce kaem pferol are the m ost abundant phenolics in the muscadine s kin, while g allic ac id, ca techin, epicatechin and oligom eric proanthocyanidins (OPC's) are abundant in the seeds 9. The m uscadine is distinguished am ong other grapes by its high ellagic acid and ellag itannin concentration. T he deep color of the grap e skin in red, purple and black cu ltivars is attr ibuted to peonidin, The m uscadine also co ntains resverat rol derivatives. Current research on dietary polyphenols indicate m any health bene fits including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, 95and anticarcinogenic abilities 12-18. The skins and the seeds are currently being used in food supplem ent products and extracts of these are in developm ent for nutraceutical and cosm eceutical products.

Dietary intervention for treatm ent of chronic inflamm atory states is gaining interest due to unwanted side effects of m any common anti-in flammatory drugs. Polyphenols 96that are found in edible plant products such as fr uits, vegetables, herbs and spices, and have been shown to inhibit the inflammation process 24. Recently ou r laborato ry exam ined a variety of anti-inflamm atory act ivities of m uscadine grape ex tracts using in vitro cell culture and in viv o models 17. The release of superoxide from phorbol m yristate acetate-activated neutroph ils was inhibited by th e add ition of m uscadine sk in extract. The release of the cytokin es TNF-, IL-6, and IL-1 was inhibite d with m uscadine sk in extract in lip opolysacch aride-activat ed peripheral blood m ononuclear cel ls. In addition , rats fed a diet of 5% muscadine g rape skin sh owed 50% less paw edem a than control anim als fed a regular chow diet when injected with carrageenan into the foot pad. The present study tested whether m uscadine skin, seed, or combined skin and seed extracts would have topical anti-inflammatory act ivities. This study was designed to test the ability of muscadine skin and seed extracts to inhibit inflamm ation, edem a, and PM N leukocyte infiltration o f the ear f ollowing topic al applica tion of TPA, a well-characte rized m odel of topical inflamm ation 21, PTZ), ferric chloride, ferrous sulphate and sodium acetate were all pur chased from Sigm a (St. Louis, M O). Preparation of Muscadine Skin and Seed Extracts 97Muscadine skin and seed powders of the Ison (purple) variety were prepared by drying separated skins and seeds at 120\u00b0C for 12 h in a forced-air pan dryer m anufactured by Powell Manufacturing Com pany (Be nnettsville, SC). The dried skins and seeds were ground in a Fitz Mill Comm inutor Hammerm ill manufactured by the Fitzpa trick Com pany (Elm hurst, I L). Phytochem icals were extracted from the dried po wders by adding one gram of powder to 3 m L of 50% ethanol and stirring for one hour. The mixtures were centrifuged (1500 rpm for 10 m in) and the supernatants were used in the study. The com bined extract was a 1:1 m ixture of the separate skin and seed extracts. Measurement of Phenolic Acid Content of Extracts Total pheno lic acid content of each extract was measured by the m ethod of Slinkard and Singleton 26 with m inor modifications. Extracts were d iluted 1:9 (vol of extr act/vol of water). Triplicate samples (20 \u00b5L) of each diluted extract were added to 1.58 m L of distilled water in 3 mL polystyrene cuvettes. 100 \u00b5L of Folin-Cio calteu reagent was added and the sam ple was mixed well. W ithin 10 m inutes, 300 \u00b5L of sodium carbonate solution (200 g Na 2CO 3 in 1 L distilled water) was added. Solutions were incuba ted for 2 h at room temperature. Absorbance was m easured at 765 nm, and phenolic concentr ations were calculated based on a gallic acid standard curve and expressed as m g phenolic acid per gram of dried powder. Measurement of FRAP (Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power) The antiox idant activity in each sam ple was a ssayed in triplicate using the FRAP test 27. Extrac ts wer e diluted further (1 :9 vol of stock/vol of water). In a 3 m L polystyrene cuvette 10 \u00b5L of each sam ple, 30 \u00b5L of distilled water a nd 300 \u00b5L of FRAP reagent were added . FRAP reagen t was m ade by m ixing 25 m L acetate buffe r (300 m M, pH 3.6), 2.5 m L TPTZ s olution (10 mM 2,4,6-tri[2-pyridyl]-s-triazine (T PTZ) dissolv ed in 40mM HCl), and 2.5 m L of 20 m M ferric 98chloride solution. The solutions were incubated at 37\u00ba C for six m inutes, and then 340 \u00b5L of distilled water was added to each cu vette. The absorbance o f the sam ple was read im mediately at 593 nm . FRAP values were calculated from a standard curve of ferrous sulfate and expressed as mmol ferrous sulfate equivalent s/100g dry weight of fruit. Animals All anim al experim ents were approv ed by the In stitutional Animal Care and Use Comm ittee (IACUC) at the University of Georgia and conducted accord ing to IACUC guidelines. Fe male Swiss W ebster m ice weighi ng 22-25 g were housed in groups of 4 in large shoebox cages and were fed a standard diet ad libitum with free acces s to water. Anim als were in the fed condition throughout the experim ent. Photoperiods equale d 12 h of light and 12 h of darkness daily, with the environm ental temperatu re maintaine d at 21\u00b0C. TPA-induced Mouse Ear Edema Edem a was induced in b oth ears of each m ouse by the topical application to both the inner and ou ter su rfaces of 2 \u00b5g TPA dissolved in 20 \u00b5L of ac etone. Additionally, one group was treated with acetone alone as a control (no T PA). Thirty m inutes after the application of TPA, the inner and outer surface of each ear wa s treated with either 10 \u00b5 L of ethanolic muscadine s kin extract, muscadine s eed extract, muscadine s kin and seed extract (50 %/50%), indom ethacin (0.5 m g/ear dissolved in ethanol as an anti-inflammatory drug standard), or 50% ethanol (vehicle control). The thickness of the right and left ears was m easured before TPA administration and after 4 h and 24 h using a microm eter (Mitutoya Series IP65). The microm eter was applied near the top of the ear just distal to the cartilaginous ridges. Ear punch biopsies were taken with a hole punch (6 mm in di ameter), and were weighed to assess edem a. A single inv estigator p erformed each m easurem ent and punch to stand ardize th e pro cedure. 99Myeloperoxidase Assay Tissue MPO activ ity was measured in biopsies from both ears 24 h after T PA administration using a m ethod reported by Suzuki et. al. 28 and m odified by De Young et. al. 29. Each m ouse ear biopsy (6 mm tissue punch) was placed in 0. 75 m L of 80 m M phosphate- buffered saline (PBS) pH brom ide (HTAB). Each sam ple was hom ogenized for 45 s at 4\u00b0C with a sm all sam ple laboratory Tissue Tearor Hom ogenizer Model 985-370 (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK). The hom ogenate was transferred to a m icrocentrifuge tub e, and the vessel was washed with an additional 0.75 m L aliquot of the HTAB in PBS and added to th e tube. The 1.5 mL sa mple was centrifuged at 12,000g for 15 m inutes. 30 \u00b5L sa mples of the re sulting sup ernatant were added to 96-well microtiter p late wells in triplicate. Fo r the MPO assay, 200 \u00b5L of a m ixture containin g 100 \u00b5L of 80 m M PBS pH 5.4, 85 \u00b5L of 0.22 M PBS pH 5.4, and 15 \u00b5L of 0.017% hydrogen peroxide were added to each well. 20 \u00b5L of 18.4 m M tetram ethylbenzidine HCl in 8% aqueous dimethylform amide was start the reaction. Plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 3 m inutes, and then placed on ice. The r eaction was stopped with the additi on of 3 0 \u00b5L of 1.46 M sodium acetate, pH 3.0. MPO enzym e activity was assesse d colo rimetrically using Bio-Tek Microp late Reader (EL x 808) at an absorbance 630 nm , and OD/biopsy. Statis tical Analysis Data are exp ressed as the m ean + standard error of the m ean (SEM). Statistical evaluations were determined by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post-hoc tests for significance of differences by th e Student-Newm an-Keuls Method. Statistical significance was considered at p<0.05. 100Results The concentration of polyphenolic acids was hi gher in extracts of seed powder when compared to extracts of skin powder (Table 4.1). Total phenolic content co rrelated directly with the m easured FRAP antioxidant activities (R2 = 0.989). At 4 h, treatm ent with muscadine sk in extrac t, seed extract, and th e com bination skin and seed extract reduced ear edem a by 29%, 32%, and 40%, respectively, compared to the TPA group (Figure 4.1). Indom ethacin decreased edem a by 58%, significantly m ore than the skin or seed extracts individually, but not significantly different from the com bination skin and seed extracts. At 24 h, edem a was reduced by 57%, 45%, 39%, and 39% respectively in the groups treated with indom ethacin, skin extract, seed extract, and the com bination extract. Ear punch biopsies were weighed as an index of degree of ed ema associated with 24 h of inflamm ation (Figure 4.2). Indom ethacin treatm ent significantly reduced ear biopsy weight compared to the group treated with TPA by 55%. Muscadine skin, seed and com bination skin and seed ex tract each red uced ear b iopsy weight com pared to the contro l by 25%, 26% and 41%, respectively. There was not a st atistically significant differen ce in ear biopsy weights between the groups treated with indom ethacin and the combined seed/skin extracts (p = 0.145). There were no significant differences in ear punch biopsy wei ghts from those treate d with acetone and those untreated (7.9 m g). Myeloperoxidase activity was m easured in th e ear punch biopsies taken at 24 h after T PA administration (Figure 4.3). Muscadine skin, seeds, and combination skin and seed extracts each inhibited MPO activity by 69%, 59% , and 62%, respectively, com pared to the TPA + vehicle- treated ears. Inhibition of MP O activity by m uscadine extrac are norm ally ingested, and one m ight wonder why they should be tested in a m odel of ear inflammation. The rationale for this is two-fold: 1) the immune system defends all epithelia, and it is feasible that compounds may suppress or induce inflamm ation in m ore than one site. 2) It is easier to study anti-infl amm atory properties of compounds on an exposed surface th an an interio r surface. In this regard, our resu lts show that topical application of extracts of m uscadine g rape skins and seeds significantly inhibited three important processes related to the TP A-induced skin inflammatory response. Decreases were seen in acute (4 h) ear edem a, the migration of PMN leukocytes to the derm is within 24 h, and chronic edem a at 24 h. Inflamm atory m arkers we re significantly reduced in all treatm ent groups compared to the vehicle-treated TPA ears. Ea r thickness and weight in the group treated with combined skin and seed extracts were not signif icantly different from ear thickness and weight in the indom ethacin-treated group. Anti-inflamm atory effects of com bining the extracts of seeds and skin were additive because the individual ex tracts did not inhibit in flammation to the same extent as the com bined extracts. The reason fo r this could be due to different phytochem ical profiles in the skins and the seed s that allow for greater activity in com bination. Ellagic acid, myricetin, quercetin, and kaem pferol are the m ost abundant phe nolics in the m uscadine skin, while gallic acid, catechin, epic atechin and oligom eric proanthoc yanidins (OPC's) are abundant in the s eeds 9. The efficacy of the polyp henolic acid s in m uscadine skin and seed extracts m ay differ with respect to inhibition of in flammation in this model. Per un it weigh t, the seeds h ave alm ost two-f old gre ater tota l phenolic conte nt than the skins, however skin ex tracts inh ibit in flammation as well as seed extracts. Seeds have high amounts of OPC's which ar e compounds of 4 to 11 102repeating flavan-3-ol units. Transderm al penetrati on of the seed extract in to the ear tissue m ight not be as effectiv e becau se of the larger size of these m olecules, which m ight decreas e the concentration of active phenolic compounds within the tissue. Alterna tively, the phenolic compounds in m uscadine skins m ay be m ore poten t inhibitors of inflam mation than those found in the s eeds. TPA applied topically to m ouse ears prom otes a cascade of inflammatory process su ch as increased vascular perm eability, edem a, and m ast cell infiltration. M ast cells react quick ly in acute inflamm atory responses, and release m ediators such as histam ine, serotonin, and tum or necrosis factor- which increas e vascular perm eabili ty and prom ote neutrophil influx 22. TPA also causes the release of AA from phospholipid pools resulting in subsequent m etabolism to inflamm atory mediators. Phospholipase A 2 inhibitors have proven effective against leukocyte infiltration and edem a in this TPA model of ear inflammation by inhibiting the release of AA from membrane stores 30. Products of AA m etabolism such as PGI2 and LTB4 interact to elicit vascular perm eability leading to ed ema during the inflamm atory respons e 21. Therefore compounds inhibiting C OX and LOX enzym es have been shown to inhibit TPA-induced inflamm ation 21. Phytochemicals in m uscadine g rapes that exhibit anti-COX II or anti-LO X activity include caf feic acid its viniferin 31. Caffeic acid has previously been studied in the TP A ear edem a model and was found to be a weak inhibitor of TPA-induced inflamm ation and tum or prom otion 32. Flavonoids have also been shown to inhibit histam ine release from hum an mast cells 33. Chung et. al. reported that edem a formation in this model m ay also be regulated by H 2O2 generation 34, as eviden ced by anti-inflammatory activ ity 103of several antioxidant compounds against TPA-induced inflammation 35, 36. Muscadine grapes have extremely high antioxidant capacities 10, 11, 37. Recently o ur laborato ry reported th e ability of muscadine grape sk in extract to inhibit the r elease of TNF-, IL-1 and aride ote NF-B activa tion 38. Multiple pheno lics in th e muscadine skins and seeds have been shown to inhibit NF- B activa tion 24. Therefore the an ti- inflamm atory action s of the m uscadine grape sk in and seed against TPA-induced inflammation could be attributed to direct actions of the polyphenol s and their indirect actions via modulation of gene tran scrip tion in multiple cell types. There is considerable potential for muscad ine bioactive com pounds in functional foods and nutraceutical and co smeceutical products. T he presen t work shows th at muscadine extracts can reduce the inflamm atory response to TPA in sk in. This suggests that the extracts would be useful for skin care products including m oisturizing cream s and anti-aging products. An exam ple of a product that is used to support skin and ga strointestinal healing is Aloe vera . Aloe inhibits COX in skin and increases collagen biosynthesi s and degradation 39. Howeve r, aloe is also ingested and has proved useful in d ecreasin g inflamm ation in ulcerative co litis 40, 41, suggesting that com pounds that suppress infl ammation in one epithelium often suppress it elsewher e owing to sim ilarities of the epith elial a nd m ucosal immune system s. A unique feature of the muscadine g rape skin compared to other grap e species is its h igh concentratio n of ellagic acid 9. Ellagic acid inhibits degradat ion of elastic fibers in derm al fibroblas t cultures, which is consistent w ith use as an anti-ag ing cosm eceutical agen t 42. Ellagic acid a potent m odulator of metabolic vation and protects agai nst derm al infla mmation caused by ultraviolet radiation in m ice 44. It is likely that anti-inflamm atory phytochem icals in m uscadine extracts would protect against exposure to environm ental agents and ultraviolet radiation. W hile our laboratory has previously studied anti-inflamm atory activities of muscadines in imm une cell culture and in adjuvant-induced inflammation in vivo 17, the present d ata indicate that muscadine extra cts are topical anti-inf lamma tory agents in the skin. I t will be inte resting to determ ine whether m uscadine extracts m ay also redu ce inflammation in the MPO: Myeloperoxidase 4. cript do not need special attention.

Bralley1, Phillip Greenspan1, James L. Ha rgrove2, Louise W icker3, Diane K. Hartle1 1Univers ity Phar maceutical edical Sciences, Laboratories, Athens, GA 30602 2University of Georgia, Departm ent of Food and Nutrition, Nutraceutical Research Laboratories, Athens, GA 30602 3University of Georgia Departm ent of Food Science and Technology, Athens, GA 30602 Submitted to the Journa l of Ethnopha rmacology 117ABST RAC T The et Z ucc. (Polygo naceae) extract and polym orpho nuclear leukocyte infi ltration was tested following topical application of 12- O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). An ethanolic extract of commercial 200:1 PCE wa s applied to both ears of fe male Swiss m ice 30 min after TPA (2 \u00b5g/ear) adm inistration. Other groups exam ined consisted of m ice treated with either the vehicle, or with a known anti -inflammatory agent, indom ethacin (0.5 m g/ear), or with trans - resveratrol (0.6 m g/ear). Ear thickness was m easured before TPA and at 4 and 24 h post-TPA administration to assess ear edem a. Ear punch bi opsies were collected at 24 h and weighed as a second index of ede ma. Myeloperoxidase activ ity was m easured in each ear punch biopsy to assess the extent of neutrophil infiltration. Results: PCE trea tment significantly reduced ear edem a and MPO activity com pared to the TPA control. The PCE response was dose-dependent and a dose of 2.5 m g PCE significan tly inhibited all m arkers of in flammation to a greater extent than indom ethacin (0.5 mg). Trans- resveratrol did not inhibit inflamm ation as well as PCE at comparable doses indica ting th at a c ombination of factors in PCE m ay positiv ely con tribute to its total activities. Conclusion: PCE exhibits significant top called Japanese knotweed or Mexican bam boo, is a m ember of the polyg onaceae family th at is widely dis tributed in Asia and North Am erica. In traditional Chinese m edicine, PC is called Hu Zh ang. It is us ed as an analgesic, antip yretic, diuretic, and an expecto arthralg am enorrhea, chronic bronchitis, and/or hypertension 1. PCE (PC extract) is now in m any nutraceutical p roduct formulations because of its high con centration of trans -resveratrol, a polyphenolic trans-stilben e Resveratrol and its rela ted phytochem icals Other analogs in P C root contains emodin and emodin 8- O-glucopyranoside. Because of its broad ran ges of use in traditional Chinese m edicine, we b ecam e intere sted in studying properties. Increasing implicates ic inflamm ation as a m ajor com ponent of m any seem ingly unrelated chronic diseases, e.g., Alzheim er's disease, arthritis, co litis, cancer, d iabetes, es. Polyphe nolic phytochem icals from fruits, vegetables, herbs and spices, are known to exert diverse biol ogical effects includ ing the ability to inhibit multiple asp ects of inflammation 16. Diets enriched with anti-inflamm atory phytochem icals are recomm ended for treatm ent of chronic inflammatory d iseases. 119 Although many individual chem icals in PC have been studied for a variety of activities related to inflamm ation, the topi cal anti-inflamm atory activity of PCE has not been reported. PCE is stand ardized to its trans- resveratrol con tent for use in nutraceutical and cosm eceutical products. This should not be interpreted to m ean that trans -resveratrol is th e only m olecule of interest in the PCE; indeed, it represents less than 50% of the phytochem icals in most PCE preparations. Since PCE, not purified trans- resveratrol, is what is used as the ingredient of m ost topical products, PCE should be screened for its t opical bioactivities. Th e present study tested whether PCE matory activ ities in ouse ear edema /inflamm ation screening m odel 17, 18. This study was designed to test the ability of PCE to inhibit inflammation, edem a, and PMN leukocyte in filtration of the ear follo wing topical application of TPA. Mater ials a M 2,4,6-tri[2-pyridyl]-s-triazine (T PTZ) were all purchased from Sigm a (St. Louis, MO). Polygonum cuspidatum 200:1 powdered extract was purchased from Supplem ental Health Form ulations (Mayer, AZ). Preparation of Polygon um cuspidatum extract (PCE) PCE used in this study was a 200-fold concentrate prepared from PC root pr ocessed in India, but grown in China. Product specification chem ical analysis from Supplem ental Health Form ulations reported that the em odin content was < 20 m g/gm and trans- resveratrol c omplex at 120least 500 m g/g. As a quality control, we analyzed the extract by HPLC anal ysis using an Agilent 1200 system (W ilmington, DE). The details of th e chrom atography com prise the following: the colum n was a Phenom enex LUNA ODS2 (Torran ce, CA), 150 mm by 4.6 mm, ID, 5 \u00b5m particle size; isocratic elution with volum 10 flow rate of 1 m l/min and de tection at 308 nm . Th contained resve ratrol. The phytochem icals in the 200:1 PC powder were dissolved in 50% ethanol (1 part P C to 9 parts ethanol) and stirred for one hour at r oom temperature. The m ixture was centrifuged (1500 rpm for 10 m in, 4\u00b0C) and the supernat ant was diluted for topical dose-response applic ation s in this study l phenolics of extrac ts Total pheno lic acid content of each extract was measured by the m ethod of Slinkard and Singleton 19 with m inor modifications. Triplicate samples of a 1:10 extract (wt/vol) (20 \u00b5L) were added to 1.58 m L of distilled w ater in 3 mL polystyrene cuvettes. 100 \u00b5L of Fol in- Ciocalteu reagent was added and the sam ple wa s mixed well. W ithin 10 m inutes, 300 \u00b5L of sodium carbonate solution (200 g Na 2CO 3 in 1 L distilled w ater) was added. Solutions were incubated for 2 h at room tem perature. Absorbance was m easured at 765 nm . Total phenolic acid concentration was calculated fro m a gallic acid stand ard curve (0-500 mg/L) and expressed as gallic acid equivalents per gram 200:1 PCE powder. Measurement of FRAP (Ferric Reducing FRAP method 20. 10 \u00b5L of the sam ple or standard, 30 \u00b5 L of distilled water and 300 \u00b5L of FRAP reagen t were m ixed. FRAP reagent was m ade by m ixing 25 m L acetate buffer (300 m M, pH 1213.6), 2.5 m L TPTZ solution (10 m M 2,4,6-tri[2-pyridyl ]-s-triazine (TPTZ) dissolved in 40m M HCl), and 2.5 m L of 20 m M ferric chloride solution.

FRAP value was calcula ted from a standard curve of ferrous sulf ate (0-1 mm ol/L) and the antiox idant power of the PCE was expressed as mmol ferrous sulfate equivale nts/100g dry weight of the 200:1 PCE powder. Animals The presen t study was p erform ed according to in ternational and nationa l rules considering anim al experim ents. It was approved by th e Ins titutional Anim al Care and Use Comm ittee (IACUC) at the University of Georgia and condu cted according to IACUC guidelines. Fe male Swiss W ebster m ice weighing 22-25 g were housed in groups of 4 in large shoebox cages and were fed a standard diet ad libitum with free access to water. E ach test group had 8 anim als. Animals were in the fed condition throughout the experim ent. Photoperiods equaled 12 h of light and 12 h of darkness daily, with the environ mental tem peratu re maintained at 21\u00b0 C. TPA-induced mouse ear edema Edem a was induced in b oth ears of each m ouse by the top ical applic ation of a total of 2 \u00b5g TPA dissolved in 20 \u00b5L of acetone to both the inner an d outer ear s urfaces. Thirty m inutes after the application of TPA, the inner and ou ter su rface o f each ear w as treated (1 0 \u00b5L to each side) with 50% ethanolic solutions of PCE ranging from 0.075 - 2.5 m g PCE/ ear, a 50% ethanol solution of trans g/ear dis solved in 50% ethanol as an anti-inflammatory drug standard), or 50% ethanol (v ehicle control). The thickness of each ear was m easured using a m icrom eter (Mitu toya Series IP65) before and at 4 h and 24 h after TPA adm inistratio n. The m icrom eter was applie d near the top of th e ear just d istal to the 122cartilag inous ridges. At 24 h each animal was sacrificed with CO 2 inhalation as per IA CUC approved protocol. Ear punch biopsies (6 mm in diam eter hole punch) w ere taken im mediately, weighed, frozen and stored at - 80\u00b0C. A single investigator perf ormed all ear m easurem ents and biopsies in o rder to stand ardize p rocedure and reduce error. E.C. 1.11.1.7) activity was meas ured in biopsies taken from both ears 24 h after TPA adm inistration using a m ethod by Suzuki et. al. 21 and m odifie d by De Young et. al. 22. Each m ouse ear biopsy w as placed in 0.75 m L of 80 m M phosphate-buffered saline (P BS) pH 5.4 containing 0.5% hexadecyltrim brom ide (HTAB). Each sam ple homogenized for 45 s at 4\u00b0C with a sm all sa mple laboratory T issue Tearor Hom ogenizer Bartlesville, was transfe rred quantitatively to a microcentrifuge tube with an additional 0.75 mL HTAB in PBS. The 1.5 m L sample was centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 15 m in, maintained at 4\u00b0C. Trip licate 30 \u00b5L sam ples of the resulting supernatant w ere adde d to 96-well m icrotiter plate we lls. For the MPO assay, 200 \u00b5L of a m ixture containing 100 \u00b5L of 80 m M PBS ( pH 5.4), 85 \u00b5L of 0.22 M PBS (pH 5.4), and 15 \u00b5L of 0.017% hydrogen peroxide were adde d to each well. 2 0 \u00b5L of 18.4 m M tetram ethylbenzidine HCl in 8% aqueous dim ethylform amide to start the reaction. Micro titer p lates were in cubated at 3 7\u00b0C for 3 min, and then placed on ice. The reaction was stopped with the additio n of 30 \u00b5L of 1.46 M sodi um acetate, pH 3.0. MPO enzym e activ ity was assessed absorbance wavelength . MPO activity was expressed as OD/biopsy. 123Statis tical analysis Data are exp ressed as the m ean + standard error of the m ean (SEM ). Statistical evaluations were determ ined by t-tests and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post-hoc tests for significance of differences by th e Student-Newm an-Keuls Method. Statistical significance was considered at p<0.05. Results Total phenolics and FRAP value A 50% ethanolic extract (1:10 wt/vol) of th e 200:1 PCE contained 188 mg total phenolics per gram of PCE. Antioxidant power based on the FRAP as say was 85 mmol ferrous sulfate equivalents/100g dry weight of PCE. Ear edema Ear edem a was observed in all TPA-tr eated anim als 4 h aft er treatm ent. Experim ental groups showed significantly reduced ear edem a compared to TPA treatment alone. PCE at 2.5, 1.25, and 0.3 m g per ear was as potent as indom ethacin (0.5 mg/ear) in reducing edem a (Figure 5.1). treatm ents inhibited edem a 61%, 55 %, 52%, and 65% (IM), respectively com pared to TPA treated with vehicle controls. In com parison, 0.62 mg of comm ercially purified trans- resveratrol inhibited edem a by only 35%. At 24 h, all experim ental groups had signif icantly reduced ear edem a com pared to TPA alone except PCE at 0.075 m g per ear and the trans- resveratrol-treated groups. PCE at 1.25, 0.3, and 0.15 m g per ear inhibited edem a as well as IM (58%, 36%, 40%, and 45% (IM), re spectively. P C, 2.5 m g per ear, was significantly more potent than indom ethacin in reducing edem a with a 73% reduction compared to the TPA treated vehicle control. 124 Ear punch biopsy weights were significantly lower in all PCE groups compared to the TPA-treated, vehicle control group (F igure 5.2). When com paring the activity of PCE and indom ethacin, 2.5 m g of PCE reduced edem a 80%, which was significantly greater than the reduction by 0.5 m g indom ethacin (36%). Myeloperoxidase activity Myeloperoxidase activity was m easured in the ear punch biopsies taken 24 h after TPA administration as an index of neutrophil infiltrati on (Figure 5.3). Biopsies from ears treated with indom ethacin at 0.5 m g/ear and PCE at 1.25 and 2.5 m g/ear doses had significantly reduced MPO activity. The higher PCE dose (2.5 m g/ear) decreased MPO to 18% of the activity of the TPA-treated vehicle control group and was significantly greater at decreasing MPO activity than indom ethacin. Indom ethacin (0.5 m g/ear) and PC E (1.25 m g/ear) inhibited MPO to the sam e extent at 53% and 45% , respectively. Discussion Topical application of PCE significantly inhibite d acute (4h) ear edem a, chronic ed ema at 24 h, and the m igration of PMN leukocytes into the de rmis within 24 h as indicated by reduced MPO activity. Interestin gly, PCE, at a dose of 2.5 m g/ear re duced edem a and inhibited leukocyte infiltration to a greater extent than indom ethacin (0.5 m g/ear). Indom ethacin is a very potent and highly renal toxic NSAID drug with an LD 50 of 50 m g/kg when given orally to m ice based on a 14 day m ortality response 23. This translates to 1.25 m g indom ethacin per 25 g m ouse, just under the dose adm inistered topically (1 mg/ mouse). No significant toxicity has been shown for PCE in this bioequivalence range. Since the dose of indom ethacin was a very high dose, the PCE used for topical anti-inflammatory activity is as active, without com parable toxicity. 125 PCE is widely used in nutraceutical pr oducts because of its high concentration of resveratrol and resveratrol de rivatives. Knowing that PCE contains m any bioactive phytochem icals in addition to trans -resveratrol we decided to exam ine any additive or synergis tic effects by co mparing it to purified trans- resveratrol. The ce rtificate of analysis of the PCE powder , 200:1, reported a 50% trans- resveratrol content. The am ount of trans -resveratrol used in the experim ent (0.62 m g/ear) was equal to the am ount of reported resveratrol in 1.25 m g of PCE, 200:1. Although trans- resveratrol did significantly inhib it the in flammatory m arkers of acute and chronic edem a, it did so at a bioequivalence approxim ately equal to 0.075 mg PCE. The TPA model of ear inflammation is useful for screen ing th e efficacy an d potency of prospective topical anti-inflammato ry com pounds or herbal extracts. In epiderm al cell culture, TPA stim ulates cell proliferation and increa ses the m etabolism of arachidonic acid to leukotrienes and prostaglandins 24. TPA applied topically to mous e ears prom otes the cascad e of events of the inflamm s such as vascu lar pe rmeability, edem a, and m ast cell infiltration. Mast cells react quickly and release mediators such as histam ine, serotonin, and tumor necrosis factor- during acute responses. These m ediators perm eability and prom ote neutroph il inf lux 17. TPA also cau ses the release of arachid onic acid from membrane phospholipids, resulting in subsequent form ation of inflammatory m ediators. Phospholipase A 2 inhibitors have proven effective ag ainst both leukocyte in filtration and edem a in the TPA model of ear inflamm ation by inhi biting the release of arachidonic acid from membrane stores 25. Products of arachidonic acid metabolism such as PGI 2 and LTB 4 ct to increase vascular perm eability leading to edem a during the inflammatory response 18. Therefore compounds inhibiting C OX and LOX enzym es have been shown to inhibit TPA-induced inflamm ation 18. Chung et. al. reported that edema fo rmation in this m odel m ay also be 126regulated by H 2O2 generation 26, as evidenced by anti-infla mmatory activity of several antioxidant com pounds against TPA-induced inflamm ation 27, 28. One of the early ha llmarks of skin irr itation and local inf lammation in the TPA m odel is thickening within 1-4 h due to increased vascular perm eability, edem a and swelling w is 29. Secondarily, PMN leukocytes m igrate to th e derm is within 24 h and are estim ated by the MPO assay. Both of these inflamm atory pr ocesses were blocked by topical application of PCE in a dose-dependent m anner. While m ost PC research to date h as been done on individu al chem ical constitu ents, PC E extracts are widely used in nutraceutical and cosmeceutical p roducts. Biological testing of the PCE in test system s has yielded some inte resting experim ental data m ostly from in vitro screening tests. PCE is suggest ed to be cardioprotective because it decreases cellu lar cholesterol ester content and em odin com ponents isolated from PC ar e both protein tyrosine kinase C inhibitors 31, 32. These kinases play an im portant ro le in regulation of cell growth and transform ation and are theref ore its inhi bition of growth of thr ee pros tate cancer cell lines 33. PCE also possesses som e anti-viral pr operties by inhibiting the production of the hepatitis B v irus 34. To date, there has been little in vivo testing of PCE. The presen t data testing of PCE vers us any single constituent both in vivo and in vitro becom es important when considering known additiv e and s ynergis tic actions of phytochem icals in living system s. Although PC is processed to enrich the trans -resveratrol in PCE, we do not imply that all the anti-inflammatory activities are attributab le to the resveratrol com ponent. W hen the PCE 127extract was com pared directly to kno wn trans -resveratrol, it appeared th at there was m ore anti- inflamm atory activ ity in the PC E was perf ormed determ ine the ef fect of trans -resveratro l in th e TPA ear edem a model. In addition to 50% resveratrol, PCE extr act contains other compounds, including em odin, g lycosid es su ch k nown anti- inflammatory ities and that e are iologically additiv e or synerg istic with the activ ity of trans -resv eratrol. There are am ple re ports in the lite rature of such interactions within biological system s in vitro 35, 36. For exam ple, in hum an leukem ia cells, ellagic acid and querce tin in teract synergis tically with resveratrol to induce apo tosis and cell cycle arrest 37. Trans- resveratro l and its de rivatives have been studied extens ively f or their hea lth prom oting qualities, including its anti-inflamm atory activity. Resverat rol and analogues of resver ll inh ibit hu man TNF-, and LPS-induced activation of NF- B 38, 39. Resveratrol can inhibit prostaglandin E 2 release from hum an peripheral blood leukocytes 40. In a m odel of early ificantly decreas ed elevated plasm a levels of prostaglandin D 2 and decreased the expression of COX-2 41. Resveratrol also inh ibits the TPA- induced m ouse dorsal skin inflammatory response m ainly via NF- B and activator protein-1 (AP-1) m odulation 42, 43. Emodin, an anthraquinone, is a m ajor com pone nt in PCE. The em odin content in PCE is controlled during the processing to achieve a final content of < 20 m g/g to reduce the risk of unpleasan t gastrointestin al motility s ide effects of em odin in hum ans 44. Emodin is a phytoestrogen, and an anti-viral, and anti-inflammatory agent B activ ation and IB deg radation, an d decreases gene expression of cell surface adhesion proteins in vascu lar endothelial cells 46. Emodin also effectively inhi bits gene expression for TNF- , iNOS, and IL- 12810 in RAW 264.7 m acrophages by altering the intracellular location of NF- B, and the production of I B 47. Thus, even though em odin levels have been reduced from levels in PC root, its continued presence in PCE may well co ntribute to th e anti-inf lamm atory activ ity of PCE. The presen t dem onstrated th at 50% ethanolic solution of PCE has topical anti- inflamm atory activity. At higher doses, PC E was m ore potent than the s tandard anti- inflamm atory drug indom ethacin at 0.5 m g/ear. Trans- resveratrol alone was not as potent as the PC extract, s uggesting ad ditive or syn ergistic effects of resveratro l with ad dition al phytochem icals in the P CE. Because anti-infla mmatory activity is a de sirab le property in a topical preparation, the present work done in vi vo supports the use of PCE in cosm eceutical and derm atological products. We tested P CE in a topical m odel of infl amm ation, but it is possibl e that PCE m ay have system ic anti-inflamm atory activities. The ratio nale for this is two-f old: 1) the immune system defends all epithelia, and it is feasible that compounds m ay suppress or induce inflamm ation in more than one site. 2) It is easier to st udy anti-inflammatory properties of com pounds on an exposed surf ace than an interior surface. PC E is currently so ld commercially in nutritio nal supplem ents, and in traditional Chinese m edicine , PCE is ingested orally. Further study is warranted to determ ine system ic an ti-inflamm atory properties of PCE The authors are grateful to Ms. Linda Duncan for her te chnical assistan ce. 130References 1.

T NBS binds to proteins initiating im mune activation, infiltration, infl amm ation, vitro and in vivo tests. Hypothesis: Dietary m uscadine skin powder in chow and extracts in drinking water, + one enem a with m uscadine extract, will attenu ate T NBS-induced colitis in r Experim ental Design: R ats were pre-fed 5% muscadine sk in powder in chow and m uscadine skin extrac t in drink ing water f or 3 days before, and 7 days afte r TNBS trea tment. Rats were administered TNBS intracolonically (120 m g/kg in 0.25 m l 50% EtOH). One group was given a muscadine extract enem a (1 m l) 1 hr before TNBS. Control groups consisted of rats + TNBS + saline enema fed norm al chow diets. Daily f ood intakes and body weights were recorded. Colon weights, colon lengths, m acroscopic sc ores and m yeloperoxida se activ ities marker of ne utrophil invasion) were determ ined after sacrifice on Day 7. Results: Muscadine- enrich ed diets decreased neutr ophil invasion in to the colon ic tissue, edema and m acroscopic scores. Inflammation in the colon w as elim inated in rats receiving the muscadine en ema treatm ent. In these, TNBS produced no significa nt changes in m arkers from untreated controls fed nor mal chow. Conclusion: Muscadine phytoch emicals exert a powerful protective effect in the TNBS model of colitis. 141Introductio n Ulcera tive atory Bowel Diseas e (IBD) that is the cause of illness for 1 - 2 million A mericans. It is char acterized by the ulceration of the innerm ost lin ing of the colonic mucosa, usually in the rectum and sigmoid colon anifes ts as peri-anal irritations, fissures, hemorrhoids, fistulas, ulcers and abscesses. Th e origin of UC is unknown, but dietary, genetic, environm ental, and immunological factors are all suggested causes . Regardless of the lack of understanding of its etiology, there are m any pathol ogic features seen in the progression of the disease. A mong these include genetic predispos ition, increase in inflammatory m ediators, increased oxidative stress, im balance in gut m icroflora, abnorm al glycosam inoglycan content of the m ucosa, and decreased oxidation of short chain fatty acids 1. Prim ary lesions in UC begin with neutrop hil inv asion in areas of inflammation. Because th e mucous layer is thinnest in th e rectum and sigm oid colon, the disease is m ost pronounced in these areas. Tissue dam age develops into sm all erosions and eventually ul cers and dam age leads to abscess form ation in crypts, necrosis, and ragged ulce ration of the m ucosal layer. Major classes of drugs used to m anage the disease include am inosalicylates, corticosteroids, (TNF- ) receptor antagonists. Side effects from these drugs, however, can be quite severe. The m uscadine grap e (Vitis rotund ifolia ) is a unique plant of the southeastern United States that is tolerant to h eat, humidity and various pests. It is a rich source of biologically active constituents including ellagic ac id, quercetin, resverat rol, and anthocyanins. W that muscadine extracts have anti-inflamm atory effec ts both in ine phytochem icals are known -radical release from ac tivated neutrophils. In addition, rats fed a diet of 5% m uscadine grap e skin show ed 50% less paw edem a than control anim als fed a regular ch ow diet when inje cted w ith carrageenan into the foot pad 2. Extracts of muscadine s eeds and skins also inh ibit top ulated by phorbol m yristate acetate 3. Because UC is a disease of infla mmation, th e anti-inflamm atory properties of m uscadine grapes lead one to ask w hether the phytochem icals that are co ncentrated in the grap e skin might affect the inflamm atory processes involved in th e pathology of UC. W e have chosen to study the beneficial effects of m uscadine g rape skin on trea tment of UC in the rat us ing the trin itrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) rat m odel disease 4. TNBS is inje cted intrarectally and acts as a hapten to produce an intense local inflammatory response that exhibits m any of the macroscopic, histological and imm unological re sponses seen in UC. In this study, we are exam ining the effects of pre- and post-feeding 5% muscadine skin powder in the diet, the oral ingestion of a concentrated m uscadine skin ex tract, and the ad ministra tion of muscadine skin extra ct intrarectally. Materials and Methods Preparation of Muscadine Skin extract Muscadine skin powder of the Ison (purple) vari ety was prepared by drying the separated skins at 120\u00b0C for 12 h in a forced-air pan dryer manufactured by Powell Manufacturing Company (Bennettsville, SC). The dried sk ins were ground in a Fitz Mill Communitor Hammerm ill manufactured by Fitzpatrick Com pany (Elm hurst, IL ). In th e muscadine treated anim als, th is powder was included as 5% of the chow. 143 The phytochem icals were extracted f rom the dried powders in order to be suspended in the drinking water and adm inister ed intrarectally by adding 100g sk in powder to 900 m l of 50% ethanol and stirring for one hour. The m ixture was centrifuged (1500 rpm for 10 m inutes) and the supernatant was rem oved. To remove the et hanol and to concentrate the phytochem icals, the extra ct was heated to 65 \u00b0C and stir red until th e volume was reduced by 5 0%. Extra cts were standardized based on tota l phenolic content. Experimental Animals All anim al experim ents were approv ed by the In stitutional Animal Care and Use Comm ittee (IACUC) at the University of Georgia and c onducted according to IACUC guidelines. Male Wistar rats weighing 200 g were ordered from Harlan Laboratori es (Indianapolis, Indiana) and were placed individually in si ngle wire hanging cages. Photoperiods equaled 12h of light and 12 h of darkness daily, with environm ental tem perature m aintained at 21\u00b0C. Rats were pre-fed for 3 days with either control c how or control chow containing 5% m uscadine skin powder. All rats were fasted 24 hours before the induction of colitis bu t were allowed access to water throughout. Induction o f Colitis Colitis was induced usin g accord ing to th e procedure describ ed by W hittle, et.al.5. Rats were anesthetized with m se dated, 0.12m g/g TNBS (Sigm a, St. Louis, MO) dissolved in 50% ethanol was adm inistered intrarectally via a 2 mm outside diam eter flexible plastic tube, in a volum e of 0.25 m l. The cathete r was inserted 8 cm into the colon, and the TNBS was adm inistered in a cons tant flow as the catheter rem oved. Sham anim als received a 1440.25 m l saline intracolonic injection following th e sam e procedure. After the intracolonic injections, anim als were m aintained in a Trundleberg position for 15 m in. One experim ental group of anim als received an enem a of muscadine skin extract 1 h before TNBS adm inistration. The anim als were sedated as described a bove and a catheter was inserted 8 cm into the colon. One m l of the c oncentrated muscadine skin extract was irrigated into the colon within 15 seconds. Experim ental groups each had 8 anim als and consisted of: 1. Saline injection (no T NBS), nor mal chow 2. TNBS injection, normal chow 3. TNBS injection, 5% muscadine skin in the diet and 10% concentrated extract in the drinking water 4. Saline enem a, TNBS in jection, norm al chow 5. extract enem a, TN BS injection, 5% m uscadine skin in the diet and 10% concentrated extract in th e drink ing water. The anim als were checked daily for behavi or, food intake, stool consistency, and body weight. Seven days after TNBS adm inistration, the rats were sacrificed via carbon dioxide inhalation. Assessment of Colitis The entire colon of each anim al was rem oved, slit longitudinally, and gen tly rins ed with ice-cold PBS buffer, pH 7.0 to remove any feces. The colon was weighed, and len gth was m easured. Macroscopic scoring was perform ed by a single investigator and was assessed based on the colitis score described in Table 1. The colon was then cut up and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80\u00b0C until used f or biochemical ass ay. 1452.5 Assessment of neutrophil infiltrat ion (myeloperoxidase(MPO) activity) MPO activity was assessed in full-thickness tissu e samples from macroscopically inflam ed areas, or com parable locations in the control ra ts by a m ethod described by Grisham et. al. 6. It was the most distal region of each col on that was used to assess neut rophil invasion. Tissue sam ples (200m g/4m l) ethylammonium brom ide a 50 m M pota ssium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0) and were homogenized with a Tissue T earor Hom ogenizer Model 985-370 (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK) three tim es for 30 sec each. The hom ogeni zer was th en rinsed with 2 ml HTAB buffer. The pooled hom ogenate and washes were sonicated for 10 sec. The sam ple was then f reeze- thawed three tim es (-80 \u00b0C/37 \u00b0C) and then centrifuged at 4,000 x g for 25 m inutes at 4 \u00b0C. To a cuvette, 69 \u00b5l of the supernatant was added to 2 m l of a 50 mmol/L phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 0.167 m g/ml O-dianisidine hydrochloride and 0.0005% hydrogen peroxide. The change in absorbance over two m inutes was m easured at 460 nm . One unit of MPO activity is defined as that converting \u00b5m ol of hydrogen per oxide to water in 1 m inute at 22 \u00b0C. Results were also norm alized based on MPO units per m g protein as assessed by the Bradford Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). All other chem icals were purchased from Sigm a, St. Loius MO). Results A thickening and a shortening of the colon is a hallmark char acteristic of inflamm ation in the TNBS mode l of ulcera tive colitis. Norm al chow fed, TN BS injected anim als had a 70.4% increase in colon weight com pared to the colon weight of a healthy anim al (Figure 6.1). The control anim als given an additional saline enem a had a 72.8% increase in colon weight. The increase was reduced to only 42.6% in the anim als fed the muscadine diet, and was reduced to 25.7% in those given an additional muscadine extract enem a. Inflamm ation due to TNBS 146reduced the colon length by 33.8% com pared to healthy anim als (Figure 6.2). Control anim als given an add itional salin e enem a had a 25.5% re duction in colon length. Ani mals fed the muscadine diet only had a 7.8% reduction in colon length, and those given an additional muscadine extract enem a had no sig nificant d ifference in colon length comp ared to the healthy anim al. Gross m orphological dam age scores were 54.5% and 81.8% lower in the muscadine fed, and additional m uscadine extract enem a groups , respectively, than in the T NBS, chow fed control group (Figure 6.3, Figure 6.4). MPO activity was m easured as a m arker of ne utrophil inv asion into th e colon tis sue. The saline enema treated group inhibi ted activity by 25.2% com pared to the T NBS, chow fed control anim al (Figure 6.5). The m uscadine fed group a nd the m uscadine extract enem a group inhibited MPO activity by 60% and 82.1%, respectively. Discussion Results support the hypothesis that m uscadine grap e skin in the diet a nd/or m uscadine skin extra ct injected in trarectally a ct as a nti-inflamma tory ag ents in the co lon by decreasin g markers of infla mmation including colon weight, m acros copic scoring and neutrophil invasion. To elucidate the m echanism of action, a further understanding of the pa thophysiology of UC is required. Disregulation of the immune function is though t to be a m ajor contributing factor in the progression of UC 7. In the norm al gut, the gastrointestinal tract acts as a barrier to foreign antigens from food and intestinal bacteria a nd its byproducts. The \"controlled inflamm ation\" that occurs is necessary to m aintain mucosal homeostasis and eradicate the pathogen. Once the harmful antigen is gone, the local im mune response must be attenuated, and is done so by either 147CD4+/CD25+ cells produced by the thym us, or by apoptosis of T lym phocytes, the m ajor cell- mediated immune response cells 8, 9. In a diseased colon, this attenuation of the immune response is absent, and vicious cycle of infla mmation occurs. When exposed to exogenous antigens, a cell- mediated imm une res ponse is activated in the gut and T lym phocytes secret e specific pro-inflammatory cyt okines, tum or necrosis factor- alpha (TNF- most abundant 10. TNF- amplifies the inflamm atory response by increasing transcription of itself, and IL-1\u00df and IL-6 m ainly via activation of the nuclear-f actor kappa B (NF- B) pathway. TNF- also increases the expression of adhesion m olecules, and proliferation of fibroblasts 11, 12. The exogenous antigens also directly stim ulate production of cytokines such as IL-1, IL- 6, and TNF- from the intestinal epithelium 13. These cytokines am plify the imm une response by enhancing the proliferation of T lym phocytes, facilitating cell-cell signaling, and prom in to the inf a stage in the inf lammatory pro cess 14. Neutrophils reduce m olecular oxygen the supe roxide anion radical and through the enzym e MPO, the potent cytotoxic oxida nt, hypochlorous acid, is form ed from hydrogen peroxide and chlor ide ion s 15. Cytokines also play a direct role in the inflammatory response by rapidly synthesizing and secretin g reactive oxygen and prostaglandins 16-19. Cellu lar injury an d necrosis are induced by reactive oxygen species by peroxidation of m embrane lipids, protein denaturation, and D NA da mage. Current drug treatm ent includes corticostero ids and immunomodulator s. Corticosteroids bind to th e cytosolic glu cocorticoid recepto rs and inhibit the arachidon ic acid cas cade, thus inhibiting activation of certain tr anscription facto rs such as IL -1, -6, and interferon-gamma. The therapy is designed for short-term , but if used chronically, side effects co uld include cataracts, 148osteoporosis, m yopathy, and conditions associat ed with imm une suppression and adrenal insufficiency. Immunomodulator y drugs m ainly inhibit TNF- activation thus inhibiting the T- lymphocyte activity decreasing th e cell-m ediated immune response. Patients see a faster recovery rate than with corticosteroids and a longer rem ission, but the chance for serious side effects is increased. Immunom odulators prom ote activation of latent infections such as tuberculosis, and increase the vulnerability to active infection s. There is a decreased immune vigilance, w hich can increase early tum or formation. Other side effects include dem yelination and other neurological dam age, aplastic anem ia, intestinal perforations , and congestive heart failure. Phytochem icals have been shown to modul ate many m etabolic pathways and signaling pathways that alter gene expr ession, m ainly by inhibiting NF- B. These modulatory effects m ay be especially im portant in the gastro intestinal tract becau se it is the larg est body surface in contact with the outside world. It is the site of the mucosal immune system , and the gut- associated lym phoid tissue is the largest lym phatic organ in the body. It is also exposed to the highest concentrations of phytochem icals found anywhere in the body. The study of phytochem icals as a treatm ent for UC is not novel but is warranted due to the harsh side effects of current drug treatm ent. Diet ary quercetin, a m ain phytochem ical in the m uscadine grape, was shown to ameliorate TN BS-induced colitis in by way of TNF- B activa tion 20. ical in the m uscadine grape, has been shown to inhibit TNF- activation of NF-B in vitro and is protective against TNBS-indu ced colitis due to im pairm ent of neutrophil function, decrease in NF- B activation, and stim ulation of apoptosis in colonic cells 21, 22. 149Our previous in vitro work shows that m uscadine grape skin phytochem icals inhibit several processes related to the pathology of UC . In hum an mononuclear cells stim ulated with muscadine of TNF- , IL-1 and IL -6, three of the m ain cytokines in volved in U C superoxide respiratory burst 2. Muscadine grape skin extracts have also been shown to be highly anti-oxidant 23. In vivo work dem onstrated that topical application of extracts of m uscadine sk ins to the m ouse ear inhibited the inf lammatory process associated with phorbol -myristate acetate exert highly anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties and can be useful, non-toxic treatm ents in diseases of inflammation including ulcer ative colitis. 1.

Both Ison (purple) and Early Fry (bronze) grape skin and seed extracts inhibited hyaluronidase. Inhibito ry activ ity co rrelated and antioxidant activity. Hyaluroni dase inhibition could be an important strategy in treatm ent and prevention of osteoarthritis. Not only does hyaluronidase degrade hi gh molecular weight hyaluronan to cause structural breakdown in th e joint tis sue, it a lso produ ces low m olecula r weigh hyaluronan fragments that stimulate infl ammation. The results of this study support the need for further stud ies in vivo to determine the effect of m uscadine skin and seed fractions on joint and car tilage hea lth. In Chapter T hree, the hypothesis was tested th at sorghum bran of several varieties will inhibit hyaluronidase activity in vitro . All sorghum brans tested inhibited hyaluronidase in vitro, and inhibitory activity correlated with total phe nolic con tent and antiox idant ac tivity. Sum ac sorghum bran possessed the greatest inhibitory activity, and inhibition was dose-dependent. Commonly consum ed wheat bran and rice bran had weak inhibitory activities relativ e to sorghum bran, which had m uch higher content of phenolic compounds. The results of this study support the need for further studies in vivo to determ ine the effect of sorghum bran on joint and cartilage health. In Chapters Four and Five, inhib ition of skin inf The m odel of inflamm ation used in these chapters resulted from application of a defined irri tant called phorbol m yristate to the mouse ear. 160Extracts of muscadine s kin, seed an d com bination treatm ents significantly reduced inflammatory markers compared to th e contro l. An additi ve effect was observed with the com bination treatment that was sta tistically sim ilar to th e anti-inflamm atory of the control drug treatment. Polygonum cuspidatum extra ct inhibited a cute an d chronic inflamm ation in a dose- dependent m anner, and was a m ore potent inhibito r of inflamm ation than a com parable dose of purified trans -resv eratrol. These resu lts represent som e of the f irst an ti-inflammatory te sts of muscadine extracts and Polygonum cuspidatum in a live anim al as com pared to cell culture or other tests in vitro . Finally, results in Chapter Six supported the hypothesis that mu scadine skin extract in the diet and/or adm inistered intra- rectally would decrease s everity of ulcerative colitis in rats. Muscadine enriched d iets decreased several m arkers of inflammation associated with this m odel. Inflamm ation in the co lon was ra ts receiv ing the treatment. The botanicals of this dissert ation com e from muscadine grapes, Sum ac sorghum bran, and the root of Japanese knotweed. Tests showed that each kind of extract is highly anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory in several m odel system s. Because of the broad ran ge of biological activities of the phytochem icals, th ese botanicals would be excellent sources for use in functional foods, functional beverages, food supplem ents, nutraceuticals, and cosm eceutical product ingredients. Further studies ar e called for in order to invest igate whether bi oactive compounds from muscadine grap e pomace and sorghum bran have benefits in o ther inflammatory conditions such as developm ent of t he metabolic syndrom e or specific cancers. 161 "}
