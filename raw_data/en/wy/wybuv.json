Pasteur obtained his master of [science](https://www.britannica.com/science/science) degree in 1845 and then acquired an advanced degree in physical sciences. He later earned his doctorate in sciences in 1847. Pasteur was appointed professor of [physics](https://www.britannica.com/science/physics-science) at the Dijon Lyc\u00e9e (secondary school) in 1848 but shortly thereafter accepted a position as professor of [chemistry](https://www.britannica.com/science/chemistry) at the [University of Strasbourg](https://www.britannica.com/topic/University-of-Strasbourg). On May 29, 1849, he married Marie Laurent, the daughter of the rector of the university. The couple had five children; however, only two survived childhood. Molecular asymmetry Soon after graduating from the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, Pasteur became puzzled by the discovery of the German chemist [Eilhardt Mitscherlich](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Eilhardt-Mitscherlich), who had shown that tartrates and paratartrates behaved differently toward [polarized light](https://www.britannica.com/science/polarization-physics): tartrates rotated the plane of polarized light, whereas paratartrates did not. This was unusual because the [compounds](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/compounds) displayed identical chemical properties. Pasteur noted that the tartrate crystals exhibited asymmetric forms that corresponded to their optical asymmetry. He made the surprising observation that crystalline paratartrate consisted of a mixture of crystals in a right-handed configuration. However, when these crystals were separated manually, he found that they exhibited right and left asymmetry. In other words, a balanced mixture of both right and left crystals was optically inactive. Thus, Pasteur discovered the existence of molecular asymmetry, the foundation of stereochemistry, as it was revealed by [optical activity](https://www.britannica.com/science/optical-activity). Over the course of the next 10 years, Pasteur further investigated the ability of organic substances to rotate the plane of [polarized](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/polarized) light. He also studied the relationship that existed between [crystal structure](https://www.britannica.com/science/crystal) and molecular configuration. His studies convinced him that asymmetry was one of the fundamental characteristics of living matter. Germ theory of fermentation In 1854 Pasteur was appointed professor of chemistry and dean of the science faculty at the [University of Lille](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Universities-of-Lille-I-II-and-III). While working at Lille, he was asked to help solve problems related to [alcohol](https://www.britannica.com/topic/alcoholic-beverage) production at a local distillery, and thus he began a series of studies on alcoholic [fermentation](https://www.britannica.com/science/fermentation). His work on these problems led to his involvement in tackling a variety of other practical and economic problems involving fermentation. His efforts proved successful in unraveling most of these problems, and new theoretical [implications](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/implications) emerged from his work. Pasteur investigated a broad range of aspects of fermentation, including the production of compounds such as [lactic acid](https://www.britannica.com/science/lactic-acid) that are responsible for the souring of [milk](https://www.britannica.com/topic/milk). He also studied [butyric acid](https://www.britannica.com/science/butyric-acid) fermentation. In 1857 Pasteur left Lille and returned to [Paris](https://www.britannica.com/place/Paris), having been appointed manager and director of scientific studies at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure. That same year he presented experimental evidence for the participation of living organisms in all fermentative processes and showed that a specific organism was associated with each particular fermentation. This evidence gave rise to the [germ theory](https://www.britannica.com/science/germ-theory) of fermentation. Pasteur effect The realization that specific organisms were involved in fermentation was further supported by Pasteur's studies of butyric acid fermentation. These studies led Pasteur to the unexpected discovery that the fermentation process could be arrested by passing air (that is, [oxygen](https://www.britannica.com/science/oxygen)) through the fermenting fluid, a process known today as the Pasteur effect. He concluded that this was due to the presence of a life-form that could function only in the absence of oxygen. This led to his introduction of the terms aerobic and anaerobic to [designate](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/designate) organisms that live in the presence or absence of oxygen, respectively. He further proposed that the phenomena occurring during [putrefaction](https://www.britannica.com/science/putrefaction) were due to specific germs that function under anaerobic conditions. [Pasteurization](https://www.britannica.com/technology/pasteurization) Pasteur readily applied his knowledge of microbes and fermentation to the wine and beer industries in [France](https://www.britannica.com/place/France), effectively saving the industries from collapse due to problems associated with production and with contamination that occurred during export. In 1863, at the request of the emperor of France, [Napoleon III](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Napoleon-III-emperor-of-France), Pasteur studied [wine](https://www.britannica.com/topic/wine) contamination and showed it to be caused by microbes. To prevent contamination, Pasteur used a simple procedure: he heated the wine to 50-60 \u00b0C (120-140 \u00b0F), a process now known universally as [pasteurization](https://www.britannica.com/technology/pasteurization). Today pasteurization is seldom used for wines that benefit from aging, since it kills the organisms that contribute to the aging process, but it is applied to many foods and beverages, particularly [milk](https://www.britannica.com/topic/milk). Following Pasteur's success with wine, he focused his studies on [beer](https://www.britannica.com/topic/beer). By developing practical techniques for the control of beer fermentation, he was able to provide a rational [methodology](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/methodology) for the brewing [industry](https://www.britannica.com/money/topic/industry). He also devised a method for the manufacturing of beer that prevented deterioration of the product during long periods of transport on ships. "}
