During the renewal process, the Michigan Department of Health & Human Services will check to see if you are still eligible for free or low-cost Medicaid coverage. You may need to fill out a renewal form to keep your coverage. If you need to complete a renewal form one will be mailed out to you by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services based on your individual renewal date. WHAT TO DO NOW: 1. Update your address, phone number, and email address. 2. Report any changes to your household or income. 3. Check your mail or text messages for a renewal packet. To update your information and learn more about filling out your renewal forms, visit [michigan.gov/mibridges](http://michigan.gov/mibridges). WHAT TO DO IF YOU RECEIVE A RENEWAL PACKET: Fill out and sign your forms and return them by the scheduled due date with any proof the Michigan Department of Health & Human Services may need. Please be advised if you do not complete your renewal, you may lose your Medicaid coverage. Questions?
