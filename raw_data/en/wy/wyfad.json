Healers are trained to allow this natural healing energy to flow through themselves to you. By increasing and strengthening your own energy reserves, it will help you to heal yourself in mind body and spirit. It works with you in a holistic way by addressing the wider issues that have contributed to the problem, not just treating the presenting symptoms. Natural Spiritual Healing is very gentle, non invasive and very relaxing. Natual Spiritual Healing can be beneficial for all kinds of problems including but not limited to mental health issues, back pain, arthritis, diabetes, sleep problems and headaches. It helps to bring more peace, self love and acceptance. Each healing is preceded by a consultation.
