Discover the health benefits of acupuncture and the different conditions and ailments it can help with. What are Acupuncture points? Acupuncture points are specific areas on the surface of the skin that correlate with a particular part of the body. When acupuncture needles are inserted into acupuncture points, they stimulate the nervous system to release chemical messages to promote the body's natural healing process. There are 14 energy pathways/meridians that run through the body and acupoints are positioned along these pathways, connecting to certain organs or a network of organs. When acupuncture needles are inserted into the acupoints, it releases a flow of energy, also known as qi (\"chi\"), to bring the body back into balance. It is thought that when there is a blockage in a meridian, illness and disease can occur. An acupuncturist will gently move or manipulate the needles in order to channel the flow of qi through the body. Health benefits of Acupuncture - Relieves stress and anxiety and boosts mood.
