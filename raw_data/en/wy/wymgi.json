Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2017 FY 2018 FY 2019 Continuing FY17 work, FY18 funding will support the modeling of collected malaria surveillance and intervention data to measure the impact of previous interventions in Vietnam. The Ministry of Health has agreed in principal to provide malaria data from 2010-2015 to study the impact of environmental, climatic and control/elimination factors on malaria burden. This effort will be enhanced by continuation of ongoing surveillance efforts with the Ministry of Health with expanded collection of blood samples to evaluate current malaria infection by microscopic and PCR detection of malaria parasites and historic malaria exposure by antibody testing. These activities will improve the understanding of malaria parasite diversity and the distribution of drug resistance along the Vietnam-Cambodia-Laos border region. The focus of efforts with the Ministry of Health will be studying malaria transmission within the country and transport of malaria parasites along the Laos-Cambodia-Vietnam border, a new project will be initiated to detect malaria infection in people returning from working in Africa. This project will provide insight into the transport of which may impact malaria transmission patterns in Vietnam. In FY18 efforts with the Ministry of Defense will focus on completing the cross-sectional study approved in FY17. This study will be conducted in Gai Lia Province on the Cambodia border and provide information on subclinical malaria infection. Subclinical infections are not captured in routine surveillance activities; this gap impacts Vietnam's malaria elimination program and US force health protection strategy as these cases are part of the malaria transmission cycle. Clinical studies on malaria drug resistance will continue in FY18. The Ministry of Defense is reviewing a new clinical study for malaria drug resistance in Dak Nong Province on the Cambodia border, this study began in Q3 FY17 and will continue for two years. FY 2019 Plans: Building on partnerships with the Ministries of Health and Defense surveillance activities will continue in border areas with known malaria drug resistance. Surveillance efforts will be augmented by pilot testing intervention products and packages that could be utilized by the Vietnam National Malaria Control Program and the US DoD to inform malaria prevention and control programs. Surveillance and malaria control/elimination products and strategies will be evaluated using approaches harmonized with the World Health Organization and US DoD Defense Malaria Assistance Program. Study results and recommendations will be reported in refereed professional journals and policy recommendations submitted to the Vietnamese and US Governments.

Sepsis is the common path to end-organ damage and death for a large proportion of globally-important infectious diseases. This project will improve the understanding of disease pathogenesis and antimicrobial resistance mechanisms through network and biomarker analysis thus offering unique opportunities for improving sepsis diagnosis and management. Through systematic biology, it will develop insight into the disease pathogenesis of sepsis, and host factors which predict susceptibility, and sepsis severity provides opportunity for targeted interventions to forestall morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, enhanced knowledge of emerging antimicrobial resistance in strategic regions informs ongoing surveillance and mitigation efforts of critical importance to deployed forces. Successful completion of this project will provide reliable antimicrobial resistance data for forces deploying to Egypt and the region and also document improved methods for the treatment and management of sepsis. ACESO is an international consortium of sepsis researchers led by NMRC that has established a network of sepsis research sites in SE Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa to improve clinical outcomes and advance our understanding of pathogenesis, biomarkers of sepsis and antimicrobial resistance trends. The largest infectious disease hospital in Egypt, Abbassia Fever Hospital, provides critical severe infection and antimicrobial resistance data from the North African Theater.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2017 FY 2018 FY 2019 infection and evidence of systemic inflammation were considered for enrollment. Laboratory testing augmented the testing routinely performed at the hospital microbiology laboratory, and included diagnostic tests (e.g. blood cultures, malaria smears, HIV tests, and serology), molecular diagnostics, and assays measuring the host-response (RNA sequencing, proteomics, and metabolomics). Sophisticated analytic and statistical approaches are being applied to the complex data set to identify diagnostic and prognostic markers for sepsis and to investigate common pathogenic pathways. The Vietnam-Australia-US military study of drug resistance patterns in Central Vietnam was closed in Jan 2017 due to a lower than expected malaria burden. Preliminary data supports previous findings, reported in FY16, that there is no resistance for 1st choice malaria drug treatments. Additionally, a review of Vietnam malaria burden, control measures and environmental factors was initiated; the preliminary findings suggest increased average daily temperature was a primary factor of decreased malaria rates. Recruitment for the cross-sectional study in Gai Lia Province (on the border with Cambodia) started in Dec 2016 and was completed in Feb 2017. Sample and data analysis are ongoing, however, preliminary results from the >3,000 participants indicate the rate of patients without symptoms, but still carrying malaria parasite, was >1.25% in this study population, representing a silent malaria transmission risk in this forested, border region on the Cambodia-Vietnam border. The study of Vietnamese workers returning from Africa was initiated in Q2 FY17 with concurrent records review was stated for malaria patients recently returned from Africa presenting for care at two referral medical facilities in Ha Noi in 2014-2016. Preliminary results were accepted for presentation at the Joint International Tropical Medicine Meeting in Bangkok, Thailand from 06-08 Dec 2017. These data suggest delayed malaria clearance in patients returning from Africa was likely due to delayed medical treatment and not from malaria drug resistance. FY 2018 Plans: FY18 funding will support the continuation of the observational study at the Takeo Provincial Hospital in Cambodia and Komfo Anoke Teaching Hospital in Ghana, the sophisticated analytic and statistical approaches leading to development of the diagnostic and prognostic biomarker panels, and verification of the initial findings.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification This project area seeks to deliver improved capabilities across the full spectrum of operations in the areas of Directed Energy and Occupational and Environmental Health. Research in the Directed Energy sub-project area seeks to develop technologies to \"detect to warn\" and \"detect to protect\" AF operators such that they can take appropriate actions to prevent or minimize exposure leading to adverse health effects. Research in the Occupational and Environmental Health sub-project area involves the assessment and implementation of innovative new technologies that enable effective surveillance, detection, identification, and mitigation of hazardous chemical, biological, and physical hazards that present a health risk to our forces and threaten to degrade and disrupt the missions they execute. Air Force FHP efforts focus on health protection across the spectrum of AF air and ground operations. These include hazards presented to high performance and high flyer aircraft crews facing extreme environments within their flight envelopes that are potentially more sensitive to physiologic and cognitive stressors and rely on aircraft systems to provide life support for protection. Because Air Force installations are typically very strategically important in combat execution, they are more often tied to performing ops at fixed locations; therefore, they drive the need to detect and identify the USAF and environment-specific risks posed by chemical, biological, directed energy, and other radiological and physical hazards immediately and on-site so that operations can be resumed as quickly as possible. This requires enhanced monitoring capability, such as man-portable gold-standard hazard detection. Research is needed to improve these capabilities and to account for emerging threats. The mission needs driving the ability to detect also drives the need to rapidly reduce or mitigate threats once discovered. State of the art detection and monitoring equipment, therefore, is also an important FHP research need. B.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Center for Prostate Disease Research (CPDR) is an interdisciplinary translational cancer research program of the Department of Surgery, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USU), the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC), the Murtha Cancer Center, and the Urology Service at WRNMMC. The CPDR conducts state-of-the-art clinical and translational research with emphasis on precision medicine to enhance the readiness of active duty personnel juxtaposed with the continuum of medical care for military retirees and beneficiaries. The CPDR enriches the training of the next generation of physicians/ scientists who directly benefit the quality, outcomes, and stability of the military health care delivery system. Ground-breaking discoveries through strong academic and clinical research; e.g., over 24 yrs. and 450 publications) have led to major advances in translational prostate cancer research and treatment. The CPDR integrates expertise of urologic and epidemiologists, bio-statisticians, medical technologists, research nurses, patient educators, bioinformaticians, and program management specialists. All these areas of expertise provide state-of-the-art resources for in-house and collaborative research in prostate cancer. The program is also committed to translational research training for future generations of physicians and scientists at leading DoD medical institutions (USU, WRNMMC, JPC, NMCSD, MAMC, FY Excellence (USUHS) Description: The CPDR is at the forefront of \"cutting-edge\" clinical, basic science and epidemiologic research. The emphasis is on improving diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of prostate cancer involving new modalities such as MRI guided biopsy, gene- based biomarkers, and precision medicine strategies targeting causal gene alterations in prostate cancer. The CPDR multi- center database is a unique programmatic resource, enrolling over 27,500 DoD health care beneficiaries under suspicion for prostate cancer, with longitudinal follow up to 23 years. This database continues to highlight emerging issues in prostate cancer management such e.g., treatment outcomes, racial/ethnic differences, quality of life and discovery of novel molecular prognostic markers. In light of current issues related to overtreatment of early detected prostate cancers and poorly understood biology of prostate cancer, CPDR's long-term biospecimen banks, high-impact discoveries and collaborations are leading towards better diagnostic and prognostic molecular markers and therapeutic targets with promise in improving the management of the disease. The CPDR's health disparity research focus has uniquely benefited from studying a prostate cancer patient cohort, with a high representation of African American men, in an equal-access military health care system. Ground-breaking studies of the most validated prostate cancer gene, ERG, in over 1,500+ patients provide the first definitive information on prostate cancer biology underscoring racial/ethnic differences with potential to enhance personalized medicine. The CPDR's state-of-the-art research infrastructure and framework is providing education and training for over 100 next generation physicians, scientists, medical and graduate students within DoD medical institutions.8.443 7.250 8.203 Volume 1 - 142UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603115DHA: Medical Technology Development UNCLASSIFIED Defense Health Agency Page 83 of 109 R-1 Line #6Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2019 Defense Date: February 2018 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0130 / 2R-1 Cancer Center of Excellence Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2017 FY 2019 FY 2018 Plans: Precision Focus: Refine and develop modalities for diagnosing and prognosing clinically significant cancers prostate cancers.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification To better protect mounted warriors from the effects of underbody blast (UBB) caused by landmines or Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), UBB Testing medical research project will provide new data on the biomechanics of human skeletal response that occurs in an attack on a ground combat vehicle. The data will provide a biomedical basis for the development of a Warrior-representative blast test manikin (the Warrior Injury Assessment Manikin or WIAMan project) and the required biomedically-valid injury criteria that can be used in Title 10 Live Fire Test and Evaluation (LFT&E) to characterize dynamic events, the risk of injury to mounted warriors, and to support acquisition decisions. This new data will also benefit the overall DoD effort in vehicle and protection technology for the UBB threat. This work is needed to overcome the limitations of the current test manikin and injury criteria which were designed for the civilian automotive industry for frontal crash testing and as such are not adequate in the combat environment. The current manikins do not represent the modern Warrior and were not designed for the vertical acceleration environment associated with UBB events. Consequently, current LFT&E crew survivability assessment methodologies are limited in their ability to predict the types and severity of injuries seen in these events. Due to this technology gap, military ground vehicles are being fielded without fully defined levels of injury risk and crew survivability for UBB events. The data produced by this project will be used to satisfy a critical need for a scientifically valid capability for analyzing the risk of injury caused by UBB. B.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2017 FY 2018 FY 2019 Title: DoD Cancer Moonshot - Applied Proteogenomics Organizational Learning and Outcomes (APOLLO) Description: Description: DoD's Cancer Moonshot at USU's MCC is a research program consisting of two overall projects, the first known as APOLLO (Applied Organizational Learning and Outcomes), and the second as DoD Framingham. APOLLO is a novel high-throughput molecular analysis of every DNA (gene), RNA, and protein expression molecule in cancer patient tumors. Such analysis has never been done on a large scale across multiple cancer types, and small pilot studies demonstrate that the APOLLO project will result in unprecedented findings across all types of cancer (with specific focus on cancers of the greatest threat to ASDMs). These new findings will be identified by using state-of-the-art tissue collection procedures in the operating rooms of all patients undergoing cancer surgery at MCC collection protocol sites (e.g.. Walter Reed NMMC;NMC Portsmouth; Diego; Womack the entire DNA genome and RNA sequence at USU, while analyzing the entire protein expression profile of these same cancers in MCC's Proteomics Laboratory, as well as other affiliated protein laboratories.

These combined data sets will be housed in National Cancer Institute (NCI) secure cloud-based servers with restricted access for analytics by teams of bioinformatics experts (i.e., from government, university, and corporate entities) across the United States working on this endeavor. This complete bio molecular (global) expression profiling of thousands of cancers of all types seen in military treatment and other facilities will predictably result in a myriad of new discoveries regarding the way cancers develop, progress, respond to treatment, evade treatment, and spread. It also will result in new ways to combat cancers and minimize side effects of cancer treatment, as well as identify novel cancer screening and prevention opportunities, while focusing on militarily-relevant cancers and ADSMs with cancer, distinguishing it from any effort that might develop in the future in a civilian organization, as none of this scale exists today. There are five specific APOLLO sub-projects, which are classified based on the organ type of cancer under study: APOLLO 1 = Lung cancer; APOLLO 2 = Gynecological cancer; APOLLO 3 = Prostate cancer; APOLLO 4 = Breast cancer; and APOLLO 5 = all other cancer types. Both of these projects in the DoD Cancer Moonshot program were specifically developed to focus on ADSM with cancer (readiness), utilize molecular laboratories that are American owned and operated (U.S. DoD and DOE), keep all sensitive de- identified clinical and molecular data on U.S. government computers and servers for maximum data security and analysis (through the NCI), and benefit the nation through any and all discoveries that are made. FY 2018 Plans: APOLLO - Collect 1,000 cancer specimens (all cancer types) and run them though the DNA, RNA, and protein molecular analysis lab platforms of USU, and perform initial data analytics on the results. Perform final data analytics on previously analyzed APOLLO samples. FY 2019 Plans: APOLLO - FY 2019 plans continue efforts as outlined in FY 2018.

B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2017 FY 2018 FY 2019 Title: DoD Cancer Moonshot Program - DoD Framingham Longitudinal Study Description: DoD Framingham is a novel project that is enabled by the blood serum specimens stored at the DoD Serum Repository at the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch (AFHSB) in Silver Spring, Maryland. This facility stores blood serum drawn from over 10 million ADSMs who were required to undergo mandatory semiannual blood testing for the last 25 years, resulting in this repository with over 65 million blood serum specimens. MCC tumor registry data, which includes every ADSM who developed cancer while on active duty, is matched to data in the Serum Repository. This allows MCC to identify the blood serum of ADSMs who ultimately develop cancer at key times, i.e., before they had cancer, during their cancer treatment, and after their successful cancer treatment. Four different serum specimens (two before, one during, and one after cancer diagnosis and treatment) from every ADSM who developed certain types of cancer over a ten-year period of time are then sent to the Nation's foremost protein identification (mass spectroscopy) center, i.e., the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) run by the Department of Energy (DOE). This enables identification of the entire proteome circulating in the blood serum of these cancer patients before, during, and after cancer diagnosis. Comparing the proteomes will allow for identification of new protein biomarkers and indicators of treatment response and failure both of individual patients and across all patients with a specific type of cancer. Smaller studies of this nature done by MCC researchers have proven that this is an effective strategy to identify novel diagnostic and treatment protein expression biomarkers that can be assayed in new blood tests for cancer.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2017 FY 2018 FY 2019 project will do it \"at scale\", i.e. in large numbers of active duty cancer patients (who are otherwise healthy and therefore do not have the \"confounding\" protein markers of old age, diabetes, and other medical issues). By using serums that go back many years before the ADSM was diagnosed with cancer, the earliest markers of cancer that will be identified, and assays will be performed by another U.S. governmental agency with the best protein detection and analysis tools in the world. Eight specific DoD Framingham sub-projects, classified based on the organ type of cancer, will be conducted: Framingham 1 = Oropharyngeal cancer; Framingham 2 = Lymphoma; Framingham 3 = Bladder cancer; Framingham 4 = Kidney cancer; and Framinghams 5 through 8 subtypes will be determined by MCC and NCI experts in the coming months. Both the APOLLO and Framingham projects in the DoD Cancer Moonshot program were specifically developed to focus on ADSM with cancer (readiness), utilize molecular laboratories that are American owned and operated (U.S. DoD and DOE), keep all sensitive de-identified clinical and molecular data on U.S. government computers and servers for maximum data security and analysis (through the NCI), and benefit the nation through any and all discoveries that are made. FY 2018 Plans: Identify Framingham 2 (Lymphoma) serum specimens and run them through the serum protein analysis lab platform, and perform initial data analytics on the results. A de-identified dataset will be obtained from the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch related to serum samples identified by and pulled from the Department of Defense Serum Repository (DoDSR). This data set will include the following: 1) case status (i.e., case or control); 2) year of diagnosis; 3) year of the sample acquisition; 4) year of birth of the subject; 5) gender of the subject; 6) tumor stage at time of diagnosis for the cases; and 7) p16 status at time of diagnosis for the cases. If information on recurrences of the cancer for the case subjects is available, that will be provided as well (i.e., in yes/no format and with date of recurrence if applicable). Specimens to be used in this study will be serum samples from the DoDSR. The DoDSR is a repository of serially collected serum samples obtained from active duty service members from the time of their military in-processing through their discharge, taken at a minimum at two year intervals FY 2019 Plans: Identify Framingham 3 serum specimens and run them through the serum protein analysis lab platform, and perform initial data analytics on the results.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Defense Health Program (DHP) appropriations' distribution and execution of funding is currently dispersed amongst multiple, disparate accounting systems, which is in direct conflict with Financial Improvement Audit Readiness (FIAR) guidance prioritizing the standardization of financial management systems and business processes. Currently DHP funding is distributed and executed across three disparate systems. The current Defense Health Agency (DHA) structure hinders the overarching goal for audit ready initiatives and agency standard financial business processes. The identified solution for DHA to meet these challenges is to deploy a single operational financial management system (FMS) with minimal mission and business impact. DHA is researching a system that will accommodate standard and medically-required business processes. The goal is to transition financial operations to a platform that allows for consistency across the DHA, enabling standardized processes, data collection, and reporting. B.

Because of the CSI annual structure, out-year funding is not programmed. For the Air Force Medical Service, funding in this program element supports technology development for the rapid transition of medical products and capabilities from Air Force laboratories, and the ability to perform modifications/enhancements required to integrate commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) and near-COTS products into the military operating environment. Ability to enhance or modify existing COTS is a cost effective technique we should maximize where possible, ensuring warfighters have appropriate technology at hand to care for wounded at the point of injury through definitive care and on to rehabilitation and reintegration at the most efficient cost and schedule possible. Significant benefits can be obtained from rapid insertion of high value/impact technologies into healthcare operations to address capabilities that enter the acquisition life-cycle at high TRL levels that can readily be implemented with significant upside potential. The viability of S&T and translational research with a materiel component cannot be ensured without correctly programmed funding for logical progression and transition of those activities in the product development lifecycle. This PE ensures viability of S&T and translational research efforts with a materiel component by providing programmed funding for logical progression and transition of those activities in the product development lifecycle.

Navy Medicine also funds, when appropriate, a number of small-scale, opportunistic business improvements when the technology makes a sudden advance. These projects are generally not in the scope of the TRICARE Management Activity (TMA) Central Programs such as the development/integration of Defense Optical Fabrication Enterprise Management System (DOFEMS) into a fully automated system to support workload distribution, performance metrics, staffing requirements, supply management, calculation of operating costs from the current independently or manually DOFEMS system. This effort will be a web based centralized management tool and provide a standalone standard set of Lab Management software for all 26 Navy labs. Additionally, the re-design of HIV Management System (HMS) will be more user friendly, less time to perform everyday tasks and prevents the need to maintain separate databases. The re-design will also automate and minimize functions that require manual assistance and assist in fulfilling new requirements. For the Air Force Medical Service (AFMS), this program element supports IM/IT development requirements within four AFMS Chief Information Officer defined core capabilities as essential to Air Force Medical Service IM/IT mission support. Data warehousing, reporting services, systems integration, and custom application development are featured in almost all IM/IT systems and application requests. The information needs of the AFMS are growing in volume, complexity, and delivery formats. In order to meet future requirements, aggregation of more and varied data sources require increasingly complex data warehousing capabilities. Demand for dynamic analytic capability will require investments in business intelligence, predictive analytic tools, open source research data models, and emerging personalized medicine analysis. Information is still largely produced in an ad hoc manner without standard methodologies, mapping of business requirements, transparent analytic models, and distributed by office productivity software. Centralized production of standard reports, balance sheets, and dynamic query tools would relieve many managers and action officer of routine work and increase leadership decision support. AFMS medical readiness reporting and tracking has set the standard in the DoD for over a decade but multiple applications now encompass what has merged into a common process of tracking unit capability and personal health assessments. Consolidation of medical readiness applications would streamline disability, medical readiness, deployment surveillance, and flying status tracking and reporting who currently must move between multiple applications. For the Air Force, the funding in this program element provides for sustainment of the IM/IT Test Bed (IMIT-TB) capability, which is a dedicated OT location and staff encompassing the entire spectrum of healthcare services and products available in MTFs, to provide risk controlled testing of designated core and interim medical applications in a live environment. Defense Health Agency (DHA) Health Information Technology (HIT) [previously known as Tri-Service IM/IT] - DHA HIT RDT&E activities includes funding for development/integration, modernization, test and evaluation for the Defense Health Agency initiatives, and any special interest that are shared within all centralized components of the Defense Health Program (DHP). The DHP RDT&E appropriation includes the following TMA initiatives: Electronic Commerce System (E-Commerce): This system was developed for centralized collection, integration, and reporting of accurate purchased care contracting and financial data. It provides an integrated set of data reports from multiple data sources to management, as well as tools to control the end-to-end program change management process.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The primary goal of the VLER Health initiative is to enable the secure sharing of health information (i.e., demographic and clinical data) between DoD and external Federal and private sector partners which meets Meaningful Use (MU) requirements to improve healthcare quality, safety, and efficiency. By electronically sharing health information using national standards, that information can support tracking key clinical conditions, communicating that information to better coordinate care, and engaging patients in their own care. The VLER Health initiative provides clinicians with the most up-to-date information, potentially reducing redundant diagnostic tests, medical errors, paperwork and handling, and overall healthcare costs. These benefits, in turn, align with the MHS quadruple aim by ensuring that the military force is medically ready to deploy; the military beneficiary population remains healthy through focused prevention; patient care is convenient, equitable, safe, and of the highest quality; and the total cost of healthcare is reduced through the reduction of waste and focus on quality.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Legacy Data Repository (LDR) will provide the strategy, analysis, and solution to assume data management and governance for legacy Clinical and Business data for Defense Health Agency's Solutions Delivery Division systems that will be decommissioned as the Military Health System (MHS) Genesis electronic health record is deployed. As MHS Genesis deploys to each site, legacy systems cannot decommission without a legacy data repository to safely and securely migrate data - absence a LDR solution negates and ignores the underlying requirement. Clinicians without access to legacy patient history can create a direct patient safety issue. The legacy component of a patient's Legal Medical Record will no longer be accessible once MHS Genesis rolls out. LDR will identify, capture, organize, disseminate, and synthesize required legacy data needed to support medical information requirements for Business Intelligence (BI), Continuity of Care, and Archival in support of Defense Health Modernization Systems (DHMS) deployment plans, legacy system decommissioning plans, and operations and sustainment activities within their areas of responsibility. This initial investment would allow the MHS to realize cost savings by decommissioning systems with overlapping capabilities to MHS Genesis, and reduce the legacy system footprint across the enterprise. Further, LDR would make legacy data available for clinicians through a clinical viewer to compliment the longitudinal record of MHS Genesis. This project will enable clinicians to holistically view a service member's medical record through both MHS Genesis and a legacy viewer. Downstream system dependent on legacy data would also be benefited through a persistence of this information. As the LDR takes responsibility for legacy data, it must be retained within a flexible, scalable, and cost effective platform, but must also maintain the discipline of existing MHS data governance and management standards. While meeting these data governance and management standards, legacy data will be maintained in a variety of formats and degrees of normalization and structuring (i.e. discrete data, document, object, and file level).

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program was established in the Defense Health Program (DHP), Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) appropriation during FY 2001, and is funded in the year of execution. The objective of the DHP SBIR Program includes stimulating technological innovation, strengthening the role of small business in meeting Department of Defense (DoD) research and development needs, fostering and encouraging participation by minority and disadvantaged persons in technological innovation, and increasing the commercial application of DoD-supported research and development results. The program funds small business proposals chosen to enhance military medical research and information technology research. The Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program was established in the DHP, RDT&E appropriation during FY 2015, and is funded in the year of execution. The STTR Program, although modeled substantially on the SBIR Program, is a separate program and is separately financed. Central to the program is expansion of the public/private sector partnership to include the joint venture opportunities for small businesses and nonprofit research institutions. The unique feature of the STTR program is the requirement for the small business to formally collaborate with a research institution in Phase I and Phase II. STTR's most important role is to bridge the gap between performance of basic science and commercialization of resulting innovations. The mission of the STTR program is to support scientific excellence and technological innovation through the investment of Federal research funds in critical American priorities to build a strong national economy. The programs' goals are to stimulate technological innovation, foster technology transfer through cooperative research and development between small businesses and research institutions, and increase private sector commercialization of innovations derived from federal research and development. Both the SBIR and STTR programs address the President's multi-agency science and technology priority of innovation in life sciences, biology, and neuroscience through coordination with the Joint Program Committees, which manage multi-Service DHP-sponsored research.

After the programmatic review, funding recommendations are forwarded to the Defense Health Agency - J9/Research and Development for final approval prior to award. E. Performance Metrics Principal Investigators will provide quarterly reports and a final report. Performance is measured based on the number of products for which testing either certifies use in a given environment (e.g., sufficiently ruggedized, airworthiness testing) and/or results in a recommendation of a specific product, and delivery of an enhanced product or knowledge product. The benchmark performance metric for research supported in this PE will be the enhancement of a maturity level that is typical of TRL 9.
