The report, which was developed by the GSA Workgroup on Cognitive Impairment Detection and Earlier Diagnosis, calls attention to three major points: Cognitive impairment in older adults is severely underdetected in the United States. If cognitive impairment is undetected, older adults who have the condition are unlikely to receive a diagnostic evaluation to determine the cause. Without a diagnostic evaluation, those who have dementia are unlikely to receive a diagnosis. Likewise, without a diagnostic evaluation, those who have treatable conditions that are either causing their cognitive impairment or exacerbating the cognitive impairment caused by their dementia are unlikely to receive treatments for these conditions. Without a diagnosis, older adults who have dementia and their families are unlikely to receive community -based educational, support, and skill-building services that often lead to improved health-related outcomes and well-being for the person with dementia as well as reduced stress, depression, and feelings of isolation and burden for family caregivers. Likewise, without a diagnosis, older adults with dementia are unlikely to benefit from post -diagnostic medical care that can help to mitigate the person's dementia-related symptoms and take into account the effects of the person's dementia in managing his or her other serious medical conditions (e.g., diabetes, congestive heart failure). The GSA report emphasizes that primary care providers (PCPs), including physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners, play critical roles in initiating conversations about brain health and cognition with their older adult patients, detecting cognitive impairment, conducting or referring for a diagnostic evaluation, and referring older adults with dementia and their families for help in accessing community -based services and other resources that will benefit them. This toolkit provides assessment instruments and other approaches and tools to help PCPs with these important functions.KAER: Approaches and Tools | 7 INTRODUCTIONThe GSA Workgroup created a model that identifies four steps to achieve greater awareness of cognition in older adults, increased detection of cognitive impairment, earlier diagnostic evaluation, and referrals for educational and supportive community services for persons with dementia and their family caregivers. The four steps are ultimately intended to improve health-related outcomes and well-being for older adults with diagnosed dementia and their families. Figure 1 illustrates the KAER model. Figure 1. Steps in the KAER Model to Increase Cognitive Awareness, Detection of Cognitive Impairment, Diagnosis, and PostDiagnostic Referrals and Medical Care KAER: Approaches and Tools | 8 INTRODUCTIONOBJECTIVES AND COMPONENTS OF THE TOOLKIT PCPs, health plans, and health care systems vary greatly in the structure, organization, and the usual procedures of their primary care practices. The toolkit is intended to provide options so that PCPs, health plans, and health care systems will be able to select the approaches and tools that fit best with their existing primary care structure, organization, and procedures. The toolkit has a section for each of the four steps in the KAER model: 1. Kickstart the cognition conversation 2 Assess for cognitive impairment 3 Evaluate for dementia 4 Refer for community resources The four sections provide approaches and tools PCPs can use to implement the steps. Some of the tools are shown in the text, and other tools are included as appendices at the end of each section. The KAER model focuses on the roles and functions of PCPs, but the GSA Workgroup recognizes that the knowledge and perceptions of older adults and their families affect what PCPs are able to accomplish in primary care office visits. An appendix to the fourth section of this toolkit (Appendix R6) includes informational materials and tools that can help older adults and families be better prepared to engage in conversations about cognition with their PCP and understand and respond to their PCP's recommendations about obtaining a structured cognitive assessment, a diagnostic evaluation, and needed community services. These materials and tools include, for example, Forgetfulness: Knowing When to Ask for Help, a document developed by the National Institute on Aging (2016a) and the Community Resource Finder, an online tool developed by the Alzheimer's Association (n.d. -b) to help persons with dementia, families, and others identify needed services. Many other informational materials and tools for older adults and their families are listed in the appendix and can be easily downloaded and printed. Although PCPs are not responsible for providing these materials and tools, some PCPs, health plans, and health care systems may wish to inform their older adult patients and families about some of the materials and tools and may opt to have some of them available in the primary care office. KAER: Approaches and Tools | 9 INTRODUCTIONIn general, the approaches and tools shown in this toolkit can be adapted by PCPs, health plans, and health care systems to fit their existing primary care structure, organization, and procedures. The exceptions are the brief cognitive tests and other structured assessments in KAER Step 2. These tests and other assessments have been validated in primary care settings, and changes made to them are likely to reduce their validity. Other tools and materials included in the toolkit should be considered templates that provide concepts, wording, and procedures that can be adapted by PCPs, health plans, and health care systems. The approaches and tools included in the toolkit have been selected because they are appropriate for use in primary care settings. While the 2015 GSA report and this toolkit focus on PCPs and primary care, the GSA Workgroup recognizes that some older adults with cognitive impairment present first to another health care professional. Older adults also receive care in settings other than primary care, such as hospitals, emergency departments, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and home and community -based care settings. Many of the tools and approaches included in the toolkit can be used as is or adapted for use by these other health care professionals and in care settings other than primary care. An addendum to the KAER toolkit includes three clinical practice tools developed for Dementia Friendly America (2015, 2016a, 2016b), a Minnesota-based initiative to foster dementia friendly communities. The three clinical practice tools incorporate many of the same approaches and tools included in the KAER toolkit, but they encompass the broad continuum of dementia care delivered by an array of health care and other service providers in many care settings. In contrast, the KAER toolkit focuses primarily on dementia care provided by PCPs in primary care settings. The Dementia Friendly America clinical practice tools may be especially useful to PCPs, health plans, and health care systems in thinking about and designing systems of dementia care. New approaches and tools to initiate conversations about brain health, detect and assess cognitive impairment, diagnose dementia, and provide post-diagnostic referrals are currently being developed and tested. As these new tools and materials become available, PCPs, health plans, and health care systems should adopt those that will work best in their primary care practices. In particular, the GSA Workgroup notes the need for evidence -based tools and approaches that more effectively accommodate racial, ethnic, cultural, and language-related diversity; low literacy; sensory impairments; and intellectual disabilities in older adults with cognitive impairment and dementia. As such tools become available, PCPs, health plans, and health care systems should consider adopting them.KAER: Approaches and Tools | 10 INTRODUCTIONGENERAL TIPS FOR COMMUNICATING WITH OLDER ADULTS A 2012 GSA publication, Communicating With Older Adults: An Evidence-Based Review of What Really Works, provides information about communicating with older adults in general. A one-page summary of tips from the document can be found in Appendix 1 Many older adults have hearing impairments that can interfere with effective communication in primary care visits. Although PCPs are aware of this problem in some of their older patients, it may be missed in other patients. Use of a brief screening test, the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly, is widely recommended. The test can be found in Appendix 2 TERMS AND DEFINITIONS In this toolkit, the terms family, family member, and family caregiver are used to mean any relative, partner, friend, or neighbor who has a significant relationship with and provides assistance for an older adult with one or more chronic or disabling conditions (adapted from Feinberg, Reinhard, Houser, & Choula, 2011). The term dementia is used to mean a condition in which there is decline in memory and other cognitive functions, such as thinking, problem solving, and language, that is severe enough to interfere with daily activities. Dementia can be caused by Alzheimer's disease, vascular conditions, Lewy body disease, frontotemporal degeneration, and combinations of these and other diseases and conditions, including treatable conditions, such as depression and vitamin B 12 deficiency.

Listen for older adults' concerns about memory and cognition 4. Listen for family concerns about the older adult's memory and cognition 5. Observe for signs and symptoms of cognitive impairment 6. Add a question about memory or cognition to health risk questionnaires7. Use information about health conditions and functioning from existing patient records 8. Combine approaches Appendices 27KAER: Approaches and Tools | 15 STEP 1 : KICKSTARTOVERVIEW In its 2015 report, the GSA Workgroup on Cognitive Impairment Detection and Earlier Diagnosis recommends that: PCPs should initiate a conversation with their older adult patients and patients' families about brain health and changes in cognition that may occur with aging. PCPs should continue the conversation in subsequent visits and encourage their older adult patients to express any questionst or concerns they may have about their cognition (GSA, 2015). PCPs should listen for and acknowledge any questions or concerns about cognition expressed by their older adult patients or family members. PCPs should use their clinical judgment and observational skills to identify signs and symptoms of cognitive impairment in their older adult patients (GSA, 2015). The objectives of KAER Step 1 are to increase awareness among older adult patients about the importance of brain health and to assist PCPs in detecting signs and symptoms of cognitive impairment that should lead to further evaluation, including a brief cognitive test and other structured assessments (KAER Step 2) and a diagnostic evaluation (KAER Step 3), if indicated. Approach 1 includes tools and materials PCPs can use to increase awareness about brain health and aging. Approaches 2 to 7 include tools and procedures to help PCPs recognize signs and symptoms of cognitive impairment in their older adult patients. All the tools and procedures are intended for use by PCPs, and some can also be used by other primary care office staff. It is important to emphasize that none of these approaches is diagnostic. The approaches are intended to increase older adults' awareness of brain health and to assist PCPs in identifying older adults who have signs and symptoms of cognitive impairment and therefore should receive further evaluation. All the approaches can be used in any PCP office visit, including initial and subsequent Annual Wellness Visits. The 2010 federal legislation that created the Annual Wellness Visit requires detection of any cognitive impairment and says that detection should be accomplished by \"assessment of an individual's cognitive function by direct observation, with due consideration of information obtained by way of patient report, concerns raised by family members, friends, caretakers or others\" (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2010, p. 73613). All the tools and procedures shown in KAER Step 1 approaches 2 to 7 are consistent with the Annual Wellness Visit requirement for detection of cognitive impairment. KAER: Approaches and Tools | 16 STEP 1 : KICKSTARTThe brief cognitive tests and other structured assessment instruments described in KAER Step 2 also can be used to detect cognitive impairment. PCPs, health plans, and health care systems may choose to adopt any combination of the approaches and tools shown in Steps 1 and 2 to achieve the objective of detecting cognitive impairment. PCPs could, for example: Use one or more of the approaches in Step 1 to detect signs and symptoms of cognitive impairment and then recommend that older adults with such signs and symptoms receive a brief cognitive test and other structured assessments (KAER Step 2). Based on results of the cognitive test and other structured assessments, PCPs could then conduct or refer older adults with cognitive impairment for a diagnostic evaluation (KAER Step 3). Use one or more of the approaches in Step 1 to detect signs and symptoms of cognitive impairment and then conduct or refer older adults with such signs and symptoms for a diagnostic evaluation, thus skipping KAER Step 2. Use a brief cognitive test and other structured assessments (KAER Step 2) to determine which older adults should receive or be referred for a diagnostic evaluation, thus skipping KAER Step 1. There is considerable disagreement about the best approach to detect cognitive impairment and determine which older adults should receive a diagnostic evaluation. Many clinician experts are convinced that the best approach is routine use of a brief cognitive test for all older adults, or older adults above a specified age, followed by provision or referral for a diagnostic evaluation for those whose scores on the brief cognitive test are consistent with possible dementia. In contrast, other clinician experts are convinced that the best approach is to observe for signs and symptoms of possible cognitive impairment, then provide a brief cognitive test and other structured assessments for only those older adults who are observed to have such signs and symptoms, and then conduct or refer for a diagnostic evaluation only those older adults whose test and other assessment scores are consistent with possible dementia. Disagreement about the best approach reflects differences in beliefs about a wide array of issues, including: the accuracy of cognitive impairment detection based on observed signs and symptoms versus a brief cognitive test; the willingness of older adults to take a brief cognitive test; the risk of over-identification of cognitive impairment based on a brief cognitive test; the risk of under- identification based on use of observed signs and symptoms alone; and recognition that some method or methods are needed to determine which older adults should receive a diagnostic evaluation in order to avoid the prohibitive cost of staff time and other resources that would be required to provide diagnostic evaluations for all older adults, most of whom do not have dementia.KAER: Approaches and Tools | 17 STEP 1 : KICKSTARTIn this context, it is important to reiterate the findings of the GSA Workgroup on Cognitive Impairment Detection and Earlier Diagnosis that cognitive impairment in older adults is severely underdetected in the United States and that unless cognitive impairment is detected, older adults who have the condition are unlikely to receive a diagnostic evaluation to determine the cause of their cognitive impairment; those who have dementia are unlikely to receive a diagnosis; and those who have treatable conditions that are either causing or exacerbating their cognitive impairment are unlikely to receive treatments for the conditions. Therefore, despite ongoing disagreement about the best approach to detect cognitive impairment, it is essential for PCPs, health plans, and health care systems to select and then routinely use one or more of the approaches described in KAER Step 1 and/or Step 2. KAER: Approaches and Tools | 18 STEP 1 : KICKSTARTAPPROACHES RAISE THE TOPIC OF BRAIN HEALTH. PCPs can raise the topic of brain health during any office visit with an older adult, including an Annual Wellness Visit. By raising this topic, PCPs will communicate to their older adult patients that brain health and changes in memory and cognition that may occur in aging are important aspects of their overall health. Raising the topic will also help to normalize attention to cognition in primary care and encourage older adults to be aware of changes in their cognition and to tell their PCP about cognition-related concerns, if any. Many older adults are reluctant to express such concerns to their PCP, in part because of fear and stigma often associated with dementia. A frank yet sensitive introduction to the topTic by the PCP is a highly appropriate first step to kickstart the cognition conversation. This approach can open the way for older adults to reveal any cognition-related concerns they may have. A 2015 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report, Cognitive Aging: Progress in Understanding and Opportunities for Action, recommends that PCPs and other health care professionals should provide patients and families with information about brain health and aging. The related four-page document, Cognitive Aging: An Action Guide for Health Care Providers (Appendix K 1), suggests five key messages that PCPs could use in providing such information (Figure K-1) (IOM, 2015a). IOM (2015b) also created a similar four-page document for older adults and their families, Cognitive Aging: An Action Guide for Individuals and Families (Appendix K 2). Figure K 1. Key Messages for Older Adults About Brain Aging The brain ages, just like other parts of the body. Cognitive aging is not a disease. It is a natural, lifelong process that occurs in every individual. Cognitive aging is different for every individual. Some cognitive functions improve with age. There are steps patients can take to protect their cognitive health. Source: Institute of Medicine, 2015a.KAER: Approaches and Tools | 19 STEP 1 : KICKSTARTAnother source that may be useful for adult patients is a website, \"Brain Health: You Can Make a Difference!\" (Appendix K 3). The website was developed by the Administration for Community Living, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Institutes of Health (2014). It provides information about brain health and aging, including a PowerPoint presentation with slides on age-related changes in memory and learning and possible risks or threats to brain health (Appendix K 4). The slides are targeted to older adults and provide brief messages about brain health and aging that PCPs could adapt as they choose to talk with their older patients. The slides are available in Spanish on the same website. There is also a brief handout that some PCPs might want to download and give to patients as a reminder of the main points. The handout is available in English (Appendix K 5) and Spanish (Appendix K 6). ASK ABOUT MEMORY AND COGNITION. PCPs can ask older adult patients whether they have concerns about their memory or cognition or have noticed changes in their memory or cognition since a previous office visit, if any, or over a specified time period. Options for wording include the following: \"Are you worried about your memory?\" \"Have you noticed a change in your memory that concerns you?\" \"During the past few months, have you had increasing problems with your memory?\" The first and second options ask about concerns the older adult may have, while the second and third options ask about changes the older adult may have noticed. Both topics are important, and PCPs may prefer to ask one question about each topic. The focus on memory in all three questions reflects the way many people speak about changes in their cognition, even though other cognitive functions, such as attention, executive function, language, and spatial orientation, can also decline in older adults. PCPs may prefer to ask about memory and at least one other cognition-related function, such as following a familiar recipe or getting lost in a familiar place. KAER: Approaches and Tools | 20 STEP 1 : KICKSTARTLISTEN FOR OLDER ADULTS' CONCERNS ABOUT MEMORY AND COGNITION. PCPs can listen for and acknowledge concerns about memory and cognition that are expressed by their older adult patients. The video, Assessing Cognition and Recommending Follow-Up shows a staged interaction in which a physician responds to a patient's very tentative expression of concern about her memory (Alzheimer's Association, n.d.-a). In a conversational tone, he acknowledges her concern and encourages her to say more about the concern. A PCP's thoughtful response to an older adult's tentatively expressed concerns about memory or cognition can help to overcome the older adult's reluctance to talk about the problem. As shown in the video, the PCP can then introduce the next step, in this case, a brief, cognitive test (Step 2 in the KAER process).KAER: Approaches and Tools | 21 STEP 1 : KICKSTARTLISTEN FOR FAMILY CONCERNS ABOUT THE OLDER ADULT'S MEMORY AND COGNITION. PCPs can listen for and acknowledge concerns expressed by family members and others about the older adult's memory and cognition. More than one-third of adults aged 65 years and older are routinely accompanied by a family member, close friend, or neighbor to PCP visits, and these older adults are, on average, older, sicker, and more likely to have dementia than older adults who are not routinely accompanied to PCP visits (Wolff & Roter, 2008). PCPs can listen for comments and concerns expressed by these individuals about the older adult's memory and cognition. In addition or instead of commenting specifically about memory and cognition, some family members and others may mention cognition-related behaviors, such as: Asking the same question over and over again. Becoming lost in familiar places. Not being able to follow directions. Getting very confused about time, people, and places. Having difficulty with self-care, nutrition, bathing, or safety (U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, 2011). Some PCPs may choose to ask family members and others who accompany older adult patients to a PCP visit whether they have noticed changes in the older adult's memory or cognition. The question can be asked simply, in the course of PCP visit. For example, the PCP can turn to the family member, friend, or neighbor and ask, \"Have you noticed changes in your relative's (or friend's) memory?\" Some family members and friends may be reluctant to talk about such changes in front of the older adult because they do not want to upset or embarrass him or her. For this reason, PCPs who choose to ask the family member, close friend, or neighbor about the older adult's cognition in the older adult's presence could begin by asking the older adult, \"Do you mind if I ask your [family member, friend, neighbor] about your memory?\" Note: Structured family questionnaires that ask the family member to respond to several specific questions about the older adult's memory, cognition, and cognition-related behaviors are shown in the next section of this toolkit (KAER Step 2).KAER: Approaches and Tools | 22 STEP 1 : KICKSTARTOBSERVE FOR SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT . Figure K-2 shows signs and symptoms that PCPs can use as triggers to identify older adults who should receive further evaluation. Figure K 2. Symptoms That Might Indicate Dementia Does the person have increased difficulty with any of the activities listed below? Positive findings in any of these areas generally indicate the need for further assessment for the presence of dementia: _____ Learning and retaining new information. For example, is more repetitive; has more trouble remembering recent conversations, events, appointments; more frequently misplaces objects. _____ Handling complex tasks For example, has more trouble following a complex train of thought, performing tasks that require many steps such as balancing a checkbook or cooking a meal. _____ Reasoning ability. For example, is unable to respond with a reasonable plan to problems at work or home, such as knowing what to do if the bathroom flooded; shows uncharacteristic disregard for rules of social conduct. _____ Spatial ability and orientation. For example, has trouble driving, organizing objects around the house, or finding his or her way around familiar places. _____ Language For example, has increasing difficulty with finding the words to express what he or she wants to say and with following conversations. _____ Behavior For example, appears more passive and less responsive; is more irritable than usual; is more suspicious than usual; misinterprets visual or auditory stimuli. Source: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 1996.KAER: Approaches and Tools | 23 STEP 1 : KICKSTARTMost of the symptoms listed in Figure K-2 refer to a change in functions and abilities (e.g., is more repetitive, has increasing difficulty). The emphasis on change reflects the core requirement for a decline in memory and other cognitive functions to justify a diagnosis of dementia. PCPs who have been caring for an older adult over a period of years may notice changes in the older adult's cognitive functions and abilities. This is not possible for a PCP who is seeing the older adult for the first time. Additional signs and symptoms that can be noticed in both new and ongoing patients include the following: The patient is a \"poor historian.\" The patient fails to appear for scheduled appointments or comes at the wrong time or on the wrong day. The patient repeatedly and apparently unintentionally fails to follow instructions, for example, changing medications. The patient defers to a family member to answer questions directed to the patient (National Chronic Care Consortium & Alzheimer's Association, 2003). Some of the signs and symptoms listed above are most likely to be noticed by the PCP, for example, \"The patient is a 'poor historian',\" that is, the patient is unable to provide accurate information about his or her health and previous medical treatment, or \"The patient repeatedly and apparently unintentionally fails to follow instructions, for example, changing medications.\" Other signs and symptoms listed above may be noticed more often by other clinical and office staff, for example, \"The patient fails to appear for scheduled appointments or comes at the wrong time or on the wrong day.\" KAER: Approaches and Tools | 24 STEP 1 : KICKSTARTADD A QUESTION ABOUT MEMORY OR COGNITION TO HEALTH RISK QUESTIONNAIRES. Many PCPs, health plans, and health care systems have a health risk assessment or other questionnaire that older adults are asked to complete either before the PCP visit or in the office before meeting with the PCP. Some of these health risk assessments and patient questionnaires include a question about memory or other cognitive functions. The American College of Physicians has a Medicare Annual Wellness Visit and Other Preventive Visits letter and check list for physicians that includes the question, \"Are you worried about your memory?\" (American College of Physicians, n.d.) (Appendix K 7). The Alzheimer's Association Medicare Detection of Cognitive Impairment Workgroup (Cordell et al., 2013) proposed another question that could be used in a health risk assessment or other patient questionnaire: \"During the past 12 months, have you experienced confusion or memory loss that is happening more often or is getting worse?\" This question has been tested and approved for use in a national survey that includes older adults (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014). PCPs, health plans, and health care systems that currently use a health risk assessment or other patient questionnaire that does not include a question about memory and/or other cognitive functions could add one of these questions to their assessment or questionnaire. A positive patient response to either question provides an easy way for PCPs to begin a conversation with the patient about cognitive changes and next steps to assess cognition.KAER: Approaches and Tools | 25 STEP 1 : KICKSTARTUSE INFORMATION ABOUT HEALTH CONDITIONS AND FUNCTIONING FROM EXISTING PATIENT RECORDS. Most PCPs, health plans, and health care systems already have information about characteristics of their older adult patients, such as age, health conditions, and functional abilities that have been found to be associated with cognitive impairment and dementia. Examples include stroke, diabetes, depressive symptoms, falls, gait disorders, and need for assistance with money management, medication administration, and activities of daily living. Some of these factors, such as stroke, are known causes of cognitive impairment. Others, such as need for assistance with medication administration, are caused by the cognitive impairment. Analyses of epidemiological and clinical data and experience indicate that information about these factors could be used as flags by PCPs, health plans, and health care systems to identify older adults who should receive a cognitive assessment and a diagnostic evaluation, if indicated (Barnes et al., 2014; Hausdorff & Buchman, 2013; Stark et al., 2013). PCPs, health plans, and health care systems with electronic health records could program in a notification to the PCP when one or a combination of the factors are present as an indicator of possible cognitive impairment (Cordell et al., 2013). PCPs could also mention one or more of these factors, for example, recent falls or need for assistance with medication administration, as a way to engage older adults and family members in a conversation about the importance of further cognitive assessment. KAER: Approaches and Tools | 26 STEP 1 : KICKSTARTCOMBINE APPROACHES. PCPs, health plans, and health care systems may decide to combine two or more of the seven approaches above to achieve the objective of detecting cognitive impairment in older adult patients. In its Dementia Warning Signs, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) (Figure K-3) combines three of these approaches: observing for signs and symptoms of cognitive impairment (approach 5), and listening for memory and cognition-related concerns that older adults and their family members may report (approaches 3 and 4). The VA states, \"Use of the Dementia Warning Signs is recommended to prompt provider evaluation of cognition. Dementia Warning Signs are a set of 'red flags' or signs/symptoms that a clinician, a caregiver, or a patient may notice\" ( U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, 2016) (Appendix K 8). Figure K 3. Dementia Warning Signs That Clinicians May Notice Is your patient: Inattentive to appearance or unkempt, inappropriately dressed for weather, or disheveled? A \"poor historian\" or forgetful? Does your patient: Fail to keep appointments or appear on the wrong day or wrong time for an appointment? Have unexplained weight loss, \"failure to thrive,\" or vague symptoms, e.g., dizziness, weakness? Repeatedly and apparently unintentionally fail to follow directions, e.g., not following through with medication changes? Defer to a caregiver or family member to answer questions? Dementia warning signs that patients and caregivers may report: Asking the same questions over and over again. Becoming lost in familiar places. Not being able to follow directions. Getting very confused about time, people, and places. Problems with self-care, nutrition, bathing, or safety.

Memory lapses may trigger fears of Alzheimer's disease or other dementia-related diseases. At a time when the older population is rapidly grow - ing in the United States, health care providers should be prepared to advise pa - tients and their families about cognitive health. There is a need for core competencies in cognitive aging for providers who see older adults, as well as more research on risk and preventive factors and po - tential interventions for cognitive aging. But there are resources available now to meet the increasing demand for information about cognitive health and ag - ing. Cognitive Aging: Progress in Understanding and Opportunities for Action, a 2015 report from the Institute of Medicine (IOM), analyzes the best available evidence to help offer guidance for providers. Key messages for patients about cognitive aging The brain ages, just like other parts of the body. The brain is responsible for \"cognition,\" a term that describes mental functions including memory, decision making, processing speed, and learning. As the brain ages, these functions may change\u2014 a process called \"cognitive aging.\" Cognitive aging is not a disease. It is not the same as Alzheimer's disease or other types of dementia. Cognitive aging is a natural, lifelong process that occurs in every individual. Cognitive aging is different for every individual. Some people may experience very few effects, while others may undergo changes that can affect cognitive abilities needed to carry out daily tasks, such as paying bills, driving, and following recipes. Some cognitive functions improve with age. Wisdom and knowledge often in- crease with age, and older adults report greater levels of happiness and satisfaction than their younger counterparts. There are steps patients can take to protect their cognitive health. Although aging is inevitable, it is possible to promote and support cognitive health and adapt to age-related changes in cognitive function.STEP 1 : APPENDIX K-13 steps patients can take to help protect their cognitive health 1Be physically active. 2Reduce cardiovascular risk factors (including hypertension, diabetes, and smoking). 3Manage medications and health conditions that could affect cognition. Other actions that may promote cognitive health include: Be socially and intellectually active, and continually seek opportunities to learn. Get adequate sleep and seek professional treatment for sleep disorders, if needed. Avoid delirium associated with hospitalization or certain medications. Visit www.nas.edu/cognitiveaging to download an action guide for individuals and families STEP 1 : APPENDIX K-1MONITORING MEDICATIONS WITH PATIENTS Older adults take an average of 14 prescription drugs per year, putting them at heightened risk for adverse drug reactions, drug-drug interactions, and drug-disease interactions. Health care professionals, particularly primary care providers, play a critical role in moni - toring medications and avoiding inappropriate use by older adults. PREVENTING DELIRIUM Delirium is a common and often preventable contributor to cognitive decline in older adults. Health care providers can play an important role in identifying patients at moderate to high risk for delirium, especially in pre-surgery, intensive care, and post-acute care settings. Common risk factors for delirium include age greater than 65 years, chronic cognitive impairment or dementia, current hip fracture, severe illness, multi-morbidity, depression, cerebrovascular disease, and alcohol abuse. Delirium prevention has emerged as a priority in the prevention of cognitive decline following major illness, hospitalization, or surgery.A complete medication review (including over-the-counter and herbal remedies) should be performed frequently, and especially during care transitions, such as post-surgery or hospital discharge. Over-the-counter medications (such as antihistamines, sedatives, and other medications that have strong anticholinergic activity), may have significant cognitive side effects, so their use should be carefully assessed.Key messages for patients about medication management Online resources for safe medication use in older adults: American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria (including public education resources) American Geriatrics Society\u2014What To Do and What to Ask Your Healthcare Provider If A Medication You Take is Listed in the Beers Criteria for Potentially Inappropriate Medications to Use in Older Adults National Institute on Aging\u2014Safe Use of Medicines National Institutes of Health Senior Health\u2014Taking Medications Safely Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2014Adults and Older Adult Adverse Drug Events Food and Drug Administration\u2014Medicines and You: A Guide for Older Adults Institute of Medicine\u2014Preventing Medication Errors: Quality Chasm SeriesSTEP 1 : APPENDIX K-1 For more resources, visit www.nas.edu/cognitiveaging McKnight Brain Research Foundation National Institute on AgingNational Institute of Neurological Disorders and StrokeAARPRetirement Research FoundationCenters for Disease Control and Prevention Study SponsorsPractice guidelines for health care professionals relevant to cognitive aging: American Psychological Association\u2014 Guidelines for the Evaluation of Dementia and Age-Related Cognitive Changes American Occupational Therapy Association\u2014Cognition, Cognitive Rehabilitation, and Occupational Performance Royal Australian College of General Practitioners\u2014Preventive Activities in Older Age American Association of Colleges of Nursing\u2014Older Adult Care Competencies American Geriatrics Society\u2014Clinical Practice Guideline for Postoperative Delirium in Older Adults American College of Surgeons\u2014Best Practices Statement for Prevention and Treatment of Postoperative Delirium Cognitive assessment procedures and tools for use by health care providers: Alzheimer's Association\u2014Recommendations for Operationalizing the Detection of Cognitive Impairment During the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit in a Primary Care Setting Alzheimer's Association\u2014Health Care Professionals' Cognitive Assessment Toolkit American Occupational Therapy Association\u2014Occupational Therapy's Role in Adult Cognitive Disorders American Psychological Association\u2014Part III.

Like other organs, the human brain changes with age in both its physi- cal structures and its ability to carry out various functions. The brain is responsible for \"cognition,\" a term that includes memory, decision mak - ing, processing speed, wisdom, and learning. As a person ages, these functions may change\u2014a process called \"cognitive aging.\" Cognitive aging is not a disease. In fact, it is a process that occurs in every individual, beginning at birth and continuing throughout the life span. There is tremendous variability in how people's cognition changes as they age. Some older adults may experience very few effects from cognitive aging, while in others the effects may be more pronounced. Furthermore, an individual's cognitive function may vary from one day to another. Aging can affect the cognitive abilities needed to perform daily tasks, such as paying bills, driving, following recipes, and adhering to medica - tion schedules. It can challenge an older person's ability to live indepen- dently, pursue favorite activities, and maintain a sense of identity. As a result, some older adults are reluctant to tell loved ones or care provid - ers when they experience change in their cognitive function. But there are actions individuals and their families can take to support and promote their cognitive health and to adapt to age-related cogni - tive changes. It is important to overcome stigma and misconceptions that might prevent older adults from seeking resources that can help promote their cognitive health and overall quality of life. ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE COGNITIVE AGING Chronic neurodegenerative disease Part of aging Extensive neuron lossNeuron number remains relatively sta- ble, but neuronal function may decline Affects approximately 10 percent of older AmericansOccurs in everyone, but the extent and nature of changes varies widely Declines are often severe and progressive Changes are variable and gradualCognitive aging is not the same as Alzheimer's disease.STEP 1 : APPENDIX K-2MISCONCEPTION FACT Maintaining cognitive health means preserving your memory.Cognitive health is far more than having a good memory. It also involves decision making, attention, and problem solving. Cognitive function always declines with age.Aging can have both positive and negative effects on cognition. Wisdom and expertise can increase with age. Older adults experience fewer negative emotions, such as anger and worry, than people in young adulthood and middle age, and they report feeling greater satisfaction with life in general. There's nothing you can do to improve your cognitive health. There are actions individuals and fami-lies can take to help support their cogni-tive health and adapt to age-related cognitive changes. See the next page for more information. Brain neurons die as you age, so there is no way to prevent cognitive decline.In the absence of disease, neuron death is minimal. There are a number of actions you can take to support your cognitive health.Know the facts about cognitive aging RESOURCES RELATED TO OLDER ADULT DRIVING Safe driving relies on many elements of cognition, such as processing speed, decision making, multitasking, and memory. All of these functions can decline with age. Deciding whether to limit driving or stop altogether can be a difficult decision for older adults and their families because it can affect self-esteem and the ability to live independently. However, there are many resources to help older adults drive safely or determine when it might be necessary to limit driving. For example, the American Automobile Association offers a defensive driving course called RoadWise Drive. The California Department of Motor Vehicles provides a 15-question online self-assessment to help older drivers and their families determine whether they are driving safely, and other states and organizations offer similar opportunities for assessment, as well as resources for decision making. Visit www.nas.edu/cognitiveaging to access a list of online resources about older adult driving.STEP 1 : APPENDIX K-2The top 3 actions you can take to help protect your cognitive health as you age 31Be physically active. Staying physically active can promote cognitive health in middle-aged and older adults. 2Reduce your cardiovascular risk factors (including hypertension, diabetes, and smoking). Maintaining cardiovascular health supports cognitive health. Manage your medications. A number of medications can have a negative effect on cognitive function when used alone or in combination with other medications. The effects can be temporary or long-term. It's important to review all of your medications with a health care professional and learn about their effects on cognitive health. Other actions that may promote cognitive health Be socially and intellectually active, and continually seek opportunities to learn. Get adequate sleep and seek professional treatment for sleep disorders, if needed. Talk to your health care provider to learn more about preventing delirium (a decline in cognitive function that can be associated with some medications and hospitalization). STEP 1 : APPENDIX K-2RESOURCES RELATED TO COGNITIVE AGING AND FINANCIAL DECISION MAKING Age-related declines in cognitive function may make older adults vulnerable to financial fraud or abuse at a time when significant financial decisions need to be made, such as planning for retirement. In 2010 alone, victims of elder financial abuse lost an estimated $2.9 billion, which includes loss of money and goods to legitimate businesses, scams, family, and friends and indirectly through medical insurance fraud. According to the National Council on Aging, the top 10 financial scams targeting older adults include tele - marketing, Internet scams, and sales of anti-aging products. Fortunately, there are many resources available to raise awareness and help older adults, their families, and financial advisers avoid abuse and make sound financial decisions, including AARP's \"Scam Jams\" and \"Fraud Watch Network,\" the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's Office of Financial Protection for Older Americans, and the Federal Trade Commission's \"Pass It On\" financial fraud awareness campaign.

Th e \"Welcome to Medicare\" exam occurs only once during your first twelve months as a Me dicare patient. You may receive your Annual Wellness Visit after you have been with Medicare for more than one year, or it has been at least one year since your \"Welco me to Medicare\" exam. Initial Preventive Physical Exam (IPPE) \"Welcome to Medicare\" is only for new Medicare patients. This must be done in the 1st year as a Medicare patient. Annual Wellness Visit, Initial At least 1 yr after the \"Welcome to Medicare\" exam. Annual Wellness Visit, SubsequentOnce a year (more than 1 yr + 1 da y after the last Wellness Visit). The Annual Wellness Visit is not the same th ing as what many people often refer to as their yearly physical exam. Me dicare is very specific about what the \"Annual Wellness Visit\" includes and excludes. At the Annual Wellness Visit, your doctor w ill talk to you about your medical history, review your risk factors, and make a personalized prevention pl an to keep you healthy. The visit does not include a hands-on exam or any testi ng that your doctor may recommend, nor does it include any discussion about any new or current medical problems, conditions, or medications. You may sc hedule another visit to address those issues or your doctor may charge the usual Medicare fees for such services that are beyond the scope of the Annual Wellness Visit. If you would like to schedule an annual phys ical, including any lab work or other diagnostic testing, medication management, vacci nations, and other services, please understand that these services will be charged and covered according to Medicare's usual coverage guidelines. However, you may s till develop a care plan base d on the Annual Wellness Visit criteria. We appreciate the trust you put in us to take care of your health care needs and hope that you will take advantage of this new benefit to work with your physician in creating your personalized prevention plan. See the attached list to bring with you to your appointment.

IB 10-412 P96482 November 2016 Why use Cognitive Impairment Warning Signs? Supports patient -centered care and Veteran -to-provider communication. Provides an opportunity for clinicians to initiate a conversation with the patient and/or the family. How are Cognitive Impairment Warning Signs used in clinical care? The appropriate use of Cognitive Impairment Warning Signs will prompt a structured assessment of cognition and diagnostic evaluation for cognitive impairment within primary care. Next steps if warning signs are present Focused history from patient and caregiver and review of systems emphasizing: - Onset and course of cognitive signs and symptoms; - History of head trauma, psychiatric disorders, history of atherosclerotic vascular disease and vascular risk factors; - Family and social history including drug and alcohol use; - Medication review; - Safety and functional status, driving and firearm use, history of falls; - Symptoms of delirium. Focused physical exam emphasizing the cardiovascular system; neurologic exam including mental status exam; and objective cognitive testing. Standard laboratory testing including thyroid stimulating hormone, complete blood count; electrolytes and calcium, hepatic -panel, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, vitamin B12, and Human Immunodeficiency Virus testing with documented verbal consent. Advanced diagnostic testing, neuropsychological evaluation or brain imaging may be warranted when indicated by history and physical exam or for complex cases. Keep in mind: Warning signs, by themselves, are not diagnostic of cognitive impairment but simply suggest that further evaluation is warranted. Brief, structured cognitive assessments alone are not sufficient to diagnose cognitive impairment but are an important part of the diagnostic evaluation. Delirium and depression may present with similar symptoms as cognitive impairment and need to be considered before a diagnosis of cognitive impairment is made. Sensory impairment, adverse drug events, or concurrent psychiatric or metabolic illnesses may also be mistaken for cognitive impairment.

Appendices 68 KAER: Approaches and Tools | 52 STEP 2 : ASSESS OVERVIEW In its 2015 report, the GSA Workgroup on Cognitive Impairment Detection and Earlier Diagnosis recommends that: PCPs should routinely use a brief cognitive test and other structured assessment instruments to detect cognitive impairment (GSA, 2015). If a brief cognitive test is used, results of the test should be documented in the older adult's medical record. The specific cognitive test used and the person's score should also be documented. If a brief cognitive test is not used, PCPs should note why; for example, the test was not offered, or the older adult refused to take it (GSA, 2015). The objective of using a brief cognitive test and other structured assessment instruments is to determine whether older adult patients should have a diagnostic evaluation (KAER Step 3). As noted in the previous section on KAER Step 1, PCPs, health plans, and health care systems can use various tools and approaches to achieve this objective including the following: Use one or more of the approaches in KAER Step 1 to detect signs and symptoms of cognitive impairment and then recommend that older adults with such signs and symptoms receive a brief cognitive test and other structured assessments (KAER Step 2). Based on results of the brief cognitive test and other structured assessments, PCPs could then conduct or refer older adults with cognitive impairment for a diagnostic evaluation (KAER Step 3). Use one or more of the approaches in KAER Step 1 to detect signs and symptoms of cognitive impairment and then conduct or refer older adults with such signs and symptoms for a diagnostic evaluation, thus skipping KAER Step 2. Use a brief cognitive test and other structured assessment instruments (KAER Step 2) to determine which older adults should receive or be referred for a diagnostic evaluation, thus skipping KAER Step 1.KAER: Approaches and Tools | 53 STEP 2 : ASSESS In addition to brief cognitive tests for the older adult, this section presents and discusses two other types of structured assessment instruments to detect cognitive impairment: brief informant questionnaires to obtain family members' perceptions about the older adult's cognition; and brief self-report questionnaires to obtain the older adult's perceptions about his or her own cognition. All three types of assessment instruments can be used in any PCP visit, including initial and subsequent Annual Wellness Visits. It is important to emphasize that that there is no \"gold standard\" single test for the detection of cognitive impairment, and no brief cognitive test is diagnostic. Use of these tests is instead intended to assist PCPs in identifying older adults with cognitive impairment who should receive a diagnostic evaluation. KAER: Approaches and Tools | 54 STEP 2 : ASSESS APPROACHES USE A BRIEF COGNITIVE TEST TO DETECT COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT . Brief cognitive tests administered to older adult patients can help PCPs detect cognitive impairment in order to determine which patients should receive a diagnostic evaluation. The GSA Workgroup selected three brief cognitive tests for inclusion in this toolkit: the Mini-Cog, the General Practitioner Assessment of Cognition (GPCOG), and the Memory Impairment Screen. Each of these tests is shown in this section of the toolkit along with instructions for scoring. To select the brief cognitive tests for inclusion in the toolkit, the GSA Workgroup reviewed the recommendations of two other workgroups that were formed to identify brief cognitive tests for use in Annual Wellness Visits. The National Institute on Aging (NIA) formed one of the other workgroups at the request of the U.S Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). The NIA Workgroup solicited input from other federal agencies, assessment experts, clinicians, and others, and developed criteria for selecting instruments to detect cognitive impairment in the primary care setting. The criteria required that the selected instruments must meet all of the following conditions: Take 5 minutes or less to administer. Be free of charge with simple access. Apply to the Medicare population and be designed to assess age-related cognitive impairment. Assess memory and at least one other cognitive function. Have been validated in a U.S. community-based sample or primary care settings and used in the United States after validation, between 2001 and 2011. The NIA Workgroup identified seven brief cognitive tests that met these criteria out of more than 130 assessment instruments studied.KAER: Approaches and Tools | 55 STEP 2 : ASSESS Concurrent with the NIA Workgroup activities, the Alzheimer's Association convened an expert workgroup to provide guidance for PCPs about cognitive assessment during Annual Wellness Visits (Cordell et al., 2013). The Alzheimer's Association Workgroup reviewed the findings of six systematic reviews of brief cognitive tests and selected three brief cognitive tests as most suitable for routine use in primary care setting. The three tests have the following attributes: require 5 minutes or less to administer; have been validated in a community or primary care setting; have good to excellent psychometric properties; can be used in a clinical setting without payment for copyrights; are easy to administer by medical staff members who are not physicians; and are relatively free from education, language, and cultural bias. Both the NIA and Alzheimer's Association Workgroups identified the Mini-Cog as meeting their criteria. For that reason, the GSA Workgroup decided to include the Mini-Cog (Appendix A 1) in this toolkit. The GSA Workgroup also decided to include the two other brief cognitive tests recommended by the Alzheimer's Association Workgroup: the GPCOG (Appendix A 2) and the Memory Impairment Screen (Appendix A 3). PCPs, health plans, and health care systems could select any one of the three brief cognitive tests for routine use in their primary care practices: The Mini-Cog asks the older adult to learn and later recall three words and to draw a clock with the hands set at 11:10. The GPCOG asks the older adult to learn and later recall a name and address, to give the current date, to name something that happened in the news recently, and to draw a clock with the hands set at 11:10. The Memory Impairment Screen asks the older adult to learn four words and a category related to each word, for example, the word \"checkers\" and the category \"game.\" The older adult is then distracted with other activities for a few minutes and subsequently asked to recall four words. If he or she cannot recall a word, the category is given as a clue, and the older adult is again asked to recall the word.KAER: Approaches and Tools | 56 STEP 2 : ASSESS As discussed earlier, there is considerable disagreement about the best approach to detect cognitive impairment in older adults, with some clinician experts favoring routine use of a brief cognitive test and other clinician experts favoring use of signs and symptoms of cognitive impairment to identify older adults who should receive further cognitive assessment and a diagnostic evaluation, if indicated. Among clinician experts who favor the use of a brief cognitive test, there is also disagreement about the patient age at which use of a brief cognitive test should begin. Starting ages that are often proposed include 60, 65, 70, 75, and 80 years of age. Disagreement about the patient age at which use of a brief cognitive test should begin reflects, on the one hand, a belief that cognition should be considered one of the important vital signs that should be measured routinely in all older adults, starting at age 60 or 65 years. Clinician experts who favor a later starting age point out, however, that asking PCPs to use a brief cognitive test in their patients aged 60 to 74 years, when cognitive impairment and dementia are much less common than in older age groups, will result in apparently unnecessary time spent by busy PCPs and perhaps increased resistance to the routine use of these tests for older adults of any age. PCPs, health plans, and health care systems that choose to use a brief cognitive test to detect cognitive impairment in their older adult patients will have to weigh these different perspectives to select the age at which the test will be routinely used. In addition to the Mini-Cog , the NIA Workgroup identified six other brief cognitive tests that take 5 minutes or less to administer and meet all criteria established by the workgroup: the Brief Alzheimer's Screen, the Mental Status Questionnaire, the Short Blessed Test, the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire, the Six-Item Screener, and the Short Test of Mental Status. Information about these six brief cognitive tests is available in a searchable, online database created by NIA (2012). More than 100 other assessment instruments identified by the NIA Workgroup are also shown in the searchable database. These additional assessment instruments include cognitive tests that take longer than 5 minutes to administer, structured questionnaires to obtain family members' perceptions about the older adult's cognition, and structured questionnaires to obtain the older adult's perceptions about his or her own cognition.KAER: Approaches and Tools | 57 STEP 2 : ASSESS The NIA has published two documents about detecting cognitive impairment in older adults that may be useful for PCPs, health plans, and health care systems. A 2014 NIA document, Assessing Cognitive Impairment in Older Patients: A Quick Guide for Primary Care Physicians, discusses why it is important to assess cognitive impairment in older adults, when use of a brief cognitive test is indicated, and how cognitive impairment is evaluated (NIA Alzheimer's Disease Education and Referral Center, 2014) (Appendix A 4). The NIA has also added a new section to its clinician handbook, Talking with Your Older Patient. The new section, \"Talking with Patients about Cognitive Problems,\" discusses cognitive impairment in older adults, deciding when to use a brief cognitive test, and how to conduct the test (NIA, 2016b). PCPs, health plans, and health care systems that do not currently use a brief cognitive test with their older adult patients could consider the three brief cognitive tests shown in this toolkit and decide whether one of the tests would fit well with their existing primary care structure, organization, and procedures. Alternatively, they could consider the other brief cognitive tests that are included in the NIA searchable database (NIA, 2012). KAER: Approaches and Tools | 58 STEP 2 : ASSESS NonPCP Primary Care Office Staff Can Help With Detection of Cognitive Impairment in Older Adult Patients Trained, non-PCP primary care office staff can use many of the approaches and tools discussed thus far in this toolkit to assist PCPs in detecting cognitive impairment in their older adult patients. For example, trained non-PCP staff can ask older adult patients whether they have noticed changes in their memory; they can be alert for the signs and symptoms discussed in the previous section on KAER Step 1; and they can administer and score brief cognitive tests. Findings from these activities can then be given to the PCP who will decide whether patients should receive further cognitive assessment or a diagnostic evaluation. The Rural Older Adult Memory (ROAM) study tested the feasibility of using non-PCP medical assistants to help in the detection of cognitive impairment in adults aged 75 years and older in rural, primary care health clinics in Oregon (Boise et al., 2010). As shown in Figure A 1, the assessment used in the ROAM study included two of the approaches listed in KAER Step 1 (a question for the older adult patient about whether he or she has noticed a change in memory that concerns him or her and a similar question for a family member or other person who accompanied the person to the primary care visit). The assessment also included a brief cognitive test, asking the older adult to learn and later recall three words. Non-PCP medical assistants were trained to ask the questions, conduct the test, enter the results on a brief form, and place the form on the charts of patients whose scores indicated cognitive impairment. Before placing the form on the patient's chart, the medical assistants also checked a box on the form to indicate whether they personally had concerns about the patient's memory.KAER: Approaches and Tools | 59 STEP 2 : ASSESS Figure A 1. ROAM Assessment Process Using NonPCP Medical Assistants Question 1: The medical assistant asks the patient: \"Our clinicians are asking us to do a memory assessment on all of our patients aged 75 and older. Is there a family member or companion here with you who can participate in the beginning of the visit when we do this assessment so that I can ask him/her some questions about your memory?\" Question 2: The medical assistant asks the patient: \"Have you noticed a change in your memory that concerns you?\" If the patient asks for clarification, the medical assistant uses these examples: \"For example, have you had problems remembering things that you used to be able to remember, like appointments and family occasions, or problems taking medications according to instructions? Have you had problems with tasks, such as writing checks or paying bills?\" Question 3: If someone is with the patient, the medical assistant asks that person, \"Have you noticed a change in [patient's name] memory that concerns you?\" If the person asks for clarification, the medical assistant uses these examples: \"For example, has he/she had problems repeating him/herself, or remembering things that he/she used to be able to remember, like appointments and family occasions, or problems taking medications according to instructions? Has he/she had problems with tasks such as writing checks or paying bills?\" Memory Test: Before doing vital signs and asking the patient about the reason for the PCP visit, the medical assistant asks: \"As part of the memory assessment, I'm going to ask you to remember three words. T hen after a few minutes, I'm going to ask you to tell me those words. The words are PONY, QUARTER, ORANGE. Please repeat these for me now.\" Question 4: After doing vital signs and asking the patient about the reason for the PCP visit, the medical assistant asks: \"Can you tell me what those three words were that I asked you to remember?\" Question 5: The medical assistant notes his or her own concerns related to the patient's memory or confusion based on either the clinic visit, communication with the patient or family members, or other interactions. Scoring questions 2, 3, and 4 and attaching the form to the patient's chart: If the patient remembered none or one item on question 4, OR if answers to questions 2 and/or 3 are \"yes,\" OR if the patient refused to answer, the medical assistant attaches the results to the patient's chart for review by the PCP. Source: Boise et al., 2010.KAER: Approaches and Tools | 60 STEP 2 : ASSESS Of 427 older adult patients who were given the assessment, 46% had scores that indicated cognitive impairment (Boise et al., 2010). Surveys of patients who participated in the study show that a very high proportion said they had no concerns about or were pleased to have their memory evaluated. Medical assistants reported that the process was easy to incorporate in their work routine, and PCPs rated the project as moderately or highly successful in increasing the identification of cognitive impairment. Interestingly, medical assistants' expressed concerns about patients' memory or confusion were much more strongly associated with PCPs' decisions about whether a patient should receive further cognitive evaluation than either the concerns of the patient or family member about change in the patient's memory or the patient's performance on the three-word recall test. Specifically, PCPs scheduled further cognitive evaluation for 77% of the patients about whom medical assistants expressed concerns, compared with only 37% of the patients who expressed concerns about their own memory, 43% of the patients whose family members expressed concerns about the patient's memory, and 39% of patients whose score on the three-word recall test indicated cognitive impairment. KAER: Approaches and Tools | 61 STEP 2 : ASSESS USE A BRIEF FAMILY QUESTIONNAIRE TO OBTAIN FAMILY MEMBERS' PERCEPTIONS OF THE OLDER ADULT'S COGNITION. Use of a brief, structured family questionnaire can help PCPs obtain the perceptions of a family member or other informant about changes in the older adult's memory, other cognitive functions, and cognition-related behaviors. Three validated family questionnaires along with instructions for scoring are shown in this toolkit: AD8 Informant Interview (Appendix A 5) GPCOG Informant Interview (Appendix A 6) Short Form Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (Short IQCODE) (Appendix A 7) Each of these questionnaires can be completed in a few minutes by most family members. All three questionnaires focus on change. As noted earlier, the focus on change reflects the core requirement for a decline in memory and other cognitive functions to justify a diagnosis of dementia. Research findings and clinician experience indicate that family members are often able to report changes and decline in an older adult's cognition accurately and may be more likely to notice the changes than PCPs or other primary care office staff who have not known the older adult for as long.The three questionnaires ask the family member or informant to think about changes that have occurred over a considerable time period, ranging from \"several years\" for the AD8, to 5 to 10 years for the GPCOG Informant Interview, and 10 years for the IQCODE. The three questionnaires also differ somewhat in the number and specific questions asked and the response options given: The AD8 includes 8 questions and 3 response categories: yes, a change; no, no change; and not applicable or don't know. The GPCOG Informant Interview includes 6 questions and 4 response categories: yes; no; don't know; and not applicable. The Short IQCODE includes 16 questions and 5 response categories: much improved; a bit improved; not much change; a bit worse; and much worse.KAER: Approaches and Tools | 62 STEP 2 : ASSESS PCPs, health plans, and health care systems that do not currently use a brief family questionnaire to help detect cognitive impairment in their older adult patients could decide to use any one of the three questionnaires. Additional family questionnaires that are intended to obtain family members' perceptions of older adults' cognition can be found in the NIA searchable database previously described (NIA, 2012). The Alzheimer's Association Medicare Detection of Cognitive Impairment Workgroup created an algorithm that illustrates the recommended process for detecting cognitive impairment in older adults (Cordell et al. 2013) (Appendix A 8). The algorithm starts with recognition of signs and symptoms of cognitive impairment using approaches and tools that were discussed in the previous section on KAER Step 1. It then shows use of one of the three brief cognitive tests and one of the three family questionnaires discussed thus far in this section on KAER Step 2. The algorithm ends with the provision or referral for a diagnostic evaluation for dementia (KAER Step 3). It is important to note that the brief family questionnaires discussed in this section differ from another kind of family questionnaire that is used after the older adult's cognitive impairment has been detected and more often, after dementia has been diagnosed. That kind of family questionnaire is intended to identify the needs and resources of family caregivers in order to provide information and services that will help them with caregiving tasks and reduce negative impacts that are often associated with caregiving. KAER: Approaches and Tools | 63 STEP 2 : ASSESS USE A BRIEF SELF-REPORT QUESTIONNAIRE TO OBTAIN OLDER ADULTS' PERCEPTIONS OF THEIR OWN COGNITION. Brief self-report questionnaires that ask older adults about changes in their own cognition are seldom used in primary care. This is at least in part because of a widespread perception that older adults with cognitive impairment often do not or cannot report accurately about their cognition because of denial and/or reduced awareness and insight that is often associated with cognitive impairment and dementia. Low current use of brief, self-report questionnaires about cognition in primary care may also reflect greater PCP confidence in the results of brief cognitive tests that measure cognition directly. In addition, some PCPs may not be familiar with brief self- report questionnaires intended to obtain older adults' perceptions of their own cognition. Three brief self-report questionnaires are included in this toolkit. Two of the self-report questionnaires, the AD8 (Appendix A 5) and the Short IQCODE (Appendix A 7), use the same questions as the two family questionnaires with the same names that were discussed earlier in this section, but the questions are asked of the older adult, not the family member. Both of these self-report questionnaires have been tested in primary care contexts and found to be useful, particularly in people with mild cognitive impairment. The third self-report questionnaire Know the 10 Signs was developed by the Alzheimer's Association (2009) (Appendix A 9). Any of these self-report questionnaires could be used in any primary care visit, including initial and subsequent Annual Wellness Visits. The questionnaires can be given to older adult patients to complete in the primary care waiting room or given or mailed to older adult patients to complete at home and bring with them to their next primary care visit. As previously noted, there is a widespread perception that older adults with cognitive impairment often do not or cannot report accurately about their cognition because of denial and/or reduced awareness and insight that is often associated with cognitive impairment and dementia. A recent IOM report (2015c) discusses the validity of older adults' self-reports of cognitive impairment, based on studies that compare older adults' reports of memory problems, often referred to as \"subjective memory complaints,\" and the older adults' cognitive status as measured with objective cognitive tests. Some of these studies have found that older adults' reports of memory problems are often associated with depression, other psychological distress, and personality characteristics such as conscientiousness and neuroticism, rather than with objectively measured cognitive impairment. Other, more recent, longitudinal studies have found that older adults' reports of memory problems are often associated with real cognitive impairment and may predict future cognitive decline (IOM, 2015c). One expert in mild cognitive KAER: Approaches and Tools | 64 STEP 2 : ASSESS impairment and dementia told the IOM committee that subjective memory complaints may represent very early awareness of changes in cognition that are too subtle to detect with objective cognitive tests (Petersen, 2014). The IOM report notes that most studies that include older adults with various levels of cognitive impairment have found a stronger association between self-reported memory complaints and objectively measured cognitive status in older adults with no or very mild cognitive impairment than in older adults with moderate or severe cognitive impairment (IOM, 2015c). Likewise, studies that include older adults with depressive symptoms have generally found a stronger association between subjective memory complaints and objectively measured cognitive status in older adults with fewer depressive symptoms than in older adults with more depressive symptoms. In addition, one study of more than 17,000 women ages 70 to 81 years old found that women who had many subjective memory complaints were more likely than women with fewer subjective memory complaints to have objectively measured cognitive impairment (Amariglio et al., 2011). Clearly, awareness of memory and other cognitive problems varies greatly among older adults who have cognitive impairment. The studies cited in the IOM report suggest that self-report questionnaires for older adults are likely to be most accurate and therefore most useful for PCPs when the questionnaires are used with older adults who express concerns about their memory or have other signs and symptoms that indicate mild cognitive impairment.KAER: Approaches and Tools | 65 STEP 2 : ASSESS AD8 Self Rating Questionnaire The AD8 Self-Rating Questionnaire (Appendix A 5) uses the same 8 questions as the AD8 Informant Questionnaire discussed earlier in this section and the same 3 response categories: yes, a change; no, no change; and not applicable or don't know. Instructions for use of the self-rating questionnaire say that the older adult should be asked to rate changes in his or her ability for each of the items, without attributing causality. The AD8 developers point out that the Self-Rating Questionnaire may be better than other self-report questionnaires at capturing self- reported symptoms of cognitive decline for three reasons (Galvin et al., 2007): The AD8 questions are neutral in tone and present everyday functional activities in a nonthreatening fashion. Individuals are not asked to offer complaints but simply to rate whether a change in their ability to complete the tasks has occurred. The AD8 questions do not attribute cause to any change in ability, so the AD8 is less likely to provoke anxiety about whether change is due to aging or disease in the respondent. A study of the AD8 conducted in 325 dyads of older adults and informants (mainly spouses and adult children) found that the older adults' self-ratings were correlated with their scores on objective cognitive tests, but these correlations were weaker than correlations between informant ratings and the older adults' scores on objective cognitive tests (Galvin et al., 2007). The researchers conclude that informant ratings are generally more accurate in detecting subtle signs of cognitive decline in older adults, but AD8 self-ratings by older adults provide useful information about older adults' cognitive ability and are especially valuable for increasing understanding about an older adult's perceptions about change in his or her own cognition. They emphasize that the AD8 Self-Rating Questionnaire is most useful for older adults with mild cognitive impairment and older adults for whom there is no available informant (Galvin et al., 2007).KAER: Approaches and Tools | 66 STEP 2 : ASSESS Short IQCODE Self Report Questionnaire The Short IQCODE Self-Report Questionnaire (IQCODE-SR) (Appendix A 7) uses the same 16 questions as the Short IQCODE Informant Questionnaire discussed earlier in this section and the same 5 response categories: much improved, a bit improved, not much change, a bit worse, and much worse. Jansen and coworkers (2008) used the 16-item IQCODE-SR to improve detection of cognitive impairment in older adult patients of a large primary care practice in the Netherlands. The questionnaire was mailed to 4,823 community-dwelling adults aged 75 years and older. The older adults were asked to complete the questionnaire with or without assistance and to return it by mail, indicating whether they had received assistance. Those who returned the questionnaire and scored above a preset score were considered at high risk for cognitive impairment. Of the 4,823 older adults who were mailed an IQCODE-SR questionnaire, 59% (2,841 individuals) returned it, and approximately one-third of those (915 individuals) reported having received help to complete it. Of the 2,841 individuals who returned the questionnaire, 16% (451 individuals) scored above the preset score indicating high risk for cognitive impairment. The individuals were, on average, older, had more impairments in activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), and were more likely to have had assistance in completing the questionnaire than individuals who scored below the preset score indicating high risk for cognitive impairment (Jansen et al., 2008). Based on these findings, the researchers conclude that the mailed IQCODE-SR was successful in identifying older adult patients at high risk for cognitive impairment who should receive further cognitive assessment (Jansen et al., 2008). At the same time, they acknowledge that the questionnaire was not completed by 41% of the sample, many of whom undoubtedly also had high risk for cognitive impairment. Moreover, some older adults who completed the questionnaire but lacked insight about their cognitive impairment were probably counted wrongly as not having high risk for cognitive impairment. It is likely that use of the IQCODE- SR in the primary care office would have resulted in a much higher proportion of completed questionnaires and perhaps fewer instances in which older adults who lacked insight about their cognitive impairment were not identified as high risk. Using the IQCODE-SR in the primary care office would have delayed identification of cognitive impairment, however, since older adults would be offered the questionnaire only if they came in for a primary care visit. Using the questionnaire in the office probably would also have required more staff time than using the mailed questionnaire.KAER: Approaches and Tools | 67 STEP 2 : ASSESS Know the 10 Signs The Alzheimer's Association's Know the 10 Signs (Appendix A 9) questionnaire is a checklist based on the Association's widely publicized \"Ten Warning Signs of Alzheimer's.\" For each warning sign, the checklist provides a two- or three-sentence description and an example of \"What's typical,\" that is, what would not count as a warning sign. Individuals are encouraged to check off each warning sign about which they have concerns and to take the checklist to their next doctor visit. The Know the 10 Signs questionnaire is available online to older adults and their families. The GSA Workgroup is not aware of PCPs who are currently using the questionnaire to learn about their older patients' perceptions of their own cognition. Such use would be possible, however. The concepts and words used in the questionnaire are not simple; thus, this questionnaire would probably be most appropriate for older adult patients who express concerns about their memory or other cognitive abilities but are likely to have very mild, if any, cognitive impairment. Some PCPs, health plans, and health care systems may decide to offer the questionnaire to such patients in response to the patients' expressed concerns.

Please say them for me now.\" If the person is unable to repeat the words after three attempts, move on to Step 2 (clock drawing). The following and other word lists have been used in one or more clinical studies. 1-3 For repeated administrations, use of an alternative word list is recommended. Say: \"Next, I want you to draw a clock for me. First, put in all of the numbers where they go.\" When that is completed, say: \"Now, set the hands to 10 past 11.\" Use preprinted circle (see next page) for this exercise. Repeat instructions as needed as this is not a memory test. Move to Step 3 if the clock is not complete within three minutes. Ask the person to recall the three words you stated in Step 1.

A cut point of <3 on the Mini-Cog has been validated for dementia screening, but many individuals with clinically meaningful cognitive impairment will score higher. When greater sensitivity is desired, a cut point of <4 is recommended as it may indicate a need for further evaluation of cognitive status. Mini-Cog \u00a9 S. Borson. All rights reserved.

With this information, you can identify emerging cognitive deficits and possible causes, following up with treatment for what may be a reversible health condition. Or , if Alzheimer's disease or another dementia is found, you can help patients and their caregivers prepare for the future. Brief, nonproprietary risk assessment and screening tools are available. 2 This quick guide addresses: Why is it important to assess cognitive impairment in older adults? When is screening indicated? How can physicians and staff find time for screening? How is cognitive impairment evaluated? Why is it important to assess cognitive impairment in older adults? Cognitive impairment in older adults has a variety of possible causes, including medication side effects, metabolic and/or endocrine derangements, delirium due to intercurrent illness, depression, and dementia, with Alzheimer's dementia being most common. Some causes, like medication side effects and depression, can be reversed with treatment. Others, such as Alzheimer's disease, cannot be reversed, but symptoms can be treated for a period of time and families can be prepared for predictable changes. Many people who are developing or have dementia do not receive a diagnosis. One study showed that physicians were unaware of cognitive impairment in more than 40 percent of their cognitively impaired patients.3 Another study found that more than half of patients with dementia had not received a clinical cognitive evaluation by a physician.17 The failure to evaluate memory or cognitive complaints is likely to hinder treatment of underlying disease and comorbid conditions, and may present safety issues for the patient and others. 4,5 In many cases, the cognitive problem will worsen over time.2,4,6 Alzheimer's Disease Education and Referral CenterSTEP 2 : APPENDIX A-4Benefits of Early Screening If screening is negative: Concerns may be alleviated, at least at that point in time. If screening is positive and further evaluation is warranted : The patient and physician can take the next step of identifying the cause of impairment (for example, medication side effects, metabolic and/or endocrine imbalance, delirium, depression, Alzheimer's disease). This may result in: yTreating the underlying disease or health condition yManaging comorbid conditions more effectively yAverting or addressing potential safety issues yAllowing the patient to create or update advance directives and plan long-term care yEnsuring the patient has a caregiver or someone to help with medical, legal, and financial concerns yEnsuring the caregiver receives appropriate information and referrals yEncouraging participation in clinical research Most patients with memory, other cognitive, or behavior complaints want a diagnosis to understand the nature of their problem and what to expect.6-10 Some patients (or families) are reluctant to mention such complaints because they fear a diagnosis of dementia and the future it portends. In these cases, a primary care provider can explain the benefits of finding out what may be causing the patient's health concerns. Pharmacological treatment options for Alzheimer's-related memory loss and other cognitive symptoms are limited, and none can stop or reverse the course of the disease. However , assessing cognitive impairment and identifying its cause, particularly at an early stage, offers several benefits. When is screening indicated? The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, in its recent review and recommendation regarding routine screening for cognitive impairment, noted that \"although the overall evidence on routine screening is insufficient, clinicians should remain alert to early signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment (for example, problems with memory or language) and evaluate as appropriate.\"11 The Dementia Screening Indicator (http://bit.ly/1pxk5rI) can help guide clinician decisions about when it may be appropriate to screen for cognitive impairment in the primary care setting.12 How can physicians and their staff find time for screening? Trained staff using readily available screening tools need only 10 minutes or less to initially assess a patient for cognitive impairment. While screening results alone are insufficient to diagnose dementia, they are an important first step. The AD8 and Mini-Cog are among many possible tools. For a searchable database that describes instruments to detect cognitive impairment in older adults, see www.nia.nih.gov/research/cognitive-instrument . 2STEP 2 : APPENDIX A-4Assessment for cognitive impairment can be performed at any visit but is now a required component of the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit (http://go.cms.gov/1E9Mlub) .4,13 Coverage for wellness and, importantly, for follow-up visits is available to any patient who has had Medicare Part B coverage for at least 12 months. How is cognitive impairment evaluated? Positive screening results warrant further evaluation. A combination of cognitive testing and information from a person who has frequent contact with the patient, such as a spouse or other care provider, is the best way to more fully assess cognitive impairment. 14 A primary care provider may conduct an evaluation or refer to a specialist such as a geriatrician, neurologist, geriatric psychiatrist, or neuropsychologist. If available, a local memory disorders clinic or Alzheimer's Disease Center (www.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers/ alzheimers-disease-research-centers ) may also accept referrals. Genetic testing, neuroimaging, and biomarker testing are not generally recommended for clinical use at this time. 2,15 These tests are primarily conducted in research settings. Interviews to assess memory, behavior, mood, and functional status (especially complex actions such as driving and managing money16) are best conducted with the patient alone, so that family members or companions cannot prompt the patient. Information can also be gleaned from the patient's behavior on arrival in the doctor's office and interactions with staff. Note that patients who are only mildly impaired may be adept at covering up their cognitive deficits and reluctant to address the problem. Family members or close companions can also be good sources of information. Inviting them to speak privately may allow for a more candid discussion. Per HIP AA regulations, the patient should give permission in advance. An alternative would be to invite the family member or close companion to be in the examining room during the patient's interview and contribute additional information after the patient has spoken. Brief, easy-to-administer informant screening tools, such as the short IQCODE or the AD8, are available. Points to Remember Patients should be screened for cognitive impairment if: ythe person, family members, or others express concerns about changes in his or her memory or thinking, or yyou observe problems/changes in the patient's memory or thinking, or ythe patient is age 80 or older. Other risk factors that could indicate the need for cognitive-impairment screening include: low education, history of type 2 diabetes, stroke, depression, and trouble managing money or medications. Instruments for brief screening are available and can be used in an office visit. Patients, particularly those who express a concern, likely want to know what the underlying problem is. Refer to a specialist if needed. 3STEP 2 : APPENDIX A-4References 1. Bunn F, Goodman C, Sworm L, et al.

Daily problems with thinking and/or memory TOTAL AD8 SCORE STEP 2 : APPENDIX A-5The AD8 Administration and Scoring Guidelines A spontaneous self-correction is allowed for all responses without counting as an error. The questions are given to the respondent on a c lipboard for self-adminis tration or can be read aloud to the respondent either in person or over the phone. It is preferable to administer the AD8 to an informant, if available. If an informant is not available, the AD8 may be administered to the patient. When administered to an informant, specifica lly ask the respondent to rate change in the patient.When administered to the patient, s pecifically ask the patient to rate changes in his/her ability for each of the items, without attributing causality. If read aloud to the respondent, it is important for the clinician to carefully read the phrase as worded and give emphasis to note changes due to c ognitive problems (not physical problems). There should be a one second del ay between individual items. No timeframe for change is required. The final score is a sum of the number items marked \"Yes, A change\". Interpretation of the AD8 (Adapted from Galvin JE et al, The AD8, a brief informant interview to detect dementia, Neurology 2005:65:559-564) A screening test in itself is insufficient to di agnose a dementing disorder . The AD8 is, however, quite sensitive to detecting early cognitive changes associated many common dementing illness including Alzheimer disease, vascular demen tia, Lewy body dementia and frontotemporal dementia.Scores in the impaired range (see below) indicate a need for further assessment. Scores in the \"normal\" range suggest that a dem enting disorder is unlikely, but a very early disease process cannot be ruled out. More advanced assessment may be warranted in cases where other objective evidence of impairment exists.

Conduct a diagnostic evaluation. 2. Identify the cause(s) of diagnosed dementia. 3. Document the dementia diagnosis and identified cause(s) 4. Disclose the diagnosis and cause(s) to the older adult and family unless otherwise indicated. 5. Increase older adult and family understanding about the importance of diagnostic evaluation Appendices 109 KAER: Approaches and Tools | 88 STEP 3 : EVALUATEOVERVIEW In its 2015 report, the GSA Workgroup on Cognitive Impairment Detection and Earlier Diagnosis recommends that: If, as a result of using one or more approaches to detect cognitive impairment, PCPs find that the older adult has cognitive impairment, PCPs should, at a minimum, rule out reversible, physiological causes of cognitive impairment per published clinical practice guidelines and recommendations (e.g., thyroid or vitamin deficiency) by ordering appropriate laboratory tests (GSA, 2015). Consistent with relevant health care system protocols, if any, and PCP training and experience, PCPs should conduct a diagnostic evaluation for dementia per published clinical guidelines and recommendations (GSA, 2015). PCPs who are unable for any reason to conduct a diagnostic evaluation for dementia should refer patients with cognitive impairment to a clinical specialist or team (e.g., geriatrician, neurologist, geriatric psychiatrist, neuropsychologist, nurse practitioner with geropsychiatric expertise, or memory disorders clinic) for a diagnostic evaluation per published clinical practice guidelines and recommendations (GSA, 2015). Many older adults who have cognitive impairment do not receive a diagnostic evaluation to determine whether they have dementia. Findings from a study of a nationally representative sample of Americans aged 70 years and older indicate that less than half (45%) of those who were diagnosed with dementia in an extensive, in-person diagnostic evaluation conducted for the study had previously received a diagnostic evaluation (Kotagal et al., 2014). Other studies have similar findings (Bradford et al., 2009). KAER: Approaches and Tools | 89 STEP 3 : EVALUATEThere are many reasons that older adults who have cognitive impairment may not receive a diagnostic evaluation, including the following: The older adult's cognitive impairment has not been detected; if cognitive impairment is not detected, a diagnostic evaluation is unlikely to be conducted to determine its cause. The older adult's cognitive impairment has been detected, but the PCP decides not to recommend a diagnostic evaluation; sometimes this occurs because the PCP thinks no additional or useful information will be gained from a diagnostic evaluation. In addition, anecdotal evidence suggests that older adults and family members sometimes ask the PCP not to recommend a diagnostic evaluation because of fear or shame about the possibility of a confirmed dementia diagnosis. The PCP, the older adult, and/or family members mistakenly assume that the older adult's score on a brief cognitive test or apparent signs and symptoms of cognitive impairment are sufficient evidence for a dementia diagnosis and that no additional evaluation is needed. The older adult's cognitive impairment has been detected and the PCP has recommended a diagnostic evaluation, but the older adult does not follow through on the recommendation. This may occur because the older adult does not want to know the diagnosis, does not want others to know, or is afraid of consequences, such as loss of his or her driver's license, rejection for health or long-term care insurance, or refused admission to an assisted living facility. It is unclear how often each of the above-listed reasons accounts for instances in which older adults with cognitive impairment do not receive a diagnostic evaluation. Research suggests, however, that the last reason, failure of the older adult to follow through on the PCP's referral for a diagnostic evaluation, may account for a substantial proportion of such instances. Two studies conducted in a large health care system in Indiana (Boustani et al., 2005; Fowler et al., 2015) and one study conducted in eight VA medical centers in the Midwest (McCarten et al., 2012) found that large proportions of the older adults with cognitive impairment whose PCP recommended a diagnostic evaluation did not follow through to get the evaluation (48%, 67%, and 72%, respectively). These data and the above-listed reasons clearly demonstrate that perceptions, assumptions, and actions of three groups\u2014PCPs, older adults, and family members\u2014contribute to the problem that many older adults with cognitive impairment do not receive a diagnostic evaluation. Although this toolkit focuses on PCPs, the GSA Workgroup believes it is critical to acknowledge the involvement of all three groups in the development of the problem and, therefore, the importance of involving all three groups in finding ways to solve it. KAER: Approaches and Tools | 90 STEP 3 : EVALUATEAs noted at the beginning of this toolkit, without a diagnostic evaluation, older adults who have treatable conditions that are either causing their cognitive impairment or exacerbating the cognitive impairment caused by their dementia are unlikely to receive treatments for these conditions. Likewise, older adults who have dementia but do not receive a diagnostic evaluation are unlikely to get a dementia diagnosis. Without a diagnosis, they and their families are unlikely to benefit from educational, supportive, and skill-building services that can improve health- related outcomes and well-being for the person with dementia and reduce stress, depression, and feelings of isolation and burden for family members. Without a diagnosis, older adults with dementia are also unlikely to benefit from post-diagnostic medical care that can help to mitigate their dementia-related symptoms and accommodate any negative effects of their dementia on their co-existing medical conditions and treatment for those conditions, and vice versa. A systematic review of English-language studies published from 1980 to 2008 identified a wide array of factors that can limit the proportion of patients with dementia that receives a dementia diagnosis (Bradford et al., 2009). The factors were categorized as physician-related, patient- related, family-related, and system-related. The 2015 GSA Workgroup report includes a table, Barriers to PCP Diagnosis of Dementia (Figure E 1), which summarizes the physician-related factors identified by six sources including the systematic review. KAER: Approaches and Tools | 91 STEP 3 : EVALUATE Figure E 1. Barriers to PCP Diagnosis of Dementia Brief time for office visits. Need to focus office time on diagnosis and treatment of the person's other physical health problems. Inadequate diagnostic skills. Concerns about the risk of misdiagnosis. Limited availability of specialists to help with diagnosis. Reluctance to refer the person or family to a specialist for diagnosis. Worry that diagnosis will result in increased demand for limited resources, including physician time for communicating with and supporting family members. Ambivalence about the value of diagnosis. Belief that the symptoms are just normal aging. Belief that the person or family doesn't want to know. Concerns about the negative effect of a dementia diagnosis on the person or family. Uncertainty about whether and how to disclose the diagnosis to the person or family. Difficulty explaining or discussing dementia with the person or family. Perceived lack of effective drug treatments. Lack of awareness about nondrug treatments and community services and supports that have been shown to benefit people with dementia and their families. Reluctance to acknowledge dementia in patients who are friends, neighbors, or members of the same religious or social group. Low reimbursement for diagnosis. Sources: Boise, Camicioli, Morgan, Rose, & Congleton, 1999; Boise et 2010; Bradford, Kunik, et al., 2007.KAER: Approaches and Tools | 92 STEP 3 : EVALUATEPatient-related and family-related factors identified by the systematic review as limiting the proportion of patients with dementia that receives a diagnostic evaluation are: an assumption that cognitive changes are part of normal aging, a perception of limited treatment options, concern about the cost of treatment, lack of health insurance, and communication problems (Bradford et al., 2009). For patients, these communication problems include forgetting to mention cognitive symptoms and relying on the PCP to bring up that topic. For families, the identified communication problems include difficulty talking with the older adult and the PCP about cognitive impairment and dementia and interpretation of PCP silence as a sign that nothing is wrong. Additional patient-related factors identified by the systematic review are: concern about the effects of treatment, patient denial of need or refusal to accept assessment or treatment, fear of the possibility of dementia, and fear that a dementia diagnosis might threaten immigration status and lead to deportation. Additional family-related factors are: lack of knowledge of dementia and its symptoms, misattribution of symptoms to another condition or medication, uncertainty about the appropriate choice of medical provider, denial or preference not to know the diagnosis, doubts about the value of diagnosis and treatment, fear of stigmatization or other negative consequences for the patient, fear of confirming the family member's own risk for dementia, fear that the patient might be denied admission to a nursing home or other care facility, and concerns about emotional, financial or other negative effects of diagnosis on the family. Caregiver- related factors also include the perception that there is a lack of physicians capable of making a diagnosis and concern that the diagnostic process will be too time consuming.System-related factors identified in the systematic review are insufficient PCP time with patients, insufficient availability of community services and specialists for consultation, low financial reimbursement for dementia care, and limitations on diagnostic tests that are imposed by managed care or state health systems.The wide array of physician-related, patient-related, family-related, and system-related factors identified as limiting the proportion of older adults with dementia that receives a dementia diagnosis suggests both challenges and opportunities for increasing that proportion. Many of the same factors influence other aspects of the diagnostic process, resulting, for example, in dementia diagnoses that have been made but are not documented in the patient's medical record or disclosed to the patient and/or family.KAER: Approaches and Tools | 93 STEP 3 : EVALUATEThis section presents approaches and tools that may be helpful to PCPs in conducting a diagnostic evaluation, documenting the diagnosis, and disclosing it to the older adult and family. The section also presents several available tools that PCPs may be able to use to increase older adults' and family members' understanding about the importance of diagnostic evaluation for older adults with cognitive impairment. KAER: Approaches and Tools | 94 STEP 3 : EVALUATEAPPROACHES Due to differences in the structure, organization, and usual primary care procedures among and between single PCP offices, physician group practices, health plans, and health care systems, approaches and tools for diagnostic evaluation that fit and are useful for one PCP practice setting will not fit or be useful for other PCP practice settings. Moreover, some single PCP offices, group practices, health plans, and health care systems already have procedures in place for diagnostic evaluation for dementia, whereas others have no such procedures in place; thus approaches and tools that are timely for some PCP practice settings are not timely for others. The approaches and tools presented below are intended to provide information and options that will help single PCP offices, group practices, health plans, and health care systems formulate new procedures or evaluate and perhaps improve their existing procedures for conducting diagnostic evaluations for dementia and documenting and disclosing dementia diagnoses. CONDUCT A DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION. A diagnostic evaluation for dementia is intended to determine first whether a person with cognitive impairment has dementia or a non-dementia condition that is causing the cognitive impairment. If the diagnostic evaluation shows that the person has dementia, the next step is to identify the cause(s) of the dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease, vascular conditions, Lewy body disease, frontotemporal degeneration, or a combination of these and other possible, although less common, causes. Dementia is a syndrome characterized by cognitive and functional impairments. Specific criteria for a diagnosis of dementia come from various sources. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) (American Psychiatric Association, 2000), which is still used by some and perhaps many PCPs and other health care professionals, requires deficits in two or more cognitive domains, including memory impairment and at least one of the following: aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, or disturbance in executive functioning. The deficits must cause significant impairment in social or occupational functioning. They must constitute a decline from the person's previous level of functioning, and they may not occur solely in the course of delirium.KAER: Approaches and Tools | 95 STEP 3 : EVALUATEThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), published in 2013, does not use the term \"dementia.\" Instead, DSM-5 uses the term \"neurocognitive disorder.\" The criteria for neurocognitive disorder require impairment in one or more of six cognitive domains: complex attention, executive function, learning and memory, language, perceptual-motor, and social cognition. Unlike the DSM-IV-TR criteria, memory impairment is no longer a required criterion. Like the DSM-IV-TR criteria, the DSM-5 criteria require that the cognitive impairment(s) must constitute a decline from a previous level of functioning; that they are sufficient to interfere with independent functioning; and that they do not occur solely in the course of delirium (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Figure E-2 shows the recommended components of a diagnostic evaluation for dementia based on the GSA Workgroup's review of six published guideline and recommendation documents that are intended mainly, although not exclusively, for primary care (American Academy of Neurology, 2013; American Geriatrics Society, Geldmacher & Kerwin, 2013; Group Health Cooperative, 2012). The six guideline and recommendation documents use slightly different terms and categorize the components slightly differently, but they all include the eight components shown in the figure: medical history, cognitive and mental status testing, functional assessment, physical and neurological examination, neuropsychological testing, laboratory tests, neuroimaging, and specialist referral. Figure E 2 lists several assessment tools for cognitive testing, depression, and functional impairment because many PCPs, physician group practices, health plans, and health care systems may already be using an assessment tool for one or more of these domains and will probably want to incorporate that assessment tool in diagnostic evaluations for dementia. With the exception of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (Folstein et al., 1975), the assessment tools listed in the figure are included as appendices to this section: Appendix E-1: Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) Appendix E-2: Saint Louis University Mental Status (SLUMS) Examination Appendix E-3: Confusion Assessment Method Depression Scale (CES-D) Appendix E-7: Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Appendix E-8: Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) Appendix E-9: Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ)KAER: Approaches and Tools | 96 STEP 3 : EVALUATE Figure E 2. Components of a Diagnostic Evaluation for Dementia Medical History Obtain a medical history through a clinical interview with the older adult and at least one additional informant. Gather information about the onset, course and nature of memory and other cognitive impairments and any associated behavioral, medical, or psychological issues, including comorbid medical conditions, alcohol and other substance use, vision and hearing problems, and depression. Ask about recent illnesses, falls, head injury, prescription and over-the-counter medications, uninten- tional weight loss, and family history of dementia. Cognitive and Mental Status Testing Conduct cognitive testing using validated assessment instruments that measure multiple cognitive domains. Recommended instruments include the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (Appendices E 1a and E1b) and the Saint Louis University Mental Status (SLUMS) Examination (Appendix E 2). Many PCPs and others continue to use the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (Folstein et al., 1975). A private company now holds the copyright for the MMSE, charges a fee for each use, and increasingly enforces the charge. Thus the MMSE is not shown in this toolkit. Use validated instruments to test for delirium and depression, for example, the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) (Appendix E 3), the Patient Health Questionaire-9 (PHQ-9) (Appendix E 4), the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) E 5), or the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) Scale (Appendix E 6). Functional Assessment Functional impairment is usually assessed by asking the older adult and a family member or other informant about the older adult's daily functioning. Commonly used instruments include: The Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living (ADL) (asks about bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring, continence, and feeding) (Katz et al., 1970) (Appendix E 7). The Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) Scale (asks about using the telephone, shopping, food preparation, housekeeping, laundry, transportation, and ability to manage medica- tions and finances' (Lawton & Brody, 1969) (Appendix E 8); and the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) (asks about writing checks and other financial management activities; working on a hobby; making a cup of coffee or a balanced meal; keeping track of current events; understanding TV, a book, or a magazine; remembering appointments and medications; and driving or using other transportation) (Pfeffer et al., 1982) (Appendix E 9). A diagnosis of dementia requires impairment in functioning that is sufficient to interfere with performance of daily activities. If the older adult has cognitive impairment but not the required level of functional impairment, a diagnosis of dementia cannot be made. Physical and Neurological Examination Conduct a physical and neurological examination to assess walking, gait disturbances, balance, coordination, speech and language impairment, vision, hearing, focal weakness, extrapyramidal signs rigidity tremor, or slowness of movement [bradykinesia], blood pressure, and heart and other vascular functions that affect blood flow to the brain.Neuropsychological Testing Neuropsychological testing is especially helpful in diagnosing mild and very early stage dementia and evaluating atypical presentations. It can provide comprehensive, objective information about which cognitive functions are affected and establish a baseline for future re-evaluations. Laboratory Tests Routine laboratory tests are used to rule out treatable causes for cognitive impairment. Suggested tests include the following: Completed blood cell count Serum B 12 Serum calcium Folate Glucose Sources: American Academy of Neurology, Cooperative, 2012. Serum Electrolytes Thyroid function tests Liver function tests Renal function tests Neuroimaging Recommendations for use of neuroimaging in clinical diagnostic evaluation of dementia vary. Some sources say that structural neuro - imaging with a non-contrast computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan should be included in clinical diagnostic evaluations for dementia. Other sources say that neuroimaging, including CT and MI scans should be limited to particular clinical situations, for example, when the history and/or physical and neuro- logical examinations indicate a possible central nervous system lesion and for patients who have atypical symptoms or sudden onset of dementia symptoms that could indicated a tumor, subdural hematoma, or normal pressure FDG-PET (fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography) are not currently recommended for use in routine clinical diagnostic evaluations for dementia. Diagnostic practices vary in different medical settings, however, and these tests may be used in routine clinical dementia evaluations in some settings. FDG-PET scans are currently approved by Medicare for patients who meet specified criteria: they must have a recently established diagnosis of dementia with cognitive decline documented for at least 6 months; meet diagnostic criteria for both Alzheimer's disease and frontotemp- oral dementia; and have already been evaluated for specific alternative degenerative diseases or causative factors (CMS, 2004). Medicare also covers FDG-PET in CMS-approved clinical trials that focus on the utility of FDG-PET in the diagnosis or treatment of mild cognitive impairment or early dementia. Specialist Referral PCPs should consider referral to a specialist, such as a neurologist, geriatric psychiatrist, neuropsychologist, geriatrician, nurse practitioner with geropsychiatric experience, or memory disorders clinic in situations, where there is diagnostic uncertainty following a standard diagnostic evaluation, an atypical presentation, onset of symptoms in patients younger than 60 years of age, a request for a second opinion by the older adult or a family member, or conflict among family members about the diagnosis. KAER: Approaches and Tools | 97 STEP 3 : EVALUATEClearly, the focus and amount of time spent on each of the components in Figure E-2 will vary for different patients and situations. Some parts of each component may have already been conducted by the PCP or other primary care office staff in the process of determining whether the older adult has cognitive impairment (KAER steps 1 and 2). For example, parts or all of the medical history may have been obtained, and some cognitive and functional tests may have been conducted and do not need to be repeated. All six documents reviewed by the GSA Workgroup to identify recommended components of a diagnostic evaluation for dementia endorse a central role for PCPs in diagnosing dementia in older adults. They acknowledge that some older adults with cognitive impairment present first to a physician specialist, such as a neurologist, geriatric psychiatrist, or geriatrician, or a specialty memory clinic. The documents also acknowledge the need for specialist referrals in specified situations (see \"Specialist Referral\" in Figure E-2). The guideline and recommendation documents point out, however, that older adults with cognitive impairment usually present first to a PCP and that PCPs can successfully conduct diagnostic evaluations for most of these individuals. They also note that because of the increasing number of older adults with cognitive impairment, PCPs are likely to be conducting a growing number of such diagnostic evaluations. The six guideline and recommendation documents generally encourage early diagnosis and emphasize the importance of obtaining input, whenever possible, from a family member or other informant who knows the older adult well. The guideline and recommendation documents also stress the importance of identifying treatable causes of cognitive impairment, focusing in particular on depression, medications, hypothyroidism, vitamin B 12 deficiency, and comorbid health conditions, all of which can cause cognitive impairment and are often treatable and sometimes reversible. It is not clear how many PCPs conduct diagnostic evaluations for dementia using the eight components shown in Figure E-2. A 2008 mail survey of a random sample of U.S. members of the American Academy of Family Physicians asked about usual practices in detection, diagnosis, and ongoing primary care for patients aged 65 years and older with dementia (Stewart et al., 2014). The survey had a 60% response rate. The great majority of the physician respondents (90%) said they conduct diagnostic evaluations for dementia based on signs or symptoms or concerns expressed by a patient and/or caregiver. Almost all the physician respondents (95%) said they routinely collect patient history as part of the diagnostic process; 93% said they routinely order KAER: Approaches and Tools | 98 STEP 3 : EVALUATElab work as part of the process; 73% said they routinely conduct additional cognitive testing; 66% said they routinely order brain imaging; and 40% said they refer some patients with dementia to specialists, usually to verify the diagnosis. Identified barriers to diagnostic evaluation cited by physician respondents included inadequate clinician time and lack of diagnostic tools. To the extent that these and other PCPs are already conducting diagnostic evaluations for some or all of their older patients with cognitive impairment, the diagnostic tests noted in Figure E-2 may be helpful. For single PCP offices, group practices, health plans, and health care systems that are not currently conducting comprehensive diagnostic evaluations, the components and tools discussed in this section could be helpful in the development of routine procedures for diagnosing dementia in primary care. As noted earlier, procedures will probably vary considerably because of differences in the structure, organization, and existing primary care procedures in single PCP offices, group practices, health plans, and health care systems. In particular, variation is likely in the components of the diagnostic evaluation that are defined as the sole responsibility of the PCP versus other health care providers, including physician specialists, who work in the same group practice or health care system or are available through outside referrals. KAER: Approaches and Tools | 99 STEP 3 : EVALUATEIDENTIFY THE CAUSE(S) OF DIAGNOSED DEMENTIA. Once dementia has been diagnosed, the next step is identification of the cause(s) of the dementia. Common causes of dementia in older adults include Alzheimer's disease, vascular conditions, Lewy body disease, frontotemporal degeneration, and combinations of these and other diseases and conditions. A two-page publication from the Alzheimer's Association (n.d.-c), In Brief for Healthcare Professionals: Differentiating Dementias (Appendix E 10), provides an overview of diseases and conditions that cause dementia and a useful table that compares dementia caused by Alzheimer's disease, vascular conditions, Lewy body disease, frontotemporal degeneration, and Parkinson's disease in terms of usual course, presentation, risk factors, and imaging results. Until recently, the term \"mixed dementia\" was generally used for dementia caused by Alzheimer's disease and vascular conditions (Langa et al., 2004; Rahimi & Kovacs, 2014). There is growing recognition, however, that more complex combinations of diseases and conditions often cause dementia, especially in older adults (Rahimi & Kovacs, 2014; Schneider et al., 2007; Sonnen et al., 2009). The implications of this growing recognition for identifying the causes of dementia in primary care and other clinical contexts are still unclear, and diagnostic criteria and procedures for clinical use are not available.Some PCPs, group practices, health plans, and health care systems already have criteria and procedures in place for diagnosis of the cause(s) of dementia. Other PCPs, group practices, health plans, and health care systems that do not have criteria and procedures for diagnosing these conditions may be able to use the information presented below as a starting point for developing such criteria and procedures. It should be noted that diagnosing the cause(s) of dementia can be difficult and may require more than one PCP visit and specialist referrals. The DSM-5 includes diagnostic criteria and codes for neurocognitive disorders (dementia) caused by Alzheimer's disease, vascular disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Lewy bodies, traumatic brain injury, HIV infection, substance-medication use, prion disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease, as well as neurocognitive disorders (dementia) due to another medical condition, multiple etiologies, or unspecified (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). The International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) also includes diagnostic codes for dementia caused by various diseases and conditions (CDC, 2016). A table of commonly used ICD-10 diagnostic codes for Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, and mild cognitive impairment is shown in Appendix E 11. KAER: Approaches and Tools | 100 STEP 3 : EVALUATEIn addition to DSM-5 and ICD-10 criteria and codes, the GSA Workgroup identified a few additional sources that may be useful to PCPs, health plans, and health care systems in developing or revising their diagnostic procedures for some of the most common causes of dementia. These additional sources are organized by the cause of dementia. Dementia Caused by Alzheimer's Disease Current clinical criteria and procedures for the diagnosis of dementia caused by Alzheimer's disease were developed by an NIA and Alzheimer's Association Workgroup (McKhann et al., 2011). The Alzheimer's Association has also developed free Alzheimer's Disease Pocketcard app for health care professionals that includes clinical information on the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and other assessment and care related issues. The app can be downloaded free at www.alz.org/health-care-professionals/physicians-app.asp. Dementia Caused by Vascular Conditions Various vascular conditions can cause dementia, including stroke, multiple small strokes, white matter brain lesions, atherosclerosis, and microbleeds. A review by Korczyn, Vakhapova, and Grinberg (2012) cites several sources of clinical criteria for diagnosis of dementia caused by vascular conditions, including Chui et al. (1992) and Roman et al. (1993), but notes that there is no gold standard for this diagnosis. The review by Korczyn and coworkers concludes that \"the occurrence of comorbid changes in the brain, the availability of multiple diagnostic criteria, and reliance on several imaging methods and different criteria for abnormality make diagnosis imprecise.\" With these caveats in mind, one useful resource for PCPs, health plans, and health care systems is the 1993 NINDS-AIREN Criteria for the Diagnosis of Vascular Dementia (Roman et al., 1993). In addition, the website of the University of California San Francisco Memory and Aging Center has a 2010 article about vascular dementia that includes diagnostic guidelines.KAER: Approaches and Tools | 101 STEP 3 : EVALUATEDementia Caused by Lewy Body Disease The Lewy Body Dementia Association (LBDA) has several publications that may be useful to PCPs, health plans, and health care systems that are developing or revising their diagnostic criteria and procedures for Lewy body dementia. A two-page document, Lewy Body Dementia Diagnosis (LBDA, 2015a), provides information about the criteria and procedures for diagnosing this condition, based on McKeith and coworkers (2005). It also includes diagnostic criteria for a related condition, Parkinson's disease dementia. Another one-page LBDA (2009) document Lewy Body Dementias: Symptoms and Diagnostic Criteria, shows symptoms and areas of deficit for Lewy body dementia and Parkinson's disease dementia. Dementia Caused by Frontotemporal Degeneration Frontotemporal degeneration includes three subtypes, each of which can cause dementia: behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), semantic variant of primary progressive aphasia nonfluent variant of primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA). Neuropsychiatric symptoms are the most prominent symptoms of bvFTD, whereas difficulty with language and speech are the most prominent symptoms of svPPA and nfvPPA (Bott et al., 2014). Several 2011 documents provide diagnostic criteria for bvFTD (see Pijnenburg, 2011; Rascovsky et al., 2011) and primary progressive aphasia (Gorno-Tempini et al., 2011). The Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration (AFTD) provides four easily accessible documents that may be useful to PCPs, health plans, and health care systems in developing or revising their diagnostic criteria and procedures for frontotemporal degeneration: Evaluation and Diagnosis Behavioral Variant Frontotemporal Degeneration Semantic Variant Primary Progressive Aphasia Nonfluent/Agrammatic Variant Primary Progressive AphasiaKAER: Approaches and Tools | 102 STEP 3 : EVALUATEDOCUMENT THE DEMENTIA DIAGNOSIS AND IDENTIFIED CAUSE(S). Dementia diagnoses are not always documented in the patient's medical record. It is unclear how often this occurs, but some research suggests that it may be common enough to raise concern. One study found, for example, that 17% of primary care physicians who reported that they had diagnosed dementia in some of their older adult patients had not documented the diagnosis in the older adults' medical records (Chodesh et al., 2004). PCPs may decide not to document a dementia diagnosis for various reasons, including expressed or assumed preferences of the older adult or a family member. Even if a dementia diagnosis is not documented, the PCP who made the diagnosis is likely to be aware of the older adult's dementia and able to take it into consideration in providing medical care and referrals for community services for the older adult. The problem occurs when that PCP is not available and/ or another PCP or other health care professional has to make decisions about or provide medical care for the older adult. These other PCPs and health care professionals probably will not be aware of the older adult's dementia. On average, older adults with dementia have very high numbers of transitions between care settings (Callahan et al., 2012; Callahan et al., 2015). If an older adult's dementia diagnosis is not documented in his or her medical record, the diagnosis is unlikely to be included in transfer information provided when the older adult transitions from one care setting to another. As a result, PCPs and other health care professionals and providers in that care setting may not be aware of the dementia, especially when the older adult first arrives. In these situations, lack of documentation of an older adult's dementia diagnosis could jeopardize his or her safety and the appropriateness of care he or she receives. To avoid this problem, PCPs, group practices, health plans, and health care systems could institute routine documentation of dementia diagnoses and include relevant check boxes in electronic medical records.KAER: Approaches and Tools | 103 STEP 3 : EVALUATEDISCLOSE THE DIAGNOSIS AND CAUSE(S) TO THE OLDER ADULT AND FAMILY UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED. Many older adults with diagnosed dementia and their family members are not aware of the diagnosis. Data from a nationally representative sample of older adults and Medicare records show that in the period from 2007 to 2009, only 34.8% of older adults with a dementia diagnosis in their Medicare records or a Medicare claim for treatment of Alzheimer's disease or dementia said (or their proxy respondent said) that a doctor had ever told the older adult or proxy respondent that the older adult had Alzheimer's disease or any other type of dementia (U.S. Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, 2016). Likewise, in a sample of 193 older veterans with diagnosed dementia, only 24% of the veterans and 67% of their family caregivers reported that they were aware of the diagnosis (Bradford et al., 2011). Older adults with dementia certainly may not remember that they were told about their dementia diagnosis. Likewise, family members may not remember or may chose not to report having been told about the diagnosis. It is concerning, nevertheless, that large proportions of older adults who have a dementia diagnosis are not aware, and their families are not aware, of the diagnosis. There has been considerable disagreement about whether a dementia diagnosis should be disclosed to the patient (Carpenter & Dave, 2004; Bamford et al., 2004). Results from studies conducted with family caregivers have found that most of caregivers prefer to be told the diagnosis although they often complain about the way it was disclosed (Connell et al., 2004).KAER: Approaches and Tools | 104 STEP 3 : EVALUATEOne study of the effects of diagnostic disclosure on 62 older adults with dementia found they generally did not experience the post-disclosure anxiety and depression that some commentators have predicted (Carpenter et al., 2008). In fact, anxiety levels were reduced for some of older adults, perhaps because they had finally received the diagnostic information. The disclosure procedures used by the health care system involved in the study included many of the suggestions families and others have made about how to improve the process. An 8-minute video created by ACT on Alzheimer's illustrates some of these suggested changes (ACT on Alzheimer's, 2014). Delivering an Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis KAER: Approaches and Tools | 105 STEP 3 : EVALUATEA 2012 Alzheimer's Association publication, In Brief for Healthcare Professionals: Increasing Disclosure of Dementia Diagnosis (Appendix E 12) and a set of talking points in the Group Health Cooperative (2012) Dementia and Cognitive Impairment Diagnosis and Treatment Guideline (Figure E-3) provide additional ideas that PCPs may want to use or adapt for disclosing dementia diagnoses. Figure E 3. Delivering a Diagnosis of Dementia Talking Points From the Group Health Cooperative Dementia and Cognitive Impairment Diagnosis and Treatment Guideline \"Memory changes are due to abnormal accumulation of proteins in the brain, which interfere with the essential functions of thinking and processing. Basically these proteins clog things up.\" \"Most people who have dementia don't end up in nursing homes\u2014they can live at home with family, be reasonably content, and have nice lives.\" \"Eventually, dementia will cause a worsening in your ability to handle regular tasks, such as shopping, finances, and medications. But we'll talk regularly, and we'll manage that.\" \"Dementia is not hereditary in most cases.\" \"Dementia is a progressive condition with no cure, but we have treatments for symptoms. And proper care and planning can greatly alleviate the burden of dementia.\" \"It is important for you and your family to plan for the future, and it is especially important for you to make legal plans. The sooner legal planning starts, the more you may be able to participate. Legal planning includes advance directives.\" Source: Group Health Cooperative, 2012. (Conversation 1a.)KAER: Approaches and Tools | 106 STEP 3 : EVALUATEINCREASE OLDER ADULT AND FAMILY UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION. As noted at the beginning of this section, older adults and families often contribute to the problem that the older adult with cognitive impairment does not receive a diagnostic evaluation. They may mistakenly assume that the older adult's score on a brief cognitive test or apparent signs and symptoms of cognitive impairment are sufficient evidence for a dementia diagnosis and that no additional evaluation is needed. Even when the PCP recommends a diagnostic evaluation, the older adult and/or the family may not follow through on the recommendation. Failure to follow through on the PCP recommendation may occur because of fear or shame about the possibility of a confirmed dementia diagnosis, reluctance to have others know about the diagnosis, and worry about consequences, such as loss of the older adult's driver's license, rejection for health or long-term care insurance, or refused admission to an assisted living facility or other senior residence. The GSA Workgroup report provides a table that discusses many potential benefits of an early diagnosis of dementia, worded primarily from the perspective of the older adult and family members (GSA, 2015) (Appendix E 13). While PCPs may be able to draw important messages from the text, it is not clear that the table itself is a useful tool for older adults and families. A 2016 Alzheimer's Association publication, In Brief for Healthcare Professionals: Special Issues in Memory Loss, Alzheimer's Disease, and Dementia, suggests messages PCPs can use to convince patients to come in for a diagnostic evaluation (Appendix E 14). The best tool the GSA Workgroup has found thus far for older adults and families comes from the Alzheimer's and Dementia Alliance of Wisconsin (2009) (Figure E 4).KAER: Approaches and Tools | 107 STEP 3 : EVALUATE Figure E 4. Importance of an Early Diagnosis of Dementia Early Diagnosis Is Key. There are at least a dozen advantages to obtaining an early and accurate diagnosis when cognitive symptoms are first noticed. 1. Your symptoms might be reversible. The symptoms you are concerned about might be caused by a condition that is reversible. And even if there is also an underlying dementia such as Alzheimer's disease, diagnosis and treatment of reversible conditions can improve brain function and reduce symptoms. 2. It may be treatable. Some causes of cognitive decline are not reversible, but might be treatable. Appropriate treatment can stop or slow the rate of further decline. 3. With treatments, the sooner the better.Treatment of Alzheimer's and other dementia-causing diseases is typically most effective when started early in the disease process. Once more effective treatments become available, obtaining an early and accurate diagnosis will be even more crucial. 4. Diagnoses are more accurate early in the disease process.A more accurate diagnosis is possible when a complete history can be taken early in the disease process, while the person is still able to answer questions and report concerns and when observers can still recall the order in which symptoms first appeared. Obtaining an accurate diagnosis can be difficult once most of the brain has become affected. 5. It's empowering.An earlier diagnosis enables the person to participate in his or her own legal, financial, and long-term care planning and to make his or her wishes known to family members. 6. You can focus on what's important to you.It allows people the opportunity to reprioritize how they spend their time\u2014focusing on what matters most to them\u2014 perhaps completing life goals such as travel, recording family history, completing projects, or making memories with grandchildren while they still can. 7. You can make your best choices.Early diagnosis can prevent unwise choices that might otherwise be made in ignorance\u2014such as moving far away from family and friends, or making legal or financial commitments that will be hard to keep as the disease progresses. 8. You can use the resources available to you.Individuals diagnosed early in the disease process can take advantage of early-stage support groups and learn tips and strategies to better manage and cope with the symptoms of the disease. 9. Participate or advocate for research.Those diagnosed early can also take advantage of clinical trials\u2014or advocate for more research and improved care and opportunities. 10. You can further people's understanding of the disease.Earlier diagnosis helps to reduce the stigma associated with the disease when we learn to associate the disease with people in the early stages, when they are still cogent and active in the community. 11. It will help your family.An earlier diagnosis gives families more opportunity to learn about the disease, develop realistic expectations, and plan for their future together\u2014which can result in reduced stress and feelings of burden and regret later in the disease process. 12. It will help you, too. Early diagnosis allows the person and family to attribute cognitive changes to the disease rather than to personal failings\u2014 preserving the person's ego throughout the disease process. Taken all together, these advantages result in a higher quality of life for the person afflicted, less stress for family care partners, and more time to treasure the present and prepare for the future. Source: Alzheimer's and Dementia Alliance of Wisconsin, 2009.KAER: Approaches and Tools | 108 STEP 3 : EVALUATEThe GSA Workgroup believes that additional tools are needed to increase older adults' and family members' understanding about the importance of diagnostic evaluation for older adults with cognitive impairment. Such tools should be designed in various formats for delivery through print, online, and other media. They could be created jointly by organizations that represent PCPs and organizations that represent older adults, persons with cognitive impairment and dementia, and families. Once created, the tools could be disseminated widely by these and other organizations to their members and the older adults and families they represent. As noted at the beginning of this section, it is clear that PCPs, older adults, and family members contribute in different ways to the problem that many older adults with cognitive impairment do not receive a diagnostic evaluation. Involving organizations that represent all these groups in the creation and dissemination of tools to address the problem is likely to be more effective than expecting that PCPs or the physician practices, health plans, or health care systems they work for to address it on their own.

Mark a check in the allocated space for each word the subject produces on this first trial. When the subject indicates that (s)he has finished (has recalled all words), or can recall no more words, read the list a second time with the following instructions: Put a check in the allocated space for each word the subject recalls after the second trial. At the end of the second trial, inform the subject that (s)he will be asked to recall these words again by saying, Scoring : No points are given for Trials One and Two. Forward Digit Span: Administration : Give the following instruction: \" \". Read the five number sequence at a rate of one digit per second. Backward Digit Span: Administration : Give the following instruction: \" \" Read the three number sequence at a rate of one digit per second. Scoring : Allocate one point for each sequence correctly repeated, ( : the correct response for the backwards trial is 247). Vigilance: Administration : The examiner reads the list of letters at a rate of one per second, after giving the following instruction: \" \". Scoring : Give one point if there is zero to one errors (an error is a tap on a wrong letter or a failure to tap on letter A). STEP 3 : APPENDIX E-1a 3 Serial 7s: Administration : The examiner gives the following instruction: Give this instruction twice if necessary. Scoring : This item is scored out of 3 points. Give no (0) points for no correct subtractions, 1 point for one correction subtraction, 2 points for twotothree correct subtractions, and 3 points if the participant successfully makes four or five correct subtractions. Count each correct subtraction of 7 beginning at 100. Each subtraction is evaluated independently; that is, if the participant responds with an incorrect number but continues to correctly subtract 7 from it, give a point for each correct subtraction. For example, a participant may respond \"92 - 85 - 78 - 71 - 64\" where the \"92\" is incorrect, but all subsequent numbers are subtracted correctly. This is one error and the item would be given a score of 3. Administration : The examiner gives the following instructions: [pause]: Following the response, say: [pause]: Scoring : Allocate 1 point for each sentence correctly repeated. Repetition must be exact. Be alert for errors that are omissions (e.g., omitting \"only\", \"always\") and substitutions/additions (e.g., \"John is the helped today;\" substituting \"hides\" for \"hid\", altering plurals, etc.). Administration : The examiner gives the following instruction: [Pause] [time for 60 sec]. Scoring : Allocate one point if the subject generates 11 words or more in 60 sec. Record the subject's response in the bottom or side margins. Administration : The examiner asks the subject to explain what each pair of words has in common, starting with the example: If the subject answers in a concrete manner, then say only one additional time: If the subject does not give the appropriate response , say, Do not give any additional instructions or clarification. After the practice trial, say: Following the response, administer the second trial, saying: . Do not give any additional instructions or prompts. STEP 3 : APPENDIX E-1a 4 Scoring : Only the last two item pairs are scored. Give 1 point to each item pair correctly answered. The following responses are acceptable: Trainbicycle = means of transportation, means of travelling, you take trips in both; Rulerwatch = measuring instruments, used to measure. The following responses are acceptable: Trainbicycle = they have wheels; Ruler watch = they have numbers. Administration : The examiner gives the following instruction: Make a check mark ( ) for each of the words correctly recalled spontaneously without any cues, in the allocated space. Scoring : Following the delayed free recall trial, prompt the subject with the semantic category cue provided below for any word not recalled. Make a check mark ( ) in the allocated space if the subject remembered the word with the help of a category or multiplechoice cue. Prompt all nonrecalled words in this manner. If the subject does not recall the word after the category cue, give him/her a multiple choice trial, using the following example instruction, Use the following category and/or multiplechoice cues for each word, when appropriate: FACE: category cue : part of the body multiple choice : nose, face, hand VELVET: category cue : type of fabric multiple choice : denim, cotton, velvet CHURCH: category cue : type of building multiple choice : church, school, hospital DAISY: category cue : type of flower multiple choice : rose, daisy, tulip RED: category cue : a colour multiple choice : red, blue, green Scoring : A cue is used for clinical information purposes only and can give the test interpreter additional information about the type of memory disorder. For memory deficits due to retrieval failures, performance can be improved with a cue. For memory deficits due to encoding failures, performance does not improve with a cue. Administration : The examiner gives the following instructions: \"Tell me the date today\". If the subject does not give a complete answer, then prompt accordingly by saying: Then say: Scoring : Give one point for each item correctly answered. The subject must tell the exact date and the exact place (name of hospital, clinic, office). No points are allocated if subject makes an error of one day for the day and date. Sum all subscores listed on the righthand side. Add one point for an individual who has 12 years or fewer of formal education, for a possible maximum of 30 points. A final total score of 26 and above is considered normal. Reproduced with permission. Copies are available at www.mocatest.orgSTEP 3 : APPENDIX E-1b Reproduced with permission.

Greenberg, PhD(c) MSN, GNP-BC New York University College of Nursing The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) By: Christine M. Waszynski, MSN, APRN, BC, Hartford Hospital WHY: Delirium is present in 10%-31% of older medical inpatients upon hospital admission and 11%-42% of older adults develop delirium during hospitalization (Siddiqi, House, & Holmes, 2006; Tullmann, Fletcher, & Foreman, 2012). Delirium is associated with negative consequences including prolonged hospitalization, functional decline, increased use of chemical and physical restraints, prolonged delirium post hospitalization, and increased mortality. Delirium may also have lasting negative effects including the development of dementia within two years (Ehlenbach et al., 2010) and the need for long term nursing home care (Inouye, 2006). Predisposing risk factors for delirium include older age, dementia, severe illness, multiple co-morbidities, alcoholism, vision impairment, hearing impairment, and a history of delirium. Precipitating risk factors include acute illness, surgery, pain, dehydration, sepsis, electrolyte disturbance, urinary retention, fecal impaction, and exposure to high risk medications. Delirium is often unrecognized and undocumented by clinicians. Early recognition and treatment can improve outcomes. Therefore, patients should be assessed frequently using a standardized tool to facilitate prompt identification and management of delirium and underlying etiology. BEST TOOL: The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) is a standardized evidence-based tool that enables non-psychiatrically trained clinicians to identify and recognize delirium quickly and accurately in both clinical and research settings. The CAM includes four features found to have the greatest ability to distinguish delirium from other types of cognitive impairment. There is also a CAM-ICU version for use with non-verbal mechanically ventilated patients (See Try This: \u00ae CAM-ICU). VALIDITY AND RELIABILITY: Both the CAM and the CAM-ICU have demonstrated sensitivity of 94-100%, specificity of 89-95% and high inter-rater reliability (Wei, Fearing, Eliezer, Sternberg, & Inouye, 2008). Several studies have been done to validate clinical usefulness. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: The CAM can be incorporated into routine assessment and has been translated into several languages. The CAM was designed and validated to be scored based on observations made during brief but formal cognitive testing, such as brief mental status evaluations. Training to administer and score the tool is necessary to obtain valid results. The tool identifies the presence or absence of delirium but does not assess the severity of the condition, making it less useful t o detect clinical improvement or deterioration. FOLLOW-UP: The presence of delirium warrants prompt intervention to identify and treat underlying causes and provide supportive care. Vigilant efforts need to continue across the healthcare continuum to preserve and restore baseline mental status.

(If present or abnormal) Did this behavior fluctuate during the interview, that is, tend to come and go or increase and decrease in severity? 3. [Disorganized thinking] Was the patient's thinking disorganized or incoherent, such as rambling or irrelevant conversation, unclear or illogical flow of ideas, or unpredictable switching from subject to subject? 4. [Altered level of consciousness] Overall, how would you rate this patient's level of consciousness? (Alert [normal]; Vigilant [hyperalert, overly sensitive to environmental stimuli, startled very easily [Disorientation] Was the patient disoriented at any time during the interview, such as thinking that he or she was somewhere other than the hospital, using the wrong bed, or misjudging the time of day? 6. [Memory impairment] Did the patient demonstrate any memory problems during the interview, such as inability to remember events in the hospital or difficulty remembering instructions? 7. [Perceptual disturbances] Did the patient have any evidence of perceptual disturbances, for example, hallucinations, illusions or misinterpretations (such as thinking something was moving when it was not)? 8A. [Psychomotor agitation] At any time during the interview did the patient have an unusually increased level of motor activity such as restlessness, picking at bedclothes, tapping fingers or making frequent sudden changes of position? 8B. [Psychomotor retardation] At any time during the interview did the patient have an unusually decreased level of motor activity such as sluggishness, staring into space, staying in one position for a long time or moving very slowly? 9. [Altered sleep-wake cycle] Did the patient have evidence of disturbance of the sleep-wake cycle, such as excessive daytime sleepiness with insomnia at night? The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) Diagnostic Algorithm Feature 1: Acute Onset or Fluctuating Course This feature is usually obtained from a family member or nurse and is shown by positive responses to the following questions: Is there evidence of an acute change in mental status from the patient's baseline? Did the (abnormal) behavior fluctuate during the day, that is, tend to come and go, or increase and decrease in severity? Feature 2: Inattention This feature is shown by a positive response to the following question: Did the patient have difficulty focusing attention, for example, being easily distractible, or having difficulty keeping track of what was being said? Feature 3: Disorganized thinking This feature is shown by a positive response to the following question: Was the patient's thinking disorganized or incoherent, such as rambling or irrelevant conversation, unclear or illogical flow of ideas, or unpredictable switching from subject to subject? Feature 4: Altered Level of consciousness This feature is shown by any answer other than \"alert\" to the following question: Overall, how would you rate this patient's level of consciousness? (alert [normal]), or coma [unarousable]) The diagnosis of delirium by CAM requires the presence of features 1 and 2 and either 3 or 4. \u00a9 2003 Sharon K.

STEP 3 : APPENDIX E-10\"My mom has dementia, not Alzheimer's.\" This statement reflects the lack of understanding among patients and caregivers that dementia is not a specific disease but a range of symptoms associated with cognitive impairment severe enough to affect a person's ability to perform everyday activities. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent cause of dementia, but there are many other causes as well. Other common types of dementia include vascular dementia (VaD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Parkinson dementia (PD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and mixed dementia (2 or more etiologies, most commonly AD and VaD)(Figure 1). Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Huntington's, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, and normal pressure hydrocephalus are just a few of the dementias that appear less frequently. Physicians often define dementia based on the criteria given in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). The latest version, the fifth edition (DSM-5), includes a new, broader diagnostic category called major neurocognitive disorders (NCD), which incorporates the former diagnosis of dementia. 1 T o meet the DSM-5 criteria for major neurocognitive disorder, an individual must have evidence of significant cognitive decline in memory or another cognitive ability, such as language or learning, that interferes with independence in everyday activities. For example, an individual may need assistance with complex activities such as paying bills or managing medications. Mild cognitive impairment, or MCI, is now subsumed under the DSM-5 criteria for mild neurocognitive disorder\u2014an individual has evidence of modest cognitive decline, but the impairment does not interfere with performing complex activities. It might take more effort, but a person can still pay bills and manage their medications. Although there are commonalities among the dementias (or NCDs), examining the course and clinical features of a patient's cognitive impairment can help differentiate between the various common subtypes (Table 1). This helps determine the treatment and support services appropriate for the dementia.in brief for healthcare professionals Issue 7 alz.org\u00ae Differentiating Dementias DEMENTIA An \"umbrella\" term used to describe a range of symptoms associated with cognitive impairment.

A majority of patients want to know if they have Alzheimer's disease A recent 5-country survey9 (France, Germany, Poland, Spain, and the US) examining public attitudes about Alzheimer's disease found the following: More than 80% of all adults (N=2,678) and 89% of US adults (N=639) responded that if they had memory or confusion symptoms, they would go to a doctor to determine if the cause was Alzheimer's disease. This US finding is consistent with previously published reports over the last 2 decades (Figure 2). 10,11 Of the US respondents, 65% said that even if they were asymptomatic they would likely or somewhat likely be interested in getting a medical test that would determine if they would get Alzheimer's disease in the future (if one becomes available). 100 80 60 40 20 0 Bradford (2009)~50%Figure 1. 50% of patients with dementia have no medical record of diagnosis% of patients who met dementia diagnostic criteria and did not have it noted in medical record s 100 80 60 40 20 0 Alz-Eu Harvar d (2011)89%Figure 2.

The purpose of the study was to examine racial differences in the perceived benefits and barriers to a dementia diagnosis.6 More than 75% of family members rated the following benefits of diagnosis as being very or extremely important: 1) let family know what was wrong with relative; 2) allowed family to get information about Alzheimer's disease; and 3) allowed family to plan for the future. Black respondents endorsed the above benefits more often than whites and indicated that involving their family members in important decisions, such as making a will and using community services, also were very important to extremely important benefits of diagnosis. Only 6% of all respondents strongly agreed that \"it is easier to not know what the diagnosis is.\" Diagnosis does not cause psychological stress in most patients and their families Physician conjecture that a dementia diagnosis may lead to depression or even suicide has been reported.12 Empirical findings on the issue are primarily limited to retrospective or review studies in populations with comorbid depression, a well-known risk factor for suicide. 13,14 T o examine psychological stress, Carpenter and colleagues evaluated 90 individuals and their companions before a dementia evaluation and after dementia disclosure using the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). 15 Sixty-nine percent of individuals were diagnosed with very mild or mild dementia. No clinically significant changes were noted in depressive symptoms in either the persons diagnosed with dementia or their companion (Figure 3). Anxiety decreased or remained unchanged after diagnostic feedback for most groups (Figure 4). Authors noted, \"Gaining knowledge and developing a treatment plan, individuals may realize that they can take an active role in managing the illness, enhancing a sense of self-efficacy where before they might have felt helpless.\" Changes in depression and anxiety, pre-evaluation vs post-disclosure, in individuals and companions seeking a dementia evaluation. 0(GDS) Individuals Seeking Evaluation Companions0.51.01.52.02.53.0 N = 63 N = 46Figure 3: Depression no dementia very mild dementia mild dementia 0(STAI) Individuals Seeking Evaluation Companions202530354045 N = 61 N = 46Figure 4: Anxiety15 15 7Table 2. Potential Benefits of Early Diagnosis of Dementia Early diagnosis of dementia allows the person with the condition and his or her family and significant others to understand what is causing any observed decline in the person's cognitive and other abilities. It names the problem, eliminates the need for further searching to obtain a diagnosis, and validates concerns that have usually been present before a diagnosis is made. If an early diagn ostic evaluation shows that the person does not have dementia, the person and family are a ble to seek other causes for the person' s cognitive de cline, some of which may be partially or completely reve rsible with treatment. Early diagnosis of dementia allows the person with the condition and his or her family and significant others to have important conversations about the person' s wishes for his or her future care. The person with dementia has an opportunity to address legal and financial matters, designate a surrogate decision make r, and express preferences about future medical treatment and living arrangements while he or she still has decision-making capacity . This early planning can help to avoid crisis situations later on, when the person is no longer capable of expressing preferences or making decisions for himself or herself. Early diagnosis of dementia allows the person with the condition and his or her family to think about and plan ways to avoid significant risks that are associated with cognitive decline for some people with dementia. These risks include financial losses due to reduced financial decision-making capacity and susceptibility to scams; accidents and injuries to the person with dementia or others due to unsafe use of tools, appliances, or guns; continuing to drive when the person is no longer capable of driving safely; and wandering and getting lost. Early diagnosis a llows the person with dementia a nd his or her family and significant others to benefit from dementia-specific support groups a nd other counseling, peer mentoring, d isease education, socialization, exercise, and recreation programs that may be availa ble in their community . Source: Gerontological Society of America, 2015.The curr ently available medications for Alzheimer's disease cannot prevent, cure, or delay the onset or progression of the disease, but they do help to reduce cognitive and other symptoms in some people with Alzheimer's for some time. Early diagnosis allows the person with dementia caused by Alzheimer's disease and his or her family to consider whether to try one or more of these medications. Early diagnosis allows the person with dementia to decide whether to participate in research on new medications to prevent, cure, or delay the onset or progression of Alzheimer's and other diseases and conditions that cause dementia. Early diagnosis of dementia allows family members to benefit from training about how to manage difficult caregiving issues, including dementia-related behavioral symptoms, and counseling and support to maintain their own health and reduce stress. Early diagnosis can lead to more appropriate medical care and better health outcomes for the person with dementia. Without a diagnosis, people with dementia are more likely to receive medications for their other acute or chronic medical conditions that can worsen their cognitive functioning. In addition, people with dementia may be unable to report physical health symptoms accurately, comply with medical treatment recommendations, or take medications as prescribed. In the absence of a dementia diagnosis, PCPs, physician specialists, and other health care providers may not question a patient's reports about symptoms of coexisting medical conditions and compliance with recommended treatments, especially in the early stages of the patient's dementia. As a result, they may not be able to manage the patient's coexisting conditions effectively, resulting in potentially preventable worsening of the person's health and avoidable hospitalizations and emergency department visits. STEP 3 : APPENDIX E-13STEP 3 : APPENDIX E-14In Brief for Healthcare Professionals Quick Start Some Patients Do Not Want to Have Their Memory Evaluated Help patients understand that the goal is to improve their memory and allow them to continue doing the activities that they enjoy. Explain that there are a number of medications available that could help them. Some Patients Do Not Want You to Talk to Their Family A few patients are able to manage the disease on their own, at least for a while. For the majority of patients, involvement of family or friends is a critical part of the patient's care, helping him or her to deal with and manage memory loss due to Alzheimer's disease or another dementia. Difficulty in convincing patients to come to appointments to evaluate their memory can sometimes be one of the biggest obstacles faced by families. Patients do not want to come to the appointment for a variety of reasons. Some patients may not want to come to the appointment because they are fearful of the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, particularly if they watched their parent, spouse, or friend suffer with this disorder. Others may not want to come to the appointment because they are afraid they will be sent to a nursing home. And some may simply not want to come to the appointment because they do not recognize a problem and cannot be bothered with coming. We admit that we have not been able to convince every patient to come to an appointment. We have, however, been successful with a couple of strategies. The most reliable of these is to explain to the patient (typically on the phone) that our goal is to improve their memory to allow them to continue doing the activities that they enjoy, and that there are a number of medications available to help their memory, and even to delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease. Sometimes it is not even what you say, but just spending a minute and making a connection with the patient helps to make the appointment less frightening. A number of families will grab us in the hallway prior to the appointment and say something like, \"Please measure her blood pressure... the only way I was able to get her to you was to pretend that this was for her routine blood pressure check.\" Although we do not condone deception as a way to bring a patient to an appointment (in part because it may lead to mistrust, in part because of the ethical implications), patients brought in this way typically do just fine. These patients discover that a memory evaluation is quite similar to other medical evaluations, not as frightening or threatening as they had feared.The Patient Who Does Not Want to Come to the Appointment Sometimes it happens that patients come to the clinic and they do not want you to tell their family about their memory difficulties. Should we agree with respecting their desire for confidentiality, despite the difficulties and potential danger in which they may be placing themselves and others? Or should we insist that their family be involved? Our answer is that it depends upon the circumstances (see patient examples below). For the vast majority of patients, the involvement of family or friends is a critical part of the patient's care, helping him or her to deal with and manage memory loss whether due to Alzheimer's disease or due to another dementia. There are a few patients, however, who are able to manage the disease on their own, at least for a while.The Patient Who Does Not Want You to Talk to Their FamilySpecial Issues in Memory Loss, Alzheimer's Disease and DementiaSTEP 3 : APPENDIX E-14800.272.3900 | alz.org \u00aeThis article was published in: Memory Loss, Alzheimer's Disease, and Dementia, Second Edition, Budson A and Solomon P, \"Chapter 27: Special Issues in Memory Loss, Alzheimer's Disease, and Dementia\", pp 246-247, Copyright Elsevier (2016).The First Patient A patient came to our office about 10 years ago, driving himself the three hours to get to our clinic, with concerns about his memory. He had noticed mild changes in his memory, and was worried that he might be at the earliest stage of Alzheimer's disease. He had watched his father go through the disease, and so he knew the signs well. After evaluating him we made a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment, and prescribed a course of medication. He did not want us to mention anything to his children or his wife, which we thought was acceptable at the time given how mild his memory difficulties were, how responsibly he was acting, and that he was taking a medication which had the potential to improve his memory to the level which it was at the previous year. Several years passed in this manner. His memory became worse, and he was diagnosed with very mild Alzheimer's disease dementia. At each visit we discussed the importance of letting his family know about his difficulties, but he continued to decline our suggestion. He was able to persuade us, however, that he was taking all of his medications correctly, was driving safely, not getting lost, and not running into any serious difficulties. Finally a minor crisis occurred at home when he forgot to come home to take the dog out for a walk\u2014a small thing, but very uncharacteristic for him\u2014and he ended up explaining to his family about his disease and about not wanting to burden them with it. Our next visit with the patient included his wife and two anxious sons. We had a very productive meeting and learned many things we wished we had known about earlier, such as that he used many woodworking tools in the basement and was beginning to have minor injuries associated with not using the tools correctly. Overall, however, we were pleased that we were able to provide good treatment to the patient while at the same time respecting his wishes not to tell his family about his memory problems. The Second Patient Another patient came to our clinic several years ago. We knew that there were going to be some issues before she came in, because she had scheduled and then canceled the appointment four times before finally coming in to see us. It had also been clear to us ahead of time that she did not want her family involved, because when our secretary scheduled the visit and mentioned to the patient that she should bring someone close to her to the appointment, such as a family member or close friend, she adamantly refused to do so. During the appointment she was incredibly anxious. We were sympathetic to her. It was perfectly clear that she was absolutely terrified that she might have Alzheimer's disease. Her mother had recently died of the disease, and we gathered that the experience of her mother's illness and death had been quite traumatizing to her. Her mother, however, first showed symptoms in her mid-80s and died at age 91. The patient herself was only 68 years old. Even before we finished interviewing her we could tell that her memory problems were significant, and we wondered whether she was really able to cover her difficulties as well as she stated. We took an extra 10 minutes, and spoke with her about some of what we typically save for the first follow-up visit. We discussed that, if it turned out that she did have Alzheimer's disease, there are many treatments that could help her\u2014more than were available when her mother was diagnosed. Additionally, we discussed a number of experimental treatments that were currently in clinical trials, treatments that had the possibility to significantly slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease. We then asked about her family and, when we learned that they were supportive, we explained the importance of having her family with her. She hesitated, and we gently but firmly insisted that she involve her family and bring at least one family member with her to the follow-up appointment. We insisted because we were concerned that she needed the emotional support of family to effectively come to terms with her memory problems. Additionally, her memory was already poor enough such that she would be unable to hide it for long\u2014assuming that it was not already apparent to those around her. Both her daughter and husband came with her to the next appointment, at which time we told her that she had mild Alzheimer's disease dementia. Although tears were shed, with their help she was able to accept the diagnosis, and she worked to have a positive attitude.Case Study Reprinted in its entirety with permissionKAER: Approaches and Tools | 134 STEP 4 : REFER TABLE OF CONTENTS Overview 135 Approaches 137 1. Connect older patients with dementia to assistance in the PCP's organization to identify needs and access help 2. Connect older patients with dementia to community agencies and providers to identify needs and access help3. Maintain a list of online resources and refer older adults and families to relevant resources 4. Provide general information about and encourage participation in clinical trials Appendices 142KAER: Approaches and Tools | 135 STEP 4 : REFER OVERVIEW In its 2015 report, the GSA Workgroup on Cognitive Impairment Detection and Earlier Diagnosis recommends that: All older adults who are found to have a diagnosis of dementia be referred to all appropriate and available community services and online resources to learn more about the disease process and how to prepare for the future with a dementia diagnosis (GSA, 2015). Specific community resources should include the closest Area Agency on Aging (AAA), the closest Aging and Disability Resource Center (ADRC), and, as appropriate, the local or regional chapter of the Alzheimer's Association or other Alzheimer's support organization and local or regional organizations representing different causes of dementia, such Lewy body disease and frontotemporal degeneration (GSA, 2015). Older adults with dementia and their families differ in many ways that affect the kinds of community services and other resources that will benefit them. The kinds of services that are available in particular communities also differ greatly. Few PCPs have the time or the detailed knowledge of community services and other resources that would be required to connect their older adult patients with dementia and the patients' families with the services and other resources they need. PCPs can, however, refer older adult patients with dementia and their families to agencies, organizations, and individuals that can assist them in determining exactly what kinds of help they need and finding and accessing that help. PCPs can also encourage their older adult patients with dementia and the patients' families to work with the identified agency, organization, or individual to find the needed help. Over time, PCPs can ask the patients and families whether they are receiving the help they need and, if appropriate, continue to encourage them to work with the identified agency, organization, or individual to find that help. As dementia progresses, the needs of the older adult with dementia and his or her family and other caregivers are likely to change. PCPs can acknowledge these changes and encourage the patient and family to work with the identified agency, organization, or individual to find help that meets the patient's changing needs. This section provides approaches and tools to help PCPs refer and connect their patients with dementia and the patients' families to agencies, organizations, and individuals that can assist them in identifying their needs and accessing help to meet those needs. The section assumes that PCPs generally will not go beyond this level of referrals because of time constraints and lack KAER: Approaches and Tools | 136 STEP 4 : REFER of the detailed knowledge of community resources that is required to match the specific needs of older adults with dementia and their families to appropriate community services and other resources. An important consideration in PCP referrals to agencies, organizations, and individuals that can provide assistance in identifying patient and family needs and accessing help to meet the needs is the extent to which the agencies, organizations, and individuals are knowledgeable about dementia and the care needs of people with dementia and their families. Efforts are currently underway in various communities and health care systems to increase knowledge about dementia and dementia-related care needs among organizations and individuals that provide assistance to older adults and families. PCPs cannot assume, however, that all agencies, organizations, and individuals that provide such assistance for older adults and families in general are knowledgeable about dementia and qualified to assist older adults with dementia and their families. KAER: Approaches and Tools | 137 STEP 4 : REFER APPROACHES Approaches for referring and connecting older adults with dementia and their families to agencies, organizations, and individuals that can assist them in identifying their needs and accessing help to meet those needs vary for PCPs working in different settings. Some PCPs work in physician group practices, health plans, and health care systems that have case managers, care managers, patient navigators, or other staff who assist primary care patients and their families in determining what kind of help they need and accessing the needed help. Other PCPs work in single PCP offices and other practice settings that do not have such staff. CONNECT OLDER PATIENTS WITH DEMENTIA TO ASSISTANCE IN THE PCP'S ORGANIZATION TO IDENTIFY NEEDS AND ACCESS HELP . Some physician group practices, health plans, and health care systems that have case managers, care managers, patient navigators, or other staff who assist primary care patients and their families in identifying their needs and accessing help to meet those needs limit this assistance to particular types of patients, often referred to as \"high risk\" patients, a term defined by the group practice, health plan, or health care system. PCPs who work in these practice settings should first find out whether patients with dementia are generally included among the types of patients who are eligible to receive assistance in identifying their needs and accessing help to meet those needs in the PCPs' practice setting. If so, the PCPs should learn the procedures for referring their patients with dementia and the patients' families for the assistance and use those procedures routinely for their patients with dementia. CONNECT OLDER PATIENTS WITH DEMENTIA TO COMMUNITY AGENCIES AND PROVIDERS TO IDENTIFY NEEDS AND ACCESS HELP . PCPs who work in single practitioner offices and other practice settings that do not have case managers or other staff to assist patients with dementia and their families in identifying their needs and accessing help should connect those patients and families to community and other organizations and individuals (often referred to as \"geriatric care managers\") that can provide this kind of assistance. Public agencies that provide such assistance for older adults with dementia and their families include AAA and ADRC. Private agencies, organizations, and individuals that provide this assistance KAER: Approaches and Tools | 138 STEP 4 : REFER differ in various communities and regions. Some of these agencies, organizations, and individuals serve older adults in general, including persons with dementia, and other agencies and individuals serve only persons with dementia. In many communities and regions, the closest AAA or ADRC may have a list of private agencies and individuals that provide assistance to older adults with dementia and their families in determining what kind of help they need and accessing that help. PCPs should have contact information for the nearest AAA, ADRC, and local or regional Alzheimer's Association chapter or other Alzheimer's support organization. Some Alzheimer's Association chapters and other Alzheimer's support organizations also provide assistance in determining needs and accessing services for older adults with other diseases and conditions that cause dementia, such as Lewy body disease, frontotemporal degeneration, and vascular conditions. Local and regional organizations that provide assistance targeted specifically for older adults with these other diseases and conditions also exist in some communities and regions, although they are less common than Alzheimer's organizations. The GSA Workgroup has developed a template (Appendix R1) that PCPs, physician group practices, health plans, and health care systems can complete to provide the contact information needed to support PCP referrals to community and regional agencies organizations and individuals. The template also includes a list of the types of community services and other resources people with dementia and family caregivers may need. PCPs may want to use examples of services and resources from this list to explain to patients with dementia and their families why the PCP is referring them to an agency, organization, or individual that can help them identify their specific needs and find services and other resources to meet those needs. Some national organizations provide assistance for people with dementia and their families in determining what kind of kind of help they need and finding that help. The Alzheimer's Association's national 24/7 Helpline is probably the best known of these sources (1-800- 272-3900). The Alzheimer's Association also has an online Community Resource Finder that can help people with dementia and their families identify their specific needs and find help. Other national organizations also provide telephone and online assistance to help people with dementia and their families find needed services. Often these national organizations are able to refer or connect people with dementia and families to community or regional agencies, organizations, and individuals that can provide assistance in identifying needs and finding help. This can be useful for PCPs who do not already have contact information for the relevant agencies, organizations, and individuals in their own community or region.KAER: Approaches and Tools | 139 STEP 4 : REFER Some local and regional Alzheimer's Association chapters and other Alzheimer's support organizations have telephone, email, or fax referral procedures that PCPs can use to connect older adult patients with dementia and patients' families to an organization that can help them identify their needs and access help. Alzheimer's Greater Los Angeles, an Alzheimer's support organization, has a referral program, ALZ Direct Connect, that PCPs and others can use to refer a person with dementia, family member, or personal representative to the organization for help in identifying needs and finding appropriate services and other resources. The ALZ Direct Connect referral form (Appendix R2) includes a place for the person, family, or personal representative to sign, thereby giving the PCP permission to forward that individual's contact information to Alzheimer's Greater Los Angeles. With this signature, the organization can contact the person, family member, or organization to begin working with that individual to identify needs and find needed services and other resources. Many other Alzheimer's support organizations, including many Alzheimer's Association chapters have similar programs. As noted earlier, PCPs cannot assume that all agencies, organizations, and individuals that provide general assistance to older adults and families in identifying needs and finding help are knowledgeable about dementia and qualified to assist older adults with dementia and their families. Efforts are currently underway in many communities to provide training about dementia and care, services, and supports for people with dementia for such agencies, organizations, and individuals. In Minnesota, for example, the state Board on Aging supported the development of a three-part, web-based training program for staff of the state's Senior LinkAge Line (the state's ADRC) to help them connect people with dementia and family caregivers to needed services and other resources; Appendix R3 describes the content of the training. Likewise, Alzheimer's Greater Los Angeles is providing training for case managers in local health plans that serve individuals eligible for both Medicare and MediCal (California's Medicaid program). A Dementia Care Management Toolkit has been developed for this purpose, accessible at http://www.alzgla.org/professionals/dementia-care-management-toolkit/, which includes a care needs assessment tool (Appendix R4) and more than 20 standardized care plans that case managers can use to identify problem areas and link families to community and other resources (Standardized Care Plans for Older Adults and Families, Appendix R5).KAER: Approaches and Tools | 140 STEP 4 : REFER MAINTAIN A LIST OF ONLINE RESOURCES AND REFER OLDER ADULTS AND FAMILIES TO RELEVANT RESOURCES. PCPs who work in any setting should have a list of online sources of information about dementia that will be useful for people with cognitive impairment and dementia and their families. The NIA's Alzheimer's Disease Education and Referral Center (ADEAR), the national Alzheimer's Association, the Alzheimer's Foundation of America, the Lewy Body Dementia Association, the Association for Frontotemporal Dementia, and many other national, regional, and local organizations maintain websites that contain valuable, usually downloadable, information about dementia and diseases and conditions that cause dementia. For people with dementia and families who are comfortable using the Internet, these websites offer an extensive array of valuable fact sheets and other information and materials they can access without leaving their homes. The large number of such websites, each with numerous potentially valuable fact sheets, information, and other materials, can be overwhelming, however, for many people with dementia, family members, and others. Appendix R6 provides examples of the available materials, with a primary focus on materials that could help older adults and family members understand and engage in the detection of cognitive impairment, diagnostic evaluation, and use of community services and other resources to meet their needs. PCPs may suggest that patients and/or families access one or more of the materials or PCPs may choose to have some of the materials printed so they can be given to patients and/or caregivers.KAER: Approaches and Tools | 141 STEP 4 : REFER PROVIDE GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT AND ENCOURAGE PARTICIPATION IN AVAILABLE CLINICAL TRIALS. PCPs who work in any setting should provide general information about clinical trials and encourage interested older adult patients with dementia and their families to use available online sources of specific information about such trials. Several sources provide information about clinical trials that are recruiting persons with dementia for studies of medications and other interventions for dementia and particular diseases and conditions that cause dementia. Some older adults with dementia and some family caregivers experience great emotional satisfaction from participating in such trials. Two of the sources of information about clinical trials are: The NIA's ADEAR Center website, Find Alzheimer's Disease and Related Clinical Trials, is a free online resource that allows users to search for relevant clinical trials being conducted in their geographic area. The Alzheimer's Association's Trial Match, is a free, online resource that matches persons with dementia, caregivers, and healthy volunteers to clinical trials in their geographic area. PCPs could recommend a 2014 NIA document on clinical trials, Participating in Alzheimer's Research: For Yourself and Future Generations, which is targeted to persons with dementia and families.

The last part of the template is a list of the types of community services and other resources people with dementia and family ca regivers may need. PCPs may want to use examples of services and resources from this list to explain to patients with dementia and their families why the PCP is referring them to an agency, organization, or individual that can help them identify their need s and access needed services and other resources . The first section of the template could be completed by the PCP or someone else in the PCP' s practice setting . Closest Area Agency on Aging (AAA) AAA name, phone number, email, and website To find the closest AAA, go to www.eldercare.gov ; type in the primary care office zip code or city and state, and click on \" search. \" On the page that comes up, scroll down in the box on the left, labelled \"show all,\" to select \"Area Agencies on Aging. \" Area Agencies on Aging are public or private non -profit agenc ies designated by the state to respond to needs of older people in the AAA's geographic area, which may be a city, several towns, a single county , or several counties. Some PCPs, physician group practices, health plans, and health care systems provide care for people in large geographic areas that may be served by more than one AAA. \"Area Agency on Aging \" is a generic term, and the name of a particular AAA may differ. Closest Aging and Disability Resource Center (ADRC) ADRC name, phone number, email, and website To find the closest ADRC , go to www.eldercare.gov ; type in the primary care office zip code or city and state, and click on \" search. \" On the page that comes up, click on th e box on the left, labelled \"show all, \" STEP 4 : APPENDIX R-1to select \"Aging and Disability Resource Centers. \" In some areas , the AAA and ADRC are in the same agency. ADRCs are one-stop centers intended to provide a single point of entry to the long -term care system. They provide information and assistance for older adults and indi viduals with disabilities who need either public or private long- term care services , professionals seeking assistance on behalf of their clients, and individuals planning for their future long -term care needs. ADRCs also serve as the entry point for publicly administered long -term services, including services funded by Medicaid, Older Americans Act, and state programs. Closest Alzheimer's Association Chapter Chapter name, phone number, email, and website To find the closes t Alzheimer's Association chapter, go to www.alz.org , and click on \"We Can Help. \" On the page t hat comes up, click on \"Local Chapters \" on the left, and then on \"chapter search. \" On the page that comes up next , titled \"In My Community, \" enter the primary care office zip code or state, or click on your state in the map. Alzheimer's Association chapters provide information, emotional support, and assistance , including referrals and help to connect with community services and other resources, for persons with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, their families, other caregivers , and the general public. Other Alzheimer's Support Organization Organization name, phone number, email, and website Some s tates and localities have Alzheimer's support organizations that provide services similar to th e services provided by Alzheimer's Association chapters , that is, information, emotional support, and assistance, including referrals and help to connect with community services and other resources for persons with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, their families, other caregivers , and the general public. Some Alzheimer's support organizations were previously Alzheimer's Association chapters. As of mid-2016, there is no national website that lists the organizations. A google search for \"Alzheimer's support organization \" in a particular locality identif ies these organizations in addition to the local or regional Alzheimer 's Association chapter, local Alzheimer's support groups , and other organizations. It is likely that the local AAA or ADRC (see above) can also provide the name and contact information for Alzheimer's support organizations in its jurisdiction , if any . STEP 4 : APPENDIX R-1Professional Geriatric Care Managers Names, phone number s, email addresses , and w ebsite s, if any The Aging Life Care Association (ALCA) , formerly the National Association of Professional Geriatric Care Managers , has a website that allows anyone to search by zip code or city and state for geriatric care manager s who are member s of the ALCA . The website provides contact information for geriatric care managers and shows their professional level and practice areas. It does not include information about the geriat ric care managers ' experienc e or expertis e in workin g with peopl e with dementi a or dementia family caregivers. The website is: http://www.aginglifecare.org/ALCA/About_Aging_Life_Care/Find_an_Aging_Life_Care_Expert/ALCA/Ab out_Aging_Life_Care/Search/Find_an_Expert.aspx. It is lik ely that the local AAA and ADRC (see above ) and som e Alzheimer's Association chapters and Alzheimer's support organizations will also be able to provide names and contact informati on for geriatric care managers in their geographic area. National Alzheimer's Association Organization name, phone number, email, and website The national Alzheimer's Associati on has a 24/7 telephone \"Helpline\" that people with dementia, family caregivers , and others can call with questions about community services and other resource s (1-800- 272- 3900). The \"Helpline\" can also link caller s to local and regional Alzheimer's Association chapters for furthe r assistance. The Alzheimer's Association also has an online \"Community Resource Finder \" that can help people with dementia and their families identify their specific needs and find needed community services and other resources (http://communityresourcefinder.org). Lewy Body Dementia Association Organization name, phone number, email, and website The national Lewy Body Dementia Associati on (LBDA ) has support group s in some localities across the country. Names and contact information for these support groups are available at https://www.lbda.org/lbd-l ocal-s upport-g roups. The GSA Workgroup is not aware, however, of o ther local or regional agencies, organizations , or individuals t hat provide assistance specifically for people with Lewy body dementia and their families in identifying t heir needs and accessing needed community services and other resources. Many Alzheimer' s Association chapter s and other Alzheimer' s support organizations provide this kind of assistance for people with Lewy body dementia and their families. AAAs and ADRCs in some localities may be able to provide contact information for other agencies, organizations, and individuals that provide assistance specifically fo r people with Lewy body dementia and their families in identifying needs and accessing needed community services and other resources. STEP 4 : APPENDIX R-1Association for Fro ntotemporal Degeneration Organization name, phone number, email, and website The national Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration (AFTD) has a telephone \"Helpline \" (1-866- info@theaftd.org ) The GSA Workgroup is not aware of local or regional agencies, organizations or individuals that provide assistance specifically for people with frontotemporal dementia and their families in identifying their needs and accessing needed community services and other r esources. Many Alzheimer's Association chapters and other Alzheimer's support organizations provide this kind of assistance for people with frontotemporal dementia and their families. AAAs and ADRCs in some localities may be able to provide contact infor mation for other agencies, organizations, and individuals that provide assistance specifically for people with frontotemporal dementia and their families in identifying needs and accessing needed community services and other resources. Vascular Dementia Organization name, phone number, email, and website The GSA Workgroup is not aware of local, regional , or national organizations that provide assistance specificall y for people with vascular dementia and their families in identify ing their needs and accessing community services and other resources to meet the needs. Many Alzheimer's Association chapters and other Alzheimer's support organizations provide this kind of assistance for people with vascular dementia and their families . In addition, some acute care and rehabilitation hospitals and health care systems have care managers who assist stroke patients and their famil ies to identify and access the services and other resources they need, and these case managers assist people with dementia caused by stroke. AAAs and ADRCs may be able to provide contact information for local and regional stroke clubs and other sources of assistance in identifying needs and community services and other resources for people with vascular dementia and their families. STEP 4 : APPENDIX R-1Types of Community Services and Other Resources That May Be Needed by People With Dementia and Their Family Caregivers As noted in the KAER toolkit, people with dementia and their families differ in many ways that affect the types of community services and other resources they need and will benefit them. The following list is intended to provide a broad overview of types of community services and other resources that may be needed by particular people with dementia and their families. The list is not comprehensive and may not include community services and resources that ar e important for some people with dementia and families. The list also does not include primary and acute medical care services. The large number of types of community services and other resources in the list below and the important differences among people with dementia and their families explain why it is so important for PCPs to connect patients with dementia and their families to agenc ies, organization s, or i ndividual s that can help them identify their specific needs and find community services and other resources to meet those needs. Adult Day Program s Adult Protective Services Assistance With Money Management Assistance With Shopping, Cooking, Cleaning, Laundry, and Other Household Activities Assistance With Taking Medications Assisted Living Residences Behavioral Symptom Management Chore Services Financial Support, Benefits Counseling , and Assistance With Applications for Benefits Grief Counseling Home Modifications Hospice Housing Information and Education About Dementia In-Home Skilled Nursing Legal Services Meals on Wheels Mental Health Services Nursing Homes Occupational Therapy Peer Support, Mentoring, and In - Person, Telephone, and Online Discussion Groups for the Person With Dementia Personal Care Assistance, Including Help With Bathing, Dressing, Eating, and Toileting Personal Emergency Response Systems Physical Exercise Physical Therapy Professional Counseling for the Person With Dementia and/or the Family Caregiver Recreation for the Person With Dementia, the Family Caregiver, or Both Respite Services Skill-Building Training About Dementia Care for Family and Other Caregivers Socialization, Including Formal Social Activities and Opportunities for Informal Socialization Speech and Language Therapy Support Groups for the Person With Dementia and the Family Caregiver Telephone Helplines STEP 4 : DIRECT CONNECT REFERRAL PROGRAM ...partnerin g with Healthcare and Aging Service Providers to improve care and s upport for people with Alzheimer's or dementias & their f amilies ALZ DIRECT CONNECT allows healthcare and aging services providers to directly link patients /clients and families to Alzheimer's Greater Los Angeles for: access to care coordination and psychosocial support referrals to supportive services (often at no cost) help with understanding the disease & navigat ing its progression a 360 approach to care through feedback to the referring provider ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS ?

DFA grew out of ACT on Alzheimer's, a statewide collaboration of government and private sector organizations and individuals that is intended to build Minnesota's capacity to respond to Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. ACT on Alzheimer's created clinical practice tools to help health care and social service providers and community- based organizations improve and coordinate care and services for people with dementia and their families. The ACT on Alzheimer's clinical practice tools have been adapted to address DFA's national perspective and audience. The three DFA clinical practice tools shown in the following appendices incorporate many of the same tools and approaches included in the KAER toolkit. In contrast to the KAER toolkit, which focuses primarily on dementia care provided by PCPs in primary care settings, the DFA tools encompass the broad continuum of dementia care delivered by an array of health care, social service, and community-based providers across care settings. The DFA tools include flow charts that cross the KAER steps and therefore, may be useful to PCPs, other health care providers, health plans, and health care systems as they think about and design systems of dementia care. CLINICAL PROVIDER PRACTICE TOOL, 2016 (Appendix DFA-1) This 6-page tool includes a flow chart for cognitive impairment identification; 1-page guidelines for dementia workup and management, assessment tools, management resources, and references. The tool also includes a 2-page fact sheet on disclosure of dementia diagnoses. CARE COORDINATION PRACTICE TOOL, 2016 (Appendix DFA-2) This 4-page tool includes a flow chart for cognitive impairment identification; a 2-page dementia care plan checklist; and a fact sheet on symptoms of mild cognitive impairment and symptoms and duration of early, middle, and late stage Alzheimer's disease. MANAGING DEMENTIA ACROSS THE CONTINUUM (MID TO LATE STAGE), 2015 (Appendix DFA 3) This 6-page tool describes nine tasks in managing care in the mid to late stages of dementia and provides resources to help care providers implement these tasks.

A majority of patients want to know if they have Alzheimer's Disease (AD) A recent 5-country survey 9 examining public attitudes about AD found that more than 80% of all adults (N=2,678) and 89% of US adults (N=639) responded that if they had memory or confusion symptoms, they would go to a doctor to determine if the cause was AD. This US finding is consistent with previously published reports over the last 2 decades. 10,11 Diagnosis does not cause psychological stress in most patients and their families Physician conjecture that a dementia diagnosis may lead to depression or even suicide has been reported. 12 Empirical findings on the issue are primarily limited to retrospective or review studies in populations with comorbid depression, a well-known risk factor for suicide. 13,14 To examine psychological stress, Carpenter and colleagues evaluated 90 individuals and their companions before a dementia evaluation and after dementia disclosure using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). 15 No clinically significant changes were noted in depressive symptoms in either the persons diagnosed with dementia or their companion (Figure 1). Anxiety decreased or remained unchanged after diagnostic feedback for most groups (Figure 2). Most family members appreciate the benefits of diagnosis Connell and colleagues surveyed 178 adults who had a family member with AD. More than 75% of family members rated the following benefits of diagnosis as being very or extremely important: 1) let family know what was wrong with relative; 2) allowed family to get information about AD; and 3) allowed family to plan for the future. Only 6% of all respondents strongly agreed that \"it is easier to not know what the diagnosis is.\" no dementia very mild dementia mild dementiaIn gaining knowledge and developing a treatment plan, individuals may realize that they can take an active role in managing the illness, enhancing a sense of self-efficacy where before they might have felt helpless. 4 \u00a9 2016 Page 5Increasing Disclosure of Dementia DiagnosisCLINICAL PRACTICE TOOLSADDENDUM : APPENDIX DFA-1References: Increasing Disclosure of Dementia Diagnosis 1.

Rule out delirium for any acute changes in behavioral expressions and other symptoms 2. Define and categorize the target behavioral expression and other symptom (Examples: hallucinations, delusions, physical aggression, spontaneous disinhibition, mood-related) Identify and address unmet need(s) (see Figure 1: Screening, Identifying, and Managing Behavioral Symptoms in Patients With Dementia on page 4) Only treat conditions that are bothersome or negatively affecting the quality of life of the person with the disease 3. Initiate non-pharmacologic therapies aimed at reducing the target symptom See Table 1: Potential Nonpharmacologic Strategies on page 5 See Table 2: General Nonpharmacologic Strategies for Managing Behavioral Symptoms on page 6 Give the patient \"tasks\" that match his/her level of competency Train caregivers to validate, redirect, and re-approach Reinforce that routine is essential Control the level of stimulation in the person's environment Be proactive: Write orders for non-pharmacologic interventions Ask caregivers to re-administer a behavior tool (e.g., Cohen Mansfield) to assess the efficacy of the therapy 4. Consider pharmacologic interventions only when non-pharmacologic interventions consistently fail and the person is in danger of doing harm to self or others, or when intolerable psychiatric suffering is evident Note there is no FDA-approved medication for Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD), nor strong scientific evidence to support any particular class of medications. If you use any medications, document informed consent in the medical record and counsel caregivers to monitor for degraded functional or cognitive status, sedation, falls or delirium. Regularly attempt to wean or discontinue the medication as soon as possible. Regularly monitor target behaviors to evaluate efficacy of medication, if started. Identify all prescriptions and over-the-counter medications being used, including vitamins and herbal remedies Avoid or minimize anticholinergics, hypnotics (benzodiazepines, zolpidem), H2-receptor antagonists, and antipsychotics Evaluate the medications for over and underuse and inappropriate prescribing Periodically reassess the value of any medications, including those being used for cognitive symptoms; consider a slow taper if continued benefit is unclear Recommend a care partner or health care professional oversees/dispenses medications as needed \u00a9 2015 Page 2Promote Positive Behavioral Health Optimize Medication Therapy Continue to discuss home safety and fall risk Refer to an occupational therapist and/or physical therapist, if indicated, to address fall risk, sensory/mobility aids and home modifications Continue to discuss safe driving Refer to driving rehabilitation specialist for clinical and/or in-vehicle evaluation Report an at-risk driverAssess Safety and DrivingCLINICAL PRACTICE TOOLSADDENDUM : APPENDIX DFA-3 Continue to discuss care goals, values and preferences with person with the disease and family Discuss the role of palliative care and hospice in addressing pain and suffering Encourage completion of healthcare directive and financial surrogacy documents Complete POLST, when appropriate (and routinely re-evaluate/modify plan of care as appropriate) Identify care partner/caregiver and assess needs Encourage self care of care partner Offer suggestions to the care partner for maintaining health and well-being Encourage caregiver support services (e.g., respite) in the care plan for the person with dementia Provide education on behavioral expressions and stages of dementia Report suspected abuse, neglect (including self neglect), or financial exploitation Under many state statutes, licensed health care professionals and professionals engaged in the care of a vulnerable adult are mandated to report suspected maltreatment of a vulnerable adult Visit the Eldercare Locator at www.eldercare.gov or call 1-800-677-1116 to get connected to aging services such as financial assistance, home delivered meals, transportation, adult day services and long-term care options in every community across the US.
