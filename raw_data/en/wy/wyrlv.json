So, if you are looking for natural and eco-friendly vegan personal care products that align with your values, read this unsponsored Faith in Nature Products review to find out why this brand is a very good choice. Pros Cons Still not convinced? You can find out more about these lovely natural products by reading Vegan Mum's full Faith in Nature products review below. A clean brand with a great range of products containing natural ingredients Faith in Nature products use natural, organic ingredients wherever possible. There is always a balance to be struck between the use of organic ingredients and the price of a product, and Faith in Nature seem to have found a happy medium which means they remain good value for money. Whilst I would love everything to be organic, I appreciate it does not make for an affordable product. They are also free from parabens and SLS (Sodium Lauryl Sulfate - see FAQs below) which is great. In spite of not using this ingredient, which helps products to foam, I found that [Faith in Nature's Body Wash](https://www.faithinnature.co.uk/collections/body-wash) lathers really well and leaves a clean, fresh fragrance that isn't overpowering. It doesn't dry out my skin either. Their range of 100% natural fragrances (using essential oils) is good too, and includes: I also tried [Faith in Nature's Hand and Body Lotion](https://www.faithinnature.co.uk/collections/all?filter.p.m.custom.product=Hand%20%26%20Body%20Lotion) in preparation for this Faith in Nature Products review, which comes in the first 3 fragrances listed above. It is absorbed easily, doesn't feel greasy and again, leaves a very pleasant, light fragrance. Where they do use more controversial ingredients, like palm oil for example, Faith in Nature are very honest about it. They have an interesting section on their website about their commitment to the [quality and origins of their ingredients](https://tidd.ly/3HlTOi8). Faith in Nature have a wide range of other natural products including: Overall, Faith in Nature is a clean and ethical brand, using good quality, natural ingredients. It's vegan and cruelty-free too (otherwise I wouldn't be writing this Faith in Nature Products review!) British Company with products made in the UK In terms of sustainability, this is always a plus for me. I cannot believe that any product shipped halfway around the world to our bathrooms can have a great carbon footprint. I'm sure there are people out there who might correct me on that, but that is simply what my logic tells me. Faith in Nature products are all manufactured in the UK. Apart from the logistics of shipping products, I am also happier that we therefore have a good idea about the working conditions of the people involved in the manufacturing process. Whilst wages could always do with being higher in the UK, and working conditions better, I worry even more about products made in countries where the workforce is pretty much invisible and where employment rights might be lower than our own. With so many companies outsourcing their manufacturing overseas, I like to support a British company that has kept its production in the UK. Family-owned company, woman founder With the best will in the world, companies can lose their soul when they get too big. I'm sure there are some that have managed to retain their values and hold onto their original vision, but I suspect they are few. That's why I think family-owned businesses have an important place in the world. Whilst it certainly doesn't guarantee an ethical business, I believe it is more likely to retain its sense of purpose. That seems to be the case with Faith in Nature and you can read an interview with the founder, [Rivka Rose](https://www.womentalking.co.uk/rivka-rose-faith-in-nature/) if you'd like to know more about how they were founded in the 1970s, and how the business has progressed since then. Could still be more eco-friendly I do like Faith in Nature and their products. I believe that they are sincere in their wish to be more environmentally friendly. Their efforts include: - Recyced and recyclable containers - Filling stations around the country - 5 litre refill bottles of many products - zero plastic soap, shampoo and conditioner bars So, Faith in Nature are working towards being more environmentally friendly, but there is still a lot of plastic being used here, even if it is the most environmentally friendly sort. And there are some of their competitors who are pioneering different packaging - for example, the Body Shop offers aluminium containers for its shampoo and conditioner refills. It would be great to see Faith in Nature joining the race to find a better alternative. I appreciate Faith in Nature's efforts though, and now that they have appointed 'Nature' as one of their Directors, I hope to see more progress in this area. For now, however, that is why I have rated them as a 4.5/5 in this Vegan Mum Faith in Nature Products review. You can read my verdict on Faith in Nature's soap bars in my [7 Best Vegan Soap Bars Review](https://veganmum.uk/lifestyle/best-vegan-soap-bars-in-the-uk/) if you'd like to know a little more about some of their plastic-free offerings. Vegan Mum's Conclusion of this Faith in Nature Products Review I've become a big fan of Faith in Nature products. All of the products I have used have a natural feel to them, but without compromising on effectiveness and quality. The fragrances were a revelation; they don't overpower your senses, but work in harmony with them instead. And there really seems to be a fragrance to suit every mood, whether it's zingy [Grapefruit and Orange](https://www.faithinnature.co.uk/collections/all?filter.p.m.custom.fragrance=Grapefruit%20%26%20Orange) to waken up your senses, or the warmer, more sensual [Wild Rose](https://www.faithinnature.co.uk/collections/all?filter.p.m.custom.fragrance=Wild%20Rose) for those times when self-care is all important. The [soap bars](https://www.faithinnature.co.uk/collections/all?filter.p.m.custom.product=Soap) are a regular here at Vegan Mum as well. We stopped using liquid hand soaps some time ago and these soap bars are effective, lather well and are reasonably priced too. They also keep their shape and don't end up in a gooey mess like some soap bars. So their personal care range is great, with products from [shampoo and conditioner](https://www.faithinnature.co.uk/collections/all?filter.p.m.custom.product=Shampoo) to [body wash](https://www.faithinnature.co.uk/collections/all?filter.p.m.custom.product=Body%20Wash) and soap bars. But the great thing is, they also have a range of products for your dog, your washing up and your laundry! And again, my experience of all these products has been very positive - Coco has (almost) enjoyed bath time with [Faith in Nature's dog shampoo](https://www.faithinnature.co.uk/collections/all?filter.p.m.custom.product=Dog), I have (almost) enjoyed washing up with [Faith in Nature's washing up liquid](https://www.faithinnature.co.uk/collections/washing-up), and (almost) enjoyed doing the laundry with [Faith in Nature's laundry liquid](https://www.faithinnature.co.uk/collections/laundry)! But joking aside, like their personal care range, these have all been good quality, effective and reasonably-priced products that are more environmentally-friendly than most - and with lovely fragrances! So overall, I hope this Faith in Nature products review demonstrates that this brand is a good choice for anyone wanting to purchase personal care items that match their vegan, eco-friendly values, at a reasonable price. And of course, they are all suitable for non-vegans too! Where can you buy Faith in Nature Products? Faith in Nature are available widely in different retail stores and online. However, to benefit from great deals and have access to their full range, I'd recommend buying directly online from the [Faith in Nature website](https://www.faithinnature.co.uk/collections/all). FAQs SLS - sodium lauryl sulphate - is a surfactant commonly used as a cleansing and foaming agent. You can read about SLS on the [Healthline website](https://www.healthline.com/health/beauty-skin-care/what-is-sodium-lauryl-sulfate) if you'd like to know more about this surfactant and its use in personal care products. Faith in Nature is an ethical British company whose products are vegan, cruelty-free, contain zero nasty chemicals, are SLS and Parabens-free, and without any synthetic fragrances. Where possible, they use organic ingredients too. No, not all Faith in Nature products are plastic-free. However, they do have a range of shampoo bars and hand soaps that are packaged only in cardboard, making these a much more eco-friendly choice.
