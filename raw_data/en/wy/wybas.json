Primary Objectives - To compare each investigational arm versus standard of care (SOC) for superiority in overall survival in 1st and/or 2nd line metastatic pancreatic cancer patients and determine which, if any, patients benefit from each investigational arm. Secondary Objectives - To determine short and long-term safety signals of each investigational arm in pancreatic cancer patients vs. SOC. - To determine progression-free survival (PFS) for each investigational arm vs. SOC. - Rates of overall response, CR, and PR; duration of overall response, CR or PR (whichever occurs first). - Rate of clinical benefit; duration of clinical benefit. Official Title Precision Promise Platform Trial for Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer Details Precision Promise is a multi-center, seamless Phase 2/3 platform trial designed to evaluate multiple regimens in [metastatic pancreatic cancer](../pancreatic-cancer). The goal of the platform is to find effective therapies for pancreatic cancer. The platform will rapidly and efficiently test multiple novel drugs and combinations compared to standard of care therapy in first and second metastatic patients. Bayesian response-adaptive randomization will be used to assign patients to arms based on their performance in subtypes of the disease.

If this is not the case, an HIV viral load test should be performed at screening and be negative (i.e., undetectable). - HBV-infected subjects are eligible if the most recent viral load test performed within six months of screening (based on medical chart review) is negative. If this is not the case, an HBV viral load test should be performed at screening and be negative (i.e., undetectable). - Subjects with a history of [hepatitis](../hepatitis)C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated and cured. Subjects with [HCV infection](../hepatitis-c)who are currently on treatment are eligible if the most recent viral load test performed within six months of screening (based on medical chart review) is negative. If this is not the case, an HCV viral load test should be performed at screening and be negative (i.e., undetectable). - Subjects with a history of [brain metastases](../brain-metastasis)are eligible provided they show evidence of stable lesions (and no new lesions) with no evidence of tumor progression for at least 4 weeks after CNS-directed treatment, as ascertained by clinical examination and brain imaging (MRI or CT) during the screening period.
