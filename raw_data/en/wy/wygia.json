All Marketplace plans cover treatment for pre-existing medical conditions and can't terminate coverage due to a change in health status, including diagnosis or treatment of COVID-19. - Check with your health insurance company for their specific benefits and coverage policy. COVID-19 vaccines All Marketplace plans currently cover the updated COVID-19 vaccine. The updated vaccine targets the original COVID-19 viral strain and 2 Omicron variants (BA.4/BA.5). The updated vaccine is available from: - Pfizer-BioNTech for anyone 5 years and older - Moderna for anyone 6 months and older If you've never had a COVID-19 vaccine shot - Most people who are unvaccinated can get 1 shot of the updated vaccine, instead of multiple shots of the original COVID-19 vaccine. - Children 6 months through 5 years of age who are unvaccinated can get either: - 2 shots of the updated Moderna vaccine if they're 6 months through 5 years of age - 3 shots of the updated Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine if they're 6 months through 4 years of age - 1 shot of the updated Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine if they're 5 years of age If you've already had at least 1 COVID-19 vaccine shot - Most people (depending on age) who completed their primary series with the original COVID-19 vaccine but haven't received the updated vaccine, can get 1 shot. - Anyone 65 years or older who received 1 shot of the updated vaccine at least 4 months ago, can get a second shot. - Most people who are immunocompromised (like if you had an organ transplant and are at risk for infections and other diseases) and got 1 shot of the updated vaccine at least 2 months ago, can get a second shot. Your health care provider can determine if and when you should get additional shots of the updated vaccine. - Children 6 months through 5 years who received 1-3 shots of the original COVID-19 vaccine can get the updated COVID-19 vaccine. The number of shots from the updated COVID-19 vaccine they can get depends on the vaccine and the number of shots already received. Note: Some adults 18 years and older who have completed their primary vaccine series have the option to get a Novavax vaccine instead of the updated Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. [Visit CDC.gov to learn more about the Novavax vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/s1019-novavax.html).
