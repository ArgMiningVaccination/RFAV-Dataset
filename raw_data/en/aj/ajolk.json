Estimates and Appropriations The following table compares on a summary basis the appropriations, including trust funds for fiscal year 2023, the budget request for fiscal year 2023, and the Committee recommendation for fiscal year 2023 in the accompanying bill. 2023 LABOR, HHS, EDUCATION BILL [Discretionary funding in thousands of dollars] ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Fiscal Year-- 2023 Committee compared to-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Budget Activity 2023 2022 Enacted 2023 Budget Committee 2022 Enacted 2023 Budget ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Department of Labor............. $13,189,218 $14,900,363 General Summary of the Bill For fiscal year 2023, the Committee recommends a total of $224,399,000,000 in current year discretionary funding--the 302(b) allocation--and $242,105,000,000 in overall programmatic funding, including offsets and adjustments. The fiscal year 2023 recommendation is an increase of $28,536,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. The Labor-HHS-Education bill supports some of the nation's most critical programs that touch individuals and families throughout their lifespan, from Early Head Start to Social Security. Through this bill, the Committee continues to build on progress from the fiscal year 2022 Consolidated Appropriations Act, such as significant investments in education, including strong funding increases for schools serving students in low- income communities and students with disabilities, as well as programs to expand access to post-secondary education. The fiscal year 2023 Labor-HHS-Education bill continues to build on investments in public health, including flexible resources for State and local governments to strengthen core public health infrastructure and capacity. And the bill continues to build on progress in biomedical research-- following a 50 percent increase in funding for the National Institutes of Health over the past seven years--and expands the subcommittee's investment in the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H), which was established in fiscal year 2022, to accelerate the pace of scientific breakthroughs that have the potential to transform health care and address our most complex health challenges. The bill continues to address our nation's most urgent health crises, including maternal health, mental health, gun violence, and substance misuse, while making strides to reduce persistent and unacceptable health disparities. And the Committee invests in workforce training and worker protection agencies, including significant new investments to rebuild capacity to enforce federal labor laws to protect workers' paychecks, benefits, and ensure the health and safety of our workplaces. The Committee also makes a major commitment to retired workers by including an increase of $1,100,000,000 for the Social Security Administration's operating expenses, which will restore federal capacity to provide earned benefits and services through Social Security, one of the cornerstones of the federal safety net. Some of the most notable initiatives in fiscal year 2023 include: Elementary and Secondary Education The Committee is committed to increasing investments in core Federal programs that support high-quality public education opportunities for all students. Our nation's public schools serve more than 50 million children, more than 50 percent of whom come from low-income families. Research shows that low-income students are more likely to struggle academically and often attend high-need schools with fewer resources, less experienced teachers, and more limited access to advanced coursework. At the same time, there is overwhelming empirical evidence on education spending and student outcomes that finds more funding in schools yields statistically significant positive results for students. Overall, the Committee recommendation provides $50,918,030,000 for Federal K-12 education programs, including the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), an increase of $8,333,798,000 over the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. The recommendation is a 20 percent increase over last year. In particular, the Committee recommends an additional $3,000,000,000 over the fiscal year 2022 enacted level for Title I Grants to Local Educational Agencies for a total of $20,536,802,000. Title I serves an estimated 25 million students in nearly 90 percent of school districts and nearly 60 percent of all public schools. The Committee recommends $1,000,000,000 for the English Language Acquisition program, which provides formula grants to States to serve English Leaners (EL), an increase of $168,600,000 over the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. Federal data shows that significant achievement gaps exist between ELs and their peers. At the same time, many States and school districts have experienced rapid growth in their EL populations. Providing increased resources to improve educational quality for EL students is a top priority for the Committee. The Committee recommends $16,259,193,000 for IDEA Part B Grants to States, which is $2,915,489,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. The Committee is concerned that the Federal share of the excess cost of educating students with disabilities has declined and notes the critical role this increase will play in helping to reverse this trend and serve as a significant step toward fully funding IDEA. Early Childhood Education The Committee includes nearly $20,000,000,000 for early childhood education programs through the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG), Head Start, and Preschool Development Grants--an increase of $2,420,000,000 over the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. The Committee recognizes that child care and early learning investments are essential for children and working families, and includes a $1,000,000,000 increase for the CCDBG program. This funding will provide critical support to families by providing affordable, high quality child care to more children, providing opportunities for more parents to remain in or return to the workforce, and supporting the child care workforce, which is primarily made up of women, and particularly women of color. The bill includes an increase of $1,360,000,000 for Head Start, including a $596,000,000 cost-of-living adjustment for the Head Start workforce, $262,000,000 in flexible, quality improvement funding for program-specific needs, and $500,000,000 to expand Head Start, Early Head Start, and Early Head Start-Child Care Partnerships to approximately 30,000 additional infants and toddlers from low-income families. The Committee further recommends $350,000,000, an increase of $60,000,000, for Preschool Development Grants to build State and local capacity to provide early childhood care and education for children birth through five from low- and moderate-income families. Higher Education In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, college affordability and access are vital to our nation's recovery efforts. Therefore, the Committee recommendation makes necessary investments in programs supporting student financial aid, student support services, and other programs supporting institutions of higher education and their students. The recommendation includes sufficient funding to support an increase in the maximum Pell Grant by $500 over the fiscal year 2022 enacted level, from $6,895 to $7,395. In addition, the Committee recommendation provides $1,243,882,000 for Federal Work Study, an increase of $33,882,000 over the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. The Committee recommendation also includes $920,000,000 for the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants, an increase of $25,000,000 over the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. The Committee recommendation includes $1,297,761,000 for the TRIO programs, an increase of $160,761,000 over the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. The recommendation also includes $408,000,000 for the Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs, which is $30,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. In an effort to assist postsecondary institutions in addressing barriers in completion and attainment, the Committee recommendation includes a total of $1,110,117,000 for programs that serve high proportions of students of color (Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic-Serving Institutions, Tribal Colleges and Universities, and other Minority Serving Institutions), an increase of $225,000,001 over the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. The Committee also includes robust funding to support teacher preparation. The recommendation includes $30,000,000 in funding for the Augustus F. Hawkins Centers of Excellence program, an increase of $22,000,000 over the fiscal year 2022 enacted level, and the recommendation includes $132,092,000 for the Teacher Quality Partnerships program, an increase of $73,000,000 over the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. Public Health Public health can no longer only get attention during a crisis. The Committee recognizes that State, local, territorial, and Federal public health partners need a long- term strategy and long-term investments, beginning at CDC. The bill includes approximately $10,500,000,000 for CDC, an increase of more than $2,000,000,000. Half of the increase included in the bill is directed to core capacities, as CDC's budget must be rebalanced between disease- or condition-specific activities and fundamental activities that support the nation's public health ecosystem. Building on funding initially provided in fiscal year 2022, the bill includes an increase of $550,000,000 for public health infrastructure to turn the tide on the nation's public health capacity by providing a stable source of disease-agnostic funding so the nation's State, local, territorial, and Federal public health agencies will be better equipped to coordinate together to save lives. This bill also includes core capacity increases of: $45,000,000 for Public Health Workforce and Career Development to invest in essential public health workers who protect our communities and are empowered by science; $150,000,000 for Public Health Data Modernization to advance the transformation of the collection and utilization of public health data from retrospective reporting to driving action in real time; $10,000,000 to advance laboratory science and safety so CDC is capable of meeting evolving health threats and maintaining the highest standards; $10,000,000 for the National Center for Health Statistics to initiate investments in the next generation of surveys; $100,000,000 for Global Public Health Protection to modernize and expand disease surveillance and response capabilities to strengthen global health security; and $50,000,000 for the Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics to improve preparedness and response. Biomedical Research through NIH and ARPA-H The Committee has increased NIH funding by nearly $15,000,000,000, or 49 percent, over the past seven years, under both Democratic and Republican leadership. The Committee continues and accelerates this investment by providing $47,459,000,000, an increase of $2,500,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level for NIH research and activities. The Committee continues its ongoing support for key NIH initiatives, such as the Cancer Moonshot, BRAIN Initiative, and the All of Us Precision Medicine Initiative. The bill also includes sufficient funding to provide an across-the-board increase of at least 3.2 percent for NIH Institutes and Centers. The Committee remains concerned that targeted funding for specific research initiatives in recent years has slowed the growth in other areas of basic research that may lead to unforeseeable scientific breakthroughs. The Committee also established the Advanced Projects Research Agency for Health (ARPA-H) in fiscal year 2022. Modeled after the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA), ARPA-H will invest in large high-risk, high-reward research projects that have the potential to achieve breakthroughs in the treatment of diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and others that impact the lives of millions of Americans and exacerbate existing health disparities. The Committee provides $2,750,000,000 for ARPA-H in fiscal year 2023, an increase of $1,750,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level, to accelerate these critical research projects. Mental and Behavioral Health The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated existing mental health and substance use disorder crises, with more people reporting increased levels of anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, and substance use. In particular, more than a third of high school students reported experiencing poor mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Suicide continues to be a leading cause of death, taking more than 45,000 lives in 2020, and is the second leading cause of death among youth between the ages of 10 and 14. Drug overdose deaths have also continued to increase with CDC estimating more than 107,000 drug overdose deaths in the United States during 2021, an increase of nearly 15 percent from 2020, according to provisional data. The Committee recommendation includes $9,170,380,000 for the Substance Use And Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), making a range of investments across the behavioral health continuum to support prevention, screening, treatment, and other services. The Committee includes a total increase of $1,726,062,000 for mental health activities. This includes an increase of $500,000,000 for the Mental Health Block Grant and an increase of $85,000,000 for Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics. In addition, the Committee includes a significant increase of $640,280,000 for the new three-digit 988 program, including the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and behavioral health crisis response infrastructure, which is scheduled for rollout in July 2022. The bill also increases the mental health crisis set-aside to ten percent and creates a new set-aside for prevention and early intervention. The Committee includes $60,000,000, an increase of $50,000,000 over the fiscal year 2022 enacted level, for the second year of the Mental Health Crisis Response Grant program, to help communities continue to create mobile crisis response teams that divert the response for mental health crises from law enforcement to behavioral health teams. The bill supports children's mental health with a $68,113,000 increase to the National Child Traumatic Stress Initiative, a $20,000,000 increase for Infant and Early Childhood Mental Health, and an additional $100,000,000 for Children's Mental Health services, including a new pilot program to address the impact of violence in communities of color. The Committee includes a total increase of $871,452,000 for substance use treatment activities. This includes an increase of $500,000,000 for the Substance Use Prevention and Treatment Block Grant and an increase of $250,000,000 for State Opioid Response Grants. The bill creates a new set-aside within the block grant to support recovery services. The Committee recommendation also includes an increase of $30,215,000 for substance use prevention services and activities. The bill also includes a significant investment in recruiting and training mental and behavioral health professionals to expand access to quality mental health and substance use disorder treatment services to areas and populations most in need, including an increase of $62,000,000 for HRSA's Behavioral Health Workforce Education and Training activities. Maternal Health To help eliminate race-based disparities and drive down the rate of maternal mortality, the bill provides an increase of $60,000,000 for CDC's Safe Motherhood and Infant Health programs. This funding allows for the expansion of Maternal Mortality Review Committees and Perinatal Quality Collaboratives, and for increased support to current States and territories, as well as increased support for other programs including Sudden Unexplained Infant Death. The bill provides an increase of $120,000,000 for HRSA's Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant, which includes investments in projects such as an increase of $10,000,000 for State Maternal Health Innovation Grants, an increase of $3,300,000 to expand the Alliance for Innovation in Maternal Health Safety Bundles to more States, and an increase of $3,000,000 to support and expand availability of the Maternal Mental Health Hotline. The bill also provides $30,000,000 to recruit and train midwives and doulas and an increase of $5,000,000 for Screening and Treatment for Maternal Depression and Related Disorders. HIV Initiative Advances in medications for the prevention and treatment of HIV, improved diagnostic tests, and new outbreak detection technology provide a unique opportunity to alter the trajectory of HIV infection rates in the U.S. with a goal of eliminating new HIV infections. This bill provides a total of $738,000,000, which is an increase of $225,000,000 for the fourth year of the Ending the HIV Epidemic Initiative, which began a new era of moving the U.S. from HIV prevention to HIV epidemic control. Firearm Injury and Mortality Prevention Research Firearm injury and mortality is among the leading causes of death for people aged 1-64 in the U.S. In 2019, there were nearly 40,000 firearm-related deaths in the U.S. Addressing the gaps in knowledge around this issue and identifying effective prevention strategies are needed steps toward keeping people, families, schools, and communities safe from firearm injury. In fiscal year 2020, the Committee provided the first funding in more than two decades to address the public health emergency of firearm violence with a total of $25,000,000 to CDC and NIH. This bill more than doubles the total funding to $60,000,000 to support research to identify the most effective ways to prevent firearm related injuries and deaths, and to broaden firearm injury data collection. Building on these efforts to address firearm injury and death, this bill also includes $100,000,000 for a new evidence-based community violence intervention initiative at CDC, which aims to prevent intentional violence, such as mass casualty violence or gang violence. Employment and Training The economy and the labor market have seen significant gains since the economic recession resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The U.S. economy has added 6.5 million jobs over the past year and the unemployment rate, which peaked at 14.7 percent two years ago, is now down to 3.6 percent. Despite the strong labor market, however, economic opportunity remains hard to reach for millions in communities around the country. The unemployment rate for Black and Hispanic workers remains considerably higher than that of the overall population, and far too many women have been pushed out of the workforce or forced to consider new employment over the last two years. We must prioritize our workers and their wages as the nation emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, the Committee recommendation includes needed investments in workforce and training systems. Specifically, the recommendation includes $3,135,332,000 for Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act Grants to States, an increase of $256,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and $116,230,000 above the fiscal year 2023 budget request. In addition, the recommendation includes $303,000,000 for registered apprenticeships, an increase of $68,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2023 budget request. The recommendation also includes $100,000,000 for the Strengthening Community Colleges Training Grant program, an increase of $50,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and equal to the fiscal year 2023 budget request. This program helps community colleges build capacity for training workers. The recommendation includes $50,000,000 for a new grant program to support communities suffering dislocations related to changes in fossil fuel and other energy industries. The recommendation also includes $3,184,635,000 for Unemployment Compensation State Operations, an increase of $333,819,000 over the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2023 budget request. This funding will help support States in overcoming challenges associated with administering unemployment insurance programs. Altogether, these investments will continue to support families with the economic consequences of COVID-19 and prepare workers for new employment opportunities. Worker Protection Agencies The Committee recommends $2,179,524,000 for Department of Labor agencies responsible for worker protection and worker rights. This is an increase of $346,589,000 over the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. The Wage and Hour Division employs fewer investigators today than it did 75 years ago, despite the workforce having grown significantly in that time. To help make up for this lost ground, hold bad-acting employers accountable, and defend working people so they receive the pay they earned and are legally entitled to, the Committee recommendation includes $312,678,000, an increase of $61,678,000 over the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and an increase of $5,000,000 over the fiscal year 2023 budget request. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) enforcement of safety and health laws is critical to preventing workplace tragedies from occurring, which is why it is concerning that, under current staffing levels, the agency would need more than 150 years to inspect each workplace under its jurisdiction. To restore OSHA's enforcement capacity, the Committee includes $712,015,000, an increase of $100,000,000 over the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and $10,610,000 over the fiscal year 2023 budget request for this critical worker protection agency. The Committee also recommends $319,424,000 for the National Labor Relations Board, an increase of $45,200,000 over the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. This increase will restore the NLRB's capacity to protect workers' rights to union representation and collective bargaining. POLICY HEARINGS The Committee continued to fulfill its responsibility to conduct oversight of programs under its jurisdiction by holding nine subcommittee hearings--including four budget hearings and three policy hearings, as well as subcommittee hearings to take testimony from Members of Congress and public witnesses. Social and Emotional Learning and Whole Child Approaches in K-12 Education The Subcommittee held a hearing on ``Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) and Whole Child Approaches in K-12 Education,'' during which the Subcommittee heard from a panel of national experts on the robust evidence of effectiveness for whole child interventions, including SEL. The Subcommittee focused on how high-quality SEL programs that support students' social, emotional, and cognitive development result in lasting positive academic and life outcomes. In addition, the Subcommittee explored how dedicated Federal resources for these approaches are vital to expanding their reach nationwide. Healthy Aging: Maximizing the Independence, Well-Being, and Health of Older Adults The Subcommittee held a hearing to discuss some of the top health issues facing seniors, with a particular focus on the importance of senior nutrition, elder justice, mental health, and falls prevention programs. The Subcommittee recognizes that the country's senior population is growing, and that the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies bill funds several key agencies, including the Administration for Community Living (ACL), CDC, and SAMHSA, that provide direct services to support seniors' independence, health, and overall well-being. The Committee heard from four aging experts about some of the most significant challenges to healthy aging, and the need for specialized prevention, treatment, and support services to support seniors' physical and mental well-being. Tackling Teacher Shortages The Subcommittee held a hearing on ``Tackling Teacher Shortages,'' during which the Subcommittee heard from a panel of national experts on the scope and severity of nationwide teacher shortages. The Subcommittee discussed root causes of teacher shortages and explored acute challenges with the retention and recruitment of educators of color and special educators. In addition, the Subcommittee identified strategies to help rebuild educator pipelines and address shortages and highlight needed investments in programs funded in this bill that support educator pipelines and address challenges related to recruitment and retention.

The Committee recommendation includes $100,000,000, an increase of $50,000,000 over the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and is the same as the fiscal year 2023 budget request, for Strengthening Community College Training Grants to support a new grant competition. This funding will continue to help better align workforce development efforts with postsecondary education and build off lessons learned from the Trade Adjustment Assistance Community College and Career Training Grant program. The Committee continues to direct the Department to follow the program requirements as laid out in House Report 116-62, except that the 120 day requirement for the solicitation shall not apply. The Committee recommendation also includes $50,000,000 for a new program designed to assist communities experiencing dislocations occurring in fossil fuel and other energy related industries. A part of the Interagency Working Group on Coal and Power Plant Communities and Economic Revitalization, this program builds upon the Obama Administration's POWER+ initiative and is intended to support the economic well-being of workers and communities impacted by changes in the coal, oil, gas, and other industries. The Committee strongly encourages continued investment in areas with high rates of unemployment and substance use disorder impacted by the loss of employment in the coal industry. This industry has experienced significant employment reduction in the past decade and sustained investment to transition workers to new industries is necessary to offset challenging economic conditions. The Committee is aware of the high, unmet demand for cybersecurity and software development skills in both the Department of Defense (DoD) and the private sector and appreciates the Secretary's attention to this priority. Given the high wages and job security associated with jobs in these areas, combined with the benefits for national security and the economy at large, the Committee directs the Secretary to utilize appropriate discretionary or mandatory funds available for the purpose of high skill job training to establish grants for qualified training and educational institutions to help increase training capacity to meet this demand. The Department is also strongly encouraged to coordinate with partners within the DoD to ensure the program is effectively targeted to meet existing needs. The Committee includes $5,000,000 for the Department of Labor to establish an Automation Impacted Industries Pilot Program to award competitive grants to industry or sector partnerships to support demonstration and pilot projects relating to the training needs of workers who are, or are likely to become, dislocated workers as a result of automation. Under this program, grantees may use the funds for one or more of the following: 1) Providing training services, which may include training services that prepare workers for in-demand industry sectors or occupations; 2) providing assistance for employers in developing a staff position for an individual who will be responsible for supporting training services provided under the grant; 3) purchasing equipment or technology necessary for training services; 4) providing job search and other transitional assistance to workers in industries with high rates of job loss; 5) providing a training stipend to workers for training services; 6) providing integrated education and training. The Committee provides $45,000,000 for the Workforce Opportunity for Rural Communities program, to provide enhanced worker training in the Appalachian, Delta, and Northern Border regions. The Committee encourages the Department to develop demonstration and pilot programs that facilitate education and training programs in the field of advanced manufacturing. Eligible entities include local educational entities (e.g., technical college, community college, a manufacturing extension center, or an entity that assists educationally underserved communities) partnering with manufacturers that employ individuals who have advanced manufacturing skills. These programs should (1) develop skills and competencies of workers in communities with expected growth in advanced manufacturing; (2) provide education and training for available and anticipated jobs in advanced manufacturing; (3) educate individuals about career advancement opportunities within advanced manufacturing; (4) strengthen community college partnerships with manufacturing extension centers and advanced manufacturing businesses in an effort to meet the needs of businesses for adaptability in training of workers; and (5) give priority to incumbent workers, dislocated workers, and unemployed individuals. The Committee recognizes that the environmental health workforce is vital to protecting the health and safety of the public. The Committee encourages the Secretary, in coordination with Federal, State, local, and tribal government agencies, and private-sector and nongovernmental entities, to develop model standards and guidelines for credentialing environmental health workers. The Committee further encourages the Secretary to develop a comprehensive and coordinated plan for developing the environmental health workforce to meet national needs. This plan should include performance measures to more clearly determine the extent to which these programs and activities are meeting the Department's strategic goal of strengthening the environmental health workforce; identify any gaps between existing programs and activities and future environmental health workforce needs; identify actions to address such identified gaps; and identify any additional statutory authority that is needed by the Department to implement such identified actions. The Committee requests this plan no later than 360 days after the date of enactment of this Act. The Committee recognizes that there is a significant number of immigrants that arrive in America, fluent in English and holding degrees and credentials in health care from their home countries. Because of the significant barriers of translating these foreign certifications into required American certifications, many immigrants are underemployed, resulting in a lower quality of life and contributing to the shortage of health care professionals. The Committee recommends that the Secretary of Labor release guidance that identifies ways to bridge the gap between unemployed immigrants and health care professions. The Committee supports efforts by organizations to advance worker training for individuals who are survivors of abuse, abandonment, or trauma. The Committee further supports worker training projects that provide wraparound services to these individuals and recognizes the value and need to support the ``whole'' worker, including access to new clothing, shoes, home essentials, family hygiene items, relevant worker resources, and life skill classes to foster healing and create long-term goals. Native Americans.--For the Indian and Native American programs, the Committee recommends $63,800,000, which is $6,800,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2023 budget request. Migrant and Seasonal Farmworkers.--For the National Farmworker Jobs program, the Committee recommends $105,000,000, which is $9,604,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and $8,289,000 more than the fiscal year 2023 budget request. The Committee directs the Secretary to ensure that additional funding made available in fiscal year 2023--above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level--is available to all eligible organizations. YouthBuild.--For the YouthBuild program, the Committee recommends $145,000,000, which is $45,966,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2023 budget request. Reintegration of Ex-Offenders.--The Committee recommends $150,000,000 for training and reintegration activities for individuals with criminal legal histories or who have been justice system-involved, which is $47,921,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2023 budget request. The Committee directs the Department to ensure grantees establish formal partnerships with employers and that program participants receive industry recognized credentials and training in fields that prepare them for successful reintegration, including ensuring participants receive training and credentials in fields where their criminal record is not a barrier to entry or continued employment. The Committee also directs the Department to consider the needs of communities that have recently experienced significant unrest. The Committee includes a set-aside of $50,000,000 for competitive grants to national and regional intermediaries. The Committee encourages the Department to prioritize grants to national intermediaries and community-based organizations with recognized expertise and nationwide employer partners that will address the inequities deepened by the pandemic by serving populations with multiple barriers to employment and providing wraparound services to the individuals served. The Committee is aware that recent re-entry programs are an excellent way to help address workforce challenges, including those in the advanced manufacturing sector. The Committee directs the Department to provide an update in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification on information from the last three fiscal years on pathways and relationships built with employers, including data on formerly incarcerated individuals who have utilized the program, rates of increased credentials, and placement in higher paying positions. Workforce Data Quality Initiative.--The Committee recommends $6,000,000 for the Workforce Data Quality Initiative, which is the same as the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the fiscal year 2023 budget request. The Committee supports the work of States in using these funds to create and utilize data to align preschool through workforce systems. Apprenticeship Grants.--The Committee recommends $303,000,000 for the apprenticeship grants program, which is $68,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2023 budget request. The Committee established this program in 2016 to expand work-based learning programs in in-demand industries through registered apprenticeships. Registered apprenticeships are a proven strategy for meeting the needs of our nation's workforce and industry simultaneously. The Committee continues to invest in expanding opportunities relating to Registered Apprenticeship programs registered only under the National Apprenticeship Act, to be available to the Secretary to carry out activities through grants, cooperative agreements, contracts and other arrangements with States and other appropriate entities. As part of these opportunities, the Committee directs the Secretary to continue funding for national and local apprenticeship intermediaries, business and labor industry partner intermediaries, and equity intermediaries. The Committee also directs the Department to ensure that these intermediaries are given opportunities to apply for competitive grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and other funding opportunities. The Committee urges the Secretary to ensure that States engage both business and labor as part of any State funding opportunities associated with this program. In addition, the Committee continues to support the funding and development of industry or sector partnerships as a means to expand work-based learning programs and registered apprenticeships in in-demand industries. The Committee directs the Secretary to submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations providing details on entities awarded funding, selection criteria used, and the funding amount for each grant or contract awarded at the time such awards are made. Not later than 90 days after enactment of this Act, the Department shall provide the Committees on Appropriations a detailed spend plan of anticipated uses of funds made available, including administrative costs. The Committee also directs the Department to provide quarterly briefings on all spending activities under this program to the Committee. The Committee strongly supports efforts to expand Registered Apprenticeships to traditionally underrepresented communities. In addition, the Committee continues to note that apprenticeships are an important path to the middle-class, with those completing a program earning an average annual income of $70,000. However, women are largely underrepresented in apprenticeship programs, and women who do participate make far less than men. Therefore, the Committee directs the Department to accelerate efforts to recruit and retain women as part of these programs and to ensure equal compensation. The Committee recognizes that the creative economy was severely impacted by COVID-19 and encourages the Department to partner with the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities to explore the feasibility and expansion of Registered Apprenticeship programs for creative workers who previously received income through creative, cultural, or artistic-based pursuits to produce ideas, content, goods, and services, without regard to whether such income is earned through employment as an independent contractor or as an employee for an employer. The Committee continues to be concerned about nationwide shortages of qualified drinking water and wastewater operation professionals, especially in rural areas, and urges the Secretary to address these challenges through apprenticeship opportunities consistent with the National Guideline Standards of Apprenticeship for Water and Wastewater System Operations Specialists. The Committee notes that apprenticeship programs contribute to higher wages and fewer injuries for workers in the energy industry. The Committee also notes that as the United States combats climate change, we need to expand the clean energy workforce. However, we currently lack sufficient apprenticeship programs in the clean energy sector. Therefore, the Committee continues to encourage prioritization of apprenticeships in clean energy and encourages the Department of Labor to accelerate efforts to support apprenticeship programs that increase the number of trained workers in the clean energy sector with an emphasis in regions anticipating a loss in fossil fuel industry jobs. The Committee appreciates the Administration's actions to ensure high-quality training opportunities by taking steps to rescind the industry registered apprenticeship program. The Committee strongly supports expansion of registered apprenticeships, youth apprenticeships, and pre-apprenticeship programs to create more job training opportunities--especially in the face of shifting workforce needs and in-demand career skills. In light of this need, the Committee encourages the Secretary to identify key sectors, including advanced manufacturing, with growing workforce demands that adapt well within apprenticeship models and develop streamlined plans with key stakeholders to execute apprenticeship programs. The Committee supports efforts by organizations to advance worker training for individuals who are survivors of abuse, abandonment, or trauma. The Committee further supports worker training projects that provide wraparound services to these individuals and recognizes the value and need to support the ``whole'' worker, including access to new clothing, shoes, home essentials, family hygiene items, relevant worker resources, and life skill classes to foster healing and create long-term goals. National Youth Employment Program.--For the National Youth Employment Program, the Committee recommends $75,000,000, which is the same as the fiscal year 2023 budget request. This new competitive grant program will provide funding for youth employment programs, including summer and year-round opportunities. Veterans' Clean Energy Training Program.--For the Veterans' Clean Energy Training Program, the Committee recommends $10,000,000, which is the same as the fiscal year 2023 budget request. This new competitive grant program will prepare veterans and their spouses for careers in clean energy. Civilian Climate Corps.--For the Civilian Climate Corps, the Committee recommends $15,000,000, which is the same as the fiscal year 2023 budget request. This new grant pilot will rely on strong DOL partnerships with other Federal agencies to focus on job training and paid community service for underrepresented populations in clean energy and climate mitigation. Community Project Funding.--Within the funds included in this account, $132,114,000 shall be used for the projects, and in the amounts, specified in the table titled ``Labor, HHS, Education Incorporation of Community Project Funding Items'' at the end of this report. JOB CORPS Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $1,748,655,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 1,778,964,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 1,798,655,000 Change from enacted level......................... +50,000,000 Change from budget request........................ +19,691,000 Job Corps is the nation's largest residential employment and workforce development program for youth, helping prepare thousands of young people ages 16 through 24 for jobs in in- demand occupations with good wages each year. Operations.--For Job Corps Operations, the Committee recommends $1,627,325,000, which is $24,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and $24,314,000 more than the fiscal year 2023 budget request. Construction, Rehabilitation, and Acquisition.--The Committee recommends $133,000,000 for construction, rehabilitation, and acquisition activities of Job Corps centers, which is $20,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2023 budget request. Administration.--The Committee recommends $38,330,000 for the administrative expenses of the Job Corps program, which is $6,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and $4,623,000 below the fiscal year 2023 budget request. For over 50 years, Job Corps has successfully educated and trained millions of young adults for jobs in high demand industries and trades. Job Corps has campuses across all 50 States and Puerto Rico and provides a safe living, learning and disciplined residential setting that allows disconnected and opportunity youth to gain the employment and skills that U.S. employers seek. The Committee recommendation includes funding for Job Corps to meet capacity and ensure a safe learning environment for all students and staff, including to train youth for employment in industry sectors facing critical shortages of skilled workers, such as construction, healthcare, manufacturing, transportation, and cyber technologies. Job Corps centers are capable of serving approximately 50,000 out- of-work and out-of-school youth each year, and the Committee encourages the Department to use such funding accordingly. The Committee continues to be concerned with the administration of the Job Corps program, including the underutilization of centers relative to on-board strength, industry-standard training, and performance incentives. As millions of disconnected youth struggle with housing, food insecurity, and unemployment, the Committee supports the full resumption of Job Corps operations, including the reintegration of nonresidential students into normal classes, similar to other schools and institutes of higher education across the country. The Committee has previously expressed concern regarding the impact of the transition to fixed-price Job Corps contracts on staff compensation. Currently, the Department exempts Job Corps prime contracts from compliance with the McNamara-O'Hara Service Contract Act. The Committee directs the Department to provide a report within 90 days of enactment of this Act explaining the rationale for this exemption and an estimate of the costs of requiring all Job Corps contracts to comply with this statute. The Committee further directs the Department to estimate the costs of compliance if Job Corps academic and trade instructors were classified as nonexempt for the purposes of the Fair Standards Act. COMMUNITY SERVICE EMPLOYMENT FOR OLDER AMERICANS Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $405,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 405,000,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 450,000,000 Change from enacted level......................... +45,000,000 Change from budget request........................ +45,000,000 The Community Service Employment for Older Americans program provides grants to public and private non-profit organizations that subsidize part-time work in community service activities for unemployed persons aged 55 and older whose family income is below 125 percent of the poverty level. The Committee recommends $450,000,000 for the Community Service Employment for Older Americans program, which is $45,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the fiscal year 2023 budget request. FEDERAL UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS AND ALLOWANCES Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $540,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 494,400,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 494,400,000 Change from enacted level......................... -45,600,000 Change from budget request........................ - - - The Trade Adjustment Assistance program (TAA) provides assistance to workers adversely affected by international trade. TAA provides training, income support, wage subsidies for older workers, job search and relocation allowances to groups of workers who file a petition and are certified as eligible to apply for such benefits due to job losses resulting from increases in imports or foreign trade. STATE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND EMPLOYMENT SERVICE OPERATIONS Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $3,711,331,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 4,258,173,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 4,213,960,000 Change from enacted level......................... +502,629,000 Change from budget request........................ -44,213,000 The total includes $4,124,894,000 from the Employment Security Administration Account from the Unemployment Trust Fund and $89,066,000 from the General Fund of the Treasury. These funds are used to support the administration of Federal and State unemployment compensation laws. Unemployment Insurance Compensation.--For Unemployment Insurance (UI) Compensation, the Committee recommends $3,184,635,000, which is $333,819,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2023 budget request. The recommendation provides additional resources for States to increase staffing capacity and to accommodate sustained increases in workload. In addition, the recommendation provides contingency funding for increased workloads that States may face in the administration of UI. The Committee recommendation includes bill language so that, during fiscal year 2023, for every 100,000 increase in the total average weekly insured unemployment (AWIU) above 1,778,000, an additional $28,600,000 shall be made available to States from the Unemployment Trust Fund. In the event that additional funds are provided to States under the AWIU contingency authority, the Department is directed to provide notification to the Committees on Appropriations of the current projected AWIU level for the fiscal year, when funds were provided to States, and how much additional funding was provided in total and to each State within 15 days of funding being provided. In the event that additional funds are provided on a quarterly basis, the Department shall provide this information on a quarterly basis. The Committee includes $117,000,000 for the Reemployment Services and Eligibility Assessments program, and an additional $258,000,000 is made available pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-123), which is $125,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and equal to the fiscal year 2023 budget request. UI Integrity Center of Excellence (UIICE).--The recommendation provides $9,000,000 for the continued support of UIICE. Unemployment Compensation National Activities.--The Committee recommends $118,000,000 for National Activities, which is $100,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and $50,174,000 below the fiscal year 2023 budget request. This increase in funding is intended to help modernize information technology systems and support States in administering the UI program. The Committee supports ongoing efforts by the Department's Employment and Training Administration to collaborate with state workforce agencies to modernize unemployment insurance management systems. The Committee continues to urge the department to develop a comprehensive long-term strategy for delivery of assistance to state workforce agencies, as outlined in House report 117-96. Employment Service.--The Committee recommends $723,862,000 for the Employment Service allotment to States, which is $48,810,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and $25,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2023 budget request. The Committee also recommends $25,000,000 for Employment Service National Activities, which is the same as the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and $2,682,000 more than the fiscal year 2023 budget request. The Employment Service offers vital services such as referrals for job openings, career counseling, and job searches for individuals seeking employment, including veterans and people with disabilities. Since 1933, this Federal-State partnership has facilitated the connection between employers in need of workers and individuals seeking employment. Given the nature of this exchange, the Department has historically required that the Employment Service system rely on State merit-staff employees to ensure that these services are rendered in the public interest and not solely to meet private interests. However, under the previous Administration, the Department's issued a final rule that marked a dangerous departure from this operation. As such, the recommendation includes new bill language preventing the implementation of the final rule, entitled ``Wagner-Peyser Act Staffing Flexibility'' (85 Fed. Reg. 592). Foreign Labor Certification.--The Committee recommends $94,810,000 for the Foreign Labor Certification (FLC) program, which is $15,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and $3,721,000 below the fiscal year 2023 budget request. The recommendation includes $68,528,000 for Federal administration, an increase of $10,000,000 over the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and $1,721,000 below the fiscal year 2023 budget request, that is intended to be used to ensure effective oversight and enforcement of employer regulations, and $26,282,000 for grants to States, an increase of $5,000,000 over the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and $2,000,000 below the fiscal year 2023 budget request. Heat-Related Deaths.--The Committee recognizes that farm workers ensure our nation's food supply at the risk of their own health and safety, toiling under extreme temperatures and other dangerous conditions. Agriculture had the highest average rate of heat-related deaths of all industry sectors. More specifically, agriculture had roughly three times the rate of heat-related death compared to construction, which is the industry with the second highest rate of heat-related death, and 35 times the risk of heat related death compared to other industry sectors. The Committee believes that no workers should die of heat. Heat death and illness can be prevented by very simple measures, such as access to drinking water, shade, and rest breaks. The Committee urges the DOL to consider what immediate steps they can take to prevent heat illness and death while the OSHA rulemaking is in progress. In particular, the Committee urges the DOL to consider what protections could be put into place to protect workers at H-2A employers from heat illness and death, such as requiring a heat illness prevention plan as part of the H-2A labor certification process. Workforce Information.--To better understand the growing threat heat-related illness poses to climate-vulnerable agricultural workers, the Committee encourages the Department to assess heat-related illness prevention and response through the National Agricultural Worker Survey. Specifically, the Committee encourages the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) to ensure workers' access to drinking vessels, potable water, restrooms, and shade are addressed by the National Agricultural Workers Survey. The Committee also directs ETA to incorporate questions about the incidence and prevalence of heat-related illness during agricultural employment and whether workers have been training on the job about heat-related illness. The Committee directs ETA to include a report to Congress on the findings from these questions of the survey as part of its annual report on the National Agricultural Worker Survey. Schedule A Occupational Classification.--The Committee is aware that the Schedule A occupational classification list currently includes only two broad occupational classifications and a narrow subset of other applicants. The Committee continues to encourage the Secretary to consider rulemaking to improve the experience of employers and to effectively allocate Department resources with the goal of protecting U.S. workers from undue foreign competition through the labor certification process. One-Stop Career Centers/Labor Market Information.--The Committee recommends $67,653,000 for One-Stop Career Centers and Labor Market Information, which is $5,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and $18,000,000 below the fiscal year 2023 budget request. The recommendation also includes language authorizing the Secretary to transfer certain funding to the Office of Disability Employment Policy for research and demonstration projects. ADVANCES TO THE UNEMPLOYMENT TRUST FUND AND OTHER FUNDS The Committee recommends such sums as necessary for Advances to the Unemployment Trust Fund and Other Funds. The funds are made available to accounts authorized under Federal and State unemployment insurance laws and the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund when the balances in such accounts are insufficient. PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $164,415,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 222,633,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 209,200,000 Change from enacted level......................... +44,785,000 Change from budget request........................ -13,433,000 The recommendation includes $144,465,000 from the General Fund of the Treasury and $64,735,000 from the Employment Security Administration Account in the Unemployment Trust Fund. The Committee includes new bill language ensuring Office of Apprenticeship resources support Registered Apprenticeships and adequate staffing in the Office of Apprenticeship and State offices. Prize Competition.--The Committee continues to encourage the Department, in coordination with the Office of Science and Technology Policy, to establish a prize competition consistent with the requirements of section 24 of the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980, to support eligible programs designed to prepare high school students to enter and succeed in an in-demand industry sector or occupation. National Guard Job ChalleNGe.--The Committee appreciates the value and success of the National Guard's Youth ChalleNGe Program, and the benefits the Department of Labor's collaboration through Job ChalleNGe provides to the youth served through the experience. The occupational skills training, individualized career and academic counseling, work- based learning opportunities, and leadership development activities provided through the Job ChalleNGe are even more vital in the aftermath of the economic fallout associated with the pandemic. The Committee encourages the Department to build upon its collaboration with Youth ChalleNGe programs and offer youth occupational skills training, individualized career and academic counseling, work-based learning opportunities, and leadership development activities. Gun Violence.--The Committee encourages the Department to prioritize Workforce Innovation and Opportunity funding opportunities, like the Young Adult Reentry Partnership and YouthBuild, to support reintegration, transitional employment, long-term impactful positions, union positions, and living wages for systems-involved youth and older adults in cities disproportionately impacted by daily gun violence. Higher Education Workforce Development Initiative.--The Committee encourages the Department of Labor to partner with the Department of Education to explore the feasibility of creating workforce development programs at 4-year higher education institutions to align workforce development efforts and post-secondary education and support expanded skills instruction, apprenticeships, and other work-based learning opportunities, including cooperative education and upskilling and reskilling efforts in industries like manufacturing, information technology, healthcare, and energy, among others. The Committee encourages the Department to model the Higher Education Workforce Development Innovation program similarly to the Strengthening Community College Training Grants Program. Electric Vehicle Mechanics.--The Committee recognizes the growing need of high skilled mechanics and workforce development in the automotive field to prepare for advances in the electric vehicle industry. The Committee encourages the Department of Labor and the Department of Education to explore the feasibility of working with industry partners, labor groups, and nonprofit experts to develop curriculum and training programs to further career pathways for electric vehicle mechanics. The collaboration should also develop recommendations of advanced training programs for established career mechanics to grow skilled labor outcomes and deepen their skills and knowledge to meet the needs of the future. Disaggregated Data by Race.--The Committee is aware that few federal or federally funded workforce training programs track outcomes by race. The Committee recommends careful evaluation of disaggregated racial data in order to advance racial equity and minimize racial disparities in workforce training. The Committee requests a report from ETA within 120 days of enactment of this Act on efforts to evaluate disaggregated racial data in federally-funded workforce training programs. Reducing Homelessness.--The Committee recognizes that employment that pays a living wage and can support the cost of housing is a key to reducing homelessness. The Office of Workforce Investment (OWI) is responsible for a national workforce investment system that provides workers with the information, advice, job search assistance, supportive services, and training for in-demand industries and occupations needed to get and keep good jobs. The Committee urges OWI to provide workforce boards with incentives and guidance to promote coordination with local homelessness systems to ensure that employment services are accessible and useful to people who are homeless or have recently left homelessness. Justice Involved Workers.--The Committee supports the Department of Labor's intention to expand education, skills training, and work experience programs to connect justice- involved individuals with employment opportunities to obtain and retain jobs. The Committee continues to recommend that Federal workforce development funding under covered education and training programs be available to eligible recipients with a demonstrated capacity to develop and improve the availability of employment and transitional job programs that support work- based learning activities designed to increase reentry employment as an equitable workforce approach. To increase alignment of work experience opportunities across federal programs, the committee also directs the Department to enter into a cooperative agreement with national nonprofit organizations that have an established partnership with the SNAP Employment & Training program at the Department of Agriculture. Regional Councils and Councils of Governments.--The Committee encourages the Department to list regional councils and councils of governments as eligible entities in competitions for Federal funding whenever local governments or non-profit agencies are eligible entities. Furthermore, the Committee encourages the Department to seek opportunities for regional councils and councils of governments to serve as lead applicants and grantees to encourage and expand greater regional collaboration. Employee Benefits Security Administration SALARIES AND EXPENSES Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $185,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 233,867,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 233,867,000 Change from enacted level......................... +48,367,000 Change from budget request........................ - - - The Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) assures the security of retirement, health and other workplace- related benefits of working Americans. The Committee recommends $233,867,000 for EBSA, which is $48,367,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2023 budget request. Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA) Compliance.--The Committee has included resources for the Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) to fully implement Section 203 of Division BB of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021. Section 203 requires that all group health plans perform comparative analyses of the design and application of nonquantitative treatment limitations (NQTLs) to ensure those imposed on mental health and substance use disorder benefits are not more restrictive than limitations for medical and surgical benefits. The Committee is encouraged that EBSA formed a MHPAEA NQTL Task Force composed of experienced investigators, health policy experts, technical experts from EBSA's regional and national offices, and attorneys from the Office of the Solicitor of Labor to assist in the implementation of the new provisions. The Committee encourages EBSA to continue to enhance its MHPAEA NQTL enforcement program by increasing the investigative resources dedicated to NQTL review and analysis. To the extent resources allow, the Committee also encourages EBSA to create templates and tools for collecting and scoring the comparative analyses and rendering decisions on compliance; enhance coordination, standardization and MHPAEA-related decision- making uniformity among regional offices; and conduct follow-up investigations into group health plans whose comparative analyses indicate likely noncompliance or areas in which further examination is needed to determine compliance. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $472,955,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 493,314,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 493,314,000 Change from enacted level......................... +20,359,000 Change from budget request........................ - - - Congress established the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to insure the defined-benefit pension plans of working Americans. Wage and Hour Division SALARIES AND EXPENSES Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $251,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 307,678,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 312,678,000 Change from enacted level......................... +61,678,000 Change from budget request........................ +5,000,000 The Wage and Hour Division (WHD) enforces Federal minimum wage, overtime pay, recordkeeping, and child labor requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). WHD also has enforcement and other administrative responsibilities related to the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act, the Employee Polygraph Protection Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Davis Bacon Act, and the Service Contract Act. The Committee recommends $312,678,000 for WHD, which is $61,678,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and $5,000,000 above the fiscal year 2023 budget request. The increase will support additional investigators to combat wage theft and protect workers. The Committee urges WHD to explore and expand strategic enforcement approaches to the agency's work to make the most of this increase. Retaliation.--Because retaliation and the threat of retaliation remain a critical challenge to workers' ability to exercise their workplace rights, the Committee requests for WHD to provide information regarding its volume of retaliation complaints, the status of those complaints, and how WHD is working effectively to protect workers from retaliation in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification. Accessibility.--The Committee notes the importance of making sure all workers can access WHD's resources, including workers of color, immigrant workers, workers in rural communities or with limited access to transportation, and workers with disabilities. The Committee encourages WHD to undertake efforts to improve accessibility of WHD offices, translate WHD documentation and signage into languages spoken by 5 percent or more of the population in a given WHD region, and translate WHD's online webpages, complaint forms, and resources to match regional needs. In hiring investigators, the Committee encourages WHD to focus on employing and retaining a greater number of multilingual investigators. In addition, the Committee encourages WHD to establish protocols that permit workers to participate in investigations and hearings remotely where appropriate. Community-based Organizations and Partnerships.--The Committee believes that community-based organizations are critical in establishing necessary trust, connecting workers with agencies, facilitating communication between agencies and workers, and deploying enforcement resources strategically. Working with community-based organizations helps agencies cooperate with workers who might otherwise be difficult to reach, including workers employed by small businesses, workers with literacy challenges, workers with limited access to broadband, and workers in high-hazard industries most vulnerable to wage violations. Therefore, the Committee urges WHD to increase its capacity to conduct outreach and collaborate with community-based organizations. U and T Visa Certification.--The Committee notes the critical role WHD plays in completing U and T visa certifications on behalf of victims of crime and victims of trafficking in the workplace. Ensuring that all workers, regardless of immigration status, can participate in WHD investigations and exercise their workplace rights is critical to the full and effective enforcement of Federal labor laws. The Committee urges WHD to use resources provided in fiscal year 2023 to ensure the efficient and timely processing and certification of all certification requests. Domestic Workers.--The Committee is concerned that domestic workers are particularly vulnerable to workplace exploitation, including wage theft, verbal abuse, trafficking, and sexual assault. Domestic work commonly takes place in private homes, where workers are often isolated and alone. This workforce is predominantly female, and represents populations that are already vulnerable, including immigrant women and women of color. The Committee is concerned by the limited enforcement of workplace rights for this population and the severe power imbalance between domestic workers and their employers. In response to these concerns, the Committee includes new bill language directing the Secretary to use funds made available under WHD to establish a national hotline to support domestic workers. In addition, the Committee urges WHD to prioritize investigations in sectors where workers are more vulnerable to wage theft, including domestic work, long term care, and home health care. Misclassification.--The Committee is concerned that cases of workers being misclassified as independent contractors have been steadily rising in recent years, a development that transfers costs of doing business to workers, denies them the rights and protections of bedrock workplace protections, and depletes federal coffers by limiting payroll taxes. The Committee urges the WHD to use the full extent of its existing powers to enforce laws related to employee classification and to undertake such rulemaking action as may be necessary to execute Congress's direction under 29 USC 202. Warehouse Workers.--The Committee recognizes that temporary warehouse workers have been the backbone of efforts to address the supply chain issues that the United States experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Committee strongly supports increased oversight to prevent wage theft from warehouse workers and is encouraged by the WHD's initiative on Warehouse and Logistics workers. The Committee requests a report within 90 days of enactment of this Act detailing the steps the WHD is taking to address wage theft among warehouse workers, including non-union temporary warehouse workers. In addition, the Committee requests a progress report on the initiative on Warehouse and Logistics workers, including steps to provide education, outreach, enforcement to increase compliance and reduce industry violations. Office of Labor Management Standards SALARIES AND EXPENSES Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $45,937,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 49,951,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 45,937,000 Change from enacted level......................... - - - Change from budget request........................ -4,014,000 The Office of Labor Management Standards (OLMS) administers the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA), which establishes safeguards for union democracy and union financial integrity, and requires public disclosure reporting by unions, union officers, employees of unions, labor relations consultants, employers, and surety companies. The Committee recommends $44,937,000 for OLMS, which is the same as the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and $4,014,000 below the fiscal year 2023 budget request. Persuader Reporting.--The Committee is concerned about uneven compliance with rules regarding reporting of persuader activity and urges the Department to review its rules and policies on persuader reporting and take all appropriate actions to strengthen its rules and enforcement to ensure maximum compliance and reporting of persuader activity. Further, the Committee urges the Department to consider proposing a revision to its rules to require disclosure on the LM-10 form as to whether the filer is a federal contractor, whether the persuader activity relates to employees working on or in connection with the federal contract, and with which agency or agencies the employer contracts. Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs SALARIES AND EXPENSES Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $108,476,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 147,051,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 147,051,000 Change from enacted level......................... +38,575,000 Change from budget request........................ - - - The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) ensures equal employment opportunity in the Federal contracting community through enforcement, regulatory work, outreach and education to workers and their advocates. OFCCP is responsible, per Executive Order 11246 (EO 11246), for ensuring Federal contractors and subcontractors take affirmative action to ensure that all individuals have an equal opportunity for employment, without regard to race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. The Committee recommends $147,051,000 for OFCCP, which is $38,575,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2023 budget request. The Committee supports OFCCP's efforts to make sure contractors and subcontractors are adhering fully to EO 11246. Office of Workers' Compensation Programs SALARIES AND EXPENSES Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $120,129,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 145,977,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 145,977,000 Change from enacted level......................... +25,848,000 Change from budget request........................ - - - The Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) administers the Federal Employees' Compensation Act, the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act, and the Black Lung Benefits Act. These programs provide eligible injured and disabled workers and their survivors with compensation, medical benefits, and services including rehabilitation, supervision of medical care, and technical and advisory counseling. The Committee recommendation includes $143,772,000 in General Funds from the Treasury, which is $25,848,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2023 request, and $2,205,000 from the Special Fund established by the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act. SPECIAL BENEFITS Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $244,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 250,000,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 250,000,000 Change from enacted level......................... +6,000,000 Change from budget request........................ - - - These funds provide mandatory benefits under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act. SPECIAL BENEFITS FOR DISABLED COAL MINERS Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $32,970,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 36,031,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 36,031,000 Change from enacted level......................... +3,061,000 Change from budget request........................ - - - These funds provide mandatory benefits to coal miners disabled by black lung disease, to their survivors and eligible dependents, and for necessary administrative costs. The Committee recommends $36,031,000 for Special Benefits for Disabled Coal Miners. This amount is in addition to the $11,000,000 appropriated in fiscal year 2022 as an advance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. The total program level recommendation is $3,061,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2023 budget request. The Committee recommendation also provides $10,250,000 as an advance appropriation for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. These funds ensure uninterrupted payments to beneficiaries. ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, ENERGY EMPLOYEES OCCUPATIONAL ILLNESS COMPENSATION FUND Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $63,428,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 64,564,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 64,564,000 Change from enacted level......................... +1,136,000 Change from budget request........................ - - - These funds provide mandatory benefits to eligible employees or survivors of employees of the Department of Energy (DOE); its contractors and subcontractors; companies that provided beryllium to DOE; atomic weapons employees who suffer from a radiation-related cancer, beryllium-related disease, or chronic silicosis as a result of their work in producing or testing nuclear weapons; and uranium workers covered under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act. Beryllium Vendor Eligibility.--The Committee is concerned that the Department of Labor's interpretation of what constitutes a ``covered employee'' under the terms of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act (EEOICPA) mistakenly excludes some employees of beryllium vendors and facilities and contravenes congressional intent under EEOICPA. As such, the Committee encourages the Department to examine making eligible all employees of beryllium vendors named in EEOICPA for benefits under the Act regardless of corporate structure, past reorganizations, or current ownership as a subsidiary provided those actions were compliant with applicable federal law. The Committee further directs the Department to submit a report to the Committee no later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act that outlines the number of beneficiaries and eligible employers covered under the EEOICPA. BLACK LUNG DISABILITY TRUST FUND Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $331,505,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 394,896,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 394,896,000 Change from enacted level......................... +63,391,000 Change from budget request........................ - - - The Black Lung Disability Trust Fund, supported with mandatory funding, pays black lung compensation, medical and survivor benefits, and administrative expenses when no mine operator can be assigned liability for such benefits, or when mine employment ceased prior to 1970. The Black Lung Disability Trust Fund is financed by an excise tax on coal, reimbursements from responsible mine operators, and short-term advances from the Treasury. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 authorized a restructuring of the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund debt and required that annual operating surpluses be used to pay down the debt until all remaining obligations are retired. Black Lung Benefits Claims Processing.--The Committee is concerned with lengthy delays in the processing of Black Lung Benefits Act claims, particularly where the mine operator's ability to pay the claim is in question. Delays impede access to necessary medical care while claims are pending. The Committee supports efforts by the Secretary to resolve these claims expediently to ensure miners can receive the benefits and medical care they need. The Committee requests an update in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification on the Department's efforts to improve the speed and quality of its black lung claims processing. Occupational Safety and Health Administration SALARIES AND EXPENSES Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $612,015,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 701,405,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 712,015,000 Change from enacted level......................... +100,000,000 Change from budget request........................ +10,610,000 The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 established the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to assure safe and healthy working conditions by setting and enforcing standards and by providing training, outreach, education and assistance. Within the total for OSHA, the Committee provides the following amounts: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Budget Activity FY 2023 Committee ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Safety and Health Standards.......................... $29,080,000 Federal Enforcement.................................. 285,508,000 Whistleblower Programs............................... 27,290,000 State Programs....................................... 121,075,000 Technical Support.................................... 27,007,000 Federal Compliance Assistance........................ 91,608,000 State Consultation Grants............................ 63,500,000 Training Grants...................................... 14,287,000 Safety and Health Statistics......................... 42,180,000 Executive Direction and Administration............... 10,480,000 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Compliance Safety and Health Officers (CSHOs).--The Committee is concerned about the significant reduction in OSHA Compliance Safety and Health Officers (CSHOs) in recent decades relative to the number of workers they oversee. These CSHOs enforce federal workplace standards across the country, inspecting worksites and ensuring that employers comply with worker safety and health regulations. That is why the Committee is strongly supportive of OSHA's plans to use additional resources to support and rebuild OSHA's enforcement program by hiring additional CSHOs. The Committee encourages the agency to focus on employing and retaining multilingual officers crucial to thorough inspections of workplaces across the country. Elimination of the Limiting OSHA Coverage to Small Farms Rider.--The Committee continues to eliminate the existing appropriations rider that prevents OSHA from conducting any activities--including compliance assistance, investigations, and enforcement activities--on small farms. Agriculture is among the most dangerous industries in the United States. However, OSHA is currently prohibited from investigating even fatalities and serious injuries on small farms, as well as responding to worker complaints. Agricultural exemptions in New Deal worker protection laws, which set the precedent for the OSHA small farms rider, were included as compromises to secure the votes of Southern lawmakers who opposed expanding labor rights for black farmworkers and sharecroppers. This is an almost 40-year-old rider that continues to have a disparate impact on racial and ethnic minorities and should not be included in this Act. All farmworkers deserve to be protected by the OSHA law, regardless of the size of their employer. Penalties.--The Committee notes that OSHA penalties are among the lowest of any Federal agency and believes they are woefully inadequate in deterring workplace health and safety violations by employers. For instance, despite widespread reports that meatpacking facilities were becoming deadly COVID- 19 hotspots as early as March 2020, OSHA waited six months before issuing two small financial penalties totaling $29,000 to a JBS plant and a Smithfield plant. For context, in 2019, JBS's annual revenue was $51.7 billion and Smithfield's was $14 billion. To address these concerns, Committee urges OSHA to adopt policies that encourage the use of maximum penalties or a penalty multiplier for serious violations in large businesses. Whistleblower Protection Program.--The Committee is concerned about the increasing caseloads and unprecedented length of time taken by OSHA to complete whistleblower investigations. OSHA's whistleblower investigative staff enforces protections for employees who suffer retaliation for protected activity under more than 20 statutes, and the number of statutes continues to increase. OSHA's already-overburdened Whistleblower Protection Program staff has seen a consistent increase in new complaints filed, including a large increase in COVID-19 related complaints since the beginning of the pandemic, which has resulted in a significant backlog of pending investigations. The Office of Inspector General concluded in August 2020 that when OSHA fails to respond in a timely manner, it ``could leave workers to suffer emotionally and financially'' and may lead to the erosion of evidence needed for the case. To bolster the Whistleblower Protection Program's capacity to conduct critical investigations in a timely manner in industries across the country and bring the agency closer to compliance with statutory requirements of more than 20 statutes, the Committee increases resources for the Whistleblower Protection program by $5,790,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. This increase will support OSHA's efforts to update its decades-old Whistleblower data base to the current OSHA Information System for OSHA's main enforcement program or to develop a new system. Susan Harwood Training Grants.--The Susan Harwood Training Grants to non-profit organizations reach workers in dangerous industries with critical education and training on workplace hazards and statutory protections. The latest statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that workplace fatalities are increasing for Black workers and that fatality rates are higher among Hispanic and Black workers. The Committee supports OSHA's efforts to provide funding to non-profit, community- based groups, and other non-profit organizations with the capability to reach workers in low-wage industries and workers in dangerous industries. In addition, the Committee urges OSHA to allow grantees to train on multiple hazards. Further, the Committee encourages OSHA to ensure grants are awarded to train workers employed in disaster recovery and rebuilding sectors. U and T Visas.--The Committee strongly supports efforts by OSHA to ensure all workers, regardless of immigration status, can participate in OSHA investigations and exercise their workplace rights. However, the Committee notes that OSHA does not outline a process for U and T visa certification. The Committee encourages OSHA to evaluate the merits of establishing a policy on U and T visa certification requests and consider assisting workers with U and T visa certification. OSHA Noise Standard.--The Committee is aware that the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) estimates that 22 million U.S. workers are exposed to potentially dangerous levels of noise in the workplace every year and that hearing loss is the most commonly recorded occupational illness in manufacturing, accounting for 1 in 9 recordable illnesses. The Committee is also aware that the OSHA Noise Standard (20 CFR 1910.95) for employers was established in 1983, but has not been updated since that time even as the Department of Defense (DoD), NIOSH, and many other countries have recommended or adopted more protective noise exposure limits. Accordingly, to better protect the American workforce and reduce the risk of noise-induced hearing loss, the Committee urges OSHA to lower the current permissible exposure level to 85 dBA TWA using a 3 dB exchange rate. Such a change would substantially reduce the excess risk of developing occupational noise-induced hearing loss over a working lifetime and be consistent with current exposure limits specified by the DoD and voluntarily adopted by many private employers. OSHA Heat Standard.--The Committee recognizes that with climate change, risks of heat-related illnesses continue to grow, posing serious risks to workers and their families as well as the nation's food supply and supply chains. Workers exposed to extreme heat are disproportionately low-wage workers and workers of color. The Committee is encouraged by the notice of proposed rulemaking by the Department announced in October 2021. While the rulemaking is underway, the Committee is pleased that OSHA's National Emphasis program will create, for the first time, a nationwide enforcement mechanism to proactively inspect workplaces for heat-related hazards and prevent worker injuries, illnesses, and fatalities. Children in Agriculture.--The Committee is concerned that children working in agriculture are at risk from work injuries that could result in death. The Committee requests a report within 180 days of the date of enactment of this Act which shall include an evaluation of data that reflects the status of child labor and related safety and health hazards, such as the health impact of pesticide use. The report shall include information on work-related serious injuries to children under 18 employed in agriculture, as well as work-related deaths of children under 18 employed in agriculture. The report shall provide relevant details, including environmental hazards, such as chemical or pesticide exposure; use of machinery or tools at time of incident; work tasks performed at time of incident; and other details relating to the incident. OSHA is encouraged to collaborate with BLS and WHD. Technology.--The Committee recognizes that technology is increasingly incorporated into how we work. The Committee encourages OSHA, in collaboration with NIOSH and stakeholders, to examine the role of technology in improving safety. In particular, OSHA should review efforts to make technology innovation more accessible, to identify the most hazardous situations for the American workforce, and to eliminate barriers to the adoption of critical safety controls by employers. The Committee requests a briefing with 120 days of enactment of this Act on recommendations on these topics to specifically focus on reducing fatalities. Interagency Collaboration.--The Committee is concerned about the implementation and renegotiation of the 1994 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between OSHA and the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) towards establishing a process for FSIS inspection personnel to be trained to recognize and report serious workplace hazards. The Committee requests a report within 90 days of enactment of this Act on the implementation status of this renegotiated MOU that includes the agencies' timeline and action plan for implementation. Asbestos.--The Committee is concerned that construction workers continue to be exposed to asbestos at renovation, rehabilitation, and restoration construction sites for both private developments and public housing. The Committee encourages OSHA, in collaboration with the Environmental Protection Agency, to prioritize activities that proactively prevent asbestos exposure, such as increased site visits. In addition, the Committee encourages OSHA to work with employers to ensure asbestos hazards, fact sheets, and safety protocols are publicly listed in English and Spanish and to provide trainings to employers and employees. Arc-flash Personal Protective Equipment.--The Committee is concerned with continued lack of compliance with OSHA's and industry's standards for arc-flash (AR) clothing and associated personal protective equipment (PPE) requirements that have been in place for over two decades. More than 600,000 American workers performing work on or near energized electrical equipment are exposed to deadly arc-flash related injuries and hazards on worksites across the country without the required lifesaving protection. This results in many catastrophic injuries and fatalities of American workers every year, virtually all of which are preventable. The Committee encourages OSHA to adopt an enforcement policy citing existing standards such as NFPA 70E, and for requiring appropriate arc flash protective clothing and PPE during all live electrical work performed in the United States. Mine Safety and Health Administration SALARIES AND EXPENSES Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $383,816,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 423,449,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 403,816,000 Change from enacted level......................... +20,000,000 Change from budget request........................ -19,633,000 The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) enforces the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act in underground and surface coalmines and metal/non-metal mines. Within the total for MSHA, the Committee provides the following amounts: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Budget Activity FY 2023 Committee ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Mine Safety and Health Enforcement................... $279,509,000 Standards and Regulations Development................ 6,229,000 Assessments.......................................... 7,191,000 Educational Policy and Development................... 39,755,000 Technical Support.................................... 36,209,000 Program Evaluation and Information Resources......... 18,655,000 Program Administration............................... 16,268,000 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Coal, Metal, and Non-metal Mines.--MSHA is directed to include in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification and all future Congressional Budget Justifications historical and budget year information on enforcement activities and outcomes, distinguishing between coal and metal/non-metal mines. To promote transparency in agency spending on its enforcement activities, MSHA shall continue to separately present annual spending on coal and metal/non-metal mines as it has in past Congressional Budget Justifications. Resources and Activities.--The Committee notes significant worker dislocations and mine closures because of economic conditions throughout the mining industry, and in coal mining in particular. The Committee reiterates its support for the ongoing effort to bring MSHA enforcement into proportion by redistributing resources and activities to the areas where mine production is currently occurring and where MSHA identifies the most significant safety hazards. Bureau of Labor Statistics SALARIES AND EXPENSES Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $687,952,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 741,744,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 726,334,000 Change from enacted level......................... +38,382,000 Change from budget request........................ -15,410,000 The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is an independent national statistical agency that collects, processes, analyzes, and disseminates essential economic data to the Congress, Federal agencies, State and local governments, businesses, and the public. Its principal surveys include the Consumer Price Index and the monthly unemployment series. The Committee recommendation includes $658,334,000 from the General Fund of the Treasury and $68,000,000 from the Employment Security Administration Account in the Unemployment Trust Fund. The recommendation does not include funds for the relocation of the BLS headquarters, which was fully funded in fiscal year 2022. Within the total for BLS, the Committee provides the following amounts: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Budget Activity FY 2023 Committee ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Employment and Unemployment Statistics............... $261,454,000 Labor Market Information............................. 68,000,000 Prices and Cost of Living............................ 252,000,000 Compensation and Working Conditions.................. 92,976,000 Productivity and Technology.......................... 12,853,000 Executive Direction and Staff Services............... 39,051,000 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY).--The Committee continues to recognize the importance of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY), which has provided valuable information about labor market trends for decades. The increase includes sufficient resources to continue development of a new NLSY cohort. Preserving Existing Statistical Work and Staff.--When implementing the NLSY and other new investments, the Committee directs BLS not to reduce or eliminate existing statistical work. Further, the Committee directs BLS not to reduce the number of full-time equivalent positions beyond the apportioned fiscal year 2022 full-time equivalent ceiling. Nonprofit Sector Workforce.--The Committee recognizes the importance of the nonprofit sector workforce as a critical partner to government and a frontline service provider in communities nationwide and encourages BLS to examine the value in including nonprofit organizations as a distinct category of employer in quarterly reports from its Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW). Artificial Intelligence.--The Committee notes the continued development of artificial intelligence and encourages BLS to examine this trend's impact on the economy. Public Safety Telecommunicators.--The Committee recognizes that categorizations of a `public safety telecommunicator' as an `office and administrative support occupation' is outdated and does not reflect the nature of this life-saving work. The Committee encourages BLS to update data collection practices to be in line with modern changes to the public safety telecommunications profession, classifying them as a `protective service occupation' and collecting data accordingly. Military Spouses.--The Committee recognizes the need for comprehensive data measuring employment among military spouses over time. The Committee encourages BLS, in collaboration with the Department of Defense, to assess the potential for measuring labor market outcomes and characteristics of military spouses with existing survey data and explore options for modifying such surveys to capture this population. BLS Data Collection Sources.--The Committee recognizes the value and importance of real-time economic data for the purpose of identifying economic trends and consumer sentiment. Further, as the Department prepares future solicitations for economic data and research, the Committee encourages the Department to conduct robust market research to identify potential new market entrants. Office of Disability Employment Policy SALARIES AND EXPENSES Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $40,500,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 58,566,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 58,566,000 Change from enacted level......................... +18,066,000 Change from budget request........................ - - - The Office of Disability Employment Policy (ODEP) provides policy guidance and leadership to eliminate employment barriers to people with disabilities. The Committee recommendation for ODEP is $58,566,000, which is $18,066,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2023 budget request. The Committee is supportive of the budget proposal for ODEP to support the planning and implementation of Equitable Transition Model (ETM) projects that will develop strategies to enable low-income youth with disabilities, including youth experiencing homelessness, leaving foster care, or involved in the justice system, to be more likely to transition to employment. Departmental Management SALARIES AND EXPENSES Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $367,697,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 492,104,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 498,917,000 Change from enacted level......................... +131,220,000 Change from budget request........................ +6,813,000 The Departmental Management appropriation provides funds for the staff responsible for Departmental operations, management, and policy development. The Committee recommendation includes $498,609,000 from the General Fund of the Treasury, $131,220,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and $6,813,000 above the fiscal year 2023 budget request, and $308,000 from the Employment Security Administration Account in the Unemployment Trust Fund. Within the total for Departmental Management, the Committee provides the following amounts: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Budget Activity FY 2023 Committee ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Program Direction and Support........................ $38,958,000 Departmental Evaluation.............................. 10,351,000 Legal Services....................................... 178,183,000 International Labor Affairs.......................... 138,965,000 Administration and Management........................ 36,630,000 Adjudication......................................... 42,836,000 Women's Bureau....................................... 35,361,000 Civil Rights Activities.............................. 11,591,000 Chief Financial Officer.............................. 6,042,000 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Office of the Solicitor (SOL).--The recommendation includes $178,183,000 for SOL to bring enforcement actions on behalf of DOL's agencies. The SOL is encouraged to increase staffing levels to assist in the development of investigations, negotiations, and litigations to ensure workers get the relief they deserve. Bureau of International Labor Affairs (ILAB).--Of the $138,965,000 recommended for ILAB, the Committee directs the Secretary to allocate not less than $40,500,000 in grants to build the capacity of countries to enforce labor rights to promote a more level playing field for workers in the U. S. while maintaining critical funding for combatting child labor. The Committee directs ILAB to use its fiscal year 2023 funding increase to place additional labor attaches in strategic countries, including, but not limited to, Honduras. Flagship Reports on Child Labor and Forced Labor.--ILAB is directed to continue its work on three key reports, including: DOL's Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor; the List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor; and, the List of Products Produced by Forced or Indentured Child Labor. The Committee includes the resources requested in the fiscal year 2023 budget request for staff and contract costs to fulfill a new statutory mandate requiring the List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor to include goods that are produced with inputs that are produced with forced labor or child labor. USMCA Implementation Act.--The Committee urges ILAB to use USMCA Implementation Act funding to directly support workers' rights and capacity to organize independent unions in Mexico. These activities must be central to ILAB's monitoring, enforcement, and capacity-building roles in USMCA implementation. ILAB can also advance this critical work through technical assistance that strengthens the capacity of independent unions in USMCA priority sectors. Further, ILAB can fund research and legal teams, including through academic institutions, to develop sustainable programs that train and support labor lawyers and researchers in priority sectors. Finally, ILAB can support key USMCA objectives by funding innovative supply chain monitoring and accountability mechanisms, focused on ensuring the effective recognition of workers' rights to organize and collective bargaining in USMCA priority sectors. Such efforts to develop necessary research, legal assistance and monitoring mechanisms will collectively supplement and strengthen core ILAB program to directly educate and train workers to build independent unions. In the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification, ILAB is directed to include spending plans for resources provided in the USMCA Implementation Act for fiscal years 2020 through 2024. Spending plans should include descriptions and amounts for projects and staffing. Child Labor in Cocoa.--The Committee is concerned about the continued prevalence of child labor in the harvesting and production of cocoa beans. Further, the Committee notes that while the Child Labor Cocoa Coordinating Group (GLCCG) has facilitated progress in the reduction of child labor in cocoa production, substantial levels of children remain engaged in child labor in the industry. The Committee is concerned about the progress of the GLCCG in accordance with goals established in the Harkin-Engel Protocol. The Committee encourages the Department to report on indicators of progress being made by high-risk countries to eliminate child labor and forced labor in the cocoa sector, including progress being made to map all cocoa farms. In addition, the Committee encourages the Department to report on government and industry use of available best practices for management, reporting, and verification, and on the active and meaningful participation of worker organizations in order to provide consumers with assurance that cocoa products are produced without the use of child labor and forced labor. Women's Bureau.--Of the $35,361,000 appropriated to the Women's Bureau, the Committee provides no less than $7,500,000 for the Women in Apprenticeship and Nontraditional Occupations (WANTO) program, which is $5,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the fiscal year 2023 budget request. This program helps employers and labor unions recruit, train, and retain women for nontraditional employment opportunities. These resources are essential in helping women overcome traditional barriers to entry and supporting women's full participation in the labor force. Operating Plan.--The Committee directs the Department to submit its annual Operating Plan to the Committees on Appropriations within the 45-day statutory deadline. Advertising Spending.--The Committee understands that, as the largest advertiser in the U.S., the Federal Government should work to ensure fair access to its advertising contracts for small disadvantaged businesses and businesses owned by minorities and women. The Committee directs the Department to include the following information in its fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification: Expenditures for fiscal year 2022 and expected expenditures for fiscal years 2023 and 2024, respectively, for (1) all contracts for advertising services; and, (2) contracts for the advertising services of`(I) socially and economically disadvantaged small business concerns (as defined in section 8(a)(4) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)(4)); and (II) women- and minority-owned businesses. Nondisclosure Agreements.--The Committee recognizes that harassment, including sexual harassment and assault, continue to be pervasive in the workplace, and that the use of predispute nondisclosure and nondisparagement clauses as conditions of employment can perpetuate illegal conduct by silencing survivors and shielding perpetrators. The Committee directs the Department to include proposals in its fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification to eliminate the use of grants and contracts to employers that use this practice. National Equal Pay Enforcement Task Force.--The Committee strongly urges the Secretary to establish a National Equal Pay Enforcement Task Force (Task Force), consisting of representatives from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Department of Justice, the Department of Labor, and the Office of Personnel Management. The mission of the Task Force should be to improve compliance, public education, and enforcement of equal pay laws. The agencies in the Task Force should coordinate activities and limit potential gaps in enforcement. The Committee further urges the Task Force to investigate challenges related to pay inequity, advance recommendations to address those challenges, and create action plans to implement the recommendations. The Committee requests an update in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification on steps to establish the Task Force. Employees.--The Committee directs the Department to provide a report not later than 30 days after the conclusion of each quarter detailing the number of full-time equivalent employees and attrition by principal office and appropriations account. Investments in Impoverished Areas.--The Committee supports targeted investments in impoverished areas, particularly in persistent poverty counties and in other high poverty census tracts. To understand how programs funded through the Department are serving these particular areas, the Committee directs the Department to submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations on the percentage of funds allocated by all competitive grant programs in fiscal years 2020, 2021 and 2022 to serve individuals living in persistent poverty counties, as defined as a county that has had 20 percent or more of its population living in poverty over the past 30 years, as measured by the 1990 and 2000 decennial censuses and the most recent Small Area Income and Poverty estimates, or any territory or possession of the United States, and high-poverty areas, as defined as any census tract with a poverty rate of at least 20 percent as measured by the 2014-2018 5-year data series available from the American Community Survey of the Census Bureau. The Department shall report this information to the Committees within 90 days of such data being available and provide a briefing to the Committees not later than 180 days of enactment of this Act on how the Department is carrying out this directive. In the case of any competitive program for which at least 10 percent of the funds allocated were not allocated to persistent poverty counties or for which the percentage allocated to high-poverty areas in fiscal year 2021 or 2022 was less than the average percentage of Federal assistance allocated to high-poverty areas awarded under the program in fiscal years 2017, 2018, and 2019, such report and briefing shall explain why such a benchmark is unable to be met. Study on the Health Impact of Pesticide Use on Children in Agriculture.--The Committee includes $1,000,000 for the Department to contract with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) to study the impact of pesticide exposure on children working in agriculture. Pesticides have a detrimental effect on human health, with children among the particularly vulnerable, and low levels of pesticide exposure can affect children's neurological and behavioral development. The Committee encourages NASEM to review other environmental hazard-related exposures on children in agriculture as well. Evidence-based Policymaking Act.--The Committee is supportive of efforts by the Department to consider evidence of effectiveness in grant competitions and requests an update in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification on implementation of the Foundations for Evidence-based Policymaking Act (P.L. 115-435) and implementation plans for the coming year. The Committee encourages the Secretary to develop guidance to ensure relevant participants and grantees are involved in the Department-wide process of prioritizing evidence needs, including participating in Department led evaluations. Consistent with program statutes, the Committee encourages the Secretary to ensure that evidence of effectiveness is a consideration in grant opportunities. Organizational Priority Goals.--The Committee directs the Department to comply with title 31 of the United States Code, including the development of organizational priority goals and outcomes such as performance outcome measures, output measures, efficiency measures, and customer service measures. The Committee further directs the Department to include an update on the progress of these efforts in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification. Streamlining Service Delivery and Improving Customer Service.--The Committee continues to support efforts to improve customer service in accordance with Executive Order 13571-- Streamlining Service Delivery and Improving Customer Service. The Committee directs the Secretary to develop standards to improve customer service and incorporate the standards into the performance plans required under 31 U.S.C. 1115. The Committee further directs the Department to include an update on the progress of these efforts in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification. Use of Force.--The Committee supports vigorous action to improve training for all Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers on racial profiling, implicit bias, procedural justice, the use of force, and the duty for officers to intervene when witnessing the use of excessive force against civilians. The Committee therefore directs the Secretary to work with the Attorney General and the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers to implement improved, mandatory training on these topics for all federal law enforcement officers, along with the development of related standards that can be applied in hiring and performance assessments. These training requirements and standards should be based on the related provisions in H.R. 1280, as passed by the House of Representatives in March 2021. The Committee directs the Department's Division of Protective Operations, to the extent it has not already done so, to submit its use of force data to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's National Use of Force Data Collection database. The Committee requests a briefing within 90 days of enactment of this Act on current efforts to tabulate and submit use of force data to the FBI. Inter-agency Collaboration.--The Committee identifies a need for more inter-agency collaboration between the Department--including WHD and OSHA--, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and the National Labor Relations Board to enforce labor and civil rights laws fully and effectively. The Committee encourages the agencies to review and evaluate current enforcement efforts, rescind harmful regulations and sub-regulatory guidance, and ensure each agency is using all the tools and policies at their disposal to protect workers. This includes robust coordinated outreach and education to rebuild trust in government enforcement, especially in communities of color. Critical Minerals.--The Committee recognizes the importance of critical minerals for use in the United States. In response to this growing need, as part of the Consolidated Appropriations, Act of 2021 (P.L. 116-260), Congress authorized in section 7002 a workforce assessment and workforce development program in the Department of Labor to address mineral security. The Committee requests an update on these efforts in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification. Residential Contractor Certification Program.--The Committee encourages the Department to develop a system, similar to Energy Star, to help consumers make informed decisions when hiring a residential contractor to perform work. The Department should work with labor unions and other stakeholders in developing such a system. The Committee requests a briefing within 90 days of enactment of this Act on the Department's plans to develop this system.

This funding will enhance the quality of employment support services for transitioning service members and allow VETS to develop and implement a course curriculum to help military spouses overcome the challenges they face related to employment and career development. The Committee includes $70,500,000 for the Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program, which is $10,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and $8,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2023 budget request. Funds will be used to further support the needs of veterans experiencing homelessness. The Committee includes $500,000, which is the same as the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the fiscal year 2023 budget request, to support the HIRE Vets Medallion Program authorized by the Honoring Investments in Recruiting and Employing American Military Veterans Act of 2017. The Committee recommendation includes $300,000 within Federal Administration, which is the same as the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the fiscal year 2023 budget request, to continue the operation of the Disabled Veteran Program (DVP), which was initiated by the Committee in fiscal year 2020. The DVP addresses the high unemployment and low labor force participation rate of veterans with service-connected and non- service-connected disabilities. The DVP helps increase employment and advancement opportunities for veterans with disabilities by working with Federal, State, and private partners to promote the hiring of veterans with disabilities, improve coordination of available employment services and supports, and to identify and share employment best practices for hiring, retaining, and advancing veterans with disabilities in the workforce. Equity and Access for Homeless Veterans.--The Committee continues to direct the Department to include an update on racial equity and access to programs at the Department providing services to homeless veterans in its fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification. The update shall also track departmental expenditures within the Homeless Veteran Programs, specifically with regard to minority, female, and LGBTQ populations. Where available, the Department shall disaggregate data by ethnicity, age, gender identity, and discharge status. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY MODERNIZATION Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $28,269,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 47,969,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 38,269,000 Change from enacted level......................... +10,000,000 Change from budget request........................ -9,700,000 Information Technology (IT) Modernization provides a dedicated source of funding for Department-wide IT modernization projects together with funding through the Department's Working Capital Fund. OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $90,847,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 107,865,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 99,028,000 Change from enacted level......................... +8,181,000 Change from budget request........................ -8,837,000 The Office of Inspector General (OIG) conducts audits of Department programs and operations in order to determine that they comply with the applicable laws and regulations, that they use resources effectively, and that they are achieving their intended results. The recommendation includes $93,187,000 from the General Fund of the Treasury, which is $8,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level, and $5,841,000 from the Employment Security Administration Account in the Unemployment Trust Fund. Pandemic Unemployment Assistance.--The PUA program was designed to ensure that critical emergency assistance was delivered immediately, so it would be available to unemployed workers when it was most needed. It is important to ensure that resources for such critical emergency assistance during simultaneous public health crisis and financial crisis should be targeted to individuals and families who are eligible for benefits. The Committee supports the Inspector General's oversight activities and efforts to investigate any illegal schemes to defraud the PUA program. General Provisions Sec. 101.

TITLE II--DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Health Resources and Services Administration Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $8,891,772,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 8,782,614,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 9,574,521,000 Change from enacted level......................... +682,749,000 Change from budget request........................ +791,907,000 The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) supports programs that provide health services to disadvantaged, medically underserved, and special populations; decrease infant mortality rates; assist in the education of health professionals; and provide technical assistance regarding the utilization of health resources and facilities. The Committee recommendation for HRSA includes $9,295,951,000 in discretionary budget authority, $256,370,000 in mandatory funding and $15,200,000 in trust fund appropriations for the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program Trust Fund, and $7,000,000 for the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program. PRIMARY HEALTH CARE Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $1,748,772,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 1,839,022,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 1,946,772,000 Change from enacted level......................... +198,000,000 Change from budget request........................ +107,750,000 Health Centers The Committee recommends $1,945,772,000 for the Health Centers program, $198,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and $107,750,000 above the fiscal year 2023 budget request. Health Centers deliver affordable, accessible, quality, and cost-effective primary health care to millions of people across the country regardless of their ability to pay. Programs supported by this funding include community health centers, migrant health centers, health care for the homeless, and public housing health service grants. The Committee includes bill language providing up to $120,000,000 for the Federal Tort Claims Act program, the same as the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the fiscal year 2023 budget request. Alcee L. Hastings Program for Advanced Cancer Screening in Underserved Communities.--The Committee appreciates the work and leadership of HRSA to implement the Alcee L. Hastings Program for Advanced Cancer Screening in Underserved Communities and provides $15,000,000 for this activity, an increase of $10,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. This program is imperative to redressing disparities in cancer screening in medically underserved communities. In continuing to implement this program, the Committee encourages HRSA to support approaches that leverage the use of community health workers and navigators providing health services at the individual health center and, where appropriate, health center- controlled network level with training, oversight, and clinical workflow support from NCI-designated comprehensive cancer centers. Also, given the immense data supporting the disparate impact of lung cancer on medically underserved populations and the effectiveness of screening for this condition, the Committee strongly encourages HRSA to prioritize programs targeting lung cancer, such as screening and smoking cessation counseling. Early Childhood Development.--The Committee provides $42,500,000 within the total for HRSA-funded Health Centers to hire or contract for early childhood development specialists to better integrate early developmental promotion services, as described in the fiscal year 2023 budget request. The Committee encourages HRSA to create a service expansion grant opportunity for health centers, with training and technical assistance to be provided by the Maternal and Child Health Bureau, which has a long-standing commitment to improving the health and wellbeing of young children and their families. Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) Initiative.--The Committee provides $172,000,000 within the Health Centers program for the EHE Initiative, $49,750,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2023 budget request. This initiative provides funding to Health Centers in high-need jurisdictions to increase the use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among people at high risk for HIV transmission. Health Care for the Homeless.--The Committee supports the activities of the Health Care for the Homeless program, which provides funding to community-based health centers to provide low- or no-cost health care to underserved populations using a trauma-informed, harm reduction approach. Services provided by such health centers include primary care, mental health treatment, substance use treatment, medical respite care, case management, and enrollment/benefits assistance. Health Center Controlled Networks (HCCNs).--These networks are the foundation of health information technology (HIT) services for the nation's community health centers. Health centers function as the largest primary care network in the country, caring for 30 million patients. HCCNs are voluntary associations of community health centers that band together to invest in HIT tools, optimize the use of these technologies, digitally connect to health care and community partners, and more. The HIT infrastructure requires robust Federal investment to support the demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic's resulting shift in how health care is provided. The Committee encourages HRSA to provide robust support for these networks and requests as part of the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification an update on the status of the network HIT infrastructure. Integrating High-Quality Contraceptive Care.--The Committee is aware that while most primary care physicians provide women's health services, many are not able to provide patients with a broad range of contraceptive care options, including long-acting reversible contraceptive methods that require specialized training and skill development. The Committee includes $25,000,000 within the total for Health Centers to support grants for training and quality improvement efforts to make available patient-centered contraceptive care within health center primary care settings. Grantees may use funds to support training and quality improvement to implement best practices in contraceptive care, including reproductive health screening, patient-centered contraceptive counseling, and access to the full range of FDA-approved, cleared, or granted contraceptive products that are determined by an individual's medical provider to be medically appropriate. These activities would improve health equity, strengthen maternal health and prenatal care, and empower patients to decide if and when they want to become pregnant. School-Based Health Centers (SBHCs) and Health Center School-Based Service Sites.--Recognizing the critical role of Health Centers as part of our Nation's health care safety net, and that Health Centers providing services at sites located at schools within the communities they serve are currently one of the most effective sources of mental health care for children and adolescents, the Committee includes $50,000,000, an increase of $20,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level, for awards to Health Centers operating school-based service sites to increase their capacity to meet the increasing demand for health services, including mental health services. The Committee also includes $50,000,000 to make grants to fund the School-Based Health Center Program and expand services at SBHCs pursuant to 42 USC 280h-5. SBHCs provide a convenient access point to high-quality, comprehensive primary health care, mental health services, preventive care, social services, and youth development to primarily children and adolescents from low-income families. HRSA Strategy to Address Intimate Partner Violence and Project Catalyst.--The Committee includes no less than $2,000,000 within the total for Health Centers for the HRSA Strategy to Address Intimate Partner Violence, the same as the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. Native Hawaiian Health Care Program.--The Committee provides $23,000,000 within the total for Health Centers for the Native Hawaiian Health Care Program, $1,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the fiscal year 2023 budget request. The Native Hawaiian Health Care Systems help improve the health status of Native Hawaiians by making health education, health promotion, disease prevention, and Native Hawaiian traditional healing services available. Of the total amount appropriated for the Native Hawaiian Health Care Program, not less than $10,000,000 shall be provided to Papa Ola Lokahi for administrative purposes authorized under 42 U.S.C. 11706, including expanded research and surveillance related to the health status of Native Hawaiians and strengthening the capacity of the Native Hawaiian Health Care Systems to provide comprehensive health education and promotion, disease prevention services, traditional healing practices, and primary health services to Native Hawaiians. Vaccination and Screening for Hepatitis B.--The Committee encourages HRSA to urge health center grantees to adopt the necessary practices and policies to comply with the November 2021 Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendation that all adults between 19 and 59 be vaccinated for hepatitis B. To implement this policy, the Committee further encourages HRSA to ensure that Health Centers screen all individuals for hepatitis B, offer to immunize all non- infected patients in the 19-59 age cohort, and navigate infected individuals into care. The Committee urges that this recommendation be implemented as early as possible in fiscal year 2023. Free Clinics Medical Malpractice The Committee includes $1,000,000 for carrying out responsibilities under the Federal Tort Claims Act, the same as the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the fiscal year 2023 budget request. The program provides medical malpractice coverage to individuals involved in the operation of free clinics to expand access to health care services to low-income individuals in medically underserved areas. HEALTH WORKFORCE Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $1,295,742,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 1,619,884,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 1,543,566,000 Change from enacted level......................... +247,824,000 Change from budget request........................ -76,318,000 The Bureau of Health Workforce strengthens the health care workforce by providing grants, scholarships, and loan repayment programs to help communities recruit and retain health care providers where they are most needed. The Committee bill strikes language prohibiting HRSA funds from being used to support section 340G-1 of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act), which authorizes demonstration projects to train or employ alternative dental health care providers, including dental therapists. Dental therapists are licensed providers who play a similar role in dentistry to that of physician assistants in medicine, and work under the supervision of a dentist to provide routine dental care like exams and fillings. Ending this prohibition on funding will give States flexibility to expand the oral health workforce and improve access to dental care, particularly in rural and underserved communities. Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Health Workforce.-- The Committee looks forward to receiving the report requested in House Report 117-96 on the impact of the COVID-19 public health emergency on the nursing workforce and encourages HRSA to continue to analyze and make information available about the impact of the pandemic on the broader health care workforce and strategies to mitigate and address these impacts. Registered Nursing Shortages.--The Committee is concerned about current and projected shortages of registered nurses in the U.S. as discussed in the HRSA publication Supply and Demand Projections of the Nursing Workforce 2014-2030. The Committee encourages HRSA to prioritize investments to increase the supply of registered nurses particularly in states with the greatest projected shortages. Report and Analysis of Technology's Role in the Health Care Workforce.--The Committee recognizes the important role that HHS and its operating divisions continue to provide to support and protect the public health workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Committee directs HRSA to submit a report to the Committee within 18 months of enactment of this Act on the challenges associated with hiring, recruiting, and retaining the Federal, State, local, Tribal and territorial public health workforce. This study should include a specific analysis of how technology, especially hands-free technology, could help to protect clinicians' physical safety and ease the burden of patient care, thereby increasing retention of the public health workforce. Grant-Based Program to Include Disability Clinical Care Competency Training.--The Committee strongly encourages HRSA to consider implementation of 42 U.S.C. 293, to develop a grant- based program in collaboration with the National Council on Disability, professional societies, licensing and accreditation entities, health professions schools, experts in minority health and cultural competency, and public health and disability groups, and community-based organizations to expand upon the National Initiative In Developmental Medicine: Draft Curriculum, which targets a patient population of adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities, to include disability clinical care competency training inclusive of all disability patient subpopulations (e.g. deaf, blind, mobility disabilities, etc.). Addressing Workforce Shortages.--The Committee supports HRSA's efforts to develop the workforce needed to care for a rapidly aging U.S. population. The Committee encourages HRSA to address the skilled care workforce needs of seniors through existing workforce education and training programs. National Health Service Corps (NHSC) The Committee includes $155,600,000, an increase of $34,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level, for NHSC to support competitive awards to health care providers dedicated to working in underserved communities in urban, rural, and tribal areas. Within this total, the Committee includes an increase of $10,000,000 for loan repayment for mental and behavioral health providers, including peer support specialists, that serve in crisis centers, as described in the fiscal year 2023 budget request. The Committee also includes $15,600,000, the same as the fiscal year 2022 enacted level, within the total to support NHSC awards to participating individuals that provide health services in IHS facilities, Tribally-Operated Health Programs, and Urban Indian Health Programs. Behavioral Health Demonstration Program.--The Committee notes that racial and ethnic minority communities continue to face acute challenges accessing behavioral health services due to the lack of providers who speak their language or understand their culture. The Committee includes $10,000,000 within NHSC for a pilot program to evaluate the benefit to patient access and practitioner recruitment and retention of increasing loan repayment of upwards of $15,000 above the maximum amount for qualified behavioral health providers serving in Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), preferably at which at least 20 percent of patients are best served in a language other than English. The Committee notes that if the qualified behavioral health provider is fluent in a language other than English or is determined by the health center to have achieved fluency in a language other than English during the provider's period of obligated service, the provider shall be paid $15,000 above the maximum amount. The Committee also directs HRSA to include an assessment of program utilization and impact in the annual NHSC report to Congress. Maternity Care Target Areas (MCTAs).--The Committee includes $5,000,000, $4,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2023 budget request, within NHSC to implement requirements contained in the Improving Access to Maternity Care Act, including establishing criteria for and identifying MCTAs and collecting and publishing data on the availability and need for maternity care health services in Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs). NHSC Loan Repayment Application Process.--The Committee is concerned that HPSA designations may not arrive in time for provider to apply for loan forgiveness through the NHSC loan repayment program, and therefore must wait for the loan forgiveness application to reopen. Given the loan repayment program is a critical component to attract providers-- particularly those in critically needed fields like behavioral health--the Committee is concerned that the timeline for HPSA designation process and the timeline for NHSC loan repayment are inconsistent and could deter providers from participating in the NHSC. The Committee requests a report within 90 days of enactment of this Act assessing the coordination of the two processes, and any improvements that could be made to ensure all providers working in a HPSA are eligible for the NHSC student loan repayment program as soon as they are hired or the HPSA is designated during the calendar year. Rural Demonstration Program.--The Committee notes that rural communities continue to face acute workforce challenges, with approximately five percent of incoming medical students coming from rural areas and only one-third of NHSC placements in rural communities. The Committee includes $10,000,000 within NHSC to conduct a pilot program to evaluate the benefit to patient access and practitioner recruitment and retention of extending loan repayment for 5 years and $200,000 for providers serving in a rural HPSA. The Committee directs HRSA to submit a report to the Committee within a year of enactment of this Act on program utilization and impact. Health Professions Training for Diversity The Committee supports programs that improve the diversity of the health care workforce. HRSA's diversity pipeline programs, including the Health Careers Opportunity Program, Centers for Excellence, Faculty Loan Repayment, Nursing Workforce Diversity, and Scholarships for Disadvantaged Students, help advance patient care and ensure opportunity for all health care providers. Centers of Excellence (COEs).--The Committee includes $30,422,000 for COEs, $6,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. This program provides grants to health professions schools and other institutions to serve as resource and education centers for the recruitment, training, and retention of underrepresented minority students and faculty. Health Careers Opportunity Program (HCOP).--The Committee includes $18,500,000 for HCOP, $3,050,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2023 budget request.

Primary Care Training and Enhancement The Committee includes $54,924,000, an increase of $6,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 level and $1,000,000 above the fiscal year 2023 budget request, for Primary Care Training and Enhancement programs, which support training and direct financial assistance for future primary care clinicians, teachers, and researchers. The Committee includes funding to support the proposal in the fiscal year 2023 budget request to make grants to support mental health training for primary care professionals. Eating Disorders Screening, Brief Intervention, Referral, and Treatment (SBIRT).--The COVID-19 pandemic worsened eating disorders across the Nation, with one study reporting a significant increase in eating disorder caseloads in children's hospitals. Despite the medical and psychiatric acuity associated with eating disorders, many patients remain undetected and untreated, as only 20 percent of surveyed medical residency programs offer elective training in eating disorders and only six percent require such training. Within the total for Primary Care Training and Enhancement, the Committee provides up to $1,000,000, in coordination with SAMHSA's Center of Excellence for Eating Disorders, to provide trainings for primary care health professionals to screen, briefly intervene, and refer patients to treatment for the severe mental illness of eating disorders, as authorized under section 13006 of the 21st Century Cures Act.

Action for Dental Health.--With the enactment of the Action for Dental Health Act of 2018, the Committee encourages HRSA to expand oral health grants for innovative programs under PHS Act Section 340G to include Action for Dental Health activities. The Action for Dental Health program helps reduce barriers to dental care through oral health education, prevention, and the establishment of dental homes for underserved populations. Interdisciplinary Community-Based Linkages Area Health Education Centers (AHEC).--The Committee includes $48,000,000 for the AHEC program, an increase of $3,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 level and $4,750,000 above the fiscal year 2023 budget request. This program links university health science centers with community health service delivery systems to provide education and training networks. Patient Safety Telesimulation Programs.--The Committee encourages HRSA to support the development and implementation of patient safety telesimulation programs. Allowable use of these funds may include increasing virtual content delivery capacity at modeling simulation centers, establishing partnerships with medical schools in providing telesimulation programs, developing telesimulation content and devices, developing appropriate governance on data and data management, and outfitting HPSA locations with necessary telesimulation hardware and software assets. Geriatrics Workforce Enhancement Program (GWEP).--The Committee includes $48,245,000 for the GWEP program, $3,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 level and $1,708,000 above the fiscal year 2023 budget request.

Adolescent Addiction Medicine and Addiction Psychiatry Workforce.--The Committee remains concerned by the lack of pediatric and adolescent addiction medicine and addiction psychiatry expertise. Currently, there are insufficient opportunities to effectively train a robust mental health and substance use disorder (SUD) workforce. Only 75 of the Nation's 179 accredited medical schools offer addiction medicine fellowships, and only one program focuses on fellowship opportunities for pediatric and adolescent addiction medicine and addiction psychiatry. The Committee strongly encourages HRSA to include an adequate number of funding awards to fellowship programs focused on increasing the number of board certified pediatric and adolescent addiction medicine and addiction psychiatry subspecialists. Graduate Psychology Education (GPE).--Within the total for Mental and Behavioral Health Programs, the Committee recommendation includes $25,000,000, $5,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level, for the interprofessional GPE program to increase the number of health service psychologists trained to provide integrated services to high-need, underserved populations in rural and urban communities. The Committee recognizes the severe impact of COVID-19 on Americans' mental and behavioral health and urges HRSA to strengthen investments in the training of health service psychologists to help meet these demands. Behavioral Health Workforce Education and Training (BHWET).--The Committee includes $185,000,000 for the BHWET Program, $62,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. This program establishes and expands internships or field placement programs in behavioral health, serving populations in rural and medically underserved areas. The Committee is concerned that increased gun violence and the pandemic's exacerbation of health disparities has unveiled an immediate and desperate need for behavioral health professionals, including social workers, psychologists, counselors, occupational therapists, and psychiatrists. Neuropsychiatrists and advanced practice behavioral nurses are specially trained to diagnose mood disorders or biochemical imbalances. A HRSA report, however, found that there will be a shortage of 250,000 mental health professionals by 2025. The Committee supports increased funding for BHWET to increase the quality and supply of behavioral health professionals and access to behavioral health services, in particular for children, adolescents, and transitional-aged youth at risk for behavioral health disorders. The Committee encourages HRSA to continue to collect data and analyze the scope of the shortage of behavioral health professionals and barriers to careers in behavioral health. Behavioral Health Integration Into Community-Based Settings.--The Committee includes $10,000,000, the same as the fiscal year 2023 budget request, to provide grants to community-based organizations and local health departments to integrate navigators and community health workers trained in Mental Health First Aid or similar trainings into non- traditional community settings. This effort will be carried out in partnership with the Maternal and Child Health Bureau and will help to address the behavioral health needs of families in underserved communities. Community Improvement Program.--The Committee includes $10,000,000, the same as the fiscal year 2023 budget request, to develop and expand community-based experiential training through internships and field placements for behavioral health and behavioral health-related professionals to prepare them to work with and support individuals who are involved, or at risk of being involved, in the criminal justice system. Crisis Workforce Development.--The Committee includes $15,000,000 for grants to support crisis workforce development. Crisis service models present opportunities for cost savings and more effective use of the behavioral health workforce by stabilizing individuals experiencing behavioral health crises in less intensive settings. Mental and Substance Use Disorder Workforce Training Demonstration.--The Committee includes $34,700,000 for this activity, $3,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and $700,000 above the fiscal year 2023 budget request. This program makes grants to institutions, including but not limited to medical schools and FQHCs, to support training for medical residents and fellows in psychiatry and addiction medicine, as well as nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and others, to provide SUD treatment in underserved communities. Peer Support Specialists in the Opioid Use Disorder Workforce.--Within the total for BHWET, the Committee includes $14,000,000, the same as the fiscal year 2022 enacted level, to fund training, internships, and national certification for mental health and SUD peer support specialists to create an advanced peer workforce prepared to work in clinical settings. Social Workers.--While the Committee is aware that the behavioral health workforce is seeing shortages in all professions, the Committee encourages HRSA to ensure that social workers are receiving equitable treatment from the program given their multifaceted roles in health care settings. Additionally, the Committee encourages HRSA to ensure that program awardees are actively working to recruit a diverse field of behavioral health professionals. Substance Use Disorder Treatment and Recovery (STAR) Loan Repayment Program.--The Committee includes $28,000,000 for this program, $4,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the same as fiscal year 2023 budget request. An estimated 21 million Americans needed treatment for SUD in 2017, but only 4 million received any form of treatment for SUD. The Bureau of Labor Statistics data has cited tremendous workforce shortages in the SUD treatment profession. Without strategic investments in the SUD workforce, this gap will not close and more lives will be lost. This program addresses shortages in the SUD workforce by providing for the repayment of education loans for individuals working in a full-time SUD treatment job that involves direct patient care in either a Mental Health Professional Shortage Area or a county where the overdose death rate exceeds the national average. National Center for Health Workforce Analysis (NCHWA) The Committee includes $6,663,000, $1,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the fiscal year 2023 budget request, for the NCHWA. This program collects and analyzes health workforce data to provide information on health workforce supply and demand. Public Health and Preventive Medicine Training Programs The Committee includes $18,000,000 for Public Health and Preventive Medicine Training Grant Programs, $1,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2023 budget request.

Nursing Workforce Development The Committee recommends $324,472,000 for Nursing Workforce Development programs authorized under title VIII of the PHS Act, $44,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and $29,500,000 above the fiscal year 2023 budget request. Expanding Access to Nursing Education.--The Committee remains concerned about workforce shortages among health care professionals, including the nursing workforce. According to the American Hospital Association, nursing vacancies increased by nearly 30 percent between 2019 and 2020, with an additional 500,000 nurses expected to retire or leave the profession by the end of this year. Recent studies suggest that an additional 1.2 million nurses will be required in the U.S. by 2030 to meet anticipated demand, with States like California, Texas, and Florida projected among those with the greatest need. The Committee also recognizes that nursing schools across the U.S. are struggling to expand capacity to meet this rising demand for care. Significant shortages of faculty, classroom space, and clinical training sites are commonly identified as factors in nursing schools turning away qualified applicants in many areas of the country. The Committee supports efforts to expand access to educational opportunities at accredited nursing schools to qualified applicants, including low-income and minority students, to meet this growing demand for nursing professionals. Experiential Learning Opportunities.--The Committee is aware that mental health is one of the most in-demand skills in nursing, but many nurse education training programs do not expose students to mental health care settings. The Committee encourages HRSA to give priority to experiential learning opportunities grantees that are partnering with behavioral and mental health hospitals to increase the pipeline of nurses into this field. Advanced Nursing Education.--The Committee includes $105,581,000 for Advanced Nursing Education, $26,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2023 budget request. This program supports traineeships and faculty and curriculum development to increase the number of qualified nurses in the primary care workforce.

These funds will support grants to accredited nurse midwifery programs or other eligible entities to award scholarships to students and registered nurses to cover the total cost of tuition for the duration of the nurse midwifery program, as well as the planning/ development of new midwife training programs. Nursing Education, Practice, Quality, and Retention (NEPQR).--The Committee includes $56,413,000 for NEPQR, $2,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and $7,500,000 above the fiscal year 2023 budget request. This program supports academic, service, and continuing education projects to enhance nursing education, improve the quality of care, increase nurse retention, and strengthen the nursing workforce. Nurse Practitioner Optional Fellowship Program.--The Committee provides $6,000,000, the same as the fiscal year 2022 enacted level, for grants to establish or expand community- based nurse practitioner residency and fellowship training programs for practicing postgraduate nurse practitioners in primary care or behavioral health, as described in House Report 117-96. Nursing Workforce Diversity.--The Committee includes $26,343,000 for Nursing Workforce Diversity, $3,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the fiscal year 2023 budget request. This program increases nursing education opportunities for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds by providing student stipends, scholarships, and preparation and retention activities. Nurse Corps Scholarship and Loan Repayment.--The Committee includes $101,635,000 for Nurse Corps, $13,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the fiscal year 2023 budget request. This program supports scholarships and loan repayment assistance for nurses and nursing students committed to working in communities with inadequate access to care. Nursing Faculty Loan Program.--The Committee includes $28,500,000 for the Nursing Faculty Loan Program, the same as the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the fiscal year 2023 budget request. This program supports schools of nursing to provide loans to students enrolled in advanced nursing education programs who are committed to becoming nurse faculty. Children's Hospitals Graduate Medical Education (CHGME) The Committee includes $385,000,000 for the CHGME payment program, $10,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and $35,000,000 above the fiscal year 2023 budget request. This program helps eligible hospitals maintain graduate medical education programs, which support the training of residents to care for the pediatric population and enhance the supply of primary care and pediatric medical and surgical subspecialties. Medical Student Education The Committee includes $60,000,000, $5,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level, to support colleges of medicine at public universities located in the top quartile of States projected to have a primary care provider shortage. The Committee directs HRSA to give priority to applications from academic institutions located in States with the greatest number of Federally-recognized Tribes. The Committee also directs HRSA to give priority to applications from public universities with a demonstrated public-private partnership. Pediatric Subspecialty Loan Repayment Program The Committee includes $15,000,000, an increase of $10,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level, for the Pediatric Subspecialty Loan Repayment Program authorized in section 775 of the PHS Act. The Committee recognizes that there are significant shortages of pediatric subspecialists, child psychiatrists, and other child mental health providers in underserved areas. The Committee also understands that high graduate debt load is a significant barrier to providers choosing to complete additional training to enable them to provide specialized care for children with special medical and mental health care needs. Public Health Loan Repayment Program The Committee includes $25,000,000 to establish the Public Health Loan Repayment Program. Funds will support loan repayment for public health professionals who agree to serve three years in a local, State, or tribal health department. This investment in the public health workforce will contribute to our Nation's preparedness to address current and future public health emergencies. Preventing Burnout in the Health Workforce Program The Committee includes $25,000,000 for activities authorized in the Dr. Lorna Breen Health Care Provider Protection Act (P.L. 117-105) to provide comprehensive and evidence-based support to prevent suicide, burnout, and mental and behavioral health conditions among health care providers. National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) The Committee includes $18,814,000 for the NPDB, the same as the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the fiscal year 2023 budget request. The NPDB is a workforce tool that collects and discloses information to authorized entities on past adverse actions of health care practitioners, providers, and suppliers to reduce fraud and abuse and improve health care quality. MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $1,044,470,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 1,272,930,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 1,201,296,000 Change from enacted level......................... +156,826,000 Change from budget request........................ -71,634,000 The mission of the Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) is to improve the physical and mental health, safety, and well- being of the Nation's women, infants, children, adolescents, and their families. Maternal and Child Health (MCH) Block Grant The Committee recommends $872,700,000 for the MCH Block Grant, $125,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. States use the MCH Block Grant to improve access to care for mothers, children, and their families; reduce infant mortality; provide pre-and post-natal care; support screening and health assessments for children; and provide systems of care for children with special health care needs. MCH Block Grant Special Projects of Regional and National Significance The Committee continues bill language identifying specific amounts for Special Projects of Regional and National Significance (SPRANS). The Committee provides the following within SPRANS: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ FY 2023 Budget Activity Committee ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Health............................ $5,250,000 Set-aside for Epilepsy............................... 3,642,000 Set-aside for Sickle Cell Disease.................... 7,000,000 Set-aside for Fetal Alcohol Syndrome................. 1,000,000 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Addressing Emerging Issues and Social Determinants of Maternal Health.--The Committee includes $10,000,000 to create an innovation fund for community-based organizations to support reducing maternal mortality and adverse maternal outcomes, as described in the fiscal year 2023 budget request.

Alliance for Innovation in Maternal Health Safety Bundles.--The Committee includes $15,300,000, an increase of $3,300,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2023 budget request, to support continued implementation of the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health program's maternal safety bundles to all U.S. States, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories, as well as tribal entities. Maternal safety bundles are a set of targeted and evidence-based best practices that, when implemented, improve patient outcomes and reduce maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity. Behavioral Health Integration Into Community-Based Settings.--The Committee includes $40,000,000, the same as the fiscal year 2023 budget request, to provide grants to engage and train community partners in underserved communities to link mothers and children with resources to address their mental and behavioral health needs, as well as children's social and emotional development. This effort will be carried out in partnership with the Behavioral Health Workforce Education and Training program. Bias Recognition in Clinical Skills Testing.--The Committee includes $1,000,000, the same as the fiscal year 2023 budget request, to support a National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) study authorized under Subtitle D, Sec. 133 of the fiscal year 2022 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 117-103) to make recommendations for incorporating bias recognition in clinical skills testing for accredited schools of allopathic medicine and osteopathic medicine. Bias Training for Health Care Professionals.--The Committee includes $2,000,000 to make grant awards to train health care providers on identifying and avoiding implicit bias, as described in the fiscal year 2023 budget request. Congenital Syphilis (CS).--The Committee is concerned with the rise in CS. A recent report by CDC cited data showing a 300 percent increase in CS over the past five years. Those born with CS can have skeletal and facial deformities, deafness, blindness, be still born, or die shortly after birth. These conditions and deaths are completely preventable with expanded prenatal screening and appropriate treatment. The Committee urges HRSA to expand efforts to increase multiple prenatal screening and testing for CS throughout pregnancies to detect and treat CS at the earlier possible stage. Assuring that providers are trained on the recommended treatment of syphilis in pregnant women is a critical component of eliminating CS. Early Childhood Development Expert Grants.--The Committee includes $10,000,000, $5,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level, to support the placement of early childhood development experts in pediatric settings with a high percentage of Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program patients. Funds will support additional State-level awards and related technical assistance with nationwide reach. Group Prenatal and Postpartum Care Programs.--The Committee recognizes the important role of group prenatal and postpartum care (GPC/PC) programs, such as Centering Pregnancy, can have on improving prenatal care and providing support for expecting mothers. GPC/PC programs provide the opportunity for expectant mothers to learn more about pregnancy, a network of social support, educational tools, and ultimately work towards lowering rates of infant and maternal mortality. The Committee includes $2,000,000 within SPRANS for grants to establish new or support existing GPC/PC programs. Growing and Diversifying the Doula Workforce Program.--The Committee includes $10,000,000 to provide grants to community- based organizations to develop and/or expand programs to recruit doula candidates, support their training/certification, and then employ them as doulas to support improved birth outcomes in the community, as described in the fiscal year 2023 budget request.

Fetal, Infant, and Child Death Review (FIDCR).--The Committee includes no less than $3,100,000, an increase of $1,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level, for the FIDCR program to expand support and technical assistance to States and tribal communities and improve the availability of data on sudden unexpected infant deaths. Uterine Fibroids Public Health Information Dissemination.-- The Committee encourages HRSA to work with partners to advance awareness of uterine fibroids and promote evidence-based care for women with fibroids. These efforts may include specific information on minority women, who have an elevated risk to develop uterine fibroids, and the range of available options for the treatment of symptomatic uterine fibroids, including non-hysterectomy drugs and devices approved under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in these awareness efforts. The Committee encourages HRSA to work with health care-related specialty societies and health systems, as appropriate, to promote awareness of evidence-based care for women with fibroids. Maternal and Child Health Programs Sickle Cell Anemia Demonstration Program The Committee includes $8,205,000 for this program, an increase of $1,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the fiscal year 2023 budget request. The Committee recognizes the importance of the program in supporting the comprehensive sickle cell disease (SCD) centers in the provision of coordinated, comprehensive, culturally competent, and family-centered care to people with SCD. The Committee affirms the goals of the program to improve care delivery and access to high quality care for people with SCD, with a focus on increasing access to SCD specialists; increase the number of providers with SCD expertise and knowledge of SCD treatment methods; and enable access to the latest treatment options following evidence-based guidelines. With the start of new five-year grant awards in fiscal year 2022, the Committee requests an update in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Justification on how the program is supporting the growth of comprehensive sickle cell disease centers that provide the latest treatment options following evidence-based guidelines and have mechanisms to identify and serve patients with SCD who are not currently being cared for by SCD specialists. Autism and Other Developmental Disorders The Committee recommends $57,344,000 for Autism and Other Developmental Disorders, $3,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. These programs seek to improve the health and well-being of children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder and other developmental disabilities and to advance best practices for the early identification and treatment of autism and related developmental disabilities. Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental and Related Disabilities (LEND).--The Committee provides $38,245,000, $1,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level, for the LEND program to allow the existing 60 LEND sites to maintain their capacity to train interdisciplinary professionals to screen, diagnose, and provide evidence-based interventions to individuals with autism spectrum disorder and other developmental disabilities. Heritable Disorders The Committee provides $21,883,000 for the Heritable Disorders program, $2,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. This program assists States to improve and expand their newborn screening programs and to promote parent and provider education. HRSA also supports the work of the Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children, which provides states with a Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP) to help ensure every infant is screened for conditions that have a recognized treatment. With new funding provided in fiscal year 2023, the Heritable Disorders program can continue to enhance, improve, expand and provide technical assistance to State public health newborn screening systems as four new disorders have been added to the RUSP in the last six years, and can continue developing and disseminating national, regional, and State education and training resources for parents, families, providers, and patient support groups. Severe Combined Immune Deficiency (SCID).--Within the total amount for Heritable Disorders, the Committee provides $4,000,000, the same as the fiscal year 2022 enacted level, to support wider implementation, education, and awareness of newborn screening and follow-up for SCID and other newborn screening disorders. Healthy Start The Committee recommends $145,000,000 for the Healthy Start program, $13,160,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the fiscal year 2023 budget request. The program provides grants to communities with high rates of infant mortality to support primary and preventive health care services for mothers and their infants. The primary purpose of Healthy Start is to reduce maternal and infant mortality and to generally improve maternal and infant health. Grants are awarded to nonprofits, State and local health departments, and community health centers in eligible communities with high rates of infant mortality and other adverse birth outcomes to develop a package of innovative health and social services for pregnant women and infants, and evaluate those services. Funding is provided to both increase funding to existing grantees so they can increase the number of individuals served and to support new, additional awards to community-based organizations for targeted initiatives to reduce disparities in maternal and infant health outcomes. The Committee requests an update in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Justification on existing evaluations of Healthy Start's effectiveness. Maternal Mortality.--The Committee continues to provide no less than $15,000,000, the same as the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the fiscal year 2023 budget request, for Healthy Start grantees to support nurse practitioners, certified nurse midwives, physician assistants, and other maternal-child advance practice health professionals within all program sites nationwide. Early Hearing Detection and Intervention (EHDI) The Committee includes $18,818,000 for the EHDI program, an increase of $1,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the fiscal year 2023 budget request. This program awards grants to 53 States and territories to support Statewide systems of newborn hearing screening and early intervention programs. The Committee recognizes the requirement under the PHS Act for EHDI funds to support prompt evaluation and diagnosis of children referred from screening programs and appropriate educational, audiological, medical, and communication (or language acquisition) interventions (including family support), for children identified as deaf or hard-of-hearing. The Committee encourages HRSA to provide the most accurate, comprehensive, up-to-date, and evidence-based information to children identified as deaf or hard-of-hearing and their families. The Committee also encourages HRSA to work with partners to advance awareness about the wide range of modalities available for children who are deaf and hard of hearing, including but not limited to auditory-oral therapy, auditory-verbal therapy, Signed Exact English (SEE), American Sign Language (ASL), Total Communication (TC), and Cued Speech; as well as a full range of assistive hearing technologies, such as hearing aids and cochlear implants. Emergency Medical Services for Children The Committee includes $25,000,000 for Emergency Medical Services for Children, an increase of $2,666,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. Funding is available to every State emergency medical services office to improve the quality of emergency care for children and to support research on and dissemination of best practices. Screening and Treatment for Maternal Depression and Related Disorders State Grants The Committee provides $11,500,000 for the Screening and Treatment of Maternal Depression and Related Behavioral Disorders Program (MDRBD), an increase of $5,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and $1,500,000 above the fiscal year 2023 budget request. Suicide and overdose, driven by maternal mental health conditions (MMH), are the leading cause of maternal mortality in the first year following pregnancy. MMH conditions impact one in five pregnant or postpartum individuals, including as many as one in three pregnant and postpartum Black individuals. However, 75 percent of those impacted by MMH conditions go untreated. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the number of individuals experiencing MMH conditions, with pregnant and new mothers experiencing anxiety and depression at a three to four times higher rate than prior to the pandemic. MDRBD trains health care providers to screen, assess, and treat for MMH conditions and provide specialized psychiatric consultation to assist the providers. The Committee directs HRSA to make grants to establish new State programs and improve or maintain existing State programs, prioritizing States with high rates of adverse maternal health outcomes. Grants shall include culturally and linguistically appropriate approaches to assist in the reduction of maternal health inequities. The Committee recognizes the high need amongst States and directs MDRBD to provide technical assistance to non-grantee States. Pediatric Mental Health Access The Committee includes $14,000,000 for Pediatric Mental Health Access, an increase of $3,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and $4,000,000 above the fiscal year 2023 budget request. This program supports expanded access to behavioral health services in pediatric primary care by supporting the development of pediatric mental health care telehealth access programs. Poison Control Centers The Committee includes $26,846,000 for Poison Control Centers, an increase of $1,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and $2,000,000 above the fiscal year 2023 budget request. The Poison Control Centers program supports a national network of centers that prevent and treat poison exposures by providing cost effective, quality health care advice to the public and health care providers. The Committee encourages Poison Control Centers to partner with institutions of higher education in border communities to be better equipped to combat public health outbreaks exacerbated by the flow of people and goods across international borders. RYAN WHITE HIV/AIDS PROGRAM Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $2,494,776,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 2,654,781,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 2,694,776,000 Change from enacted level......................... +200,000,000 Change from budget request........................ +39,995,000 The Ryan White Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS) program funds activities to address the care and treatment of persons living with HIV/ AIDS who are either uninsured or underinsured and need assistance to obtain treatment. The program provides grants to States and eligible metropolitan areas to improve the quality, availability, and coordination of health care and support services to include access to HIV-related medications; grants to service providers for early intervention outpatient services; grants to organizations to provide care to HIV infected women, infants, children, and youth; and grants to organizations to support the education and training of health care providers. Within the total for the Ryan White HIV/AIDS program, the Committee provides the following amounts: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Budget Activity FY 2023 Committee ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Emergency Assistance................................. $691,045,000 Comprehensive Care Programs.......................... 1,385,517,000 AIDS Drug Assistance Program..................... 900,313,000 Early Intervention Program........................... 211,861,000 Children, Youth, Women, and Families................. 79,114,000 AIDS Dental Services................................. 13,826,000 Education and Training Centers....................... 35,413,000 Special Projects of National Significance............ 28,000,000 Ending the HIV Epidemic Initiative................... 250,000,000 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) Initiative.--The Committee includes $250,000,000 within the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program for the EHE Initiative, an increase of $125,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level.

HEALTH SYSTEMS Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $96,009,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 94,009,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 99,009,000 Change from enacted level......................... +3,000,000 Change from budget request........................ +5,000,000 The Health Systems Bureau supports national activities that enhance health care delivery in the U.S., including maintaining a national system to allocate and distribute donor organs to individuals awaiting transplant; building an inventory of cord blood units; and maintaining a national system for the recruitment of bone marrow donors. Organ Transplantation The Committee includes $31,049,000 for the Organ Transplantation program, $1,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and $2,000,000 above the fiscal year 2023 budget request. Maximizing Deceased Donor Organ Recovery, Acceptance, and Utilization.--The Committee supports regulatory and enforcement efforts to minimize excessive and frivolous expenses reimbursed to Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs) and the Organ Procurement Transplantation Network (OPTN) by Medicare, including as related to organ acquisition costs and the waitlisting of patients, and to ensure all potential conflicts of interest of OPO and OPTN executive and board leadership are publicly disclosed. The Committee encourages HHS to make all efforts to promote competition for the Organ Procurement Transplantation Network (OPTN) contract, including the NASEM recommendation that HRSA separate the information technology functions of the OPTN contract. The Committee supports this recommendation as it will both increase the likelihood of full and open competition for all components of the OPTN contract activities and likely lead to significant improvements in the OPTN's IT functionality, which is also a goal HRSA highlights in their request for information published on April 8, 2022. Living Organ Donation Reimbursement Program.--The Committee includes $8,000,000, an increase of $1,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level, for the Living Organ Donation Reimbursement Program. The Committee supports significant expansion of income eligibility for the program to allow as many donors as possible to qualify and to ensure that financial reimbursement and monetary exchange take place outside of the organ donor-organ recipient relationship to the greatest extent possible. Reducing Organ Discards.--The Committee expresses its support for the procurement and transplantation of moderate-to- high Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI) kidneys at risk of discard to alleviate the organ shortage. The Committee requests a report within 180 days of enactment of this Act regarding the OPTN proposal to remove donor service areas from allocation and the impact of this policy on organ discards. National Cord Blood Inventory (NCBI) The Committee includes $19,266,000 for the NCBI, an increase of $1,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 level. The NCBI program supports cord blood banks to build a genetically and ethnically diverse inventory of the highest quality cord blood units for transplantation. To further strengthen communication and collaboration between HRSA and cord blood banks, the Committee directs HRSA to host quarterly stakeholder calls open to all cord blood banks contracting with NCBI. These calls should serve as a forum for the agency to solicit feedback from the cord blood banks and ensure that the program is implemented in accordance with Congressional intent. Such feedback should be incorporated into contracts between the agency and the cord blood banks to increase the programs reach and achieve program goals. C.W. Bill Young Cell Transplantation The Committee includes $33,009,000 for the C.W. Bill Young Cell Transplantation program, an increase of $1,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 level. This program supports coordinating the procurement of bone marrow and umbilical cord blood units for transplantation. The Committee continues to support cell transplantation using bone marrow, peripheral blood stem cells, and cord blood. The Committee appreciates HRSA's efforts to increase the diversity of the volunteer registry and supports efforts to significantly reduce barriers to transplant for patients. This includes increasing targeted donor recruitment efforts, intervening with community referring physicians upon patient diagnosis to accelerate the path to transplant, and propelling innovation to improve outcomes and establish new treatment options to ensure a matched donor for all searching patients, regardless of their racial/ethnic background, socioeconomic status, age, ancestry, or any other individually defining characteristic. The highest priority should be given to providing immediate and free testing of patients' cellular markers to quickly determine if a there is an available matched a donor. Eliminating these barriers would allow therapies for patients to be delivered on time and to provide equal and successful outcomes for all. Hansen's Disease Program The Committee includes $13,706,000 for the Hansen's Disease Program, $122,000 for Hansen's Disease Buildings and Facilities, and $1,857,000 for Payments to Hawaii for Treatment of Hansen's Disease. These funding levels are the same as the fiscal year 2022 enacted levels and the amounts requested in the fiscal year 2023 budget request. The programs support inpatient, outpatient, long-term care, as well as training and research in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; 11 outpatient clinic sites in the continental U.S. and Puerto Rico; facility-related expenses for the buildings of the Gillis W. Long Hansen's Disease Center; and medical care and treatment of persons with Hansen's disease in hospital and clinic facilities at Kalaupapa, Molokai, and Honolulu, Hawaii. RURAL HEALTH Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $331,062,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 373,709,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 375,675,000 Change from enacted level......................... +44,613,000 Change from budget request........................ +1,966,000 The Federal Office of Rural Health Policy's programs provide funding to improve access, quality, and coordination of care in rural communities; for research on rural health issues; for technical assistance and recruitment of health care providers; for screening activities for individuals affected by the mining, transport, and processing of uranium; and for the outreach and treatment of coal miners and others with occupation-related respiratory and pulmonary impairments.

Rural Maternity and Obstetrics Management Strategies (RMOMS).--The Committee recommendation includes no less than $8,000,000 for RMOMS, an increase of $2,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. RMOMS supports grants to improve access to and continuity of maternal and obstetrics care in rural communities by increasing the delivery of and access to preconception, pregnancy, labor and delivery, and postpartum services, as well as developing sustainable financing models for the provision of maternal and obstetrics care. Rural Health Research and Policy Development The Committee includes $11,076,000 for Rural Health Research and Policy Development, the same as the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the fiscal year 2023 budget request. Funding supports the Federal Office of Rural Health Policy's activities to analyze, advise the Secretary, and provide information to the public regarding issues that affect the availability, access to, and quality of health care in rural areas. Rural Health Research Centers.--In the next competition for Rural Health Research Centers, the Committee strongly encourages the Federal Office of Rural Health Policy to prioritize States that have not previously hosted such a center. The Committee supports centers in areas that have a demonstrated collaborative partnership with research and education in the pharmacological and physician space. Further, the Committee strongly encourages the Office to explore establishing a center which encompasses research related to biomedical and cancer research, opioid abuse, delivery of rural healthcare, and training for rurally focused residency programs. Rural Health Flexibility Grants The Committee includes $68,500,000 for Rural Health Flexibility Grants, $6,223,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and $10,991,000 above the fiscal year 2023 budget request.

HRSA supports the establishment and operation of State offices of rural health to strengthen rural health care delivery system. Black Lung Clinics The Committee includes $12,190,000 for Black Lung Clinics, an increase of $345,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2023 budget request. This program funds clinics that treat respiratory and pulmonary diseases of active and retired coal miners, steel mill workers, agricultural workers, and others with occupationally-related respiratory and pulmonary impairments. Radiation Exposure Screening and Education Program (RESEP) The Committee includes $2,734,000 for the RESEP program, an increase of $845,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2023 budget request. This program provides grants for the education, prevention, and early detection of radiogenic cancers and diseases resulting from exposure to uranium during mining and milling at nuclear test sites. Rural Health Residency Program The Committee includes $12,700,000 for the Rural Health Residency Program, an increase of $2,200,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2023 budget request. This program funds physician residency training programs that support physician workforce expansion in rural areas. The Committee commends the Federal Office of Rural Health Policy for their efforts to expand the physician workforce in rural areas and supports continuation and expansion of the program to develop new rural residency programs, or Rural Training Programs. Rural Communities Overdose Response Program (RCORP) The Committee includes $160,000,000, an increase of $25,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level, for the RCORP program, and allows for the expanded focus on behavioral health care, including SUD, needs in rural communities. The Committee is particularly interested in programs that address health equity and reach rural populations that have historically suffered poorer behavioral health outcomes relative to their counterparts. Within the funding provided, the agreement includes $10,000,000 to continue the Rural Centers of Excellence (COE) program in order to collaboratively identify, implement, and evaluate innovative SUD and broader behavioral health approaches to build the evidence-base for effective prevention, treatment, and recovery programs in rural communities across the U.S.; and through the addition of a fourth coordinating COE, track, synthesize, and disseminate national and State-level SUD policies and research, including any effective interventions and outcomes identified. Rural Health Clinic Behavioral Health Initiative The Committee includes $5,000,000 to support expanded access to behavioral health services at rural health clinics, as described in the fiscal year 2023 budget request. FAMILY PLANNING Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $286,479,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 400,000,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 500,000,000 Change from enacted level......................... +213,521,000 Change from budget request........................ +100,000,000 The Family Planning program administers Title X of the PHS Act. This program supports preventive and primary health care services at health centers nationwide by increasing access to affordable contraceptive education, services, and supplies; STD prevention, screening, and treatment; cervical and breast cancer screenings; first-line infertility services; and other community and health care services. The Title X program is a vital component of the health care safety net and is essential to addressing health inequities. The Committee directs the Secretary to ensure that grantees certify that they: (1) provide medically accurate and complete counseling, including referral as requested, on all matters; (2) shall not condition the receipt of Title X-supported services on patients remaining sexually abstinent until marriage; and (3) will not make any appointments or referrals for patients that are contrary to the patient's wishes. The bill requires that all recipients of funds under this heading offer services consistent with the best available evidence- based standards, including the Quality Family Planning guidelines from the CDC and the Office of Population Affairs (OPA). Recommendations for Quality Family Planning Services.--The Committee directs the Secretary to continue the process of revising ``Providing Quality Family Planning Services,'' evidence-based recommendations that were last updated in 2017, and to ensure the robust participation of both the CDC's Division of Reproductive Health and OPA in this effort. Revisions should incorporate new evidence and support comprehensive reproductive and sexual health needs of all people. The Committee requests a briefing on the status of this process no later than 180 days of enactment of this Act. Estimated Need for Services.--The Committee requests the Secretary conduct a study, within 270 days of enactment of this Act, determining the current estimated need for Title X services, updating the 2016 study published in the American Journal of Public Health. The Committee requests that, as in the previous work, the CDC's Division of Reproductive Health and OPA collaborate on this effort. HRSA-Wide Activities and Program Support Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $1,259,484,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 230,709,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 934,857,000 Change from enacted level......................... -324,627,000 Change from budget request........................ +704,148,000 This account supports telehealth programs, operation of the 340B drug pricing program, community projects, and the cost of Federal staff and related activities to coordinate, direct, and manage the programs of HRSA. HRSA Chief Dental Officer.--The Committee is disturbed to learn that despite its directive to have HRSA ensure that the Chief Dental Officer (CDO) is functioning at an executive level with resources and staff to lead oral health programs and initiatives across HRSA, no such authority has been delegated. The Committee urges HRSA to hire a CDO and restore the position with executive level authority and resources to oversee and lead dental programs and initiatives across the agency. The CDO is also expected to serve as the agency representative on oral health issues to international, national, State, and/or local government agencies, universities, and oral health stakeholder organizations. The Committee requests an update as part of the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Justification on how the CDO is serving as the agency representative with executive level authority on oral health issues to international, national, State and/or local government agencies, universities, and oral health stakeholder organizations. Oral Health Literacy.--The Committee includes $300,000 to continue the development of an oral health awareness and education campaign across relevant HRSA divisions, including the Health Centers Program, Oral Health Workforce, Maternal and Child Health, Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program, and Rural Health. The Committee directs HRSA to identify oral health literacy strategies that are evidence-based and focused on oral health care prevention and education, including prevention of oral disease such as early childhood and other caries, periodontal disease, and oral cancer. The Committee encourages HRSA to ensure that the Chief Dental Officer plays a key role in the design, monitoring, oversight, and implementation of this project. Targeted Investments in Impoverished Areas.--The Committee supports targeted investments in impoverished areas, particularly in persistent poverty counties and in other high- poverty census tracts. For purposes of this Act, the term ``high-poverty area'' means any census tract with a poverty rate of at least 20 percent as measured by the 2016-2020 5-year data series available from the American Community Survey of the Census Bureau and the term ``persistent poverty counties'' means any county that has had 20 percent or more of its population living in poverty over the past 30 years, as measured by the 1993 Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates, the 2000 decennial census, and the most recent Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates, or any territory or possession of the U.S. The Committee directs HRSA to develop and implement measures to increase the share of investments in high-poverty census tracts with a poverty rate of at least 20 percent as measured by the 2016-2020 5-year data series available from the American Community Survey of the Census Bureau, and any other impoverished areas the Department determines to be appropriate areas to target. The Committee directs HRSA to submit a report to the Committee within 180 days of enactment of this Act that includes the amount of funds that were targeted to such areas; the percent change from fiscal year 2022 in the amount of funds that were targeted toward such areas; and, to the extent practicable, an assessment of the economic impact of the program on the areas, including data on the categories of individuals impacted by the targeting of funds to such areas under the program, disaggregated by household income, race, gender, age, national origin, disability status, and whether the individuals live in an urban area, suburban area, or rural area. Office of Pharmacy Affairs (OPA) The Committee includes $13,238,000 for OPA, $2,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. OPA administers the 340B drug pricing program, which was designed to help safety net providers maintain, improve, and expand patient access to health care services. The 340B program has lowered the cost of outpatient drugs to health clinics and nonprofit and public hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income and rural patients. These entities provide additional services and benefits to their communities with the savings realized. The Committee recognizes that the 340B program is a critical lifeline to safety net providers, including FQHCs, FQHC Look-Alikes, children's hospitals, Ryan White HIV/AIDS clinics, and other safety-net hospitals and providers. These covered entities are model stewards of the program and reinvest 340B savings to reach more patients and provide more comprehensive services. The Committee is concerned by the fact that the number of pharmaceutical manufacturers that are violating the 340B statute has dramatically increased, threatening the ability of safety-net providers to care for patients in need. The Committee is pleased that HRSA has continued to take steps to enforce the statute and take action against companies that curtail the use of 340B drugs in contract pharmacies, refer violations of the statute by manufacturers to the HHS Office of Inspector General, and appeal litigation in these matters. The Committee encourages HRSA to continue to use its authority and any available measures, including the imposition of civil penalties, where appropriate, to hold those drug manufacturers in violation of the law directly accountable. The Committee urges HRSA to continue to take actions to safeguard covered entities' lawful access to discounted drugs. Telehealth The Committee includes $37,050,000 for Telehealth, an increase of $2,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. Funds support the Office for the Advancement of Telehealth, which promotes the effective use of technologies to improve access to health services for people who are isolated from health care and to provide distance education for health professionals. Provider Bridge.--The Committee includes $500,000 within the total for Telehealth for the Provider Bridge program. With funds appropriated in the Coronavirus License Portability Grant Program, HRSA established the Provider Bridge Program to empower medical professionals to safely and efficiently deliver urgently-needed care to communities during public health emergencies. To date, over 400 entities and 85,000 healthcare professionals have leveraged this national tool connecting health care professionals with State agencies and health care entities to quickly verify credentials and professional background information. Specifically, the platform provides a directory of State and Federal COVID-19 resources, allows health care professionals to submit professional background information, produces official and verified digital documents of licensure and credentialing information, and provides access to a database of information for volunteer clinicians willing to provide care. Telehealth Centers of Excellence.--The Committee supports the continued development of Telehealth Centers of Excellence to continue to validate technologies and reimbursement mechanisms, establish training protocols, and develop comprehensive templates for States to integrate telehealth into their state health provider networks. Rural Telehealth Initiative.--The Committee supports the Memorandum of Understanding entered into on August 31, 2020, establishing a Rural Telehealth Initiative among HHS, the Federal Communications Commission, and the Department of Agriculture. Together, this important initiative can leverage expertise of each respective agency and improve collaboration amongst entities tasked with addressing rural telehealth access. This initiative recognizes the unique problems facing rural Americans that need access to critical care services through telehealth platforms. The Committee encourages agencies involved in this initiative to prioritize opportunities to continue the expansion of telehealth services, close the digital divide, and not leave rural communities behind. Community Project Funding Within the funds included in this account, $726,569,000 shall be used for the projects, and in the amounts, specified in the table titled ``Labor, HHS, Education Incorporation of Community Project Funding Items'' at the end of this report. The Committee includes $6,000,000 within this total for agency administrative expenses. VACCINE INJURY COMPENSATION PROGRAM Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $13,200,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 26,200,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 15,200,000 Change from enacted level......................... +2,000,000 Change from budget request........................ -11,000,000 The Committee includes $15,200,000 for administrative costs associated with the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, an increase of $2,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. This program provides compensation for individuals with vaccine-associated injuries or deaths. COVID-19 Vaccine Liability.--The FDA has approved one COVID-19 vaccine for children 5 and older and granted emergency use authorization for a second COVID-19 vaccine for children 12 and older. The ACIP recommends that every eligible person receive the COVID-19 vaccine, including children aged 5 and older. Under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA), this recommendation requires the Secretary to add the COVID-19 vaccine to the VICP within two years. As the public anticipates the transition of COVID-19 vaccine injury compensation claims from the Countermeasure Injury Compensation Program (CICP) to the VICP, the Committee requests a report within 60 days of enactment of this Act regarding HHS's transition plan for COVID-19 vaccine injury compensation claims. This report should include a specific timeline for the rulemaking process to add COVID-19 vaccines to the Vaccine Injury Table, as well as a plan for how pending claims already filed with the Countermeasure Injury Compensation program will be handled. The plan should also include any anticipated resources needed to facilitate this transition and quickly process pending claims as well as how HHS will inform current and potential petitioners of their options. COVERED COUNTERMEASURES PROCESS FUND Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $5,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 15,000,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 7,000,000 Change from enacted level......................... +2,000,000 Change from budget request........................ -8,000,000 The Committee includes $7,000,000 for administrative costs associated with the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP), an increase of $2,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. The CICP provides benefits to individuals who are seriously injured as a result of a vaccination, medication, device, or other item recommended to diagnose, prevent or treat a declared pandemic, epidemic or security threat. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $8,457,204,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 10,730,159,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 10,499,354,000 Change from enacted level......................... +2,042,150,000 Change from budget request........................ -230,805,000 The Committee recommendation for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) program level includes $9,540,696,000 in discretionary budget authority, $55,358,000 in mandatory funds under the terms of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act, and $903,300,000 in transfers from the Prevention and Public Health (PPH) Fund. CDC's mission is to protect America from health, safety, and security threats, which it accomplishes by supporting core public health functions at State, local, and tribal health departments, detecting and responding to new and emerging health threats, promoting health and safety, and providing leadership in the public health workforce. IMMUNIZATION AND RESPIRATORY DISEASES Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $868,155,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 1,250,930,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 1,083,155,000 Change from enacted level......................... +215,000,000 Change from budget request........................ -167,775,000 The Committee recommendation includes $663,805,000 in discretionary budget authority and $419,350,000 in transfers from the PPH Fund. Immunization cooperative agreements are awarded to State and local public health departments for planning, developing, and conducting childhood, adolescent, and adult immunization programs, including enhancement of the vaccine delivery infrastructure. CDC directly maintains a stockpile of vaccines, supports consolidated purchase of vaccines for State and local health agencies, and conducts surveillance, investigations, and research into the safety and efficacy of new and presently used vaccines. Within the total for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, the Committee recommends the following amounts: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ FY 2023 Budget Activity Committee ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Immunization Program................................. Flaccid Myelitis............................... 6,000,000 Influenza Planning and Response...................... 251,358,000 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Cost Estimates.--The Committee urges that the report on estimated funding needs of the Section 317 Immunization Program be updated and submitted not later than February 1, 2023. The updated report should include an estimate of optimum State and local operations funding, as well as a discussion of the role of the 317 Program, as coverage for vaccination under public and private resources continues to evolve. It should also include specific information on the estimated cost to fully address evidence-based public health strategies that could be funded through CDC to improve coverage for human papillomavirus (HPV) and influenza. Immunization Program.--The Committee includes an increase of $175,000,000 to enhance immunization efforts, including increasing awardee base awards with a focus on expanding and sustaining critical immunization program infrastructure. Immunization Rates.--The Committee is concerned about the marked decline in routine vaccines as a result of the pandemic. The Committee encourages CDC to continue surveillance and laboratory efforts, and to promote HPV vaccination in support of the Administration's Cancer Moonshot Initiative. In addition, the Committee requests information in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification on how the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) can support both routine and emergency reviews in real time to ensure timely access to immunizations. Furthermore, the Committee recognizes that office-based physicians are trusted sources of health care information and delivery, and encourages CDC to consider their role in vaccination efforts. Improving Immunization Information System Infrastructure and Data.--The Committee encourages CDC to engage with States and local jurisdictions to assess gaps and greatest areas of need to work toward all Immunization Information Systems (IIS) adopting and adhering to national standards to support the capture of data for all vaccinations administered across the life course, and have secure bi-directional information sharing capabilities both inter- and intra-State and with other IIS, health information exchanges, health data systems and entities, including data repositories to achieve interoperability levels needed to capture reliable, complete, real-time vaccine administration data.

NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE (NCI) Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $6,912,522,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 6,713,851,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 7,378,579,000 Change from enacted level......................... +466,057,000 Change from budget request........................ +664,728,000 The Committee recommendation includes $7,162,579,000 in discretionary appropriations and $216,000,000 made available in the Cures Act. Mission.--NCI leads, conducts, and supports cancer research across the Nation to advance scientific knowledge and help all people live longer, healthier lives. Brain Cancer.--The Committee recognizes that certain types of brain cancers are associated with high mortality and morbidity rates. Brain and other nervous system cancers have a five-year survival rate of 33 percent. Certain brain tumors that occur in humans also occur spontaneously and naturally in dogs. These brain cancers in dogs share many of the same molecular underpinnings of their human counterparts. There is great potential for developing treatments for brain cancers that will benefit dogs and humans and provide an intermediate step to evaluate human treatments in a more meaningful and related species. The Committee encourages NIH to continue to support research that brings together researchers and clinicians from pediatrics, adult oncology, veterinary medicine, and biomedical engineering to leverage the linkage between brain cancers in dogs and humans to evaluate and develop treatments and safe delivery systems to benefit both species. Cancer Immunotherapy and Correlative Research.-- Understanding the complex factors that determine whether a particular cancer immunotherapy will succeed for a given patient is a vital area of research. Central to this research is the analysis of blood, tumor, and other tissues in conjunction with the outcome of clinical trials (known as correlative studies), which can help explain why a treatment worked or not, and why it did or did not produce serious side effects, as well as providing critical insights to help optimize subsequent trials. For example, by evaluating peripheral blood and tumor biopsies obtained from patients prior to and during treatment, researchers can better understand the factors that influence successful anti-tumor immune response and the development of treatment resistance. In general, correlative studies are most useful when conducted in a timely manner as an integrated part of clinical trials. The Committee urges NCI to continue to explore approaches to support and streamline the incorporation of correlative studies in immunotherapy trials and commends NCI for the establishment of the Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Centers (CIMACS) and the Cancer Immunologic Data Commons (CIDC) as part of the Cancer Moonshot. This network carries out comprehensive molecular analysis of clinical trial specimens for biomarkers and pathways associated with response to immunotherapy and conducts correlative studies and profiling of tumors and immune cells for NCI-funded early trials of immunotherapy. The Committee encourages NCI to continue funding for correlative studies through existing funded networks. Cancer Moonshot.--The Committee directs NIH to transfer $216,000,000 from the NIH Innovation Account to NCI to support the Cancer Moonshot initiative. These funds were authorized in the Cures Act. The Committee also encourages NCI to leverage Cancer Moonshot efforts to continue supporting research aimed at addressing health disparities and expanding the scientific understanding of the genetic and molecular drivers of cancer, including for diseases with significant differences in outcomes between White and non-White patients, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML). According to research using data from NCI's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, there is a wide disparity and higher mortality rate among African American patients compared to White patients with AML. The Committee encourages NCI to continue intramural and extramural research efforts to identify the underlying causes of health disparities associated with AML, including hereditary blood cancers. Cancer Survivorship.--As of January 2019, there were an estimated 16.9 million cancer survivors in the U.S. and the number of cancer survivors is projected to increase to 22.2 million by 2030. The Committee encourages NCI to continue to address the unique needs of cancer survivors with resources to support cancer survivors whether through additional research on essential elements of survivorship care, leveraging Federal resources, or improving coordination among providers. An investment in quality of life after a diagnosis is a critical component of our Nation's fight against the disease. Cancer Vaccines.--The Committee recognizes that the success of the COVID 19 vaccines--which became available less than a year from the outset of the pandemic and now deliver up to 95 percent protection rates--is because these vaccines were built on messenger RNA technology, or mRNA, an approach that had been initiated for cancer research. The Committee understands that with further research, mRNA cancer vaccines could potentially be among the most cost-effective methods of preventing recurrences and the high costs of cancer care. In addition, the fiscal year 2023 budget request explicitly acknowledged that a potential area of transformative research within NIH is the preparation of mRNA vaccines against common forms of cancer. The Committee encourages NIH to continue to support research efforts that move the field forward for mRNA vaccines in cancer. Areas of particular scientific opportunity include focus on enhancing immune recognition of solid tumors, overcoming suppression in the tumor microenvironment, and personalization of mRNA vaccines. Together, these strategies have high potential for increasing the effectiveness for cancer immunotherapy treatment and prevention. Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI).--The Committee includes no less than $50,000,000 for the CCDI, the same as the fiscal year 2022 level. Within this total, the Committee includes no less than $750,000 to continue to support enhancement of the CCDI Molecular Characterization Initiative and other efforts as applicable through continued expansion to focus on ultra-rare tumor types, such as atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (ATRT), and other ultra-rare pediatric tumor types with limited therapeutic options. The effort should include comprehensive clinical and molecular data for each patient to the extent possible. The dataset should include clinical, radiographic, histopathologic, and molecular information to the extent possible and be stored in a manner that allows for interrogation of patient level data. The data collected will be used to identify risk factors, aid in prognostication and treatment recommendations, and assist with the development of novel therapeutics for these diseases. Childhood Cancer STAR Act.--The Committee includes no less than $30,000,000, the same as the fiscal year 2022 enacted level, for continued implementation of sections of the Childhood Cancer Survivorship, Treatment, Access, and Research (STAR) Act to expand existing biorepositories for childhood cancer patients enrolled in NCI-sponsored clinical trials to collect and maintain relevant clinical, biological, and demographic information on children, adolescents, and young adults, with an emphasis on selected cancer subtypes (and their recurrences) for which current treatments are least effective, and to continue to conduct and support childhood and adolescent survivorship research. This amount also includes the $2,000,000 provided for the CDC's ongoing efforts to enhance cancer registry case capture efforts for childhood and adolescent cancers. Clinical Trials Reporting of Data.--The Committee recognizes that children have often been historically underrepresented in clinical trials. However, children with cancer participate in clinical trials at a high rate, thanks in large part to NCI support for clinical trials through the Children's Oncology Group, the Pediatric Early Phase Clinical Trials Network, the Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium, and NCI's Pediatric Oncology Branch at the NIH Clinical Center. The Committee encourages NCI to continue to make information available to the public regarding adult trials that allow enrollment of patients under age 18. Colorectal Cancer.--The Committee recognizes that colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death for men and women in the U.S. While colorectal cancer incidence rates in individuals over 50 have largely stabilized or declined due to significant advancements in preventive screening, incidence rates for early-onset colorectal cancer (individuals diagnosed at ages 20 to 49) have been consistently increasing. Three out of four early-onset colorectal cancer patients have no family history of the disease and over 60 percent of early-onset colorectal cancer patients are diagnosed at a late stage. There are several racial/ethnic disparities in colorectal cancer screening and outcomes. Black individuals have the highest incidence and mortality and face lower survival than White individuals. American Indians/Alaskan Natives also have elevated rates and deaths compared to the general population and represent the only racial/ethnic group for whom colorectal cancer mortality rates are not declining. Racial and ethnic minorities are also more likely than White individuals to present with late-stage, incurable disease. Notably, the sharpest increase in metastatic, early-onset colorectal cancer is among people 20 to 39 years old, especially Black and Hispanic individuals. Mortality rates across all ages for late-stage colorectal cancer have remained stagnant due to minimal progress in treatments for colorectal cancer patients. Given these challenges, the Committee urges NCI to prioritize research on colorectal cancer. The Committee directs NCI to submit a plan to the Committee within 180 days of enactment of this Act guided by a multidisciplinary and multi- agency advisory council to include diverse representatives from the colorectal cancer community, including colorectal cancer patients, patient organizations, industry, academic researchers, and community-based providers, to include all relevant health care agencies. Specifically, this plan should identify research priorities, gaps, and opportunities, and include detailed sections focused on the following non- exhaustive list of topics: the lack of progress in the development of effective therapeutics for colorectal cancer, the rising rates of colorectal cancer in people under the age of 50, with a special focus on the rapidly increasing rates of early onset colorectal cancer in the 20 to 39 year old age range; and the persistent health disparities in colorectal cancer prevalence, screening, and outcomes. The plan should describe how NCI plans to play a role in addressing these challenges and what existing and future innovative grant mechanisms can be leveraged to advance progress. Deadliest Cancers.--The Recalcitrant Cancer Research Act (RCRA) of 2012 focuses on cancers with a five-year survival rate below 50 percent, which account for 44 percent of all U.S. cancer deaths. In House Report 117-96, the Committee directed NCI to develop a scientific framework using the process outlined in the RCRA for gastric and esophageal cancers. The Committee also notes that NCI has taken an important step by receiving approval for a Program in Origins of Gastroesophageal Cancers from the National Cancer Advisory Board and Board of Scientific Advisors. Given the toll all recalcitrant cancers exact on society and the lack of diagnostic and treatment resources currently available to help patients, the Committee encourages NCI to continue to invest in the most promising research opportunities to advance progress against each of the deadliest cancers (gastric, esophageal, and GE junction; liver, including cholangiocarcinoma; lung, including mesothelioma; ovary; pancreas; and brain, including adult and pediatric brain tumors), and to provide an update on research focused on each of these areas in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Justification. Endometrial Cancer.--The Committee remains concerned about the significant racial and ethnic disparities in mortality rates for endometrial cancer that adversely impact Black women. The age-adjusted mortality rate for Black women with endometrial cancer is nearly twice the rate of White women, which is partly attributed to cancer stage at diagnosis. The Committee commends NCI's efforts to address these disparities through projects like the Discovery and Evaluation of Testing for Endometrial Cancer in Tampons (DETECT) Study, and encourages NCI to continue supporting research activities that will lead to the development of targeted interventions to improve early diagnosis among Black women with endometrial cancer. The Committee also encourages NCI to research innovative community-based outreach methods to improve access to high-quality care, with the goal of increasing enrollment and participation by Black women in clinical trials. The Committee requests an update on NCI's activities regarding endometrial cancer in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Justification, including progress made in endometrial cancer early diagnosis, survival rates, and clinical trial enrollment by race and ethnicity. Environmental Exposures and Cancer in Firefighters.--The Committee is aware that firefighters have increased rates of cancer diagnoses and death relative to the general population. Firefighters are exposed to a complex mix of known and possible cancer-causing chemicals through breathing hazardous substances and absorbing them through their skin. Despite an understanding of the risks associated with firefighter environmental exposures, there has been no large-scale, systematic examination of the mechanisms by which the environmental exposures experienced by these frontline responders can cause cancer. The Committee recognizes the work NIH and CDC/NIOSH have performed to better understand the cancer risks firefighters may experience and encourages these agencies to continue conducting this research, including efforts measuring environmental exposures in firefighters and determining the mechanisms by which these exposures lead to increased cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality. The Committee also encourages NIH to continue to support research to improve health equity among firefighters, including through inclusion of participants across race, ethnicity, gender, and workplace environment groups to evaluate potential differences in exposures and risk. Glioblastoma (GBM).--Glioblastoma is a cancer with less than a five percent five-year relative survival rate, and the average survival time from diagnosis has improved by only six months over the last 30 years. To date, there have only been five drugs and one medical device approved by the FDA for the treatment of GBM. With prior Congressional investment in NCI programs, glioblastomas have been molecularly characterized, resulting in a new and promising understanding of these tumors, including the identification of potential clinical strategies and agents, trial designs, and imaging and pathology technologies. The Committee commends NCI for its establishment and initial implementation of the GBM Therapeutics Network (GTN). The GTN's cross-cutting teams' capabilities to conduct pre- clinical studies and early-phase clinical trials enables the careful evaluation of potential treatments, including small molecule drugs, immunotherapies, radiation, and devices. The overall goal of the GTN is advancing progress towards future cures and improved quality of life for GBM patients. Given this initial progress, the Committee urges NCI to continue to enhance and accelerate its implementation of the GTN and continue to fund to the full extent necessary so that this program can rapidly launch clinical trials that speed access to promising qualified treatments to patients consistent with NCI's Glioblastoma Working Group recommendations in 2019. Gynecologic Cancers.--The Committee continues to be concerned about the growing racial, socioeconomic, and geographic disparities in gynecologic cancers. In contrast to most other common cancers in the U.S., relative survival for women with newly diagnosed advanced cervical or endometrial cancer has not significantly improved since the 1970s. Furthermore, historical data demonstrates that Black and Latina women with gynecologic cancers are not as likely to receive standard therapy and/or die more frequently. The current COVID- 19 pandemic has only exacerbated the health care disparities that were already present in minority and underrepresented communities. For example, in early 2021, CDC published findings that cervical cancer screenings among women aged 21-29 in California decreased by as much as 78 percent during the pandemic. This is concerning because cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates are disproportionately higher in Hispanic women and non-Hispanic Black women. The Committee urges NCI to expand the number of clinical trials, research grants, and contract opportunities for investigators that focus on discoveries that will positively impact access to prevention, early detection, diagnosis, and treatment for gynecologic cancers and address these now well- documented disparities. The Committee requests an update on NCI's research program for gynecologic cancers in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Justification, including specific grants and strategies where the intent is to overcome these racial disparities in gynecologic cancers outcomes and opportunities to increase participation of minority women in gynecologic cancer clinical trials. Health Disparities Research.--The Committee commends NCI for supporting research related to cancer health disparities, including studies on the molecular basis for disparities that could lead to improved screening and treatment strategies, as well as best practices for increasing participation of underrepresented populations in NCI-supported clinical trials. The Committee includes an increase of $10,000,000 for NCI to support research related to identifying and reducing health disparities as described in the fiscal year 2023 budget request. HPV Associated Cancers.--The Committee encourages NCI to expand research related to human papillomavirus (HPV) and HPV- associated cancers. Improve Native American Cancer Outcomes.--The Committee continues to be concerned that Native Americans experience overall cancer incidence and mortality rates that are strikingly higher than non-Native populations and encourages NCI to expand research efforts to reduce American Indian cancer disparities and improve outcomes. The Committee notes NCI's successful efforts through the Cancer Moonshot's Accelerating Colorectal Cancer Screening and Follow-Up through Implementation Science (ACCSIS) program, and parallel efforts by NCI Designated Cancer Centers collaborating with American Indian communities, that are improving colorectal cancer screening, follow-up, and referral for care among populations that have low colorectal cancer screening rates. The Committee encourages NCI to continue efforts such as the ACCSIS initiative to develop durable capacity for tribally-engaged cancer disparities research through an integrated program of research, education, outreach, and clinical access. Liver Cancer.--The Committee notes that liver cancer is the second most common cause of cancer worldwide, with cases in the U.S. increasing over 250 percent since 2000. The incidence of liver cancer is three times higher in men than women, and the burden is higher in African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians. The incidence of liver cancer geographically parallels the prevalence of viral hepatitis, with hepatis B estimated to cause up to 60 percent of the cases of liver cancer. For these reasons, the Committee applauds NCI for its collaboration in the effort to update the Strategic Plan for Trans-NIH Research to Cure Hepatitis B. The Committee also is supportive of the NCI intramural Liver Cancer Program, the Hepatobiliary and Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) SPOREs, the new Diversity SPORE, the Translational Liver Cancer Network, the Hepatocellular Carcinoma Epidemiology Consortium, the large Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) of liver cancer and the need to expand the GWAS study to include a focus on Hispanic and African Descent populations. The Committee also urges NCI to continue its support of the Translational Liver Cancer Consortium, which supports research focused on early detection, and to support research to explore the usefulness of current and new interventions in reducing HBV associated HCC and whether early treatment with direct action antivirals or other strategies can reduce cancer risk. Lung Cancer.--The recent decline in cancer mortality fueled by progress in lung cancer is directly attributable to NIH- funded research to inform development of new effective therapeutics and to continue progress in tobacco prevention and cessation. Ongoing understanding of the molecular underpinnings of lung cancer and identification of additional oncogene driver subsets has led to rapid development of new targeted therapies, which, together with efforts to broaden uptake of comprehensive biomarker testing, has the potential to deliver the promise of precision medicine to more patients than ever before. The Committee encourages NIH and its Office of Disease Prevention to continue to fund important research across each of these areas to broaden the base of lung cancer survivors across different disease types, including small cell lung cancer. Lung Cancer Disparities.--The Committee is concerned that lung cancer disproportionally impacts communities of color. The Committee commends NCI for its role in supporting research that established low-dose computed tomography as an effective lung cancer screening approach and for the Institute's continued research in this area, which has directly informed updates to the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) lung cancer screening guidelines. In 2021, USPSTF expanded the recommended age range for screening to 50 to 80 years (previously 55 to 80 years) and reduced the pack-year history to 20 pack-years of smoking (previously 30 pack-years). By expanding who is eligible for screening, the changes to this recommendation are particularly relevant to Black people and to women. Data shows that both groups tend to smoke fewer cigarettes than White men. Data also shows that Black people have a higher risk of lung cancer than White people. These changes will mean that many more Black people and women who smoke will be eligible for this potentially life-saving screening. Unfortunately, lung cancer screening is currently underutilized. Therefore, the Committee encourages NCI to continue to support research focused on approaches to encourage broader uptake of lung cancer screening among the USPSTF recommended populations, including evaluating strategies with a focus on increasing screening uptake among communities with lung cancer death rates higher than the national average, with a goal of reducing lung cancer mortality disparities among people of color and women. Melanoma.--As UV radiation is established as the primary carcinogen for melanoma, the Committee urges NCI to continue to support research directed at genomic and mechanistic characteristics of mutagenesis; optimization of prevention strategies; and early detection and risk declassification strategies that leverage artificial intelligence, access to large databases, noninvasive technologies, and molecular markers that will support precision medicine. Although SEER data show a decline in mortality with the advent of new categories of treatment, some patients do not respond to initial treatment, and many of the responders have disease that will recur. The Committee encourages NCI to expand research on mechanisms of primary and secondary drug resistance and validation of predictive biomarkers that allow selection of optimal therapy and prediction of comprehensive longitudinal monitoring. Basic and translational goals should be facilitated through development and use of ever-improving models of human melanoma. Building on the success of adjuvant therapies, and the promising results of neoadjuvant therapies, the Committee encourages NCI to continue support of research addressing tumor cell dormancy and metastases. The Committee encourages NCI to explore opportunities for multicenter trials that will determine whether shorter courses of therapy will decrease toxicity while maintaining benefit, refine adjuvant therapies, and continue to develop neoadjuvant therapies. The Committee also encourages NCI to continue to support research on novel targets, especially for rare subtypes. The Committee requests an update on these requests and the status of NCI-funded melanoma research in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Justification. Metastatic Cancer Research.--While the early detection and treatment of early-stage disease for many cancers results in cures, for most tumors, metastatic cancer remains incurable. More than 90 percent of cancer deaths are due to metastatic disease. In addition to genetic alterations in the cancer itself, recent research has revealed that there is a genetic basis for susceptibility to metastatic cancer or resistance to metastasis. More research is required to develop a comprehensive understanding of this complex process involving tumor and host interactions. Clinical trials are an important aspect of that progress, and diverse representation of patients in clinical trials is integral to the development of medications and therapies that effectively treat metastatic disease. Ethnicity, gender, age, and genetics all play a role in the safety and efficacy of a treatment for an individual. The Committee commends NIH and the Department of Defense (DoD) for work already underway to support research needs and opportunities identified in the April 2018 Task Force Report to Congress on Metastatic Cancer. The Committee encourages NIH to maintain collaborative efforts with DoD and the Department of Veterans' Affairs (VA) to provide subject matter expertise, as appropriate, as DoD provides updates and continues to implement recommendations from the report aimed at achieving representation of the demographic of the U.S. population in clinical trials. NCI Paylines.--Grant applications to NCI have increased by approximately 50 percent since 2013, outpacing available funding, with requests for cancer research ten-fold greater than other Institutes and Centers. With such a high demand for NCI grants, only a fraction of highly meritorious research proposals can be funded. To support more awards and improve success rates, the Committee provides an increase of $200,000,000 for NCI to prioritize competing grants and to sustain commitments to continuing grants. Pediatric Cancer Research.--NCI has supported research to advance significant achievements in childhood cancer diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and quality of life improvements. Children that are diagnosed with cancer deserve a fighting chance and effective and less toxic therapies. Childhood cancers are rare, and they need specialized treatments, not just lower dose treatments that adults receive. The Committee urges NCI to continue this important work to examine novel systems to better understand rare cancers, and to support and accelerate the development of life-saving therapeutics for pediatric patients who often have no other options. Prostate Cancer.--The Committee remains concerned that prostate cancer lacks treatments for men with advanced disease as well as adequate diagnostic and imaging methodologies. To ensure Federal resources are leveraged to the greatest extent possible, the Committee encourages NCI to coordinate, when appropriate, its research efforts with other Federal agencies, including DoD, as well as private research foundations and advocacy groups. Radiopharmaceutical Development.--Recognizing the promise of radiotherapy treatments and other diagnostic uses, NCI has organized a Radiopharmaceutical Development Initiative (RDI), which is a specialized infrastructure for the clinical evaluation of novel theranostic radiopharmaceutical cancer therapies and which complements academic and industry development of these agents with early phase combination studies to test tolerability and early signs of efficacy. While clinical trials for radiopharmaceuticals are presently ongoing, domestic production of such drugs relies on a very small number of reactors, and the future loss of such reactors would not only deal a significant blow to domestic patients due to the short half-life of many of these drugs, but would also limit NCI's ability to continue to support and conduct this important research. The Committee is aware of alternative technologies to produce radionuclides by accelerators, such as the one located at Brookhaven National Laboratory; however, some radionuclides can be produced only in nuclear reactors. Therefore, the Committee requests NIH, in conjunction with the Department of Energy, to provide an update in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Justification regarding the impact shortages of medical isotopes and radiopharmaceuticals have on the ability to conduct cancer research. Rare Blood Cancers and Germline Mutations.--The Committee commends NCI for collaborating with NHGRI in running natural history studies of patients with germline mutations and their families, which frequently lead to blood cancers including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). More research on how genetic dispositions, such as RUNX1 familial platelet disorder (RUNX1- FPD), lead to rare blood cancers will ultimately support the discovery of treatments that could prevent malignancy through advances in early detection and early treatment for all blood cancers. Interest in this field has grown significantly in recent years, and the Committee strongly urges NCI to initiate new and expanded funding opportunities related to germline predispositions to rare blood cancers. The Committee is pleased to hear that NCI will soon be launching a precision medicine clinical trial for AML and myelodysplastic syndromes and requests an update in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Justification. Rare Cancer Equity.--Nearly half a million Americans are diagnosed with a rare form of cancer every year. Rare cancers could account for hundreds, if not thousands, of distinct forms of cancer. The Committee encourages NCI to continue research to better understand the molecular drivers of all cancers, including through molecular characterization and molecular diagnostics for patients. The Committee also encourages NCI to continue to support research on cancer subtypes, which could benefit rare cancers. NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE (NHLBI) Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $3,808,494,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 3,822,961,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 3,943,702,000 Change from enacted level......................... +135,208,000 Change from budget request........................ +120,741,000 Mission.--NHLBI provides global leadership for a research, training, and education program to promote the prevention and treatment of heart, lung, and blood disorders and enhance the health of all individuals so that they can live longer and more fulfilling lives. Blood Donor Questionnaire Educational Materials.--The Committee is concerned that certain FDA guidance in the educational materials provided in the blood donor questionnaire are inappropriate and misguided. The recommendations for deferral should not hinge on a person's sexual orientation, and rather should focus on risk factors that might expose a potential donor to blood-borne illness. The Committee strongly recommends that NHLBI evaluate the need for additional research studies to inform the FDA on removing or replacing the recommended deferment of blood for men who have had sex with men in the last three months. Community Engagement Alliance (CEAL) Against COVID-19 Disparities Initiative.--The Committee continues to support the CEAL initiative, which connects researchers with community organizations and leaders to conduct outreach and increase participation of people from underrepresented communities in clinical trials for COVID-19 treatments, vaccines, and ongoing COVID-19 related research needs. COVID-19-Associated Illnesses.--The Committee recognizes the growing burden of COVID-associated critical illnesses, including sepsis and pneumonia. The Committee encourages NIH to accelerate research into sepsis, pneumonia, and acute lung injury. Duchenne and Becker Muscular Dystrophy.--Now that life expectancy for Duchenne patients has increased, there is a need for more research related to clinical care and long-term cardiac impacts. Furthermore, there is a paucity of data on Becker patients to understand cardiac implications long term. The Committee urges NHLBI to work with NINDS to explore research collaborations to follow patients throughout the lifespan to fully clinically characterize cardiac muscle function and better establish the relationship between cardiac muscle function and the impact of its progressive deterioration on both lifespan and quality of life. Developing gene therapies to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a complex and multifaceted process. The Committee encourages NIH to support research aimed at gene therapy safety utilizing viral vectors and support the development of less immunogenetic non-viral delivery systems. The Committee also supports further NIH investment in the development of more sensitive outcome measures and biomarkers for both Duchenne and Becker. Harmful Algal Blooms.--The Committee strongly encourages NHLBI to support research to address the human health concerns of cyanotoxin exposure from harmful algal blooms and emergent chemicals of concern, and particularly the need for research directed on health issues relating to aerosolized exposure to water contaminated with HABS and ECC toxins. This research could take advantage of unique laboratory facilities at the Nation's national laboratories and prioritize new preventative, diagnostic, and therapeutic strategies to combat the harmful health effects of airborne HAB and ECC toxin exposure, especially in vulnerable, at-risk populations. Health Disparities Research.--The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted and exacerbated health disparities in the U.S. The Committee includes an increase of $15,000,000 for leveraging lessons learned by NHLBI to support research related to identifying and reducing health disparities. Kleine-Levin Syndrome (KLS).--The Committee commends NIH for its December 2021 publication of the Sleep Research Plan. The Committee recommends the inclusion of KLS, a complex neurological disorder characterized by long, recurring episodes of excessive sleep and derealization, as a sleep disorder requiring attention and study in the next publication of the Sleep Research Plan. The cause of KLS is still unknown, and there are no known treatments. Because KLS shares symptoms with other sleep disorders and mental health conditions, the Committee encourages NIH to expand its support for research about KLS, which could provide the KLS community and many others with critical information and answers. Long-Term Impact of COVID-19.--The Committee notes with concern that an estimated ten percent of individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 are experiencing longer term health consequences, including residual lung damage. More studies are needed to understand if such changes resolve or are permanent. The Committee urges NHLBI to prioritize research into the understanding, treatment, and prevention of post-COVID respiratory conditions, particularly among minority populations disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. Lung Health Research.--The Committee recognizes that, over the past year, lung failure was the number one cause of death in the U.S. More than one million Americans have died as a direct result from a respiratory pandemic. Even prior to emergence of SARS CoV-2, deaths from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were already the third leading cause of death in the world, and pneumonia was the leading cause of death worldwide among children under the age of five. The risks to lung health are only increasing as global air quality deteriorates from dust and particle pollution among other factors. All of these exposures drive lung inflammation and ultimately made COVID-19 more devastating as well. Furthermore, the Nation's capability to address acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been demonstrated to be deeply inadequate. The Committee supports the activities of NHLBI's lung health research program, which supports mechanisms of lung injury and repair as well as clinical intervention trials addressing both acute and chronic lung diseases. These investments will help to identify the biological pathways of lung injury to find ways to help the lung recover from injury. Mitral Valve Prolapse (MVP) Research.--The Committee encourages NHLBI to advance technological imaging and precision medicine to generate data on individuals with valvular disease, identify individuals who are at high risk of sudden cardiac death as a result of valvular heart disease, develop prediction models for high-risk patients, and enable interventions and treatment plans to keep these patients healthy throughout their lives. National Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Action Plan.--The Committee notes NHLBI's role in crafting the National COPD Action Plan and encourages NHLBI to continue this important work by supporting additional research activities and collaborating with other PHS agencies to facilitate implementation of the plan's recommendations. National Commission on Lymphatic Diseases.--The Committee requests an update on the establishment of a National Commission on Lymphatic Diseases and strongly encourages the Director to engage with relevant Institutes, Centers, and external stakeholders to demonstrate key progress within 90 days of the enactment of this Act. NIH Sleep Research Plan.--The Committee commends the National Center on Sleep Disorders Research (NCSDR) for the release of the NIH Sleep Research Plan and supports the full implementation of the Plan. The Committee specifically encourages strong consideration of the Plan's proposal for multi-center studies and clinical trials. Pulmonary Fibrosis (PF).--Many PF patients wait more than a year for diagnosis after symptom onset, and patients with some types of PF have a life expectancy of only 3-5 years. The Committee urges NHLBI to support research into biomarkers that can aid in earlier, safer diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis, as well as tools that can help predict which patients will experience disease progression. The Committee also encourages NHLBI to support the development of novel outcome measures for clinical trials in pulmonary fibrosis, such as imaging, and to continue to fund research involving early phase clinical assessment of novel drugs and personalized approaches to therapies. The Committee requests an update on PF research in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Justification. Pulmonary Hypertension.--The Committee continues to note the relationship between the long-term effects of COVID-19 and pulmonary hypertension. The Committee encourages NHLBI to increase their collaboration with key stakeholders in advancing critical research priorities. Sickle Cell Disease.--Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common inherited blood disorder in the U.S. The Committee commends NIH, including NHLBI, for past research efforts aimed at developing more effective treatments and cures, but believes more can be done. As such, the Committee encourages NIH to renew its focus and continue to prioritize efforts by supporting extramural grants for research projects that will support the development of a treatment approach for SCD, research into potential cures, and provide better outreach and education for health care providers. The Committee encourages NIH to consider programs both domestically and globally to evaluate the effectiveness of screening technologies for infants and children with the sickle cell trait and disease and to develop different innovative technologies and medicines to treat and cure SCD. The Committee also encourages NHLBI to increase its focus on disease modifying therapies that could improve day-to-day care for the vast majority of patients and address issues such as organ damage and pain management. Lastly, the Committee encourages NHLBI to fund the training of more sickle cell disease clinicians and researchers to maintain this essential workforce pipeline and to make advances on the transition from childhood medical care to adult. Support for The Heart Truth Program.--For over a decade, ``The Heart Truth'' program has worked to raise awareness about women's risk of heart disease. The program's goals are to increase awareness that heart disease is the leading cause of death among women and to increase the conversations between women and their health care providers. Accordingly, the Committee encourages NHLBI to robustly fund ``The Heart Truth'' program. Thalassemia.--Donated blood has a relatively short shelf life and is generally stored for only 42 days. However, stored blood begins to degrade before the end of that 42-day period, with possible stiffening of cell membranes as early as after 21 days. For patients in need of emergency blood transfusions, that degradation may not be significant; however, studies are needed to determine the impact of older red blood cells on patients who require chronic transfusion, such as those with thalassemia, especially in terms of iron loading in the heart and internal organs. The Committee urges NHLBI to establish research initiatives focused on this issue. Valvular Heart Disease Research.--Many people in the U.S. have heart valve defects or disease but do not have symptoms. For some, the condition remains the same throughout their lives and does not cause significant or life-threatening problems. Unfortunately, over 25,000 people die each year in the U.S. from heart valve disease, primarily due to underdiagnosis and undertreatment of the condition. The Committee strongly supports more research into valvular heart disease. Such research should focus on advances in technological imaging and precision medicine to generate data on individuals with valvular heart disease, identify individuals who are at high risk of sudden cardiac death, and develop prediction models for high-risk patients, enabling interventions and treatment plans to help keep these patients healthy throughout their lives. The Committee thanks NHLBI for hosting a workshop on this issue. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DENTAL AND CRANIOFACIAL RESEARCH (NIDCR) Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $501,231,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 513,191,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 526,051,000 Change from enacted level......................... +24,820,000 Change from budget request........................ +12,860,000 Mission.--The mission of NIDCR is to advance fundamental knowledge about dental, oral, and craniofacial (DOC) health and disease and translate these findings into prevention, early detection, and treatment strategies that improve overall health for all individuals and communities across the lifespan. Pain Management Research.--The Committee commends NIDCR for supporting research related to pain and pain management, including studies to develop safer, non-opioid pain medications and interventions. The Committee includes an increase of $9,000,000 for NIDCR to support additional research in this area as described in the fiscal year 2023 budget request. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASES (NIDDK) Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $2,203,926,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 2,206,080,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 2,283,489,000 Change from enacted level......................... +79,563,000 Change from budget request........................ +77,409,000 Mission.--The NIDDK mission is to conduct and support medical research and research training and disseminate science- based information on diabetes and other endocrine and metabolic diseases; digestive diseases, nutritional disorders, and obesity; and kidney, urologic, and hematologic diseases, to improve people's health and quality of life. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD).--The Committee urges NIDDK to continue support for kidney research. The Committee applauds recent changes to clinical practice in the diagnosis of kidney disease and concurs with recommendations for new markers for estimating kidney function. NIDDK is encouraged to prioritize research into endogenous filtration markers, activities that spur the adoption of new equations for estimating GFR that do not include race as a modifier, and interventions to eliminate racial and ethnic disparities. Finally, the Committee encourages NIDDK to continue investment in research that bridges existing deficits in CKD management and treatments to reduce incidence and progression, increases the number of CKD clinical trials and diversity of participants, improves the delivery of evidenced-base care in underrepresented populations, and improves patients' quality of life. The Committee requests an update on these priorities in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Justification. Dietary Supplements.--The Committee supports efforts by NIDDK to monitor drug-induced liver injury. Recently, more than 20 percent of cases are reported to be caused by dietary supplements. These products need to be analyzed for their label claims; it is essential to identify the component that may cause liver injury. It has been reported that more than 70 percent of products analyzed do not meet label claims, and many of them are laced with steroids and pharmaceuticals. The Committee continues to support NIDDK research into dietary supplements. Inflammatory Bowel Disease.--The CDC estimates that in 2015, three million Americans were living with IBD, and the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017 reported that IBD prevalence in the U.S. increased by nearly 24 percent between 1990 and 2017. Many patients may be undiagnosed until the disease has become severe, and despite the therapeutic options on the market, some patients remain without an effective treatment. The Committee continues to support NIH in funding basic, translational, and clinical studies on the diagnosis and treatment of IBD. Interstitial Cystitis.--The Committee notes the progress of interstitial cystitis research through the Multidisciplinary Approach to the Study of Chronic Pelvic Pain program and encourages NIDDK and stakeholders to continue collaboration on a scientific workshop to examine mechanisms for scientific opportunity. The Committee requests an update on the progress of the conference in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Justification. Pain Management Research.--The Committee commends NIDDK for supporting research related to pain and pain management, including studies to develop interventions to reduce opioid use in people on hemodialysis. The Committee includes an increase of $10,000,000 for NIDDK to support additional research in this area as described in the fiscal year 2023 budget request. Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD).--The Committee commends NIDDK for its continued commitment to PKD Research and Translation Centers and the Pediatric Centers of Excellence in Nephrology, which improve our understanding of the causes of autosomal dominant PKD and autosomal recessive PKD. The Committee continues to encourage NIDDK to fund innovative, high-impact PKD research and promote the development of new therapeutic strategies. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE (NINDS) Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $2,611,370,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 2,768,043,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 2,833,590,000 Change from enacted level......................... +222,220,000 Change from budget request........................ +65,547,000 The Committee recommendation includes $2,608,590,000 in discretionary appropriations and $225,000,000 made available in the Cures Act. Mission.--The NINDS mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).--The Committee recognizes the devastating toll that ALS takes on those affected by the disease and their loved ones. ALS causes progressive and cumulative physical disabilities in patients, and leads to death due to respiratory muscle failure. The Committee strongly urges NINDS to expand support for research on ALS, including but not limited to its causes, diagnosis, and treatment. The Committee directs NIH to provide an update on NIH-supported research related to ALS in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Justification. Brain Aneurysm Research.--The Committee remains concerned that an estimated one out of every 50 individuals in the U.S. has a brain aneurysm and an estimated 30,000 Americans suffer a brain aneurysm rupture each year, with little or no warning. Ruptured brain aneurysms are fatal in about 50 percent of cases. The Committee continues to be concerned about the lack of research focused on prevention and early detection of brain aneurysms and encourages NIH to expand its support for research in this area. BRAIN Initiative.--The Committee directs NIH to transfer $225,000,000 from the NIH Innovation Account to NINDS to support the BRAIN Initiative. These funds were authorized in the Cures Act. This collaborative effort is revolutionizing the understanding of how neural components and their dynamic interactions result in complex behaviors, cognition, and disease, while accelerating the development of transformative tools to explore the brain in unprecedented ways, making information previously beyond reach accessible. Cerebral Palsy.--The Committee encourages NIH to continue to prioritize and invest in research on cerebral palsy (CP) including the establishment of a cerebral palsy Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) to significantly strengthen and accelerate progress toward CP research priorities across the lifespan. Cerebral palsy research should focus on basic and translational discoveries, as well as implementation, observational, and clinical studies aimed at early detection and intervention, comparative effectiveness, and functional outcomes. While some progress has been made in the understanding of CP, the most common lifelong physical disability, large gaps remain that must be addressed to improve outcomes and treatment for the cerebral palsy population and their families, impacting quality of life and reducing medical costs. Similarly, to address the racial and socioeconomic health equity challenges experienced by the cerebral palsy population, it is imperative that greater investment is made to address disparities in access to interventions and stakeholder engagement. The Committee encourages NIH to support greater investment in research focused on the areas in need of growth, as outlined in the Strategic Plan on Cerebral Palsy Research directed by the Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying the fiscal year 2022 Appropriations Act, including research on lifespan issues to address the needs of transition-age youth and adults with cerebral palsy, and research to support the development and delivery of new and improved screening tools, treatments and interventions. The Committee also encourages NIH to consider a neuroplasticity workshop and research opportunities focusing on the motor and health benefits of physical activity specifically for individuals with CP across all gross motor functional classification levels, which is vital to help prevent chronic disease and premature aging. Dystonia.--The Committee requests an update in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Justification on the status of the implementation of the recommendations from the NINDS workshop Defining Emergent Opportunities in Dystonia Research that was held in 2018. Lyme Disease.--The Committee recognizes that there have been only a small number of clinical trials involving Lyme disease, which lacks a gold standard test, and that those trials have involved a relatively small number of patients. For other diseases, high quality multi-site trials involving robust number of well-characterized patients have been considered essential to facilitate advancements in the development of more effective treatments and improved outcomes. Because of the clear neurological dysfunction of Lyme disease and the existence of the Network for Excellence in Neuroscience Clinical Trials, the Committee encourages NINDS to evaluate how it may contribute to improvements in tools to manage Lyme disease. Multiple Sclerosis (MS).--The Committee encourages NINDS to prioritize studies that develop the medical understanding of the progression of MS and advance research on prevention strategies, treatments, and cures for MS. Opioid, Stimulant, and Pain Management Research.--The Committee includes no less than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level within NINDS for the Helping to End Addiction Long-Term (HEAL) Initiative, which is a trans-NIH effort to accelerate scientific discovery related to prevention and treatment of opioid use disorder and improving pain management. The Committee also includes an additional $11,500,000 in NINDS to support related research on pain and pain management, as described in the fiscal year 2023 budget request. Parkinson's Disease (PD).--The Committee commends NINDS for taking critical steps in identifying priority research recommendations to advance research on PD, which impacts between 500,000 and 1,500,000 Americans and is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease in the U.S. The Committee recognizes that NINDS is prioritizing public health concerns with severe gaps in unmet medical needs and supports the research recommendations set forth by the NINDS planning strategy to bring us closer to better treatments and a cure for PD. The Committee also encourages NINDS to submit an update on its progress on implementing these recommendations in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Justification. Parkinson's Disease and Dementia.--The Committee recognizes that although PD is often thought of only as a movement disorder, most PD patients also develop dementia. Common symptoms include difficulty with problem solving and speed of thinking, memory, and other cognitive skills. Because people with PD usually develop these symptoms several years after their diagnosis, PD represents an under-explored opportunity to study the onset and progression of dementia. Therefore, the Committee strongly urges NIA and NINDS to put a higher priority on PD, both before and after onset of dementia, within their overall dementia research portfolios. The Committee requests an update on these activities in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Justification. Prion Research and Brain Health.--The Committee supports the efforts of NINDS to support research across the spectrum of neurodegenerative disease, including through the BRAIN Initiative and the Alzheimer's disease research portfolio. The Committee encourages NINDS to support enhanced research on the processes whereby misfolded proteins (prions) are replicated in the brain. Such proteins are critically implicated in numerous neurodegenerative diseases, many of which are both lethal and incurable. The Committee also encourages NINDS to enhance its focus on the identification of genetic and other biomarkers for disorders that involve misfolded proteins, such as traumatic brain injury, ALS, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease, and the development of related diagnostic tools and therapies. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES (NIAID) Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $6,322,728,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 6,268,313,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 6,642,608,000 Change from enacted level......................... +319,880,000 Change from budget request........................ +374,295,000 Mission.--The NIAID mission is to conduct and support basic and applied research to better understand, treat, and ultimately prevent infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases. Antimicrobial Resistance.--The Committee includes $560,000,000 to support antimicrobial resistance research, $20,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. Increased funding would support the training of new investigators; strengthen clinical trial infrastructure to boost preparedness; enhance basic, translational, and clinical research on mechanisms of resistance, therapeutics, vaccines and diagnostics; and support the development of a clinical trials network to reduce barriers to research on difficult-to-treat infections. Celiac Disease.--The Committee supports research to improve the quality of life for patients with celiac disease, efforts to find the cause of the disease, and efforts to find a cure. The Committee commends NIH for issuing a Notice of Special Interest to spur additional research on the study of celiac disease. Today, the only known treatment for this disease is a gluten-free diet; however, recent public and private sector research confirms that such a ``treatment'' is insufficient for many who suffer from celiac disease. The Committee urges NIH to support focused research on the study of celiac disease; to better coordinate existing research; and, to focus new research efforts toward causation, diagnosis, management, treatment, and, ultimately, a cure of this disease. The Committee thanks NIH for establishing a Research Condition, Disease Categorization (RCDC) for celiac disease. Cellular Immunity.--To better understand diseases like COVID-19, the Committee is aware of the enormous value in assessing cellular immunity, in addition to antibodies, which may help us answer questions about the efficacy of vaccines, the need for boosters, and the degree to which they prime the body to protect against future variants, as well as the role of cellular immune response diagnostics. With more comprehensive immune response data, the Committee understands that it may be possible to identify features of immune responses to viruses like SARS-CoV-2 that make some people more susceptible to severe disease, long COVID, and reinfection. The Committee believes enhanced cellular immunity assessment will help to generate deeper insights into the immune response, and may help identify new strategies to improve countermeasures, including cellular immune response diagnostics, for SARS-CoV-2 and other potential pathogens in the future. The Committee encourages NIAID to incorporate cellular immunity assessment into the wide range of intramural and extramural COVID-19 and other disease studies conducted and supported by NIH, including but not limited to vaccine schedule studies and understanding post- acute sequalae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC/long COVID). The Committee requests that NIAID provide an update on these efforts in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Justification. Centers for AIDS Research.--As part of the Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative, the Committee includes $71,000,000 for the longstanding HIV research efforts of the Centers for AIDS Research (CFARs) as well as CFAR activities and similar efforts to support the EHE, the same as the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the fiscal year 2023 budget request. These Centers and related efforts offer evidence-based practices on prevention and treatment to initiative partners and support for evaluating the initiative. The Committee encourages CFAR to assess whether resources are targeting areas with the highest prevalence and to develop targeted interventions that address high-need communities. Centers for Research and Emerging Infectious Diseases.--The Committee recognizes the importance of the connection between animal health and its impacts on human health. The NIH Centers for Research on Emerging Infectious Diseases, a global network of researchers dedicated to investigating how and why viruses emerge from animals to cause disease in humans, has been established by NIAID to investigate how and where viruses and other pathogens can emerge from wildlife and spill over to cause disease in people. The Committee commends the work of this program and supports its continuation. Consortium of Food Allergy Research (CoFAR).--The Committee recognizes the serious issue of food allergies, which affect approximately eight percent of children and ten percent of adults in the U.S. The Committee commends the ongoing work of NIAID in supporting a total of 17 clinical sites for this critical research, including seven sites as part of the CoFAR. The Committee includes $12,100,000, an increase of $3,000,000, for CoFAR to expand its clinical research network to add new centers of excellence in food allergy clinical care and to select such centers from those with proven expertise in food allergy research. Health Disparities Research.--The Committee includes an increase of $10,000,000 for NIAID to support research related to identifying and reducing health disparities as described in the fiscal year 2023 budget request. Hereditary Angioedema (HAE).--The Committee recognizes NIAID for its ongoing stewardship of the HAE research portfolio, including advancements that have taken HAE from a debilitating and fatal condition to a manageable chronic disease. The Committee notes the potential of gene therapy and other cutting-edge research to further improve health outcomes for HAE patients and encourages NIAID to maintain its commitment to the HAE research. Late-Stage Antifungal Research and Development.--Fungal diseases, like Valley fever, pose a threat to public health, including life-threatening drug resistant infections. The Committee supports research to further the research and development of novel anti-fungal therapies for multi-drug resistant pathogens to minimize their impact on public health. Next-Generation Vaccine Platforms.--The Committee notes that many current vaccines protect from disease but do not always prevent the spreading of pathogens. When this occurs, protected people might not experience symptoms but are still infectious. Next-generation viral vectors, designed to target specific tissue like mucosal sites or specific immune cells, offer new abilities to induce the desired immune responses and protect the necessary tissues. This will open novel opportunities to prevent diseases and transmission. The Committee encourages NIAID to maintain a balanced portfolio of vaccine platform approaches to include next-generation viral vectors, particularly in vaccine centers that have experience in developing viral vectors covering multiple virus-based vaccine platforms and that have established collaborations with high containment laboratories (e.g., BSL-3 and BSL-4) for preclinical studies. Primary Immunodeficiencies (PI) Research.--The Committee applauds NIH for recognizing the need for research on primary immunodeficiencies and other related conditions by issuing a Notice of Special Interest for research on inborn errors of immunity/primary immunodeficiencies. The Committee encourages NIH to fund as many meritorious proposals as possible and to consider building upon the notice by issuing a targeted funding announcement focused on research topics of significance to the PI research and patient communities. Regional Biocontainment Laboratories (RBLs).--The Committee provides $52,000,000 to be evenly divided among the 12 RBLs to support efforts to prevent, prepare for, and respond to infectious disease outbreaks, including, but not limited to: (1) conducting research on developing new antiviral compounds, vaccines, and point of care tests; (2) conducting research on prophylactic methods to prevent infections; (3) supporting operations costs and purchase of equipment to speed drug discovery and testing; and (4) training new researchers in biosafety level 3 practices. The Committee recognizes the need for RBLs to be able to utilize funding for all four of the aforementioned areas. The Committee urges NIAID to identify appropriate grant mechanisms that will allow RBLs to access funding to support these four critical areas. Tick-Borne Disease Research.--The Committee is supportive of the NIH Strategic Plan for Tickborne Disease Research published in 2019. The Committee encourages NIAID to increase efforts to understand causes of the increase in tick-borne diseases, to support research on tick-borne tularemia (Francisella tularensis), and to determine whether information learned on ways that ticks respond to bacterial infections offer avenues to thwart tick infections in humans. Universal Influenza Vaccine.--The Committee includes no less than $260,000,000, an increase of $15,000,000 over the fiscal year 2022 level and the same as the fiscal year 2023 budget request, to support basic, translational, and clinical research to develop a universal influenza vaccine that provides robust, long-lasting protection against multiple subtypes of flu, rather than a select few. Such a vaccine would eliminate the need to update and administer the seasonal flu vaccine each year and could provide protection against newly emerging flu strains, potentially including those that could cause a flu pandemic. The Committee requests an update on these efforts within 60 days of enactment of this Act. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCES (NIGMS) Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $3,092,373,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 3,097,557,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 3,200,157,000 Change from enacted level......................... +107,784,000 Change from budget request........................ +102,600,000 The Committee recommendation includes $1,779,457,000 in discretionary appropriations and $1,420,700,000 in PHS Act section 241 evaluation set-aside transfers.

Health Disparities Research.--The Committee includes an increase of $10,000,000 for NIGMS to support research and activities related to identifying and reducing health disparities as described in the fiscal year 2023 budget request. Institutional Development Awards (IDeA).--The Committee provides $423,076,000 for IDeA, $13,119,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. The program increases our Nation's biomedical research capability by improving research in States that have historically been less successful in obtaining biomedical research funding. IDeA funds only merit-based, peer- reviewed research that meets NIH research objectives in the 23 IDeA States and Puerto Rico. NIH IDeA is comprised of these key initiatives: Centers of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) and IDeA Networks of Biomedical Research Excellence (INBRE). The program aims to strengthen an institution's ability to support biomedical research, enhance the competitiveness of investigators in securing research funding, and enable clinical and translational research that addresses the needs of medically underserved communities. COBRE is a proven successful method to increase the number of new scientists at institutions in States eligible for IDeA awards. The Committee recognizes the success of the COBRE program and encourages NIH to continue working to increase the number of new scientists at institutions in eligible IDeA States. EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT (NICHD) Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $1,683,009,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 1,674,941,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 1,756,630,000 Change from enacted level......................... +73,621,000 Change from budget request........................ +81,689,000 Mission.--NICHD's mission is to lead research and training to understand human development, improve reproductive health, enhance the lives of children and adolescents, and optimize abilities for all. Endometriosis Research.--The Committee urges NICHD to continue to expand basic, clinical, and translational research into the mechanics of endometriosis, identify early diagnostic markers, and develop new treatment methods. Health Impacts on Children of Technology and Social Media Use.--The Committee remains concerned about the impacts of technology use and media consumption on infant, children, and adolescent development. The Committee appreciates NIH's ongoing engagement on this important topic and encourages NIH to prioritize research into the cognitive, physical, and socioemotional impacts of young people's use of technologies as well as long-term developmental effects on children's social, communication, and creative skills. The Committee also encourages NIH to study the repercussions of increased use of digital media and technologies on suicidal thoughts and ideation among children. The Committee asks NIH to consider different forms of digital media and technologies, including mobile devices, smart phones, tablets, computers, and virtual reality tools, as well as social-media content, video games, and television programming. The Committee includes no less than $15,000,000 for this activity. Impact of COVID-19 on Children.--The Committee includes no less than $10,000,000, an increase of $2,500,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level, for NICHD to support additional research into multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) and other ways in which COVID-19 affects children, as described in the fiscal year 2023 budget request. Impact of COVID-19 on Pregnant and Lactating Women.--The Committee includes an increase of $3,000,000, the same as the fiscal year 2023 budget request, to support research on the effects of COVID-19 on pregnancy, lactation, and postpartum health with a focus on individuals from racial and ethnic minority groups. IMPROVE Maternal Health Initiative.--The Committee includes no less than $30,000,000 for the Implementing a Maternal Health and Pregnancy Outcomes Vision for Everyone (IMPROVE) Initiative, the same as the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the fiscal year 2023 budget request. The IMPROVE Initiative advances research to reduce preventable causes of maternal deaths and improve health for pregnant and postpartum individuals before, during, and after delivery. Learning Disabilities Research.--The Committee is increasingly concerned with the decline in achievement for students with disabilities and recognizes the need for continued research and improved interventions, particularly in light of the COVID-19 crisis, which has led to significant loss of in-person instruction for many students. The Committee recognizes the importance of NICHD's funding of Learning Disabilities Research Centers and Learning Disabilities Innovation Hubs, which are a source of Federal funding available to researchers interested in exploring child development and learning disabilities to conduct randomized control trials and explore the relationships between different variables at work. While learning disabilities do impact an individual's education and academic achievement, these disorders are brain-based, and so clinical research using the latest technology and advances in neuroscience is essential. To continue robust research into language, reading development, learning disabilities, and disorders that adversely affect the development of listening, speaking, reading, writing, and mathematics abilities, the Committee urges NICHD to continue its investment in its Learning Disabilities Research Centers and Learning Disabilities Innovation Hubs. Male Reproductive Health.--The Committee urges NICHD to continue to support research on male mechanisms of infertility. There is a gap in the knowledge of how to diagnose and treat male infertility, often resulting in women undergoing unnecessary treatments due to undiagnosed or untreated male partner infertility. The Committee notes that NICHD has recently recognized the importance of male reproduction in its strategic plan and included andrology as a research priority. The Committee is concerned, however, that none of the NICHD branches focus on male fertility, leaving a gap in representation. The Committee encourages NICHD to consider forming a distinct Male Fertility Health branch to prioritize research in this area, including identifying new proteins and sperm structures necessary for normal sperm function and, consequently, for fertility and healthy embryo development. Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units Network.--The Committee supports the Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units Network of centers across the country that conduct clinical studies to improve maternal, fetal, and neonatal health that ultimately improves the clinical practice of obstetrics. Many Institutes at the NIH support at least one grant or project related to pregnancy, which further improves maternal and infant health outcomes and addresses maternal mortality. Pelvic Floor Disorders.--Pelvic floor disorders, including urinary incontinence, accidental bowel leakage, and pelvic organ prolapse, negatively impact the quality of life of more than 25 million U.S. women each year. There are socioeconomic disparities amongst women suffering from pelvic floor disorders, with differences in symptoms, knowledge, access to care, availability of treatments, and treatment outcomes noted in patients from different backgrounds. The Committee urges NICHD to prioritize research activities into underrepresented patient populations and pelvic floor disorders. Such activities may include the development of educational programs for general practitioners, the evaluation of effectiveness of screening protocols for pelvic floor disorders in the primary care setting, investigating medical literacy amongst minority women as it pertains to pelvic floor disorders, as well as assessing socioeconomic and socio-cultural disease perspectives by designing qualitative studies using focus groups of women with varying socio-economic, cultural, and ethnic backgrounds, evaluating current educational resources, determining gaps in patient knowledge, and designing culture-specific educational materials and resources. The Committee requests an update on this research in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Justification. Population Research.--The Committee congratulates NICHD for leading efforts to promote research regarding the effects of COVID-19 on child development and health disparities. The Committee encourages NICHD to sustain these research priorities through its support of the Population Dynamics Research Centers Program and population-representative longitudinal datasets, such as the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, Baby's First Years, Panel Study of Income Dynamics Child Supplement Survey, and National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. The Committee urges NICHD to engage the population research field to develop informed frameworks for conceptualizing and measuring social determinants of health, including structural racism. The Committee also encourages NICHD to support research exploring the direct and indirect effects of COVID-19 on reproductive health, marriage, and divorce and to expand research and data collection on mortality, especially during adolescence and the transition to adulthood. Within 90 days of enactment of this Act, the Committee requests a report on the Institute's efforts to address these priority areas. Pregnancy Loss Research.--The Committee supports NIH research into pregnancy loss and encourages NIH to expand and coordinate research activities with respect to pregnancy loss. Research in Pregnant and Lactating Women.--The Committee is pleased with the progress being made by the Task Force on Research Specific to Pregnant Women and Lactating Women in identifying and developing strategies to address gaps in knowledge and research on safe and effective therapies for pregnant and lactating women. The Committee encourages NIH to continue implementing these recommendations to the extent appropriate and feasible under the legal authorities available to the Secretary. Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).--The Committee urges NICHD to strengthen support for research into the causes and prevention of SIDS. Trans-NIH Pediatric Research Consortium (N-PeRC).--The Committee is aware of the N-PeRC that was established in 2018 to better coordinate pediatric research activities across multiple Institutes and Centers. The Committee supports the goals and objectives of N-PeRC and requests that NIH update the Committee on its activities and focus of multi-Institute or - Center pediatric research projects implemented as a result of N-PeRC. Additionally, the Committee requests a report in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Justification on how N-PeRC plans to encourage longitudinal studies of the physical, mental, and behavioral health impacts of COVID-19 on children, including multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS- C), as well as plans for N-PeRC's focus over the coming three years. Uterine Fibroids.--The Committee encourages NIH to support the activities outlined in the Stephanie Tubbs Jones Uterine Fibroid Research and Education Act of 2022 (H.R. 2007), as introduced in the House, to support research related to uterine fibroids etiology, prevention, diagnosis, disparities, and treatment. NATIONAL EYE INSTITUTE (NEI) Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $863,918,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 853,355,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 891,186,000 Change from enacted level......................... +27,268,000 Change from budget request........................ +37,831,000 Mission.-- The mission of the National Eye Institute is to eliminate vision loss and improve quality of life through vision research. Blepharospasm.--The Committee continues to encourage NEI to expand research into blepharospasm, a form of dystonia, and requests an update on collaborative efforts amongst stakeholders and other Institutes and Centers in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Justification. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCES (NIEHS) Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $842,169,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 932,056,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 878,750,000 Change from enacted level......................... +36,581,000 Change from budget request........................ -53,306,000 Mission.--NIEHS's mission is to discover how the environment affects people in order to promote healthier lives. The Committee includes an additional $10,000,000 for NIEHS to support and coordinate research on the rise in and exacerbation of a wide range of health conditions related to the environment, which may include infectious disease, injury and trauma, and chronic conditions such as asthma, mental health, and health disparities. Such research may include evaluation of both preventive and intervention strategies for such conditions. Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) Human Health Effects Research.--Harmful algal blooms are occurring with increasing frequency and severity across the country. While we know of the temporary physical discomfort caused by the toxic bacteria, we do not know if exposure presents a long-term threat to human health. The Committee supports NIEHS research to determine the impact of red tide and other HABs on human health. The Committee commends NIEHS for its collaborations with other agencies, including NSF, NOAA, EPA, and CDC, to advance such research and translate key research findings for clinical and public health benefits. Indoor Amplified Microbial Growth Research.--The Committee believes that a more robust and focused NIH commitment to research relating to mold and amplified microbial growth in damp and water-damaged buildings would yield significant advancements of knowledge and insight regarding how fungi, mycotoxins, actinobacteria, and endotoxins within indoor environments affect public health. The Committee encourages NIH to expedite planned and ongoing studies already nominated and established through the National Toxicology Program (NTP). The Committee also urges the Director of NIEHS, in coordination with the Division of the National Toxicology Program (DNTP), as well as the NTP, to prioritize new research and explore the causal links to the potential neurotoxic, immunosuppressive, immunoreactive, nephrotoxic, carcinogenic, and inflammatory responses due to inhalation of indoor amplified microbial growth in damp and water-damaged indoor environments. The Committee encourages NIH to improve applied research, communication and education, and coordination with other Federal, State, and local health and environmental agencies regarding mold and microbial growth in damp and water-damaged indoor environments. Parkinson's Disease.--Research suggests that Parkinson's disease (PD) is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Agricultural exposure to pesticides, including herbicides, has been associated with an increased risk of developing the disease, yet other exposures common to soldiers, firefighters, first responders, and others, such as burn pits, insecticides, solvents and heavy metals, need to be explored or should be considered. The Committee urges NIEHS to expand its research and collaborate with appropriate partners to understand the effects of these chemicals on PD development and progression. Research should include fundamental approaches to identify other environmental triggers and to understand the expression of PD traits that result from the interplay of genes and environment to advance the development of individualized precision environmental health strategies to prevent and treat PD. The Committee requests an update on these activities in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Justification. NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGING (NIA) Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $4,219,936,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 4,011,413,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 4,443,196,000 Change from enacted level......................... +223,260,000 Change from budget request........................ +431,783,000 Mission.--NIA's mission is to understand the nature of aging and the aging process, and diseases and conditions associated with growing older, in order to extend the healthy, active years of life. Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD).--The Committee recommends an increase of $200,000,000 for ADRD research. The Committee encourages NIA to continue addressing the research targets outlined in the fiscal year 2023 Professional Judgment Budget. The Committee encourages NIA to take the necessary steps to ensure that NIH-sponsored clinical trials take into account racial and ethnic diversity and the impact of Alzheimer's disease on underserved populations. In addition, with various treatments for Alzheimer's disease in the pipeline, the Committee encourages NIA to support a wide range of trials, including those with a patient-based national registry of regulatory grade, longitudinal evidence for patients receiving any FDA-approved disease modifying therapies for Alzheimer's disease in real-world clinical practice. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in Older Adults.--The Committee recognizes recent research which indicates that individuals with ASD are more likely to be diagnosed with neurodegenerative conditions, including dementia, compared to the general population. The Committee supports ongoing research at NIA to understand how ASD affects the aging process and to develop tools for identifying ASD and related mental health needs and evidence-based services, and commends the NIA for convening a workshop in 2022 to discuss possible linkages between ASD and Alzheimer's disease. The Committee requests an update on opportunities for research activities in this area within 180 days of enactment of this Act. Geroscience.--The Committee commends NIA for its support of geroscience, which seeks to understand the genetic, molecular, and cellular mechanisms that make aging a major risk factor and driver of numerous chronic conditions and diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and many others. A growing body of research suggests it is possible to develop treatments that would address many late-life diseases, as opposed to solely tackling each disease individually, as under the current prevailing model. Significant advances in recent years highlight the need to develop a comprehensive strategy for addressing research gaps and opportunities. Therefore, the Committee urges NIA to convene a meeting of experts across NIH, other relevant Federal agencies, academic researchers, and the private sector to identify gaps and opportunities for this research field. The Committee also recognizes that there is a shortage of investigators who combine clinical, social, and behavioral research skills with a knowledge of aging biology and experience in the care of older adults and the processes of aging at the individual and societal level. The Committee encourages NIA to expand its translational geroscience training programs to support the pipeline of such investigators. The Committee requests an update on these topics in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Justification. National Strategy for Recruitment and Participation in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias Clinical Research.-- The Committee applauds NIA's efforts to initiate, identify, and develop the National Strategy for Recruitment and Participation in Alzheimer's and Related Dementias Clinical Research. An effective way of determining whether those recommended strategies are being well-implemented and having the desired impact is through data collection and reporting. The Committee urges NIA to provide an assessment of the data and metrics it collects related to the planning, recruitment, and retention of clinical trial participants from underrepresented communities and how those data have been or will be used in grantmaking decisions. The assessment should also address how NIA plans to provide more timely data to Congress and greater transparency to the public about the planning, engagement, and recruitment efforts of its extramural grantees, including a focus on addressing barriers to inclusive and representative enrollment such as eligibility criteria, language accessibility, and adequate planning for diverse enrollment among grantees. The Committee requests that NIA provide this assessment to the Committee within 180 days of the enactment of this Act. Parkinson's Disease and Dementia.--The Committee recognizes that although PD is often thought of only as a movement disorder, most PD patients also develop dementia. Common symptoms include difficulty with problem solving, speed of thinking, memory, and other cognitive skills. Because people with PD usually develop these symptoms several years after their diagnosis, PD represents an under-explored opportunity to study the onset and progression of dementia. The Committee strongly urges NIA and NINDS to put a higher priority on PD, both before and after onset of dementia, within their overall dementia research portfolios. The Committee requests an update on these activities in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Justification. Population Research.--The Committee recognizes NIA for supporting a robust population aging research portfolio within its Division of Behavioral and Social Research (DBSR) and encouraging enhanced collaborations between DBSR and the Institute's other scientific research divisions. The Committee is pleased to learn these collaborations include, for example, integrating the population sciences into the Institute's geroscience research agenda and initiatives regarding Alzheimer's disease and the long-term social, behavioral, and economic consequences of COVID-19 on older people and their families. Continued support for large-scale, longitudinal, and representative studies, such as Health and Retirement Study and the National Health and Aging Trends Study, the Centers on the Demography and Economics of Aging, research networks, training grants, and early career opportunities are needed to sustain and enhance the field of population aging research. The Committee asks NIA to report on its plans for ensuring long- term investment and support for population aging research activities within 90 days of enactment of this Act. Thalassemia.--Thalassemia patients and others dealing with chronic diseases are now living well into adulthood, some even into their 60s. While this is a tremendous victory for research, it has opened new questions. For example, even in well-managed cases, individuals with thalassemia are likely to be exposed to levels of iron loading that, while too low to create immediate damage, are significantly in excess of what occurs in the typical population. Such exposure may occur for decades in many patients. The long-term effect of this exposure on patient health and outcomes is unknown. In addition, many thalassemia patients develop low bone mass issues early in life and may be prescribed treatments which are in the general population typically prescribed much later in life; the long- term efficacy and possible consequences of this extended exposure is unknown. In addition, there are female and male reproductive issues, the impact of other non-disease related medicines, the relationship to diseases of aging such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, arthritis, osteoporosis, and more. The Committee encourages NIA to develop a plan to research comorbidities in thalassemia and other rare disease patient populations as they continue to age. In addition, individuals with thalassemia trait are asymptomatic, aside from perhaps an occasional mild anemia, and do not require clinical care. However, research is lacking in the possible effects of thalassemia trait on an older adults. Research is warranted to determine if thalassemia trait carriers do experience adverse effects related to the trait as they age. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ARTHRITIS AND MUSCULOSKELETAL AND SKIN DISEASES (NIAMS) Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $655,699,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 676,254,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 676,395,000 Change from enacted level......................... +20,696,000 Change from budget request........................ +141,000 Mission.--NIAMS's mission is to support research into the causes, treatment, and prevention of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases; the training of basic and clinical scientists to carry out this research; and the dissemination of information on research progress in these diseases. Alopecia Areata.--The Committee notes the importance of research into autoimmune skin conditions such as alopecia areata. The Committee requests an update in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Justification on research initiatives into this condition and opportunities to advance research. Thalassemia.--Individuals with thalassemia frequently develop low bone mass issues, often several decades earlier than is typical in the general population. Most currently recognized treatment options for low bone mass issues have been developed for populations that develop these issues at an older age than in thalassemia, and which may not have the same characteristics as those with thalassemia. More research in treatments for and prevention of low bone mass for this population, including the proper use of low intensity vibration therapy, may be warranted. NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DEAFNESS AND OTHER COMMUNICATION DISORDERS (NIDCD) Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $514,885,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 508,704,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 531,136,000 Change from enacted level......................... +16,251,000 Change from budget request........................ +22,432,000 Mission.--NIDCD conducts and supports biomedical and behavioral research and research training in the normal and disordered processes of hearing, balance, taste, smell, voice, speech, and language. NIDCD also conducts and supports research and research training related to disease prevention and health promotion; addresses special biomedical and behavioral problems associated with people who have communication impairments or disorders; and supports efforts to create devices which substitute for lost and impaired sensory and communication function. Hearing Loss.--The Committee is concerned about the rapidly escalating public health crisis of hearing loss, which now impacts one in five people in the U.S. alone. The Committee encourages NIDCD to convene a workshop involving key stakeholders including industry, academia, and patient advocates, to develop a roadmap for bringing these much-needed therapies to patients. The Committee also urges NIDCD, to the extent practicable, to involve other agencies who serve disproportionately impacted populations, including VA and DoD. Spasmodic Dysphonia.--The Committee notes the research NIDCD continues to facilitate on spasmodic dysphonia and collaborative efforts with relevant Institutes, Centers, and stakeholders. The Committee continues to encourage sustained collaboration with key stakeholders and agencies. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NURSING RESEARCH (NINR) Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $180,862,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 198,670,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 208,571,000 Change from enacted level......................... +27,709,000 Change from budget request........................ +9,901,000 Mission.--The mission of NINR is to lead nursing research to solve pressing health challenges and inform practice and policy--optimizing health and advancing health equity into the future. Health Disparities Research.--The Committee includes an increase of $22,000,000 for NINR to support research related to identifying and reducing health disparities, the same as the fiscal year 2023 budget request. NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL EFFECTS AND ALCOHOL-ASSOCIATED DISORDERS (NIAAA) Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $573,651,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 566,725,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 591,757,000 Change from enacted level......................... +18,106,000 Change from budget request........................ +25,032,000 Mission.--NIAAA's mission is to generate and disseminate fundamental knowledge about the adverse effects of alcohol on health and well-being, and apply that knowledge to improve diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of alcohol-related problems, including alcohol use disorder, across the lifespan. Alcohol-Associated Liver Disease.--The Committee is aware that alcohol use disorder and alcohol-associated liver disease are distinct diseases. However, it is rare for patients to have the latter without first having the former. Combining the research in this area in a holistic approach could lead to advancements for both, which are needed urgently given the increased rates of alcohol consumption during the pandemic. The Committee requests an update in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Justification on the viability of this approach, including NIAAA's capacity to award related grants and the field's capacity to develop scientifically valid research projects. NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUGS AND ADDICTION (NIDA) Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $1,595,474,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 1,843,326,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 1,712,832,000 Change from enacted level......................... +117,358,000 Change from budget request........................ -130,494,000 Mission.--NIDA's mission is to advance science on the causes and consequences of drug use and addiction and to apply that knowledge to improve individual and public health. Addiction Intervention.--The Committee is deeply concerned by alarming trends of drug use and addiction in the U.S. The number of alcohol-related deaths doubled in the U.S. from 1999 to 2017. Staggeringly, the number of drug overdose deaths doubled from 2015-2021. Difficulty managing impulsivity, a key function of cognitive self-control, is associated with substance use disorders. The Committee recognizes that Episodic Future Thinking is a promising intervention that can help individuals with substance use disorders consider the positive outcomes of abstaining from use through a mental simulation of positive events that might occur in the future. The Committee encourages NIDA to support transdisciplinary research that incorporates neuroscience, behavioral research, neuroeconomics, brain imaging, engineering, and computer science to deploy Episodic Future Thinking intervention strategies across a range of substance use disorders. Barriers to Research.--The Committee is concerned that restrictions associated with Schedule I of the Controlled Substance Act effectively limit the amount and type of research that can be conducted on certain Schedule I drugs, especially opioids, marijuana or its component chemicals, and new synthetic drugs and analogs. At a time when as much information as possible about these drugs is needed, including research on their therapeutic potential and on overdose reversal agents, it would be helpful to lower regulatory and other barriers to conducting this research. The Committee appreciates NIDA's completion of a report on the barriers to research that result from the classification of drugs and compounds as Schedule I substances, including the challenges researchers face as a result of limited access to sources of marijuana including dispensary products. COVID-19 Pandemic and Impact on Substance Use Disorders.-- The Committee is acutely aware of the risks that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic poses to individuals with substance use disorders (SUDs). According to CDC, drug overdose deaths accelerated during the pandemic. Moreover, NIDA-supported research found that individuals with substance use disorders are at increased risk for COVID-19 and its adverse outcomes. The Committee commends NIDA for conducting research on the adverse impact of the pandemic on people with SUDs and encourages NIDA to continue to support research on these issues. Development of Cocaine Overdose Treatment.--The Committee continues to recognize the ``fourth wave'' of the overdose public health crisis involves rising overdoses involving stimulants. The Committee is concerned about the increase in overdose deaths involving cocaine and the lack of FDA-approved cocaine overdose reversal medications to address the increase in fatalities. The Committee understands that NIH has previously supported research and development of treatments that can rapidly reverse cocaine toxicity and reduce mortality rates. The Committee encourages NIDA to fund additional research to advance a life-saving treatment for overdoses caused by cocaine and other stimulants. Electronic Cigarettes.--The Committee understands that electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) and other vaporizing equipment are increasingly popular among adolescents, and encourages NIDA to continue to fund research on the use and consequences of these devices. Headache Disorders and Migraines.--Migraine is the second leading cause of disability, and 60 million Americans have migraines. There is a critical need for more effective and safer treatments for headache disorders, especially because current treatment using opioids can worsen migraine frequency and severity. Ten percent of Americans with migraines are opioid users and 59 percent receive opioids in U.S. emergency departments. The HEAL Initiative calls for disease burden to be a crucial consideration when prioritizing research programs. The Committee supports efforts to address the need for more effective pain management for those suffering from headache disorders and migraines. Kratom.--The Committee recognizes that NIH- and NIDA-funded research has contributed to the continued understanding of the health impacts of kratom, including its constituent compounds, mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine. The Committee is aware of the potential promising results of kratom for acute and chronic pain patients who seek safer alternatives to sometimes dangerously addictive and potentially deadly prescription opioids and of research investigating the use of kratom's constituent compounds for opioid use disorder. The Committee acknowledges NIDA's support of preclinical research on the toxicology of mitragynine, which will enable future studies of its safety, tolerability, and clinical pharmacokinetics in humans. The Committee also urges NIDA to consider a human clinical trial on its therapeutic effects to treat opioid use disorder, especially in light of the increases in overdose deaths reported during the COVID-19 pandemic. Marijuana Research.--The Committee supports the development of an objective standard to measure marijuana impairment to ensure highway safety. Essential to that development are high- quality scientific studies using marijuana and products containing marijuana lawfully available to patients or consumers in a State on a retail basis. The Committee notes that a majority of Federal research on marijuana has been limited to a single strain of marijuana that is not fully representative. The Committee emphasizes the need for research that encompasses the diversity, quality, and potency of products commonly available to patients or consumers in a State on a retail basis. The Committee requests an update on efforts to expand researcher access to different marijuana strains in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Justification. Medications for Opioid Use Disorder and Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome.--The Committee recognizes the increasing incidence of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS), with nearly 80 newborns diagnosed with NOWS in the U.S. daily. Currently, hospital stays for newborns with NOWS are six times as long and eight times as expensive as hospital stays for newborns without NOWS. The Committee also recognizes that medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) are the gold standard for treatment for opioid use disorder, including in pregnant people. MOUD in pregnancy reduces the risk of adverse birth outcomes, including preterm birth, but may lead to NOWS. The Committee encourages NIDA to support research on types of MOUD that would not cause NOWS or would have fewer symptoms of NOWS compared to currently available medications. Opioid, Stimulant, and Pain Research.--The Committee continues to be concerned about the high mortality rate due to the opioid epidemic and appreciates the important role that research plays in the various Federal initiatives aimed at the overdose crisis. The Committee is also aware of the most recent provisional data from CDC that shows opioid overdose fatalities exceeded 100,000 in 2021, primarily driven by illicitly manufactured fentanyl and fentanyl analogs. More research is needed to find new and better agents to prevent or reverse the effects caused by this class of chemicals and to provide improved access to treatments for those addicted to these drugs. The Committee is also concerned that, according to provisional data released by CDC, over 45,000 overdose deaths involved drugs in the categories that include methamphetamine and cocaine in the 12-month period ending in June 2021, an increase of 25 percent in a single year. The sharp increase has led some to refer to stimulant overdoses as the ``fourth wave'' of the current overdose crisis in America following the rise of opioid-related deaths involving prescription opioids, heroin, and fentanyl-related substances. To combat this crisis, the Committee includes no less than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level for NIDA's share of the HEAL Initiative, and in response to rising rates of stimulant use and overdose, the Committee has maintained bill language expanding the allowable use of these funds to include research related to stimulant use and addiction. The Committee also includes an additional $67,000,000 in NIDA to support basic research on pain and pain management, as described in the fiscal year 2023 budget request. Overdose Prevention Centers.--The Committee recognizes that overdose prevention centers, or supervised consumption sites, are part of a larger effort of harm reduction interventions intended to reduce the risk of drug overdose death and reduce the spread of infectious disease. The Committee encourages NIH to discuss in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Justification significant advances in research on the potential public health impact of overdose prevention centers in the U.S. Raising Awareness and Engaging the Medical Community in Drug Use and Addiction Prevention and Treatment.--Education is a critical component of any effort to curb drug use and addiction, and it must target every segment of society, including health care providers (doctors, nurses, dentists, and pharmacists), patients, and families. Medical professionals must be in the forefront of efforts to curb the opioid crisis. The Committee continues to be pleased with the NIDAMED initiative, targeting physicians-in-training, including medical students and resident physicians in primary care specialties (e.g., internal medicine, family practice, and pediatrics). The Committee encourages NIDA to continue its efforts in this area, providing physicians and other medical professionals with the tools and skills needed to incorporate substance use and misuse screening and treatment into their clinical practices. The Committee encourages NIDA to increase its support for the education of scientists and practitioners to find improved prevention and treatments for substance use disorders. Youth and Perinatal Marijuana Use.--The Committee includes $2,000,000 for NIDA to enter into a contract with NASEM to commission a study to determine the scope of the problem of underage youth and perinatal marijuana use and effective ways of reducing it. Topics explored should include but not be limited to the demographics of underage and perinatal marijuana use; its economic and social costs; adolescent and perinatal decision making and risk and protective factors; and the effectiveness of various prevention programs and approaches, including media campaigns, school-based education, pricing, and access. NASEM will develop a strategy for reducing and preventing underage and perinatal consumption of today's marijuana and THC products, specifically focused on the impacts of THC on the developing brain. To help develop an effective strategy, NASEM shall review existing Federal, State, and non- governmental programs, including media-based programs, that have been shown to be effective with other substances that can be harmful to youth, including any done on marijuana, that are designed to change the attitudes and health behaviors of youth (those under the age of 21). In addition, NASEM shall review existing Federal, State, and non-governmental programs including media-based programs, that have been shown to be effective with other substances that can be harmful to babies of pregnant and breast-feeding women, including with any completed on marijuana, that are designed to change the attitudes and health behaviors of pregnant and breast-feeding women. Based on its reviews, NASEM shall produce a strategy designed to prevent and reduce underage consumption of today's marijuana and THC products in addition to a strategy designed to prevent and reduce consumption of today's marijuana and THC products by pregnant and breast-feeding women. This shall include, but not be limited to: an outline and implementation strategy; message points that will be effective in changing the attitudes and health behaviors of youth concerning underage marijuana consumption; and an outline and implementation strategy, and message points that will be effective in changing the attitudes and health behaviors of pregnant and breast- feeding women, target audience identification, goals and objectives of both campaigns, and the estimated costs of development and implementation. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH (NIMH) Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $2,216,976,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 2,210,828,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 2,428,775,000 Change from enacted level......................... +211,799,000 Change from budget request........................ +217,947,000 The Committee recommendation includes $2,203,775,000 in discretionary appropriations and $225,000,000 made available in the Cures Act. Mission.--NIMH's mission is to transform the understanding and treatment of mental illnesses through basic and clinical research, paving the way for prevention, recovery, and cure. Autism.--The Committee strongly encourages NIH to support greater investment in research related to autism, particularly in priority areas outlined in the IACC Strategic Plan for ASD. While significant progress has been made in the understanding of autism, large gaps remain in the ability to improve outcomes and access to services for autistic individuals across their life span. Research has shown that autistic individuals have higher rates of some co-occurring physical and mental health conditions, impacting quality of life and increasing medical utilization and costs. Additionally, there are significant unaddressed racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic health equity challenges experienced by autistic individuals across their life span and by their families. As such, the Committee further encourages NIMH to work collaboratively with NIMHD to support research on the socioeconomic, racial, and ethnic health disparities associated with autism spectrum disorder, and to work collaboratively with other Institutes to support research on understanding the impact of social and environmental factors leading to co-occurring health conditions. BRAIN Initiative.--The Committee directs NIH to transfer $225,000,000 from the NIH Innovation Account to NIMH to support the BRAIN Initiative. These funds are authorized by the Cures Act. This collaborative effort is revolutionizing our understanding of how neural components and their dynamic interactions result in complex behaviors, cognition, and disease, while accelerating the development of transformative tools to explore the brain in unprecedented ways making information previously beyond reach accessible. Impact of COVID on Mental Health.--The Committee includes an increase of $5,000,000 for NIMH to expand research to understand and mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health, as described in the fiscal year 2023 budget request. Mental Health Impact of Alopecia.--The Committee notes recent events that have highlighted the effect on an individual's mental health because of alopecia. The Committee encourages NIMH to work with key stakeholders to advance research and resource development aimed at understanding this connection and opportunities for innovative discovery. Mental Health Research.--The Committee supports the high- quality basic research on serious mental illnesses being conducted at NIMH. The Committee requests an update on the evaluation of funding allocations at NIMH detailing the percentage of funds spent on both basic and clinical research. The Committee also encourages NIMH to provide ARPA-H with a roadmap of clinical research gaps needed to conduct deeper clinical studies and invest in breakthrough technologies and treatments to continue improving the field of mental health research and improve the lives of those experiencing serious mental illnesses. Prioritizing Black Youth Suicide Prevention.--The Committee commends NIMH for consistently expanding resources for suicide screening and prevention research over the last four fiscal years and strongly encourages the Institute to provide additional increases for this purpose in fiscal year 2023, with special emphasis on producing models that are interpretable, scalable, and practical for clinical implementation, including utilization of healthcare, education and criminal justice systems that serve populations at risk. Specifically, this includes Black youth, whose suicide death rate is increasing faster than any other racial/ethnic group. In addition, the Committee encourages NIMH to prioritize research efforts related to primary care settings to evaluate suicide prevention interventions, strategies, and programs, including assessments of the effects of the COVID-19 epidemic. The Committee requests that NIMH provide an update on all of these efforts in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Justification. Psychiatric Drug Prescription Research.--The Committee encourages NIH to conduct research to support the creation of best practices for follow-up and outreach following the prescription of psychiatric medication that could increase suicidal thoughts or behaviors in order to better allow for timely intervention in individuals experiencing increased suicidal ideation following such prescriptions. Suicide Prevention.--The Committee is encouraged that 2020 was the second year in two decades in which the suicide rate decreased. However, suicide was the 12th leading cause of death overall in the U.S. in 2020, and third among youth and young adults ages 10-24. The Committee remains committed to providing the resources necessary to address the current youth mental health crisis. The Committee commends NIMH for consistently expanding resources for suicide screening and prevention research in recent years and strongly encourages the Institute to continue to prioritize suicide prevention research in fiscal year 2023, with special emphasis on producing models that are interpretable, scalable, and practical for implementation. In addition, the Committee encourages NIMH to prioritize research efforts related to school-based suicide prevention models to evaluate suicide prevention interventions, strategies, and programs, including assessments of the effects of the COVID-19 epidemic on young adults and children. The Committee requests that NIMH provide an update on these efforts in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Justification. NATIONAL HUMAN GENOME RESEARCH INSTITUTE (NHGRI) Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $639,062,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 629,154,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 659,233,000 Change from enacted level......................... +20,171,000 Change from budget request........................ +30,079,000 Mission.--NHGRI's mission is to accelerate scientific and medical breakthroughs that improve human health by driving cutting-edge research, developing new technologies, and studying the impact of genomics on society. Germline RUNX1 Mutations.--The Committee commends NHGRI for collaborating with NCI to launch and maintain the NIH RUNX1-FPD Clinical Research Study, the only longitudinal natural history study of patients with germline RUNX1 mutations and their families. This study has broad implications for the fields of hematology and oncology because it offers researchers the opportunity to monitor the genomic evolution of cancer within a precancerous population in real-time. Insights gained from such careful monitoring can result in the development of improved early detection methods and novel treatment interventions. Given the critical importance of such natural history studies, the Committee encourages NHGRI to leverage NIH resources and toolkits to advance participant recruitment and enrollment, timely data dissemination, and to ensure optimal execution and implementation of the NIH RUNX1-FPD Clinical Research Study. The Committee strongly urges NHGRI to collaborate with other NIH Institutes to identify additional resources that would leverage the expertise across NIH Institutes so that the study can include more patients each year. In addition, the Committee encourages NHGRI to continue to adhere to the NIH Genomic Data Sharing Policy for the benefit of the entire research community and the patients and their families searching for answers. Pharmacogenomics.--NHGRI supports pharmacogenomic research in a variety of ways, including by working to develop community research resources. For instance, the program funds the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium, an international consortium of experts that create, curate, and make publicly accessible detailed gene-drug clinical practice guidelines that inform medical management decisions. The Committee encourages NIH to continue support for this research. Proteomics.--The Committee recognizes the promise of research into the proteome in the study of biological systems. The ability to effectively and efficiently analyze protein patterns and their changes over time has potential to provide valuable insights into a person's real-time state of health including identifying existing disease, understanding the biological drivers of that disease, predicting near-term health events, and guiding effective therapeutic interventions. The Committee encourages NHGRI to utilize existing resources to expand its research into this cutting-edge field. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF BIOMEDICAL IMAGING AND BIOENGINEERING (NIBIB) Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $424,590,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 419,493,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 437,991,000 Change from enacted level........................... +13,401,000 Change from budget request.......................... +18,498,000 Mission.--The NIBIB mission is to improve health by leading the development and accelerating the application of biomedical technologies. Medical Imaging and Data Resource Center (MIDRC).--The Committee supports NIBIB's work to develop the MIDRC, a growing repository of over 85,000 images and associated data to help accelerate strategies for COVID-19 diagnosis and therapeutic management. This resource is creating and enabling broader use of machine learning algorithms in medical image analysis for coronavirus patients and may serve as a model for understanding other diseases to improve patient outcomes across medical disciplines, including diagnosis, monitoring, and predictive prognoses. The Committee encourages NIBIB to continue its engagement with external stakeholders to advance this promising project. Neurotechnology.--The Committee recognizes that recent developments in wearable devices, remote monitoring, implantable medical devices, 3-D neural constructs, and bioprinting have accelerated the rate of discovery of methods to sense and modulate the activity of the nervous system. The rate of discovery now strains the ability of academic laboratories and medical centers to perform the necessary product development and early human clinical trial work, in a timely manner, to demonstrate the efficacy of these neurotechnology interventions. New neurotechnology diagnostics and therapies could enable injury prevention in both able- bodied and at-risk populations and transform treatment of children and adults living with the chronic effects of neurological disease and injury, in particular, with impairments in mobility, cognition, pain, mood, perception, and systemic health. The Committee encourages NIBIB, in collaboration with NINDS, to prioritize additional funding to accelerate the pace of bench-to-bedside clinical development of environmental, 3-D printable, wearable, and implantable artificial and biological neurotechnology. NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON MINORITY HEALTH AND HEALTH DISPARITIES (NIMHD) Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $459,056,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 659,817,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 505,292,000 Change from enacted level......................... +46,236,000 Change from budget request........................ -154,525,000 Mission.--NIMHD's mission is to lead scientific research to improve minority health and reduce health disparities. Health Disparities Research.--The Committee includes an increase of $23,000,000 for NIMHD to support additional research related to identifying and reducing health disparities. Long COVID Research.--The Committee urges NIMHD to support research on racial and ethnic health disparities prevalent in the diagnosis, treatment, recovery, and quality of life of long COVID-19 patients. Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Alopecia.--The Committee notes the disproportionate effect of alopecia on people of color, specifically women. The Committee encourages NIMHD to collaborate with relevant Institutes and Centers, such as NIAMS, and relevant stakeholders to identify key research areas of concern. Research Centers at Minority Institutions (RCMIs).--The Committee includes no less than $89,765,000, an increase of $5,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level, for RCMIs to ensure critical infrastructure development in historically minority graduate and health professional schools. Research Grants on Cosmetic Safety, Health Disparities and Communities of Color and Professional Salon Workers.--The Committee is concerned about the prevalence of cosmetics containing dangerous levels of mercury made available through online sales and increased global travel. Evidence suggests that these harmful unregulated cosmetics, such as skin lightening creams and hair chemical relaxers, are disproportionately used by women of color. The Committee encourages NIH to support competitive research grants to fund epidemiological, social, and behavioral sciences research into the negative health impacts of chemicals in cosmetic products and to disseminate the results of these studies, including public health information strategies to reduce potentially unsafe exposure. The Committee urges NIH to support research grants investigating unsafe cosmetic chemical exposures impacting communities of color and as well as grants researching the same impacts on professional nail, hair, barbershop, and beauty salon workers. The Committee thanks NIMHD for their report submitted in September 2021 summarizing the state of science and describing NIMHD's collaboration with FDA. Research Endowment Program.--The Committee includes no less than $12,000,000 to support the Research Endowment Program, an increase of $8,000,000 above the estimated fiscal year 2022 funding level. The Committee notes the recent passage of the John Lewis NIMHD Research Endowment Revitalization Act to reinvigorate the Research Endowment Program. The Committee has provided funds to implement the revitalized program and urges NIMHD to work swiftly on its implementation. The Committee further notes that the statutory goal of the program is to assist eligible institutions in achieving a research endowment that is comparable to the mean endowment of health professions schools in its health professions discipline. The Committee requests a report no later than 60 days after enactment of this Act on implementation plans and engagement with key stakeholders. Sleep Health and Health Disparities.--The Committee applauds ongoing and emerging efforts by NIMHD to advance health equity and address health disparities, including cross- Institute initiatives and the initiatives identified by the recent Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Framework. The Committee notes the disproportionate impact of sleep deficiencies among populations that experience health disparities in the U.S., including American Indians/Alaska Natives, Asian Americans, African Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders, sexual and gender minorities, the socioeconomically disadvantaged, and those living in underserved rural areas. The Committee encourages further work in and collaboration with community stakeholders on the issue of sleep health disparities. NATIONAL CENTER FOR COMPLEMENTARY AND INTEGRATIVE HEALTH (NCCIH) Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $159,365,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 183,368,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 164,395,000 Change from enacted level......................... +5,030,000 Change from budget request........................ -18,973,000 Mission.--The mission of NCCIH is to define, through rigorous scientific investigation, the usefulness and safety of complementary and integrative health interventions and their roles in improving health and health care. NATIONAL CENTER FOR ADVANCING TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCES (NCATS) Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $882,265,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 873,654,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 901,678,000 Change from enacted level......................... +19,413,000 Change from budget request........................ +28,024,000 Mission.--NCATS was established to transform the translational process so that new treatments and cures for disease can be delivered to patients faster. Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) Program.-- The Committee includes no less than $626,059,000 for the CTSA Program, an increase of $19,413,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. The Committee reiterates that CTSA funding, including these additional resources, are intended, to the greatest extent possible, to enhance support for CTSA hubs so that they can continue to effectively provide important collaborative national research infrastructure, train the next generation of physician-scientists, and provide important local services and partnerships. The Committee applauds the CTSA program for its contributions to the rapid response to COVID- 19, efforts to address health disparities and deliver innovative care in rural areas, and to provide critical support for other national priorities and translational research activities. Cures Acceleration Network.--The Committee includes up to $60,000,000 for the Cures Acceleration Network, the same as the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. Collaboration with Business Incubators.--The Committee urges NCATS to redouble its efforts to leverage its mission by exploring opportunities or potential collaborations with business incubators that host small to mid-size science, research, and pharmaceutical companies that use service-based approaches to nurture and guide their member companies to success. Full Spectrum of Medical Research.--The Committee recognizes the emerging role that the full spectrum of medical research is playing in across NIH Institutes and Centers to ensure that advancements in basic science are translated into innovative therapies and diagnostic tools, and improved care and public health information. The Committee notes the relevance of the CTSA program to a variety on ongoing and emerging NIH research activities, including the importance of training and career development to adequately enhance the translational science workforce. National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C).--The Committee continues to support NCATS N3C's open-science platform to accelerate biomedical research and discovery. N3C is the largest public clinical repository of COVID-19 data in the U.S., enabling collaborative research between more than 3,500 researchers from over 300 institutions to answer research questions such as the cause of long COVID-19 and how COVID-19 affects children. The Committee encourages NCATS to consider expanding the platform to accelerate research and cures for other high-priority diseases such as cancer and other rare diseases. Rare Disease Research.--The Committee encourages NCATS to increase support for rare disease funding opportunities, including for the Rare Disease Clinical Research Network, the Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases program, and other grant opportunities to help increase the speed of rare disease therapeutic and diagnostic development. Accelerating rare disease research will allow society to capitalize on the evolution of science in rare diseases, leading to new treatments for the 93-95 percent of rare diseases with no approved treatments and innovative diagnostics to help shorten the average 6.3 year-long diagnostic odyssey and lower the nearly $1 trillion annual economic burden of rare diseases. JOHN E. FOGARTY INTERNATIONAL CENTER (FIC) Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $86,880,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 95,801,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 99,622,000 Change from enacted level......................... +12,742,000 Change from budget request........................ +3,821,000 Mission.--FIC's mission is to support and facilitate global health research conducted by U.S. and international investigators, building partnerships between health research institutions in the U.S. and abroad, and training the next generation of scientists to address global health needs. The Fogarty International Center supports cross-cutting research and research training programs that apply to a broad range of health threats, enabling grantees and trainees to anticipate and respond effectively to new global challenges. Fogarty programs also support training for researchers in the development and use of powerful tools such as data science, mobile health, and bioinformatics, which are applied to anticipating and controlling a wide range of global health threats that could impact the U.S. The Committee encourages FIC to continue to expand training and research partnerships with schools and programs of public health and related academic institutions in support of this core mission, including new investments to support health disparities and pandemic research preparedness and response. In light of the global impact of COVID-19, the Committee recognizes the need to continue steadily increasing the resources of FIC to support its work to strengthen health research systems, train health researchers and improve pandemic preparedness in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Over more than five decades, FIC has developed strong partnerships in LMICs to train researchers to respond to and prevent emerging and enduring infectious disease and other health threats. The COVID-19 pandemic underscores the value of FIC's efforts to strengthen research capacity in LMICs, increasing the likelihood that emerging diseases can be quickly addressed wherever they appear--ultimately protecting American health security. The Committee also recognizes that investing in health research capacity in LMICs leads to reciprocal innovation and produces tools that can drive down health care costs and increase impact and effectiveness in low-resource settings everywhere, including in the U.S. The Committee believes FIC's long-standing partnerships and unique capabilities position it to play an expanded role in pandemic preparedness and health research capacity building, including by strengthening international research coordination, building capacity for computational modeling and outbreak analytics, supporting research to reduce health disparities, and improving implementation of health interventions in low-resource settings. Health Disparities Research.--The Committee includes an increase of $10,000,000 for FIC to support additional research related to identifying and reducing health disparities, as described in the fiscal year 2023 budget request. Obstetric Fistula Research.--Worldwide, an estimated 500,000 women and girls live with obstetric fistula, with thousands more occurring annually. It occurs disproportionately among impoverished, vulnerable, and marginalized girls and women. Skilled health personnel at birth and emergency obstetric and newborn care can ensure obstetric fistula is prevented. The Committee is concerned that fistula repairs were widely halted due to COVID-19, as they were deemed non-urgent and unsafe during the pandemic. This may result in an increased backlog of fistula cases. The Committee is concerned that not enough funding is provided to support existing academic curricula for the education and training for health care providers on obstetric fistula. The Committee requests a report regarding the annual support level for this training funding over the past five years, including the types of grants supported, in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Justification. NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE (NLM) Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $479,439,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 471,998,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 494,572,000 Change from enacted level......................... +15,133,000 Change from budget request........................ +22,574,000 Mission.--As a leader in computational health and the world's largest medical library, NLM collects, organizes, preserves, and disseminates data and information important to biomedicine and health; serves as a national information resource for medical education, research, and health service activities; enhances access to biomedical literature through electronic services; serves the public by providing electronic access to reliable health information for consumers; supports and directs the Network of the National Library of Medicine; provides grants for research in biomedical communications, medical library development, and training health information specialists; conducts and supports research and research training in biomedical informatics, computational health, computational biology, and data science; supports development, maintenance, and dissemination of health data standards that promote interoperability among clinical and research information systems; and manages and maintains information resources for genomics, molecular biology, clinical trials, medical images, environmental health, public health, and health services research. OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR (OD) Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $2,629,120,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 2,314,665,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 2,549,813,000 Change from enacted level......................... -79,307,000 Change from budget request........................ +235,148,000 The Committee recommendation includes $2,537,213,000 in discretionary appropriations and an additional $12,600,000 made available in the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act. Mission.--The OD provides leadership to the NIH research enterprise and coordinates and directs initiatives that crosscut NIH. OD is responsible for the development and management of intramural and extramural research and research training policy, the review of program quality and effectiveness, the coordination of selected NIH-wide program activities, and the administration of centralized support activities essential to the operations of NIH. The items below include issues and programs specific to the Office of the Director as well as those that involve multiple Institutes and Centers. Adoption of Dogs, Cats, and Rabbits Used in Research.--The Committee encourages NIH to recommend that grantees receiving extramural funds from NIH for research using dogs, cats, or rabbits implement post-research adoption policies for those animals and to maintain records on the aggregate number of animals released for adoption. The post-research adoption policies and animal release numbers should be made publicly available. Advancing Cell-Based Therapies.--The Committee recognizes that cell-based therapies hold promise for a broad range of conditions, including neurological conditions, musculoskeletal conditions, cancer, radiation damage, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, wound healing, and immunological disease. The Committee encourages NIH to support research, development, and manufacturing of adult cell-based therapies for patients with serious or life-threatening conditions. The Committee encourages NIH to support clinical trials and pre-clinical research exploring the use of adult cell-based therapies for serious or life-threatening conditions; support development, characterization, optimization, and scaling of manufacturing of cell-based therapies; support sharing of best practices and lessons learned; workforce development activities; and collaborative evidence development, including continued NIH collaboration with FDA and HRSA to enhance transparency regarding outcomes from cellular therapies from adult (somatic) cells that are FDA-approved or being administered under FDA Investigational New Drug or Investigational Device Exemption protocols by ensuring that results are submitted to appropriate databases such as the Stem Cell Therapeutics Outcomes Database and ClinicalTrials.gov. All of Us Research Program.--The Committee provides a total of $541,000,000 for the All of Us Research Program Precision Medicine Initiative, the same as the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the fiscal year 2023 budget request. The total includes $419,000,000 authorized in the Cures Act to be transferred from the NIH Innovation Account. All of Us' mission is to accelerate health research and medical breakthroughs to enable individualized prevention, treatment, and care for all of us. As of the beginning of June 2022, the All of Us Research Program enrolled 497,000 participants, more than 341,000 of whom have completed the initial steps of the program. About 80 percent of these individuals are from populations that have largely been overlooked in past research, including rural communities, people with lower incomes, those who self-identify as belonging to racial or and ethnic minority groups, and others. In March 2022, the program released nearly 100,000 whole genome sequences and data from 165,000 genotyping arrays in its Researcher Workbench for the research community to analyze. This data can be used in concert with the robust information the program's participants have previously donated, including responses to surveys and electronic health records. Nearly half of the genomic information comes from people who identify with a racial or ethnic minority group, making the dataset one of the most diverse in the world. To date, more than 90 percent of participants in genome-wide association studies worldwide have been of European descent. All of Us' efforts to recruit and retain participants that have been historically underrepresented in research is imperative to ensure that future discoveries benefit all. ALS Research, Treatments, and Expanded Access.--The Committee believes it is critically important that NIH continues to grow its investment in ALS research to capitalize on the momentum to find new treatments for ALS and a cure for the disease. The Committee recognizes that each year, only a small portion of research funds are spent on new research projects. The Committee strongly urges NIH to maintain the ALS drug ecosystem with additional grant funding for extramural research through NINDS. In addition, The Committee urges NIH to continue to increase support and momentum for ALS research that can lead to new treatments and better care as quickly as possible, as well as support expanded access research for ALS investigational drugs. In addition, the Committee urges NIH to handle funding of expanded access grants as authorized in the ACT for ALS (P.L. 117-79) as separate, and not competing with, funding for other research on ALS and includes $75,000,000 for this purpose, an increase of $50,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. Amyloidosis.--The Committee strongly encourages NIH to expand its research efforts in amyloidosis, a group of rare diseases characterized by abnormally folded protein deposits in tissues. Although amyloidosis is often fatal, Federal and foundation support over the past years has given hope for successful new treatments. More efforts are needed to accelerate research and awareness of the disease and to help patients with amyloidosis related multi-organ dysfunction. The Committee also directs NIH to provide an update in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Justification on the steps NIH has taken to expand research into the causes of amyloidosis and the measures taken to improve the diagnosis and treatment of this devastating group of diseases. Artificial Intelligence to Address Chronic Diseases.--The Committee supports NIH's efforts to use artificial intelligence (AI) to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying causes of chronic diseases, including health disparities, and to identify successful early treatments. The Committee provides sufficient resources to support NIH efforts to employ advanced technologies such as AI, machine learning, deep learning, and related approaches to enhance the collection, integration, analyses, and interpretation of data related to the onset, progression, and treatment of chronic diseases. Autoimmune Diseases.--The Committee recognizes that a recent report by NASEM recommends that NIH establish an office to support the coordination of all autoimmune diseases research across Institutes and Centers. The Committee encourages NIH to implement this recommendation, and additionally urges NIH to develop clear, consistent, and uniform guidance around autoimmunity, including a shared, working definition applicable to autoimmune disease research and how these efforts should be worked into the broader policies. The Committee also encourages NIH to establish long-term systems in determining numbers of autoimmune patients and mortality rates in the U.S. comparable to NCI's SEER database, support the development of population cohorts of the progression and coexisting morbidities, and provide funding and support for a national research agenda that addresses critical gaps. The Committee encourages NIH to work with health partners and relevant patient organizations to ensure a bidirectional relationship is developed between the agency and the autoimmune community that includes a more consistent approach to communicating new or updated guidance pertinent to the community, and that creates a foundation for improving the quality of lives for patients of autoimmune diseases. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).--Recent reports indicate that an estimated one in 44 children in the U.S. is diagnosed with an ASD. While early intervention affords the best opportunity to support healthy development, many children with an autism diagnosis lack access to quality care and interventions. The Committee is encouraged by the growing evidence that caregiver-mediated early intervention can lead to improved child developmental outcomes, improved caregiver- reported skills and knowledge, and reduced stress. The Committee encourages NIH to invest in implementation-focused research that targets caregiver-mediated interventions, including caregiver skills training and naturalistic developmental behavioral interventions. The Committee strongly encourages NIH to work collaboratively across Institutes and Centers in this effort to ensure culturally competent approaches. Furthermore, the Committee is supportive of the research recommendations included in the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee's (IACC) Strategic Plan for ASD. The Committee urges the NIH to provide an update on its investment across the priority areas outlined in the IACC Strategic Plan in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Justification. Biomedical Research Facilities.--The Committee includes $60,000,000, the same as the fiscal year 2022 enacted level, for grants to public and/or nonprofit entities to expand, remodel, renovate, or alter existing research facilities or construct new research facilities as authorized under 42 U.S.C. section 283k. The Committee urges NIH to make awards to support a significant number of newly constructed or renovated facilities. Biomedical Research Workforce Diversity.--The Committee is concerned with the impact of COVID-19 on the diversity of the biomedical research workforce, particularly women and women of color across career stages. The Committee strongly encourages NIH to study the race/ethnicity and sex/gender breakdown of the impact of COVID on participation in the workforce by monitoring the sex/gender and race/ethnicity of principal investigators designated on applications from and awards to institutions for two years. If the data demonstrate that fewer women are designated on applications from institutions for grants, then it is imperative that NIH take steps to address this disparity. The Committee requests a status update in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Justification as well as a description of the steps being taken to maintain and strengthen the diversity of the biomedical research workforce. Black Men and Women Pursuing Medicine and Science.--The Committee supports the efforts of the National Academies Roundtable on Black Men and Black Women in Science, Engineering, and Medicine and its efforts to develop specific programs to increase numbers and effectiveness of Black men and women pursuing medicine and science and commends NIH for participating. The Committee directs the Immediate Office of the Director to allocate increased resources from the Common Fund of the diversity program consortium to the National Academies Roundtable on Black Men and Black Women in Science, Engineering, and Medicine to address the increasing underrepresentation of Black men in medical schools and in the biomedical research profession. Cannabis Research.--The Committee recognizes that although concrete steps have been taken towards ameliorating the regulatory and supply issues hampering cannabis research in the U.S., funding levels have not kept pace with widespread use of cannabis and substantial clinical interest in the field. Cannabis is fully legal in 18 States and the District of Columbia, effectively so in 20 others that permit some form of medical marijuana, and consumed by nearly half of American teens and adults at some time in their lives, yet there is surprisingly little information about its effects on body chemistry and cognition. The Committee is concerned that marijuana policies on the Federal level and in the States (medical marijuana, recreational use, etc.) are being changed without the benefit of scientific research to help guide those decisions. While there are FDA-approved prescription medications that contain cannabidiol or THC which are used to treat various conditions such as certain seizure disorders and nausea associated with chemotherapy, research is needed to determine if cannabis or cannabis products could effectively treat chronic pain, certain mental illnesses, opioid use disorder or other substance use disorders, among other conditions. Therefore, the Committee encourages NIH to fund cannabis research to study efficacy of cannabinoid therapies for patients. NIH is encouraged to continue supporting a full range of research on the health effects of marijuana and its components, including research to understand how marijuana policies affect public health. Childhood Post-Infectious Neuroimmune Disorders/PANS/ PANDAS.--The Committee strongly encourages NIH to advance research and education related to the devastating diseases of Pediatric Acute-Onset Neuropsychiatric Syndromes (PANS) and Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcus (PANDAS). Although NIH has undertaken some research in this area, more research is necessary to fully understand causes, diagnosis, and treatment. Training the medical community is essential to early identification and intervention, reducing the risk of chronic illness and associated costs to families, school systems, health care systems, and insurers. The association between neuropsychiatric illness and infections has become even more evident because of SARS-CoV-2 and provides increasing opportunities for breakthroughs in research and treatment. The Committee encourages NIH to prioritize research in this area, and report to the Committee in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Justification on the progress being made on the understanding of the costs, causes, diagnostic criteria, and treatment of these conditions. Clinical Trial Diversity.--The Committee recognizes NIH's efforts to increase meaningful participation across the lifespan of ethnic and racial minority populations and underrepresented communities in clinical trials. The Committee encourages NIH to continue improving clinical research diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility by engaging in proactive outreach efforts to people including women and racial and ethnic minority groups, underrepresented communities, and health care organizations serving these populations, to improve awareness of clinical research, including trials, and understanding of how people can participate. The Committee requests an update on these activities in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Justification. Collection and Reporting of Animal Research Numbers and Agency Funding.--Congress has long expressed interest in reducing the use of animals in NIH-funded research and replacing them with valid, reliable alternatives. In the NIH Revitalization Act of 1993, Congress first requested the agency create a plan for doing so. The Committee also recognizes the scientific community's stated commitment to the three Rs of replacement, reduction, and refinement, which requires accurate counting of animals used in research and accurate reporting of NIH funding dedicated to projects involving animals. It has been NIH's policy since 1985 to collect an average daily inventory of vertebrate animals housed in recipient institutions that receive agency funding. Domestic facilities are required to file such documentation every four years as part of an Animal Welfare Assurance and copies of the documents are available to the public only through FOIA requests. The Committee directs that the report requested in the Joint Explanatory Statement for the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022 outlining a plan to improve the accuracy and transparency of collected data, also include how the agency plans to annually collect from each NIH funded research facility the total number of animals bred, housed, and used in the previous year, sorted by species and pain and distress categories. The Committee directs NIH to include a draft form for collecting this information, and details on how the agency will create a publicly accessible online database for dissemination of this new information. NIH currently collects such information with every grant application using the Research & Related Other Project Information form. NIH's plan should ensure that the answers for each funded project are publicly searchable via the Expenditures and Results module of NIH's Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools website. Common Data Elements.--The Committee recognizes the increasing importance of common data elements (CDEs) that enable standardized and consistent use of data in research, especially translational and clinical research, and that facilitate efforts to replicate and validate findings, including clinical trials, for a disease area. NIH encourages use of CDEs including use of the NIH's CDE repository. To encourage development and use of CDEs in disease areas where they currently do not exist, the Committee directs the Office of Data Science Strategy to work with Institutes and Centers to support efforts to develop CDEs, including through collaborations with research stakeholders. The Committee also directs NIH to develop a list of diseases and diseases areas that stand to benefit most from development of CDEs, including complex diseases with heterogeneous presentations, such as autoimmune and immune-mediated conditions, to inform further NIH efforts to support development of such elements. Common Fund.--The Committee recommends $678,151,000 for the Common Fund, and an additional $12,600,000 provided to support the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act for the ninth year of the ten-year Pediatric Research Initiative. This is $20,750,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and $32,212,000 above the fiscal year 2023 budget request. Communications with the Committee.--The Committee relies on its relationships with agency budget offices to do its work. The Committee expects the NIH Office of Budget to improve the quality and timeliness of the information that it provides to the Committee. Cybersecurity.--The Committee continues to support expanded cybersecurity efforts at NIH, including enhanced Security Operations Center functions, expanded threat mitigation and incident response capabilities, implementation of important architectural improvements to the NIH network, and implementation of tools and technologies to identify patterns of activities that may forecast security risks and allow real time monitoring of activity across a variety of sources as well as implementation of mitigation and remediation efforts. Diabetic Neuropathy.--Diabetic neuropathy is the most common complication of diabetes, affecting at least 50 percent of individuals with diabetes and resulting in numbness, unsteadiness, and chronic pain. Additionally, the annual cost of managing complications from diabetic neuropathy in the U.S. is estimated to be more than $10 billion. Despite its high incidence rate and major impact on quality of life for affected patients, there are limited treatment options available, and available options are not effective for all individuals with diabetic neuropathy. The Committee encourages NIH to fund collaborative research awards for diabetic neuropathy research and treatment. The Committee also encourages NIH to fund additional research on diabetic neuropathy-induced chronic pain through existing programs such as the HEAL Initiative. Diet and Chronic Diseases.--The Committee is aware of ongoing efforts to better understand the impact of diet on mucosal immunity and the microbiome and the relevance of this topic to multiple immune-related conditions including Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, allergies, celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis, metabolic syndrome, and obesity. The Committee encourages NIH to identify gaps and research needs and to encourage research focused on this topic. Diversifying Research on Health and Wellbeing to include Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders.--The Committee notes that in the last decade, less than one percent of the NIH's total budget went to research centered on Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AANHPI) health outcomes. The lack of data available on AANHPIs, or the failure to disaggregate from this group, has resulted in misleading narratives and conclusions made from the lack of available research. The Committee encourages NIH to support research on the health and wellbeing of AA and NHPI communities, including specific AA and NHPI subgroups. In addition to the expansion of research, the Committee encourages NIH to support in-language and culturally competent recruitment, outreach, education, and testing materials to ensure outcomes are representative of diverse AANHPI populations. The Committee directs NIH to provide a report to the Committee within one year of enactment of this Act describing research projects targeted to AA and NHPI communities, as well as participation barriers, including language access. Diversity in NIH Kidney Disease Research Populations.--The Committee recognizes NIH's commitment to understanding, evaluating, and resolving racial and ethnic disparities in health outcomes and adverse social determinants of health for individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end stage renal disease. The Committee directs NIH to submit to the Committee an update in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Justification on NIH research related to kidney disease, including research focusing on health disparities in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of kidney disease among racial and ethnic minority populations. Early-Career Pediatric Researchers.--The Committee remains concerned about the ongoing challenges in developing the next generation of researchers--including physician scientists-- focusing their careers in pediatrics. Challenges to the pediatric research workforce include declining numbers of graduating medical students choosing to enter the field of pediatrics, declining numbers of pediatric residents choosing to enter most pediatric subspecialties, lower transition rates from early-career to full awards, increased clinical demands, and limited mentorship opportunities compared to other fields. If unaddressed, a contraction of the pediatric researcher pipeline will result in both limited breakthroughs in child health research and to diminished understanding of adult-onset conditions given the growing body of research that many such conditions have their roots in childhood. To begin addressing this problem, the Committee encourages NIH, through the Trans- NIH Pediatric Research Consortium (N-PeRC), to explore programs for NIH-wide early career development focused on early-career researchers in the field of pediatrics and encourages NIH to include efforts to recruit researchers from diverse backgrounds, including those that are from groups underrepresented in the biomedical research workforce. The Committee requests an update on progress in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Justification. Early-Career Researchers.--The Committee notes that the mean age of a first R01 award has continued to increase over the past 25 years. Accordingly, the Committee directs NIH to examine existing efforts to expand early career research, including the Next Generation Researchers Initiative, and provide an update in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Justification. The Committee requests that NIH consider additional actions, including larger payline differentials for new or early-stage investigator applications, to further prioritize early career research. Eating Disorders.--The Committee commends NIH for supporting multi-Institute research on the chronic, fatal, and serious mental illnesses encompassing eating disorders that impact nearly 30,000,000 Americans during their lifetimes, and their association with other conditions such as co-morbid mental illnesses, substance use disorder, and metabolic, cardiovascular, neurological, and reproductive disturbances. The Committee encourages NIH to increase resources for eating disorders research and directs NIMH, NIMHD, NICHD, and NIDA to provide the Committee with an update within 180 days of enactment of this Act on research gaps in the genetics, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of eating disorders. Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.--The Committee encourages NIH to support research activities with respect to Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome and related connective tissue disorders. Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO).-- The Committee includes $180,000,000, the same as the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the fiscal year 2023 budget request, for the ECHO Project, which has the potential to greatly increase understanding of critical determinants of health across the lifespan, through its observational cohorts and the IDeA States Pediatric Clinical Trials Network. The Committee encourages continued communication about to the program's progress toward goals, milestones, and projected funding estimates with both external stakeholders and Congress. Faculty Institutional Recruitment for Sustainable Transformation (FIRST) Program.--The Committee applauds NIH for its continuous efforts to diversify the biomedical workforce and is encouraged by the recent FIRST program that was established to create a more inclusive and diverse biomedical research workforce through cluster hiring and institutional culture shifts. To build on these investments, the Committee directs NIH to provide increased and robust funding to the NIH Common Fund for the continuation of the FIRST program. Federal Advisory Committees Transparency Initiative.--The Committee continues to focus on improving transparency for Federal advisory committees established pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 282(b)(16). The Committee appreciates that NIH ensures all its Federal advisory committees operate in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended (5 U.S.C., Appendix 2), including the Literature Selection Technical Review Committee (LSTRC). The Committee appreciates the steps NIH has taken to further enhance the transparency of MEDLINE processes through via its centralized MEDLINE website. The Committee encourages NIH to continue its commitment to ensure all its committees, including the LSTRC, operate in a transparent manner in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Firearm Injury and Mortality Prevention Research.--The Committee includes $25,000,000 to support research on the prevention of firearm violence, $12,500,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2023 budget request. The Committee also directs NIH to collaborate with the National Institute of Justice to compile, share, and improve firearm violence data. Such data must include the Uniform Crime Report (UCR) and include data from hospitals treating victims of nonfatal gunshot wounds. Foreign Threats to Research.--Foreign government actors continue to have an interest in engaging in the theft of intellectual property from NIH and its funding recipients, posing risks to the integrity of NIH-supported research, fair competition, and the public's trust in resulting outcomes. The Committee directs NIH to provide biannual briefings on the progress of investigations into these efforts, as well as the institutions, scientists, and research affected. The Committee continues to direct NIH to transfer $5,000,000 to the Inspector General to continue additional investigations into this issue. Foundations of Evidence-Based Policymaking Act and OPEN Government Data Act.--The Foundations of Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-435) and the OPEN Government Data Act, which was enacted as part of P.L. 115-435 can aid in the discovery and sharing of publicly-funded biomedical research and public health data. The Committee requests a report no later than 120 days after enactment of this Act on the implementation and progress being made across NIH to comply with this legislation by ensuring that all non-sensitive government data be made available in open and machine-readable formats by default. Fragile X.--The Committee notes the importance of expanding the base of researchers and clinicians who are familiar with and trained in the fragile X-associated disorders and promoting collaboration between basic scientists and clinicians to enable researchers to better understand phenotypes, document variations in how the disorder presents itself, identify potential biomarkers and outcome measures, and develop new interventions. The Committee also commends NIH for recognizing the ethical, legal, and social issues in premutation screening and testing and encourages NIH to consider at existing pilot studies that are looking at innovative ways to screen newborns, and to coordinate efforts with CDC as they consider at screening solutions for FMR1-related conditions. Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program.-- The Committee recognizes that pediatric cancer and birth defects are a leading cause of death among children and are still poorly understood. Childhood cancer also has lasting negative health effects on children who do survive due to the high levels of toxicity associated with treatment. The Committee acknowledges that the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Program enables researchers to uncover new insights into the biology of childhood cancer and birth defects. Since its inception, Kids First has initiated the Gabriella Miller Kids First Data Resource Center, which is a comprehensive data resource for research and patient communities meant to advance discoveries. The Committee recognizes the progress that the Program has made towards understanding childhood cancer and birth defects and provides $12,600,000 to support pediatric research as authorized by the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act (P.L. 113-94). The funding provided helps lay the foundation for expanded research in future years. Gene-Environment Interactions in Neurodegenerative Disorders in the Diverse Populations of Black/African Americans and Hispanics/Latinos.--In the context of NIH's robust neurological disease research portfolio, the Committee commends the leadership of NIH in advancing the relevant objectives of the Cures Act and the BRAIN Initiative. The Committee is concerned and recognizes the need to better understand the interactions between genetics and environmental factors, in particular with older and diverse populations of Black/African Americans and Hispanics/Latinos. The Committee encourages NIH to accelerate collaborative research across relevant Institutes and Centers and the research community to better understand structural level and intermediary levels of the social determinants of health, namely those that may potentially identify the interaction between environmental exposures to toxic chemicals and genetics and their impact on neurodegenerative disorders in diverse populations of Black/ African Americans and Hispanics/Latinos, to allow for earlier and more accurate diagnosis and subsequent treatment to arrest the progression of these devastating neurodegenerative disorders. Geroscience.--The Committee applauds NIH for recognizing the importance of geroscience to a wide range of chronic conditions and diseases by creating the Cellular Senescence Network (SenNet), an effort to identify and characterize the differences in senescent cells across the body, within the Common Fund. While NIA serves as the lead Institute for geroscience, programs such as SenNet demonstrate how all Institutes and Centers benefit from a greater understanding of this field, given the wide range of chronic conditions and diseases that are influenced by the biology of aging. To date, however, NIH has not analyzed which topics in geroscience are currently being addressed across the Institutes and Centers or how much funding the Institutes and Centers are using to support this research. The lack of this information limits NIH's ability to address research gaps in a strategic way. Therefore, the Committee encourages NIH to submit a report within 180 days of enactment of this Act that describes current NIH research focused on geroscience and future plans in this area. The Committee would also welcome exploration of a trans- NIH initiative. Such an initiative might include increased funding for basic, translational, and clinical research, research infrastructure, workforce development, the development of platform technologies for geroscience, and collaboration with the FDA, industry, and academia on the discovery and validation of biomarkers. HEALthy Brain and Child Development (HBCD) Study.--The Committee recognizes and supports the NIH HEALthy Brain and Child Development Study, which will establish a large cohort of pregnant individuals and follow them and their children up to age 10 to characterize the influence of a variety of factors on neurodevelopment and long-term outcomes. The study aims to enroll approximately 7,500 pregnant individuals through 25 research sites across the U.S., including regions of the country significantly affected by the opioid crisis. The study cohort will comprise participants that reflect the U.S. population but will oversample for individuals that have used substances sometime during their pregnancy and a matching cohort with similar characteristics, but no substance exposure during the pregnancy. Multimodal data collection will include neuroimaging, behavioral and cognitive assessments as well as collection of biospecimens and brain activity measurements. Knowledge gained will be critical to help predict and prevent some of the known impacts of pre- and postnatal exposure to drugs and environmental influences, including risk for future illicit substance use, mental disorders, and other behavioral and developmental problems as well as identify factors that contribute to resilience and opportunities for intervention. The Committee recognizes that the HBCD Study is supported in part by the NIH HEAL Initiative, and NIH Institutes, Centers, and Offices, including encourages additional NIH support for this important study. Hearing Health Screening for Older Adults.--The Committee recognizes the associated comorbidities and costs of untreated hearing loss and, with the growing aging population, the importance of hearing screening for older Americans. The Committee urges NIH to provide an update in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Justification on hearing screening research for older adults across NIH. The Committee encourages NIDCD and NIA to support studies that address the research needs and gaps identified by the USPSTF in their review of hearing screening recommendations for older Americans. Hepatitis B (HBV).--The Committee applauds NIH for its work to update the Strategic Plan for Trans-NIH Research to Cure Hepatitis B and urges that the update identify what has been learned since the plan was first released and what additional research is needed to find a cure. The Committee is aware of strong interest in more research to understand and manage HBV reactivation and research to understand and develop biomarkers of disease and therefore recommends these research ideas be evaluated and supported. The Committee is also aware of the view within the scientific community that finding a cure for HBV is a winnable goal and is within reach in the near-term and therefore remains concerned that the slow growth in NIH-funded HBV research could compromise the goal of finding a cure. For these reasons, the Committee applauds efforts to create common resource services and materials for the research community and further urges that targeted calls for research, based on the needs as identified in the updated Plan, be issued and funded in fiscal year 2023 and beyond. Herpes Simplex Virus, Types 1 and 2.--The Committee recognizes the serious nature of herpes simplex virus, a neuropathic infectious disease which impacts nearly one in two Americans, and the critical need for Federal investment in treatment and prevention. The Committee is concerned with potential health, quality of life, and economic impacts for herpes simplex virus seropositive individuals, as well as the risk for severe, persistent disease in a significant portion of Americans. The Committee directs NIH to prioritize research and development of curative approaches to herpes simplex virus, with a specific focus on research projects with commercial viability and intention of bringing new HSV treatments to market. The Committee understands that herpes simplex virus is a pathogen with considerations beyond a single NIH Institute or Center and directs NIH to assemble a multi-council working group to ensure a coordinated and focused effort across NIH. Institutes and Centers may include, but are not limited to: NIAID, NIMH, NCI, NIA, NIMHD and NINDS. This working group will assemble a review of NIH efforts in herpes simplex virus treatment and prevention with commercial viability, outline gaps and/or misconceptions in currently available research, and outline future priority areas for new clinical research, with a focus on addressing Americans holistic health and well-being. The multi-council working group will also provide a funding analysis to illustrate NIH priorities, gaps, and opportunities in clinical research of HSV treatment to date. HIV/AIDS Research.--The Committee includes no less than $3,394,283,000 for HIV/AIDS research, an increase of $200,000,000 above the estimated fiscal year 2022 level. While great advancements have been made in HIV prevention, care, and treatment over the last 30 years, more must be done to improve the lives of the more than one million Americans with HIV, especially with over 36,000 new diagnoses in the U.S. in 2019 alone. The targeted HIV/AIDS research funding at NIH is needed to improve diagnosis, linkage to, and retention in care for persons with HIV; prevent at-risk populations from HIV acquisition and transmission; develop more effective treatments and evidence-based interventions; and ultimately discover a cure for HIV. HIV and Aging.--The Committee encourages the NIH Office of AIDS Research to fund interdisciplinary research and training programs in HIV and aging to increase understanding of HIV across the lifespan and to expand the diverse HIV workforce that addresses the unique health needs of this population. Humane Research Alternatives.--Recognizing that humane, cost-effective, and scientifically suitable non-animal methods are available for certain research models but underutilized, the Committee directs NIH to establish incentives to encourage investigators to utilize non-animal methods whenever appropriate for the research question and establish standardized guidelines for peer review evaluation of the justification for research with animals. Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.--Hypermobile Ehlers- Danlos Syndrome (hEDS) connective tissue disorder that attacks connective tissues in nearly every organ System. Data from the NIH All of Us research program shows hEDS has a disease prevalence of approximately one in 300. This chronic condition initiates during adolescence or earlier and disproportionately affects females (90 percent versus 10 percent male). Patients with hEDS progress from a normal, active lifestyle to one filled with surgeries and, in severe cases, to becoming wheelchair bound. hEDS takes an average of 14 years to diagnose, partially due to the lack of a clear genetic marker and very little clinical and research attention to date. Patients suffering from hEDS are typically young girls, who undergo an average of six surgeries before reaching the age of 25. The Committee is aware that researchers recently identified the first disease gene for hEDS and have developed the first hEDS animal model. In order to continue strides forward and expedite translational discoveries of cures, treatments and diagnosis, the Committee encourages NIH to increase support for hEDS related research at academic medical centers where hEDS patients are being treated. This investment could help lead to diagnostic markers of disease and provide the basis for long- term sustainable research programs. In addition, the Committee encourages NIH to evaluate the best approach to establishing multi-institution centers that can serve as regional institutes to spur earlier diagnosis and improved treatment, care, education and mechanistic understanding of hEDS. INCLUDE Down Syndrome Research Initiative.--The Committee includes no less than $90,000,000, an increase of $15,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level, within OD for the INCLUDE Initiative. The Committee is pleased that this multi- year, trans-NIH research initiative continues to drive important advances in understanding immune system dysregulation, Alzheimer's disease, and leukemia that is contributing to improvements in the health outcomes and quality of life of individuals with Down syndrome as well as millions of typical individuals. The Committee continues to encourage NIH to make further investments in health equity-focused research and care including for African Americans with Down syndrome, mosaic Down syndrome, those with the dual diagnosis of Down syndrome and autism or regression, with additional attention to neurodevelopment, metabolism, large cohort studies across the lifespan, and novel clinical trials. The Committee requests that NIH provide an updated plan within 60 days of enactment of this Act that includes a timeline and description of potential grant opportunities and deadlines for all expected funding opportunities so that young investigators and new research institutions may be further encouraged to explore research in this space. This plan should also incorporate and increase pipeline research initiatives specific to Down syndrome. Infection-Associated Illnesses.--The Committee recognizes the scientific and clinical opportunities in infection- associated illnesses research and strongly encourages NIH to continue and expand its efforts to understand the underlying causes and risk factors for individuals with long COVID and ME/ CFS, with a focus on diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. The Committee encourages NIH to support multidisciplinary efforts related to expanding existing long COVID research efforts to include study participants with ME/CFS and other overlapping infection-associated illnesses. Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM).--The Committee is aware that the Government Accountability Office recommended that NIEHS (1) facilitate the establishment of a workgroup of ICCVAM member agencies to develop metrics that member agencies could use to assess the progress made toward reducing, refining, or replacing animal use in testing and (2) incorporate those metrics into the committee's biennial progress reports. The Committee urges ICCVAM to provide an update on progress made, including publication of the Biennial Report with information individual agency metrics. Long COVID.--The Committee is concerned about the prevalence of long COVID in patients who have previously been diagnosed with COVID-19. Many people suffering with symptoms consistent with long COVID have been reduced to part-time work or are unable to work at all. While there are no therapeutics currently on the market for this condition, there are current FDA-approved services being used to treat long-term vascular disease which may also show promise in reducing long COVID symptoms. The Committee urges NIH to conduct clinical trials which seek to improve long COVID-related clinical markers and outcomes, with a specific focus on improvement of symptoms that can lead to full resumption of daily activities and return to work. The Committee also strongly encourages the Secretary to increase access to treatments of vascular disease that could also treat symptoms associated with long COVID. The agency is directed to prioritize access to such treatments in areas with higher prevalence of patients with heart disease. Lyme and Other Tick-Borne Diseases.--The Committee encourages NIH to hold a public workshop on the molecular mechanisms that Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) employs to evade the human immune system, the human immune responses and consequences of Bb infection, and how these mechanisms and responses may influence the effectiveness of antibiotics. The Committee recognizes that there have been only a small number of clinical trials involving Lyme disease, which lacks a gold standard test, and that those trials have involved a relatively small number of patients. Because of the clear neurological dysfunction of Lyme disease and the existence of the Network for Excellence in Neuroscience Clinical Trials (NeuroNEXT), the Committee encourages NINDS to evaluate how it may contribute to improvements in tools to manage Lyme disease. The Committee asks NIH to consider the value of establishing a work group on long-term, not well understood outcomes for different diseases with similar long-term sequelae, particularly SARS-CoV-2 infection and Lyme disease, taking into account the input of patients not fully recovered from these infections and who offer experiences and insights, such as called for in RECOVER. Finally, the Committee encourages NIH to intensify research on adverse outcomes related to Lyme disease during pregnancy and to continue to participate with Lyme advocacy organizations on these issues. Maintenance of Chimpanzees on US Air Force Bases.--When Congress passed the CHIMP Act, it intended for all chimpanzees owned by NIH to be retired to a sanctuary. Despite this, in 2019 NIH announced 44 chimpanzees housed at the Alamogordo Primate Facility (APF) and in 2021 announced that another 51 chimpanzees from the Keeling Center for Comparative Medicine and Research (KCCMR) would not be transferred to Chimp Haven, the national sanctuary. The Committee has previously noted in its fiscal year 2022 report that the chimpanzees must be provided an opportunity to live the remainder of their lives in the national sanctuary. As such, the Committee strongly urges NIH to reevaluate the remaining animals at APF, KCCMR and the Southwest National Primate Research Center (SNPRC) and assess options for their transport to the national sanctuary. The Committee also directs NIH to provide a written report to the Committee each quarter, beginning no later than January 31, 2023 that shall include: (1) the number of chimpanzees transported to the national sanctuary over the last quarter; (2) a census of all government-owned and supported chimpanzees remaining, if any, at APF, KCCMR or SNPRC and results of any reevaluations of their health; and (3) a list of any chimpanzee deaths that have occurred at any time after January 1, 2022 at APF, KCCMR or SNPRC. Maternal Health Research.--Research is critically important to optimizing the health of women and their families in the U.S. and identifying the causes behind pregnancy-related deaths and complications. The vast majority of research in pregnancy in the U.S. is supported by NIH. Each Institute and Center supports at least one grant or project related to pregnancy- related research, with NICHD consistently providing the greatest support of perinatal research in the U.S. NICHD's work includes the Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units Network (MFMU), a network of centers across the country that conduct clinical studies to improve maternal, fetal, and neonatal health. NICHD is also working to advance safe and effective therapies for pregnant and lactating women as recommended in the report released in 2018 by the Federal Task Force on Research Specific to Pregnant Women and Lactating Women (authorized under P.L. 114-255) and the implementation plan released in 2020. NICHD funding also supports research to address gaps in our understanding of the best way to support pregnant and postpartum women with a substance use disorder. Strengthened, prioritized support for maternal health research at the NIH is crucial to fully understanding the health inequities and disparities in outcomes that the U.S. is facing. Menopause.--The Committee is concerned about the lack of an RCDC category for menopause, which limits the ability to analyze current and future biomedical research being done on menopause and its short- and long-term effects on the health of women. As menopause is a female-specific condition and an important component of understanding women's health across the lifespan, it is critical that NIH report on and be able to track the intramural and extramural research supported by NIH. The Committee requests that NIH create a RCDC category for the menopausal transition and its related health conditions. Microbicides.--The Committee recognizes that with NIH and USAID leadership, research has shown the potential for antiretroviral (ARV) drugs to prevent HIV infection in women. The Committee encourages NIH to continue coordination with USAID, the State Department, and others to advance ARV-based microbicide development efforts with the goal of enabling regulatory approvals and product access of safe and effective microbicides for women. Mitochondrial Disease Research.--The Committee urges NIH to increase its support for primary mitochondrial disease research and to prioritize the development of potentially life-saving therapeutics. The Committee strongly encourages NIH to consider funding at least one mitochondrial disease center of excellence to centralize a critical mass of research, clinical care, and provider education. The Committee encourages NIH to consider supporting research on the role of mitochondrial function in long COVID. Mucopolysaccharidoses and Mucolipidosis (MPS/ML).--The Committee recognizes the severity of MPS/ML diseases and encourages NIH to support additional research in order to improve life expectancy and quality of life for patients. National Laboratories.--NIH funding supports investments which are collaborative with the ongoing work of the Department of Energy (DOE). The Committee directs NIH to update the Committee on the work to coordinate its efforts with DOE and the National Laboratories, and in more strategic ways to leverage NIH's research needs in the next generation of cancer research, brain mapping, drug development, or other emerging ideas in biomedical research that requires DOE's instrumentation, materials, modeling simulation, and data science. In 2015, the Secretary of Energy established the Energy Advisory Board (SEAB) to evaluate the prospects for increased collaboration between DOE researchers and biomedical scientists supported by other agencies, especially NIH. Increased and more effective coordination could be instrumental to assist in the development of the Nation's health, security, novel biomedical technologies, and in the development of more strategic enabling technologies. The Committee supports NIH's collaboration with DOE and the National Laboratories in an effort to maximize utilization of DOE's capabilities, particularly for NIH's rapidly growing data and computational challenges, and encourages NCI to build off the success of previous initiatives and consider additional pilots to address key computation and imaging bottlenecks in cancer research. The Committee requests an update within 120 days of enactment of this Act on its ongoing collaborations with DOE and opportunities for continued partnership growth. Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander Health Research.--The Committee encourages NIH to place a high priority on addressing Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (NHPI) health disparities as well as supporting the career pathways and research of NHPI investigators. NIMHD, working with other Institutes and Centers, is encouraged to develop partnerships with academic institutions with a proven track record of working closely with NHPI communities and NHPI-serving organizations and located in States with significant NHPI populations to support the development of future researchers from these same communities. The Committee directs NIMHD to provide an update in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Justification on NIH research to advance NHPI health and faculty researcher development. Neurofibromatosis (NF).--The Committee supports efforts to increase funding and resources for NF research and treatment at multiple Institutes, including NCI, NINDS, NIDCD, NHLBI, NICHD, NIMH, NCATS, and NEI. Children and adults with NF are at elevated risk for the development of many forms of cancer, deafness, blindness, developmental delays, and autism. The Committee encourages NCI to increase its NF research portfolio in fundamental laboratory science, patient-directed research, and clinical trials focused on NF-associated benign and malignant cancers. The Committee also encourages NCI to continue to support preclinical research and clinical trials. Because NF can cause blindness, pain, and hearing loss, the Committee urges NINDS and NIDCD to continue to support fundamental basic science research on NF relevant to restoring normal nerve function. Based on emerging findings from numerous researchers worldwide demonstrating that children with NF have a higher chance of developing autism, learning disabilities, motor delays, and attention deficits, the Committee encourages NINDS, NIMH, and NICHD to increase their support of clinical research investigations in these areas. Since NF2 accounts for some genetic forms of deafness, the Committee encourages NIDCD to expand its investment in NF2-related research. NF1 can cause vision loss due to optic gliomas. The Committee encourages NEI to expand its investment in NF1-focused research on optic gliomas and vision restoration. NIH Division of Police.--The Committee notes that the explanatory statement accompanying the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2022 directs the Attorney General to ensure implementation of evidence-based training programs on de-escalation and the use-of-force, as well as on police community relations, and the protection of civil rights, that are broadly applicable and scalable to all Federal law enforcement agencies. The Committee further notes that several agencies funded by this Act employ Federal law enforcement officers and are Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers partner organizations. The Committee directs NIH to consult with the Attorney General regarding the implementation of these programs for their law enforcement officers. The Committee further directs NIH to submit a report to the Committee no later than 180 days after consultation with the Attorney General on their efforts relating to such implementation. In addition, the Committee directs NIH, to the extent that they are not already participating, to consult with the Attorney General and the Director of the FBI regarding participation in the National Use-of-Force Data Collection. The Committee further directs NIH to submit a report to the Committees on Appropriations, no later than 180 days after enactment of this Act, on their efforts to so participate. Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR).--The Committee includes no less than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level for OBSSR. The Committee commends OBSSR for effectively coordinating and supporting essential basic, clinical, and translational research in the behavioral, social, and population sciences to advance the NIH mission and recognizes the critical role of OBSSR to integrate these sciences throughout the NIH research enterprise via OBSSR's leadership and coordination. The Committee urges NIH to provide an update on OBSSR's activities and progress in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Justification. The Committee notes that multiple Surgeon General and NASEM reports have concluded that most diseases and health problems facing the Nation have significant behavioral components. Meanwhile, behavioral science issues surrounding the current pandemic, including vaccine hesitancy and health misinformation, have made clear that it is important to better understand healthy behavior and how to improve health communications. The Committee notes the OBSSR's mission to enhance NIH's behavioral sciences research enterprise across all Institutes and Centers, but that its direct authorities to meet its mission are limited. The Committee is pleased that an NIH working group was established to review how better to integrate and realize the benefits of overall health from behavioral research at NIH, and encourages NIH to consider appropriate OBSSR funding levels, resources, and organizational structure to support full implementation of the working group recommendations. Office of Nutrition Research.--The Committee includes $40,000,000 for the Office of Nutrition Research (ONR). With nutrition research occurring across NIH Institutes and Centers, ONR's work is essential for coordinating and advancing nutrition research across NIH and with other Federal agencies. This investment will accelerate discoveries across numerous critical areas and positively impact public health, societal equity, the economy, national security, as well as bolster the Nation's resilience to current and future threats like COVID- 19. Office of Research on Women's Health.--The Committee recommends $64,480,000 for the Office of Research on Women's Health, an increase of $5,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. This office ensures women's health research and research on the biological and sociocultural influence of sex and gender are included within the NIH scientific framework. The Committee recognizes ORWH's critical leadership in promoting women's health research and spearheading research programs like the Specialized Centers of Research Excellence (SCORE). SCORE is a disease-agnostic research program designed to expedite the development and translation of basic and preclinical knowledge to human diseases that affect women, to learn more about the etiology of these diseases, and to foster improved approaches to treatment and/or prevention. The SCORE program also supports pilot research projects to train the next generation of scientists in the study of sex differences. Building Interdisciplinary Research Careers in Women's Health.--Within the total for ORWH, the Committee includes $5,000,000, an increase of $1,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level, for the ORWH's Building Interdisciplinary Research Careers in Women's Health (BIRCWH) program to fund additional BIRCWH fellows at all existing sites with a goal of increasing the diversity of the scholars, sites, and research areas supported by the program. These funds support additional researchers focused on women's health and sex differences, which are priority research areas, as well as expand the program's work in the reproductive sciences. The Committee recognizes the effectiveness of the BIRCWH program, which is a mentored career-development program designed to connect junior faculty and senior faculty with shared interests. Office of the Chief Officer for Scientific Workforce Diversity.--The Committee includes $22,400,000 for the Office of the Chief Officer for Scientific Workforce Diversity, $6,210,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2023 budget request. Osteopathic Medical Schools.--The Committee recognizes that increased access to research funding for the osteopathic profession will bolster NIH's capacity to support recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, address health disparities in rural and medically-underserved populations, and advance research in primary care, prevention, and treatment. The Committee requests an update on the current status of NIH funding to colleges of osteopathic medicine and representation of doctors of osteopathic medicine on NIH National Advisory Councils and standing study sections in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Justification. Overactive Bladder Treatment.--The Committee remains concerned about the safety of medications used to treat overactive bladder, which may be increasing risk of ADRD. Overactive bladder affects 38 million Americans, and one in three older adults in this country. Overactive bladder has a significant impact on quality of life and the health care system. The anticholinergic medications typically used first- line to treat overactive bladder have been shown to increase the risk of developing dementia. Dementia continues to grow as a prevalent and serious public health issue. The Committee urges NIA to study anticholinergic medications and alternative treatments to determine the safety and effectiveness of medications for overactive bladder, and their potential risks related to ADRD. The Committee requests an update on the status of research activities focused on this issue in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Justification. Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS).--PCOS affects up to 15 percent of women and is a significant risk factor for multiple cardio-metabolic conditions, such as type 2 diabetes, lipid disorders, high blood pressure, obesity, sleep disorders, and others which may significantly increase risk for adverse COVID- 19 outcomes. The Committee encourages NIH to increase investments into research on the metabolic, cardiovascular, psychosocial, maternal-fetal, oncologic, pediatric, dermatologic, and reproductive aspects of PCOS. Fifty percent of PCOS patients become diabetic or prediabetic before age 40, and are at higher risk for hypertension, stroke, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, independent of, but exacerbated by obesity. There is also evidence of racial and ethnic differences that disproportionately increase the risk for cardiovascular and metabolic disease in PCOS. The Committee urges NIH to continue to support fundamental laboratory science, patient-directed research, clinical trials, and large longitudinal studies focused on the cardiometabolic features and endocrinopathy of PCOS throughout the lifespan. The Committee also encourages NIH to provide an update on research that has been conducted on PCOS and its impact on cardio-metabolic health to date in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Justification. Additionally, the Committee requests that PCOS--one of the most common human disorders--be added to the NIH Research, Condition, and Disease Categories reporting. Prion Disease.--The Committee encourages NIH to recognize prion disease as an ADRD. The disease mechanism and clinical presentation of prion diseases closely resemble AD/ADRDs. Advances in prion disease science have been valuable to the study of other ADRDs and vice versa, and further integration of the fields will benefit scientific pursuits in both fields. Psychedelic Research.--The Committee encourages NIH to assess opportunities for further private-public partnerships on researching the use of psychedelic drugs to treat posttraumatic stress disorder and major depressive disorders and provide a report within six months of enactment of this Act on the feasibility of providing potential dedicated researching funding for such partnerships. Psychedelic Treatments.--Despite the recent Department of Veterans Affairs' 2020 National Veteran Suicide Prevention Annual Report that showed there were no significant increases in the veteran suicide rate from 2017 and 2018, the Committee is concerned that over 17 veterans on average continue to commit suicide each day, which is a number that has remained persistent over the past decade. There have been many recent studies and clinical trials demonstrating the positive impact of alternative therapies, including psychedelics, for treatmentresistant PTSD and major depressive disorder, particularly for veteran participants. Further, U.S. academic research institutions are involved in investigating psychedelic treatments, including Johns Hopkins University, Harvard University, Yale University, New York University and Baylor University. In light of growing interest in this area, the Committee encourages NIH and other relevant Federal agencies to undertake, and where appropriate expand, research to evaluate the effectiveness of psychedelic therapies in treating PTSD, major depressive disorder, and other serious mental health conditions. Repeat Expansion Diseases.--The Committee recognizes the rapidly emerging science on DNA repeat expansions, which causes over 50 distinct diseases. Myotonic dystrophy (DM1 and DM2) is one of these repeat expansion diseases and has served as paradigm for a class of diseases caused by repeat instability and toxic RNA, which includes C9ORF72/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia, Huntington's disease, and many common forms of dominantly inherited ataxias. Due to recently developed molecular and cell biological tools, a common thread has recently emerged, that repeat expansions may underlie multiple neurodegenerative conditions. The Committee encourages NIH to explore the most effective approaches to support trans-NIH research on repeat expansions and consider new funding mechanisms across multiple Institutes and Centers to support scientific discoveries that will lead to treatments and cures for these genetic disorders and related conditions. The Committee requests an update on these activities in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Justification. Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (SOGI) Research Center.--The Committee includes $2,000,000 to establish the SOGI Research Center, which will build upon the success of the NASEM consensus study and the Sexual and Gender Minority Research Office to disseminate best practices in data collection on sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex characteristics on a government-wide basis. Spina Bifida Research.--The Committee encourages NIA, NIDDK, NICHD, and NINDS to study the causes and care of the neurogenic bladder and kidney disease in order to improve the quality of life of children and adults with spina bifida; to support research to address issues related to the treatment and management of spina bifida and associated secondary conditions, such as hydrocephalus and sudden death in the adult spina bifida population; and to invest in understanding the myriad co-morbid conditions experienced by individuals with spina bifida, including those associated with both paralysis and developmental delay. The Committee requests and update in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Justification on research findings on spina bifida and issues related to it. The Committee supports the specific efforts of NICHD to understand early human development; set the foundation for healthy pregnancy, and lifelong wellness of women and children; and promote the gynecological, andrological, and reproductive health for people with spina bifida. Additionally, NIH is encouraged to identify sensitive time periods to optimize health interventions; improve health during transition from adolescence to adulthood; and ensure safe and effective therapeutics and devices for adults as well as children. Spinal Muscular Atrophy.--The Committee commends NIH for its past research into spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) that has led to new therapies to treat SMA and also contributed toward greater knowledge and research capacity into nervous system disorders. While current SMA treatments can slow or stop future degenerative nerve damage, they are not cures, and there remains significant unmet need across all ages and disease stages of SMA. Individuals with SMA, particularly adults, the largest segment of the SMA population, face significant challenges in muscle weakness and fatigue due to degeneration that occurred prior to treatment. Individuals treated prior to clinical symptoms onset may also display unmet needs, such as bulbar impairment and gait abnormalities. The Committee urges NIH to address these unmet needs, which are common across other neurological and neuro-muscular diseases, by supporting new research into the role and function of survival motor neuron (SMN) protein, investigation into non-SMN pathways and targets capable of modifying disease, and research into how to best combine SMN-enhancing and non-SMN approaches for optimal therapeutic outcomes. Thalassemia.--Nutrition can be an important tool in the management of rare diseases. Currently, there is no evidence- based guidance on nutrition approaches for the management of thalassemia, which occurs most often in African Americans and in people of Mediterranean and Southeast Asian descent. In addition to the possibility that thalassemia itself creates nutritional deficits, there is concern that necessary iron chelation therapy may create additional deficits. Research is needed to provide practitioners with evidence-based advice for patients, both on diets that would help improve and manage their condition, and those that may be harmful. The Committee encourages the Office of Nutrition Research to coordinate across NIH on the impact of nutrition on thalassemia management and current gaps in clinical understanding in this area. Transformative Research Award for ALS.--The Committee strongly supports the Transformative Research Award program for ALS and directs NIH to continue to fund this critical initiative in fiscal year 2023. Undiagnosed Diseases.--NIH is helping construct and implement the Undiagnosed Disease Network, a research study to improve the diagnosis of undiagnosed, rare disorders so that no family has to endure the anxiety associated with undiagnosed diseases. The Committee recognizes that while the research is challenging, the great effort spent on this endeavor is beneficial for every American, especially those that are fighting unknown diseases. The Committee encourages robust support for the Undiagnosed Disease Network. Wastewater Surveillance Research.--The Committee recognizes the potential and importance of wastewater surveillance in public health surveillance, including during the ongoing pandemic to inform COVID-19 surveillance. The Committee encourages NIH to continue efforts on Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx) to continue innovation through developing and improving wastewater surveillance capabilities, including for innovations that can apply to non-centralized wastewater treatment services that would serve rural communities. NIH is directed to report back to the Committee within 180 days of enactment of this Act on such efforts. Women's Health Research Study.--The Committee recognizes persistent gaps remain in the knowledge of women's health. To address these gaps and improve women's health, the Committee includes $2,000,000 to contract with NASEM to conduct a study on the gaps present in women's health research across all NIH Institutes and Centers. Specifically, the study should be designed to explore the proportion of research on conditions that are more common or unique to women, establish how these conditions are defined and ensure that it captures conditions across the lifespan, evaluate sex and gender differences and racial health disparities, and determine the appropriate level of funding that is needed to address gaps in women's health research at NIH. The Committee requests that NASEM, not later than 18 months after enactment of this Act, submit to the Committee a report containing the findings of the study and the recommendations to address research gaps in women's health research, including measurable metrics to ensure that this research is accurately tracked to meet the continuing health needs of women. Wound Care and Pressure Injuries.--The Committee commends NIH for updating RCDC with a wound care category, as it is estimated that pressure ulcers impact over 2.5 million Americans annually. Unfortunately, an estimated 60,000 patient deaths occur each year due to complications directly attributed to this painful condition. NIH is encouraged to support research projects in this area.

SAMHSA is the agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that leads public health efforts to advance the behavioral health of the nation. SAMHSA's mission is to reduce the impact of substance misuse and mental illness on America's communities. The Committee continues to include bill language that exempts the Mental Health Block Grant and the Substance Use Prevention and Treatment Block Grant as a source for the PHS Act section 241 evaluation set-aside in fiscal year 2023.

Behavioral Health Crisis Services and 988 Program The Committee recognizes that suicide is a leading cause of death, taking more than 45,000 lives every year. According to the CDC, mental health and suicidal ideation have worsened significantly since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic; approximately twice as many individuals have reported serious thoughts of suicide and 40 percent of adults reported struggling with mental health or substance use. The Committee includes a total of $746,901,000, an increase of $640,280,000, to support the entirety of the 988 Program, which includes continuing to enhance the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (NSPL) and crisis response infrastructure for the new 988 number which is launching in July 2022. SAMHSA estimates that the 988 call centers will respond to approximately 7.6 million individuals in fiscal year 2023, compared to approximately 3.3 million estimated in fiscal year 2022. The 988 Program has the potential to make it simpler for people experiencing a mental health crisis to connect with lifesaving crisis intervention services. This funding will support the NSPL infrastructure including national back-up services; expand local call center and crisis capacity across the continuum of care; promote ongoing Federal direction and leadership through coordination, standards setting, technical assistance and evaluation; and facilitate partner engagement, audience research, content and strategy development to ensure that there is public awareness of the health benefits of the 988 Program, particularly for populations at high risk of suicide. The Committee requests a briefing within 90 days of the date of enactment of this Act on implementation of the 988 Program, including an operating plan outlining how SAMHSA intends to allocate funding across 988 Program activities. The Committee also directs that as SAMHSA continues to enhance the NSPL and crisis response infrastructure, it should expand existing capabilities for response in a manner that, to the extent possible, utilizes existing phone, chat, and text capabilities. Behavioral Health Crisis and 988 Coordinating Office.--Of the funds provided for the 988 Program, the Committee includes an increase of $5,000,000 for SAMHSA to continue to staff an office within the Center for Mental Health Services to coordinate work relating to behavioral health crisis care across HHS operating divisions, including CMS and HRSA, as well as with external stakeholders. The office will continue to support technical assistance, data analysis, and evaluation functions in order to develop a crisis care system encompassing nationwide standards with the objective of expanding the capacity of and access to local crisis call centers, mobile crisis care, crisis stabilization, psychiatric emergency services, and rapid post-crisis follow up, provided by the National Suicide Prevention and Mental Health Crisis Response System, Community Mental Health Centers, Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics and other community mental health and substance use disorder (SUD) providers. NSPL-Specialized Services for LGBTQI+ Youth.--Of the funds provided for the 988 Program, the Committee includes $30,000,000 for SAMHSA to continue to provide specialized services for LGBTQI+ youth within the NSPL, including training for existing counselors in LGBTQI+ youth cultural competency and the establishment and operation of an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) and other technical solutions to transfer LGBTQI+ youth to a specialty organization. SAMHSA shall make this funding competitively available to an organization with experience working with LGBTQI+ youth and possessing the capacity and infrastructure to handle LGBTQI+ youth callers through an IVR. Criminal Justice Activities.--The Committee includes an increase of $10,000,000 for Criminal and Juvenile Justice Programs to address some of the unmet need for effective behavioral health services and supports that are accessible before, during, and after incarceration and continue in the community for those with a mental disorder. The Committee recognizes the importance of providing comprehensive services to those who suffer from severe mental health issues. The Committee is aware that lack of coordinated and accessible treatment for individuals with mental health and co-occurring disorders often results in avoidable arrest and incarceration, and that these individuals often recidivate in part due to gaps in addressing their needs. Communities of color are often disproportionately impacted by these service gaps. The Committee encourages SAMHSA to prioritize funding for centers that provide assistance to those with severe mental health needs who are at risk of recidivism. These mental health centers can provide, but are not limited to, the following services: crisis care, residential treatment, outpatient mental health and primary care services, and community re-entry supports. The Committee also encourages SAMHSA to prioritize applications from areas with high rates of uninsured individuals, poverty, and SUDs. Garrett Lee Smith Youth Suicide Prevention.--The Committee includes a total increase of $13,000,000 for Garrett Lee Smith Youth Suicide Prevention, to develop and implement youth suicide prevention and early intervention strategies. Healthy Transitions.--The Committee includes an increase of $20,000,000 for the Healthy Transitions program, which provides grants to States and Tribes to improve access to mental disorder treatment and related support services for young people aged 16 to 25 who either have, or are at risk of developing a serious mental health condition. Homelessness Prevention Programs.--The Committee includes an increase of $5,000,000 for Homeless Prevention Programs to help prevent or reduce chronic homelessness by funding services for individuals and families experiencing homelessness while living with severe mental illness or co-occurring mental and substance disorders. The program addresses the need for treatment and support service provision to individuals and families. Infant and Early Childhood Mental Health.--The Committee recognizes the importance of building mental health services for children under the age of six and includes an increase of $20,000,000 for Infant and Early Childhood Mental Health. The Committee continues to urge SAMHSA to expand grants to entities such as State agencies, tribal communities, and university or medical centers that are in different stages of developing infant and early childhood mental health services. These entities should have the capacity to lead partners in systems- level change as well as building or enhancing the basic components of such early childhood services, including an appropriately trained workforce. The Committee is pleased with SAMHSA's use of a portion of funding to provide technical assistance to existing grantees to better integrate infant and early childhood mental health into State systems and encourages that work to continue. The Committee encourages SAMHSA to increase technical assistance allocations as the number of grantees increases. Interagency Task Force on Trauma-Informed Care.--The Committee includes $3,000,000 for the Interagency Task Force on Trauma-Informed Care, as authorized by section 7132 of the SUPPORT Act (P.L. 115-271). The Task Force recommends best practices to identify, prevent, and mitigate the effects of trauma on infants, children, youth, and their families. Mental Health Crisis Response Grants.--The Committee notes that funding crisis care services can help divert people experiencing a mental health crisis from the criminal justice system into mental health treatment. However, the availability of mental health crisis care remains inconsistent across the U.S., and first responders are not always trained and equipped to diffuse a mental health crisis, which can lead to tragic outcomes. Many communities are implementing model programs where mental health providers respond to mental health emergencies, sometimes in partnership with law enforcement. To make these model programs more widely available, the Committee includes an increase of $50,000,000 to expand the grant program for communities to create, or enhance existing, mobile crisis response teams that divert the response for mental health crises from law enforcement to behavioral health teams. These teams may be composed of licensed counselors, clinical social workers, physicians, EMTs, crisis workers, and/or peers available to respond to people in crisis and provide immediate stabilization and referral to community-based mental health services and supports. The Committee encourages grantees to partner or co-respond with law enforcement to ensure community policing meets the needs of everyone in the community. The Committee looks forward to receiving the report on existing steps being taken to strengthen partnerships between mental health providers, behavioral health teams, and first responders requested in House Report 117-96. The Committee requests a report not later than one year following the obligation of awards in fiscal year 2023 for this program, including best practices and recommendations for subsequent grant cycles. Minority Fellowship Program.--The Committee provides a total of $25,169,000, an increase of $9,000,000, across SAMHSA for the Minority Fellowship Program in order to improve prevention, wellness, and treatment across the lifespan. As Congress seeks to better address substance misuse and mental health disorders across all populations, the Committee recognizes the critical importance of supporting a diverse behavioral health workforce and its effectiveness in addressing SUDs and mental health issues impacting minority and underserved populations. National Strategy for Suicide Prevention.--The Committee includes an increase of $5,000,000 for the implementation of the National Strategy for Suicide Prevention, including raising suicide awareness, establishing emergency room referral processes, and improving clinical care practice standards. In addition, funding will further support the Zero Suicide model, a comprehensive, multi-setting approach to suicide prevention in health care systems. The Committee also includes an increase of $1,000,000 for the American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) Suicide Prevention Initiative. Primary and Behavioral Health Care Integration.--The Committee includes an increase of $50,000,000 to improve the coordination and integration of primary care services and publicly funded behavioral health services. Project AWARE.--The Committee includes a total increase of $108,999,000 for Project AWARE, which is designed to identify children and youth in need of mental health services, to increase access to mental health treatment, and to promote mental health literacy among teachers and school personnel, as set out by the 2013 ``Now is the Time'' plan. This includes an increase of $102,749,000 for Project AWARE State grants, and an increase of $6,250,000 for Resilience in Communities after Stress and Trauma (ReCAST) grants. In addition, the Committee includes an increase of $20,000,000 for Mental Health Awareness Training. The Committee encourages SAMHSA to sustain and strengthen its grant and other programs that support school- based and campus-based services aimed at preventing and treating mental health challenges experienced by younger Americans. Tribal Behavioral Grants.--The Committee includes an increase of $4,250,000 to expand efforts to address the high incidence of substance misuse and suicide among AI/AN populations. Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics The Committee includes $400,000,000, an increase of $85,000,000 for the Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics (CCHBC) program. The Committee is pleased that the CCBHC program is expanding access to mental health and SUD treatment services and significantly reducing hospital emergency room utilization. CCBHCs are required to partner with local agencies, and this often includes partnering with law enforcement to develop safe and effective crisis response. The Committee directs SAMHSA to continue to make funds available nationwide and to prioritize resources to entities within States that are part of section 223(a) of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-93) demonstration and to entities within States that were awarded planning grants. Children's Mental Health Services The Committee includes $225,000,000, an increase of $100,000,000 for Children's Mental Health Services (CMHS), which support grants and technical assistance for community- based services for children and adolescents with serious emotional, behavioral, or mental disorders, and assists States and local jurisdictions in developing integrated systems of community care. Community Violence Pilot.--The Committee recognizes the crisis of community violence that is devastating families and claiming the lives of youth--particularly youth in communities of color--all across this country. Of the funds provided for CMHS, the Committee includes $50,000,000 for SAMHSA to establish a pilot program to provide and expand mental health services for families affected by community violence. The severe lack of resources for emotional support and wellbeing is of paramount need in Black and brown communities and this funding would be a crucial support for the pervasive trauma that so many families, especially families of color, face in the aftermath of fatal community violence. Mental Health Block Grant The Committee includes $1,357,571,000, an increase of $500,000,000, for the Mental Health Block Grant (MHBG). The MHBG provides funds to States to support mental illness prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation services. Funds are allocated according to a statutory formula among the States that have submitted approved annual plans. The Committee continues the 10 percent set-aside within the MHBG for evidence-based programs that address the needs of individuals with early serious mental illness, including psychotic disorders. MHBG Crisis Care Set-Aside.--The Committee increases the set-aside in the MHBG for evidence-based crisis care programs to 10 percent to address the needs of individuals with serious mental illnesses and children with serious mental and emotional disturbances. The Committee directs SAMHSA to use the set-aside to fund, at the discretion of eligible States and Territories, some or all of a set of core crisis care elements including: local, regional or statewide call centers that have capacity to address distressed and suicidal callers and deploy mobile teams or direct persons to accessible crisis receiving centers or clinics with same day appointments, mobile crisis response teams and crisis receiving units. MHBG Prevention and Early Intervention Set-Aside.--The Committee understands that early intervention is critical if we are to prevent or mitigate the effects of mental illness and enable individuals to live fulfilling, productive lives. To increase access to early intervention and prevention services, the Committee includes a new 10 percent set-aside within the MHBG total to support evidence-based programs that address early intervention and prevention of mental disorders among at- risk children, including young children and toddlers, and adolescents. The Committee directs SAMHSA to use the set-aside to fund, at the discretion of eligible States and Territories, activities targeted to children and youth such as, but not limited to, training school-based personnel to identify children and youth at risk of mental disorders; programs to promote positive social-emotional development in children from birth to age five; mental health consultation for child care programs; collaborating with primary care associations to field depression and anxiety screening tools in front line primary care practices; or partnering with local non-profit entities in low-income and minority communities to implement trauma- informed early intervention and prevention initiatives. Statutory State plan and reporting requirements will apply to early intervention and prevention set-aside programming. MHBG and Children Ages Zero-Five.--The Committee recognizes that by investing in early mental health prevention, identification, and treatment, the need for treatment later in life when it becomes much more difficult, time intensive, and expensive can be reduced. The Committee is concerned that there has not been a sufficient focus on this population. The Committee urges States to dedicate a portion of their MHBG funding through the new Prevention and Early Intervention Set- Aside for services and activities related to infants and toddlers, such as expanding the infant and early childhood mental health workforce; improving the quality of services available to children and families; increasing knowledge of infant and early childhood mental health among professionals who see children most; and strengthening systems and networks for identification and referral to reach more young children in need. The Committee looks forward to receiving the report on the portion of MHBG funding that States are allocating to services and activities for infants and toddlers requested in House Report 117-96. MHBG and AANHPIs.--The Committee urges States to ensure a portion of MHBG funding is allocated to focus on Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders (AANHPI). This focus should include the training of professionals on effective outreach and engagement with AANHPIs to raise awareness of these culturally inclusive services, including those with lived experiences. Workplace Mental Health Wellness.--The Committee notes that workforce mental health is an important part of ensuring the overall mental health of our larger communities. To address workforce mental health in the community context, the Committee urges SAMHSA to encourage States to use a portion of their MHBG funds to work with public and nonprofit organizations to implement evidence-based programs designed to educate and aid employers in providing mental health assistance to their employees to reduce the stigma and encourage the treatment of mental health illness in the workplace. National Child Traumatic Stress Initiative The Committee includes $150,000,000, an increase of $68,113,000 for the National Child Traumatic Stress Initiative. The Committee strongly supports the National Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN), which carries out essential work in building, evaluating, disseminating, and delivering evidence- based services and best practices, including through universities, hospitals, and front-line providers, to prevent and mitigate the impact of exposure to trauma among children and families. The Committee directs SAMHSA to ensure that the NCTSN maintains its focus on collaboration, data collection, and the provision of direct services and that new grants should not be awarded as training only. The agreement also provides no less than $10,000,000 for activities authorized under section 582(d) and (e) of the PHS Act for the National Center for Child Traumatic Stress. Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness The Committee includes $79,635,000, an increase of $15,000,000 for the Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness (PATH) program, which supports grants to States and territories for assistance to individuals suffering from severe mental illness and/or SUDs and who are experiencing homelessness or at imminent risk of becoming homeless. Grants may be used for outreach, screening and diagnostic treatment services, rehabilitation services, community mental health services, alcohol or drug treatment services, training, case management services, supportive and supervisory services in residential settings, and a limited set of housing services. HUD/HHS Collaboration Supportive Housing for People with Mental Illness Pilot.--The Committee is concerned that inadequate housing and support opportunities exist for people with serious mental health illness, which often results in people with serious mental illness cycling through hospitals and public institutions like jails, prisons, and homeless shelters. The Committee recognizes that housing support paired with wraparound services is a successful model. In fiscal year 2021, the Committee requested a report from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and SAMHSA on the feasibility of such a program and received agency feedback for its creation. The Committee directs SAMHSA to work with HUD to establish a pilot program for PATH grantees to partner with public housing agencies to provide mental health, SUD, and other supportive services for people experiencing homelessness, at imminent risk of becoming homeless, or in HUD-assisted housing. The Committee directs SAMHSA to use no less than $5,000,000 of the funds made available for the PATH program for this pilot. Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness The Committee includes $40,000,000, an increase of $2,000,000, for the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness program, which ensures that the rights of individuals with mental illness are protected while they are patients in all public and private facilities or while they are living in the community. Funds are allocated to States according to a formula based on population and relative per capita incomes. Addressing Access to Firearms and Suicide Prevention Programs.--The Committee continues to encourage SAMHSA to focus on suicide prevention policies that limit access to firearms and other lethal means when an individual is in crisis. The Committee urges SAMHSA to develop, adapt, and disseminate training on lethal means safety counseling for health care providers; to collaborate with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and NSPL to promote gun storage maps, accessible by both VA health care providers and Crisis Center counselors, to facilitate temporary out-of-home firearm storage; and to encourage the incorporation of tools such as extreme risk laws into risk mitigation and response plans. Behavioral Health Intervention Training.--The Committee continues to encourage SAMHSA to develop school-based and evidence-based best practices addressing behavioral health intervention training to support practices that assist children and youth with behavioral health needs. One potential best practice is behavioral intervention teams--a team of qualified mental health professionals who are responsible for identifying, screening, and assessing behaviors of concern and facilitating the implementation of evidence-based interventions. SAMHSA shall also provide technical assistance to institutions of higher education, elementary schools, and secondary schools to assist such institutions and schools in implementing the best practices. COVID-19 Impact on Communities of Color.--The Committee is concerned by the enduring impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of communities of color. The pandemic exacerbated high rates of mental illness in these communities and highlighted the need for culturally and linguistically appropriate services. The Committee requests a report not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act on SAMHSA's outreach, education, and public engagement strategies, designed to meet the cultural and language needs of diverse populations; increase awareness of symptoms of SUD and mental illness common among the aforementioned populations, taking into account differences within subgroups such as gender, gender identity, age, sexual orientation, or disability; disseminate evidence-based, culturally and linguistically appropriate and adapted interventions and treatments; ensure meaningful engagement of people with lived experiences, their families, and community members in the materials development and implementation; broaden the perspective among both individuals in these communities and stakeholders serving these communities, to use a comprehensive public health approach to promoting behavioral health that addresses a holistic view of health by focusing on the intersection between behavioral and physical health; and address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the behavioral health of such populations. Impact of COVID-19 on the Mental Health of Older Adults.-- The Committee recognizes the exacerbated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on older adults, who, being more susceptible to the virus, have experienced heightened isolation since the onset of the pandemic, which is linked to higher rates of loneliness, depression, suicidal ideation, and other mental health issues. The Committee encourages SAMHSA to work with States to address the impact of increased isolation of seniors. The Committee requests a report within 180 days of the date of enactment of this Act, outlining specific efforts to address seniors' mental health challenges. Mental Health Centers of Excellence.--The Committee continues to be concerned about the growing need for more effective health care programs and a need to better provide treatment recommendations to meet the needs of those experiencing mental illness. The Committee urges SAMHSA to establish a center of excellence program focused on comprehensive mental health treatments. The Centers will focus on the development, evaluation, and distribution of evidence- based resources regarding comprehensive treatment recommendations for mental health patients that include supportive services, wraparound services, and social determinants of health where applicable. The Centers will also work to disseminate treatment recommendations to the broader network of mental health clinicians. Preference should be given to entities that can demonstrate existing behavioral health medical home model services, CCBHC implementation, work with HUD's Housing for Persons with Disabilities (section 811) program, collaborative care agreements with primary care practices, and/or programs for supported living and supported employment. One grantee should be designated as the National Coordinating Center across the selected centers and provide technical expertise across all recipients. The Centers should collaborate with SAMHSA's Mental Health Technology Transfer Center Network and the Serious Mental Illness advisor in developing the new program. Perinatal Suicide Prevention.--The Committee continues to urge SAMHSA to develop and implement perinatal suicide prevention programs, including culturally appropriate resources and programs for Black and other at-risk pregnant and postpartum individuals. Reducing Barriers to Transportation.--The Committee notes that mental health, SUD, and opioid use disorder (OUD) are a pervasive crisis across the country and have been exacerbated by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Committee is also aware that many seeking treatment lack reliable transportation which becomes a major barrier for individuals seeking out treatment or other mental health services. The Committee encourages SAMHSA to acknowledge funds for State and local governments can be used to provide reliable, equitable, and convenient access to transportation for those seeking treatment. The Committee requests SAMHSA conduct a review within 180 days of the date of enactment of this Act to measure the impact of recovery transportation on individuals' ability to access treatment and provide a summary report. Rural Mental Health.--The Committee recognizes the unique challenges faced by those who live in rural and frontier areas to access regular mental health and substance use services. These challenges are further complicated when individuals need timely behavioral health crisis services led by behavioral health professionals in these areas. Providers in rural areas also face unique obstacles. They may lack the full staff or resources to implement evidence-based practices or meet requirements for grant funding. Given these challenges, the Committee requests a report not later than one year after the date of enactment of this Act providing details on strategies to address the unique concerns of those in rural communities. The report should address what resources are needed to improve and sustain access to prevention, treatment, and recovery- oriented services, including crisis response services, and to recruit, train, and sustain sufficient workforce in rural and frontier settings. Youth Mental Health and Mentoring Initiatives.--The Committee notes that since the pandemic began, rates of psychological distress among young people, including symptoms of anxiety, depression, and other mental health disorders, have increased. Professional mentoring programs provide evidence- based mental health and trauma mitigation services to children and families who experience barriers to accessing mental health supports, while reducing the burdens on existing systems of care. The Committee urges SAMHSA to prioritize funds to these programs to improve access to mental health services for at- risk youth and their families and to ensure applicable grant opportunities include these types of professionals as parties grantees can work with when implementing SAMHSA grants. In addition, the Committee urges SAMHSA to study underlying causes of psychological distress in young people.

Children and Families.--The Committee includes an increase of $592,000 for the Children and Families program, which makes appropriate treatment available to youth and their families or caregivers to reduce the impact of SUD and/or co-occurring mental and substance use disorders on communities in the U.S. Comprehensive Opioid Recovery Centers.--The Committee includes an increase of $2,500,000 for Comprehensive Opioid Recovery Centers, as authorized by section 7121 of the SUPPORT Act (P.L. 115-271), to help ensure that people with SUD can access proper treatment. Emergency Department Alternatives to Opioids.--The Committee includes an increase of $4,000,000 for Emergency Department Alternatives to Opioids, as authorized by section 7091 of the SUPPORT Act (P.L. 115-271). This program provides funding to hospitals and emergency departments to develop and implement alternative pain management protocols and treatments that limit the prescribing of opioids in emergency departments. Grants to Prevent Prescription Drug/Opioid Overdose and First Responder Training.--The Committee includes an increase of $4,000,000 for Grants to Prevent Prescription Drug/Opioid Overdose Deaths, and an increase of $15,000,000 for First Responder Training for Opioid Overdose Reversal Drugs, which includes an increase of $10,000,000 for a rural set-aside. Of the funds provided for First Responder Training, the Committee directs at least $10,000,000 to Rural Emergency Medical Services Training Grants. The Committee notes strong concerns about the increasing number of unintentional overdose deaths attributable to prescription and nonprescription opioids. The Committee urges SAMHSA to take steps to encourage and support the use of funds for opioid safety education and training, including initiatives that improve access for licensed health care professionals, including paramedics, to emergency devices used to rapidly reverse the effects of opioid overdoses. Such initiatives should incorporate robust evidence-based intervention training and facilitate linkage to treatment and recovery services. Improving Access to Overdose Treatment.--The Committee includes an increase of $500,000 to train and support health care providers and pharmacists on the prescribing of FDA approved drugs or devices for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose. Minority AIDS Initiative.--The Committee includes a total of $119,275,000, an increase of $3,276,000, across SAMHSA to expand access to effective, culturally competent, HIV/AIDS- related mental health services in racial and ethnic minority communities, for people living with an SMI and who are living with or are at high risk for HIV/AIDS. Peer Support Technical Assistance Center.--The Committee includes an increase of $1,000,000 to provide technical assistance to recovery community organizations and peer support networks. Pregnant and Postpartum Women program.--The Committee includes an increase of $15,000,000 for the Pregnant and Postpartum Women program and recognizes SAMSHA for its work managing this program, which utilizes a family-centered approach to provide comprehensive residential SUD treatment services for pregnant and postpartum women, their minor children and other family members. Recovery Community Services Program.--The Committee includes an increase of $2,717,000 for the Recovery Community Services Program (RCSP) to help recovery communities strengthen their infrastructure and provide peer recovery support services to those in or seeking recovery from SUD. These funds will also support the Recovery Community Services Program Statewide Network (RSCP-SN) program to strengthen the relationships between recovery community organizations and their statewide networks of recovery stakeholders as key partners in the delivery of State and local treatment and recovery support services (RSS), as well as allied health systems through collaboration, systems improvement, public health messaging, and training conducted for (or with) key recovery stakeholder organizations. RCSP-SN grantees collaborate with traditional SUD treatment providers and other purchasers of PRSS to strengthen and embed these critical service elements as fixtures on the Recovery Oriented Systems of Care landscape. Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment.-- The Committee includes an increase of $3,000,000 for Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT). The Committee urges SAMHSA to continue working to ensure SBIRT screening is more widely adopted by health providers, and directs this increase be used for implementing grants to pediatric health care providers in accordance with the specifications outlined in section 9016 of P.L. 114-255, Sober Truth in Preventing Underage Drinking Reauthorization. Training grants should focus on screening for underage drinking, opioid use, and other drug use, and be managed by the Center for Substance Use Services within the existing SBIRT program. Grantees would train providers in screening children and adolescents for and offering brief interventions to discourage alcohol and other substance use; educating parents; diagnosing and treating alcohol use and other SUDs; and referring patients to other appropriate care, when necessary. Targeted Capacity Expansion-Medication Assisted Treatment.--The Committee includes an increase of $35,500,000 for Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) for Prescription Drug and Opioid Addiction; an increase of $4,500,000, for grants to Indian Tribes, tribal organizations, or consortia; and an increase of $224,000 for general Targeted Capacity Expansion activities. The Committee urges SAMHSA to require opioid treatment program applicants submit with their certification application, a description of outreach displaying that the applicant has properly notified the community of the treatment center location. The Committee recommends that outreach shall include community stakeholders including community board(s), tenant associations, residential and outpatient treatment SUD providers, health care providers, community-based organizations who provide opioid prevention services. Treatment Systems for Homeless.--The Committee includes an increase of $728,000 to support services for people with alcohol or another SUD and who are experiencing homelessness, including youth, veterans, and families. Treatment, Recovery, and Workforce Support.--The Committee includes an increase of $2,000,000 for Treatment, Recovery, and Workforce Support, as authorized by section 7183 of the SUPPORT Act (P.L. 115-271). This program will help implement evidence- based programs to support individuals in SUD treatment and recover to live independently and participate in the workforce. Youth Prevention and Recovery Initiative.--The Committee includes $4,000,000 for the Youth Prevention and Recovery Initiative, as authorized by section 7102 of the SUPPORT Act (P.L. 115-271), to create a competitive grant program for health care providers and other entities to create SUD treatment and prevention programs that include the appropriate use of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) for adolescents and young adults. The Committee notes access to treatment for individuals experiencing SUD is critical. The use of MOUD has been shown to be a safe and effective treatment for SUD. However, access to MOUD for adolescents and young adults remains low. In order to provide MOUD to those who need it, adolescent health care providers must have the ability to prescribe these drugs and must also have access to the latest resources and training to be able to dispense MOUD safely and effectively. State Opioid Response Grants The Committee includes $1,775,000,000 for State Opioid Response (SOR) grants, an increase of $250,000,000. The Committee further directs SAMHSA to ensure that these resources continue to be managed by State alcohol and drug agencies defined as the agency that manages the Substance Use Prevention and Treatment Block Grant under part B of title X of the PHS Act. This approach will ensure continuity of funding, effective coordination of efforts, and decrease fragmentation within each State system. The Committee supports efforts from SAMHSA through SOR grants to expand access to SUD treatments in rural and underserved communities, including through funding and technical assistance. The Committee encourages SAMHSA to continue to focus on expanding access to evidence-based MOUD in counties that lack providers who are actively dispensing or prescribing MOUD. SOR Funding Cliff.--The Committee remains concerned that longstanding guidance to the Department to avoid a significant cliff between States with similar mortality rates was overlooked in the award for fiscal year 2020 funds. When the determination of new award amounts is made in fiscal year 2023, the Committee urges the SAMHSA to award funds to avoid funding cliffs between States with similar mortality rates. Substance Use Prevention and Treatment Block Grant The Committee includes a program level of $2,408,079,000 for the Substance Use Prevention and Treatment Block Grant (SUBG), an increase of $500,000,000. SUBG provides funding to States to support alcohol and drug use prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation services. The Committee recognizes the critical role the block grant plays in State systems across the country, giving States the flexibility to direct resources to address the most pressing needs of localities across the State. The Committee also recognizes that the 20 percent prevention set-aside within the SUBG is a vital source of funding for primary prevention. The prevention set-aside represents an average of 62 percent of all State alcohol and drug agency's budget for primary prevention and is essential to ending the substance misuse crisis. In addition, the Committee includes new language to use HIV cases, as opposed to AIDS cases, to calculate the HIV set-aside in the SUBG. SUBG Recovery Set-Aside.--The Committee establishes a 10 percent set-aside within total SUBG funding for the provision of evidence-informed SUD non-clinical recovery supports and services. The Committee directs SAMHSA to ensure that this set- aside shall support programs that: 1) develop local recovery community support institutions including but not limited to recovery community centers, recovery homes, and recovery schools or programs to mobilize resources within and outside of the recovery community, to increase the prevalence and quality of long-term recovery from SUD; 2) provide peer-based recovery coaching, individual or group supports, to individuals and families led by those with lived experience with SUD, delivered in person or using technology; 3) provide ancillary community- based supports necessary to sustain recovery, including access to transportation, job training, and educational services; 4) provide activities to reduce SUD recovery-related stigma and discrimination at the local level; and 5) provide technical assistance to organizations principally governed by people in recovery from SUD through facilitating financing, business functions and cross-training on evidence informed practices within the recovery community. The Committee directs SAMHSA to prioritize programs for underserved populations, to promote health equity, and to support community-based strategies to increase recovery capital and support individuals to sustain long-term recovery, as identified at the local, regional and/or State level by the recovery community. Funds from the recovery set-aside will help support operating costs for organizations that provide the above services, prioritizing those with leadership, staffing, and governance structures that include representation from those identified as in long-term recovery and impacted family members who reflect the community served. Block Grant Reporting Requirements.--The Committee acknowledges the important role of the Mental Health and Substance Use Prevention and Treatment Block Grants in supporting States' efforts to provide resources for expanded mental health and SUD treatment and prevention services. The Committee is concerned with the lack of transparency and information that is provided to Congress and the public about how States are distributing those funds and what programs or services they are going toward. The Committee continues to encourage SAMHSA to implement public reporting on their existing block grants. The Committee looks forward to receiving the report on data collection and reporting barriers requested in House Report 117-96. Fentanyl Awareness Education.--The Committee notes that the SUBG may be used to develop educational materials related to the dangers of fentanyl, including the lethalness of small quantities. Contingency Management.--The Committee is aware that contingency management, also known as motivational incentives, is an evidence-based treatment method for individuals with SUD, particularly for substances such as stimulants that currently have no FDA-approved pharmacological intervention. Current interpretation of Federal laws and regulations constrain the ability of individuals and entities to use Federal funding for appropriate contingency management program incentives. The Committee urges SAMHSA, in coordination with the Office of Inspector General, to reevaluate the limitations on the use of cash and cash-equivalent payments offered as part of contingency management in the treatment of SUD to better align them with current research. Data Collection for SUD Grants to States.--The Committee is aware that in November 2020, the GAO issued a report (GAO-21- 96) recommending that school-based drug prevention programs under SUBG and SOR better report how their activities contribute to the National Drug Control Strategy's prevention education goals. A GAO report issued in December 2021 (GAO-22- 104520) recommends further analysis and clarification of data collected through the SOR program. The Committee encourages SAMHSA to fully adopt the recommendations in these reports and requests an update in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification on the implementation of these recommendations. Evidence-Based Practices To Combat the Opioid Crisis.--The Committee directs SAMSHA to encourage States to use grant funds provided to combat the SUD crisis to prioritize evidence-based best practices exemplified by the States, including but not limited to: MAT, Overdose Education and Naloxone Distribution, Warm Handoff Protocols for Overdose Survivors Discharged from Emergency Rooms, and peer recovery support groups. The Committee directs that SAMHSA-funded SUD treatment and recovery activities shall include evidence-based, self-empowering, mutual aid recovery support programs that expressly support MAT. Evidence-Based Programs for People Experiencing Homelessness.--The Committee recognizes the importance of access to SUD treatment for individuals experiencing homelessness. The Committee encourages SAMHSA to prioritize disseminating evidence-based programs and treatments specifically tailored for those with SUD(s) and who are at a high risk of becoming homeless, and to consider grant applications that include targeting resources to address SUD within the homeless population. Medications for Opioid Use Disorder.--The Center for Substance Use Services is urged to include as an allowable use of funds (all FDA approved) medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and other clinically appropriate services to treat opioid use disorder. Opioid Use Disorder Relapse.--The Committee recognizes that return to use (or recurrence of symptoms) might occur after OUD treatment. The Committee appreciates SAMHSA's efforts to address this by emphasizing the importance of adherence to evidence-based practices that have been demonstrated to reduce the risk of return to use (or recurrence of symptoms) and encourages SAMHSA to disseminate and emphasize implementation of these practices in all settings where treatment is offered, including rehabilitation and criminal justice settings. Recovery Housing.--The Committee recognizes the importance of recovery housing, in which individuals abstain from use of non-prescribed substances in a supportive environment. In order to increase the availability of high-quality recovery housing, the Committee encourages SAMHSA to collaborate with other Federal agencies, including HUD, the Department of Labor, the Department of Justice, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, to coordinate activities across the Federal government and develop recommendations to improve policies on recovery housing and support services spanning the continuum of care. SUD Response in Rural America.--The Committee encourages SAMHSA to support initiatives to advance SUD objectives in rural areas, specifically focusing on addressing the needs of individuals with SUD in rural and medically-underserved areas, and programs that stress a comprehensive community-based approach involving academic institutions, health care providers, and local criminal justice systems. SUBSTANCE USE PREVENTION SERVICES Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $218,219,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 311,912,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 248,434,000 Change from enacted level......................... +30,215,000 Change from budget request........................ -63,478,000 Within the total provided for Programs of Regional and National Significance, the Committee provides the following amounts: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ FY 2023 Budget Activity Committee ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Capacity: Strategic Framework................... $137,484,000 Strategic Prevention Framework Rx............ 15,000,000 Federal Drug-Free Workplace...................... 4,894,000 Minority AIDS Initiative......................... 43,170,000 Sober Truth on Preventing Underage Drinking...... 14,500,000 National Adult-Oriented Media Public Service 2,000,000 Campaign....................................

Science and Service Program Coordination......... 4,072,000 Minority Fellowship Program...................... 2,321,000 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ At-Home Prescription Drug Disposal Demonstration and Evaluation.--The Committee is aware that many unused and unwanted prescription opioids and other powerful medications remain in homes and are subject to diversion. The Committee includes $5,000,000 for an at-home drug deactivation and disposal demonstration and evaluation initiative and urges SAMHSA to make a diverse selection of grantees including urban, rural, and tribal government partners. The initiative will assess the effectiveness of drug disposal technologies that meet the standard in section 3032 of the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act (21 U.S.C. 355-1(e)(4)(B)). Center for the Application of Prevention Technologies.--The Committee includes an increase of $4,500,000 for the Center for the Application of Prevention Technologies. The Committee encourages SAMHSA to ensure eligibility for private, non- profit, and regional organizations, including faith-based organizations for the Center for the Application of Prevention Technologies. The broad coalitions orchestrated by these regional organizations are uniquely positioned to supplement the work already being done by the State, tribal, and community organizations currently authorized for such grants. Eliminating Racial Disparities in Overdose Deaths.--The Committee is concerned with the rising rates of overdose deaths in communities of color, specifically among Black people. These racial disparities are made worse by the fact that access to treatment is often dependent on race, income, geography, and insurance status, rather than individual preferences, or medical or psychiatric indicators and needs. The Committee urges SAMHSA to scale programs in communities of color, including increased outreach capacity, to help eliminate racial disparities in overdose deaths and improve access to prevention and treatment services. PTSD in First Responders.--The Committee looks forward to receiving the report requested in House Report 117-96 that examines post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in individuals working in civilian first responder disciplines of law enforcement, fire services, and emergency medical services. Sober Truth on Preventing Underage Drinking Act.--The Committee includes an increase of $2,500,000 for the Sober Truth on Preventing Underage Drinking (STOP) Act. Of this amount, the Committee includes an increase of $2,500,000 for the Community Based Enhancement Grant Program to help community coalitions address underage drinking. Strategic Prevention Framework.--The Committee provides an increase of $10,000,000 for the Strategic Prevention Framework (SPF). Of this amount, the Committee includes an increase of $5,000,000 for SPF for Prescription Drugs (SPF Rx). Tribal Behavioral Grants.--The Committee includes an increase of $4,250,000 to expand efforts to address the high incidence of substance misuse and suicide among AI/AN populations. HEALTH SURVEILLANCE AND PROGRAM SUPPORT Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $291,658,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 181,073,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 288,707,000 Change from enacted level......................... -2,951,000 Change from budget request........................ +107,634,000 The Committee provides the following amounts for Health Surveillance and Program Support: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ FY 2023 Budget Activity Committee ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Health Surveillance.................................. $53,295,000 PHS Evaluation Funds............................. 30,428,000 Program Support...................................... 85,000,000 Public Awareness and Support......................... 13,260,000 Performance and Quality Information Systems.......... 10,200,000 Drug Abuse Warning Network........................... 15,000,000 Behavioral Health Workforce.......................... 1,000,000 PHS Evaluation Funds............................. 1,000,000 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Community Project Funding.--Within the funds included in this account, $110,952,000 shall be used for the projects, and in the amounts, specified in the table titled ``Labor, HHS, Education Incorporation of Community Project Funding Items'' at the end of this report. State Opioid Response Network-Technical Assistance.--The Committee directs SAMHSA to continue funding the State Opioid Response Network-Technical Assistance grant that funds the Opioid Response Network to provide locally based technically assistance teams within the administrative portion of the appropriated amounts for SOR grants. The Committee recognizes the essential work currently being done by the Opioid Response Network in delivering technical assistance to SOR grantees, sub-recipients and others addressing opioid use disorder and stimulant use disorder in their communities. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality HEALTHCARE RESEARCH AND QUALITY Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $350,400,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 415,891,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 385,000,000 Change from enacted level......................... +34,600,000 Change from budget request........................ -30,891,000 The Committee includes $385,000,000 for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), $34,600,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. AHRQ's mission is to produce evidence to make health care safer, higher quality, more accessible, equitable, and affordable, and to work within HHS and with other partners to make sure that the evidence is understood and used. AHRQ conducts, supports, and disseminates scientific and policy- relevant research on topics such as promoting high-quality care, eliminating health care disparities, using information technology, and evaluating the effectiveness of clinical services. Within the total for AHRQ, the House includes the following amounts: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Budget Activity FY 2023 Committee ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Scientific Support for the US Preventive Services 11,542,000 Task Force.......................................... Digital Health Care Research......................... 16,349,000 Patient Safety Research.............................. 99,615,000 Health Services Research, Data, and Dissemination.... 110,312,000 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey..................... 71,791,000 Program Management................................... 75,391,000 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Antimicrobial Resistance.--The Committee continues to provide no less than $10,000,000 for activities related to combating antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Center for Primary Care Research.--The Committee includes no less than $5,000,000 for the Center for Primary Care Research authorized at 42 USC 299b-4(b). Improving Maternal Morbidity and Mortality State and Local Data.--The Committee supports efforts described in the fiscal year 2023 budget request to improve the provision of timely and accurate data about maternal health and the health care system to policymakers, health care providers, and the public. Long COVID.--The Committee supports efforts described in the fiscal year 2023 budget request regarding health systems research on how to organize and deliver patient-centered care for people living with long COVID, including the use of digital and telehealth, providing needed mentoring and support to smaller communities to establish multidisciplinary clinics to care for people with complex cases of long COVID, and enhancing the ability of primary care practices to use emerging evidence to care for millions of Americans with long COVID. Diagnostic Safety.--The Committee includes no less than $20,000,000, a $10,000,000 increase above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the fiscal year 2023 budget request, to fund AHRQ research, testing, and solutions to avoid diagnostic error and to support Diagnostic Safety Centers of Excellence to disseminate related findings. Funding provided will support eight centers, with each center focusing on specific conditions, populations, or settings of diagnostic safety as noted in the fiscal year 2023 budget request. Person-Reported Experience of Care Quality Maternal Health Measures.--The Committee is concerned that the U.S. spends significantly more per capita on childbirth than any other high-income nation, with costs estimated to be well over $50 billion annually, and yet despite this expenditure ranks far behind almost all other high-income countries in birth outcomes for both mothers and babies, including high and deeply inequitable rates of preterm birth, low birth weight, and maternal and infant mortality. Quality measures are important drivers of quality improvement in health care, and their significance is growing in the context of increasing alternative payment model mechanisms for accountability. The portfolio of nationally-endorsed maternity care quality measures is small and includes no person-reported measures of the experience of receiving maternal-newborn care. Given widespread reports, especially among of people of color, of experiencing disrespectful maternity care, and of persistent inequitable health outcomes, the need for nationally-endorsed person-reported measures of maternity care to discern, track and improve maternal-newborn care experiences is crucial. The Committee strongly encourages AHRQ to develop maternity adaptations of the generic Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems surveys and other evidence-based assessment tools as necessary for facilities, health plans, and individual/group clinicians to fill these crucial gaps in maternal and newborn health measures. The Committee requests that the measures be designed to capture and reduce inequities and measure care across the continuum of maternity care providers and care settings, as well at the health plan level. Such measures will elevate birthing people's voices in standardized ways that foster accountability and quality improvement. Statewide Surgical Quality Initiatives.--The Committee is aware that several States have moved aggressively to combine the knowledge, skills, and resources of diverse hospitals across the State with the expertise of foundations, hospital associations, and other outside stakeholders to identify and disseminate best practices in surgical care. The goals of the collaborative are to improve surgical outcomes, improve the value (quality/cost) of surgical care, and decrease disparities in care. The Committee urges AHRQ to prioritize grants to States that have developed such collaborations and intend to expand by adding more hospitals and incorporate telehealth and mobile solutions into higher-value care. Trafficking Awareness Training for Health Care.--The Committee strongly encourages AHRQ to support activities authorized under the Trafficking Awareness Training for Health Care Act to award, on a competitive basis, grants or contracts to eligible entities to train health care professionals to recognize and respond to victims of a severe form of trafficking for purposes authorized under the Trafficking Awareness Training for Health Care Act. Medical professionals are in a unique position to identify abuse and help victims of trafficking, and this program will support training to enable them to do so. United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).--In fiscal year 2022, the Committee expressed its initial concerns about significant deficiencies in the process and structure of the USPSTF, as illustrated by its recommendations concerning screening mammography and cervical cancer screening. The Committee addressed the need for comprehensive USPSTF reform to ensure that its recommendations further public health for all Americans and address health inequities by outlining several recommendations. Within 120 days of enactment of this Act, the Committee requests an update from USPSTF on its implementation of the recommendations identified to reform its process for developing recommendations. The Committee also is concerned about the ability of the USPSTF to keep pace with medical innovation. Emerging and innovative screening modalities can further public health for all Americans and address health inequities by increasing access to and compliance with USPSTF recommended screenings. The Committee encourages USPSTF to utilize the Early Topic Update process described in the USPSTF procedure manual to review a recommendation on an enhanced timeframe upon a showing of new evidence. The Committee also encourages USPSTF to prioritize review of any new screening test or preventive medication approved or cleared by the FDA that is a preventive strategy or modality pertaining to but not included in a previous Task Force recommendation. In addition to prioritization, the Committee encourages the Task Force to act on such prioritization in a timely manner. Within 120 days of enactment of this Act, the Committee requests an update from USPSTF on its use of the Early Topic Update process. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services GRANTS TO STATES FOR MEDICAID Appropriation, fiscal year 2022................... $368,666,106,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023.................. 367,357,090,000 Committee Recommendation.......................... 367,357,090,000 Change from enacted level..................... -1,309,016,000 Change from budget request.................... - - - Medicaid provides health coverage to eligible populations, including eligible low-income adults, children, pregnant women, elderly adults, and people with disabilities. Medicaid is administered by States, according to Federal requirements. The program is funded jointly by States and the Federal government. This amount does not include $165,722,018,000, which was provided as advance funding for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. In addition, the Committee recommends an advance appropriation of $197,580,474,000 for program costs in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, to remain available until expended. The Committee continues bill language providing indefinite budget authority for unanticipated costs in fiscal year 2023. Federal Medicaid grants reimburse States for a portion of their expenditures in providing health care for individuals whose income and resources fall below specified levels. Subject to certain minimum requirements, States are provided certain limited authority within the law to set eligibility, coverage, and payment levels. PAYMENTS TO THE HEALTH CARE TRUST FUNDS Appropriation, fiscal year 2022................ $487,862,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023............... 548,130,000,000 Committee Recommendation....................... 548,130,000,000 Change from enacted level.................. +60,268,000,000 Change from budget request................. - - - This account includes the general fund subsidy to the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund for Medicare Part B benefits, and Medicare drug benefits and administration, as well as other reimbursements to the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund for benefits and related to administrative costs, which have not been financed by payroll taxes or premium contributions. The Committee continues bill language providing indefinite authority to pay the general revenue portion of the Medicare Part B premium match and providing resources for the Medicare Part D drug benefit program in the event that the annual appropriation is insufficient. PROGRAM MANAGEMENT Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $4,024,744,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 4,346,985,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 4,346,985,000 Change from enacted level......................... +322,241,000 Change from budget request........................ - - - Note: The fiscal year 2022 appropriation includes funding provided in section 227 of P.L. 117-103. Program Operations The Committee includes $2,957,300,000 for Program Operations, an increase of $122,477,000. This appropriation includes funding for Research, Demonstration, and Evaluation, which was previously funded on its own line. This office administers the programs under the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), funds beneficiary outreach and education, maintains information technology infrastructure needed to support various claims processing systems, and supports other programmatic improvements. Access to Buprenorphine.--The Committee is concerned by reports of patients not being able to fill buprenorphine prescriptions at pharmacies. The Committee requests a briefing from CMS and OIG within 180 days of the date of enactment of this Act on the results of the current audits examining access to and use of medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and CMS's intended response. Advancements in Breast Reconstruction.--The Committee notes that reconstruction after mastectomy can have a significant, positive impact on the quality of life for breast cancer survivors. For this reason, the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act (WHCRA) was enacted in 1998 to provide insurance protections to women choosing breast reconstruction after a mastectomy. The number of breast reconstructions performed in the U.S. has steadily increased over the past two decades. Over the same timeframe, significant technological procedure advancements have shifted the focus beyond cosmetic-only results to include the restoration of typical breast functions, such as sensation. Sensory restoration as a part of breast reconstruction can ultimately improve the overall physical and emotional health, safety, and quality of life for breast cancer survivors. The Committee directs CMS, in collaboration with other HHS agencies with necessary expertise, to study the landscape of surgical techniques and other procedures for breast reconstruction, and whether gaps exist in the insurance coverage provided by the WHCRA. The Committee requests an update in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification on this study. Adverse Childhood Experiences.--The Committee is aware that childhood trauma and toxic stress have been linked to negative health outcomes through adulthood, including higher rates of diabetes, stroke, depression, lapses in cognitive abilities, and developmental delays, suicide, and substance misuse, among other negative outcomes. Low-income children are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). The Committee directs CMS to comply with the language included in House Report 116-450 which requires the agency to work with the National Child Traumatic Stress Network and the CDC to provide a report, no later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, that evaluates how Medicaid could be further leveraged to screen, diagnose, and provide evidence- based interventions to children ages 0-21 suffering from ACEs. Biosimilars.--The Committee is concerned about the lack of access to lower cost biosimilars to beneficiaries within the Medicare Part D program. The Committee encourages CMS to examine existing barriers to biosimilar adoption and to explore the development of policies that incentivize and facilitate the adoption of biosimilar to reduce prescription drug costs to patients and Medicare. The Committee urges CMS to provide beneficiary focused education on the availability, safety, and efficacy of biosimilars and the potential for lower out-of- pocket costs. CMS should include this information in Medicare Plan Finder and in Real Time Benefit tools. CMS should also prioritize policies to accelerate the adoption of all biosimilars on Medicare Advantage and Part D formularies. Cardiac Computed Tomography.--The Committee notes that unstable and low Medicare payment for cardiac computed tomography (CT) services is contributing to significant disparity in access to this vital service among minority populations. The Committee requests a report within 90 days of the date of enactment of this Act on actions being taken by the agency to address this inequity. Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists.--The Committee is aware that during the COVID-19 pandemic, Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (CRNAs) have been working under a waiver that expanded access to care for CRNA services. With the current workforce shortages in the healthcare industry, the Committee urges HHS to consider options to permanently extend waivers that will help best utilize the current workforce to improve access to care before the end of the COVID-19 public health emergency. Children's Mental Health.--The Committee is aware of reporting in recent years on trends in behavioral health services for children insured by Medicaid, including increased reliance on psychotropic medications without accompanying behavioral health services, a lack of home- and community-based services options, and children in Medicaid from racially/ ethnically diverse backgrounds being less likely than white children to use behavioral health services. The Committee requests a report within 180 days of the date of enactment of this Act on Medicaid spending for children, youth, and young adolescents on behavioral health, disaggregated by race and ethnicity. This report should include data on the settings in which children and youth receive services, the use of psychotropic medications in this population, a breakdown of mental health services and substance use services, and whether children who received outpatient treatment received care in their state of residence. Colorectal Cancer Screenings.--The Committee commends CMS for removing cost sharing requirements for patients for the removal of potential precancerous or cancerous polyps during a screening colonoscopy. However, the Committee urges CMS to explore options to fully remove any barrier to access to colonoscopies by also waiving cost-sharing requirements for beneficiaries that select a covered non-invasive colorectal screening test who receive a positive test result and require a colonoscopy. At home colorectal cancer screening tests are an important tool to encourage increased adoption of colorectal cancer screenings and should be treated equal to a screening colonoscopy under CMS's reimbursement policy. Compounded Medications.--The Committee continues to request a report, within 120 days of the date of enactment of this Act, assessing Medicare's current policy for Part D coverage of medications compounded using bulk drug ingredients. Consensus on Assessing Mobility.--The Committee encourages CMS and other stakeholders to promote development of consensus around a mobility assessment that is validated and clinically meaningful to providers and patients. In addition, CMS should evaluate feasibility of a mobility quality measure to incentivize providers to actively intervene to prevent mobility loss among hospitalized older adults. Contraceptive Access under the Affordable Care Act.--The Committee is concerned about access to care for patients seeking preventive services, including contraceptive services. The Committee directs CMS to engage in patient education to ensure patients understand their rights under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to access (without cost sharing) the contraceptive product that is determined best for the patient, in consultation with their health care provider. In addition, the Committee directs CMS to engage with health care providers to disseminate the latest guidance on contraceptive access for patients, as well as how to help patients seek access to contraceptive services (without cost sharing) through a health insurance plan's exceptions process. Consumer Assistance Program.--The Committee encourages the Secretary to allocate up to $400,000,000 derived from ACA user fees to restore Consumer Assistance Program grants under section 1002 of the ACA. Cost-Sharing for Vaccines.--The Committee notes that minimizing cost sharing with Medicare Part D is critical to ensuring that Medicare beneficiaries have access to vaccines that can prevent serious disease. Studies have shown a direct correlation between cost sharing and increased abandonment rates of vaccines. To help reduce these barriers, the Committee encourages CMS to update the Medicare plan finder to clearly designate to consumers the plans that cover vaccines at no cost. Dementia Care Management Model.--The Committee urges the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) consider how best to test a Medicare dementia care management model. The Committee encourages CMMI to continue working with stakeholders to find a way to test a value-based dementia care management model that could reach dementia patients across the stages and include coordinated care management and caregivers. The Committee requests an update not later than one year after the date of enactment of this Act on the progress for this model. Diabetes Self-Management Training Benefit.--The Committee is concerned that barriers to accessing the Medicare diabetes self-management training benefit, particularly among communities of color, have resulted in utilization by only five percent of newly diagnosed Medicare beneficiaries. The Committee looks forward to receiving the report addressing the barriers to accessing the diabetes self-management training benefit, as requested in House Report 117-96. Disability Clinical Care.--The Committee is aware of a recent National Council on Disability (NCD) report entitled ``Enforceable Accessible Medical Equipment Standards--A Necessary Means to Address the Health Care Needs of People with Mobility Disabilities,'' which identified inaccessible medical equipment among the reasons for the susceptibility of people with disabilities to experience substandard health care, citing numerous studies documenting access barriers involving medical equipment and the health disparities experienced by millions of people with disabilities. NCD raised concerns that people with physical disabilities often postpone or delay care due to the inability to get onto exam tables and other diagnostic equipment and have to search for facilities that have such equipment. Relatedly, NCD has recently advised Congress and the Administration regarding the nexus between the lack of disability clinical care training for health care professionals and the well-documented health disparities experienced by people with disabilities. The Committee encourages CMS to examine including disability clinical care training and the availability of accessible medical and diagnostic equipment in its conditions of participation for Part A and Part B providers. Disproportionate Share Hospitals.--The Committee again encourages CMS to compile publicly available information on hospitals that receive payments under Medicaid as disproportionate share hospitals. Such information shall include the Medicaid inpatient utilization rate and low-income utilization rate. Within each category, CMS should further identify such hospitals by rural or urban status, number of beds, and status as a major teaching hospital. Domestic Manufacturing.--The Committee recognizes the importance of ensuring a robust U.S. manufacturing base and domestic supply chain to support Federal health programs. Therefore, the Committee urges CMS to develop and implement a pilot or demonstration program to identify innovative payment and reimbursement policies within Federal health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP, to support the utilization of U.S. manufactured generic and biosimilar medications to ensure increased access and utilization of life- saving and life-changing drugs. Drug Quality.--The Committee continues to be concerned about the discovery of dangerous levels of carcinogens in frequently prescribed medications, including angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) like losartan and valsartan, ranitidine, and metformin. As two of the country's largest payers for prescription medication, Medicare and Medicaid have a responsibility to help ensure the safety and quality of prescribed therapies. The Committee reiterates its request for a report on the amount that the Medicare and Medicaid programs spent on medication in the previous three fiscal years that was subsequently recalled by manufacturers, as requested in House Report 117-96. The Committee also requests that CMS consider the potential value of increased chemical testing of medication in the U.S. supply chain and quality rating systems for drug manufacturers. Enhancing Access to Recommended Vaccines.--The Committee is concerned that current regulations implementing the Public Health Service Act's (PHSA) provisions regarding vaccine coverage and cost-sharing have caused uneven access to CDC- recommended vaccines. The Committee encourages HHS, Department of Labor (DOL), and Department of the Treasury (Treasury) to act to ensure that its regulations fully implement section 2713 of the PHSA, which ensures broad-based coverage of all CDC- recommended vaccines without cost-sharing, including occupational and travel vaccines, regardless of whether the vaccine is recommended for routine use or placed on the CDC's Immunization Schedules. Ensuring Access to Lifesaving COVID-19 Oral Medications from Pharmacists.--The Committee is concerned with CMS's guidance ``Permissible Flexibilities Related to Oral Antiviral Drugs for Treatment of COVID-19 that May Receive U.S. Food and Drug Administration Emergency Use Authorization and are Procured by the U.S. Government,'' which only encourages, but does not require, Part D ``sponsors to consider paying a dispensing fee for these drugs that may be higher than a sponsor's usual negotiated dispensing fees given the unique circumstances during the public health emergency.'' The Committee is concerned about patients' access to these lifesaving medications and encourages CMS to review policy options for Part D sponsors to cover all the necessary services to ensure the safe pharmacy dispensing of COVID-19 oral medications. GAO Report on Health Care Consolidation.--The Committee recognizes the need for more research on consolidation in health care markets. As such, the Committee directs GAO to study the extent health care consolidation is taking place across Medicare and Medicaid, and how the involvement of private equity in healthcare could be contributing to consolidation. The Committee requests a briefing, including GAO and CMS, within 90 days of the date of enactment of this Act to discuss the scope and requirements of the study, and expects to receive regular updates from GAO about the status of the report and any initial critical findings. Geographic Practice Cost Index.--The Committee encourages CMS to publish its work on a rationale for current methodology for the Geographic Practice Cost Index so that the various inputs can be better understood. In addition, the Committee requests a briefing from the GAO within 90 days of the date of enactment of this Act on the results from the recent GAO report on geographic adjustments to Medicare physician payments (GAO- 22-103876). Graduate Medical Education.--The Committee notes that in section 126 of P.L. 116-260, Congress provided an additional 1,000 new graduate medical education (GME) slots eligible for Medicare payment. In section 126, Congress specified four categories of hospitals eligible for additional GME slots: hospitals located in rural areas; hospitals currently training over their caps; hospitals located in States with new medical schools; and hospitals serving Health Professional Shortage Areas; however, when CMS released their final plan for the distribution of the 1,000 new slots, a ``super prioritization'' based on location of resident training was created that is not found in the statute. The Committee urges CMS to prioritize applications in fiscal year 2023 from any hospitals seeking to establish or expand residency training in certain needed specialties, such as primary care, geriatrics, and general surgery, as had been the priority with previous GME slot distribution programs. Hospitals in the U.S. Virgin Islands.--The Committee remains concerned that Medicare payments for hospitals in the U.S. Virgin Islands are calculated using out-of-date payment data and formulas under the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA). The two hospitals in the U.S. Virgin Islands are reimbursed based on 1982 and 1996 costs. As a result, patients are forced to travel outside the territory for necessary services, including total joint replacements and chemotherapy, often at great expense and personal hardship. The Committee encourages CMS to update the TEFRA base period for these hospitals to more accurately reflect current conditions and costs. IMD Exclusion Pilot Program.--The Committee is aware that although HHS allows waivers to States allowing short-term stays in Institutions for Mental Disease (IMD) for mental health treatment, there are IMDs that provide care to thousands of individuals in acute psychiatric distress located in States without waivers. The Committee continues to urge CMS to pursue a pilot program, as outlined in House Report 117-96. IMD Exclusion Report.--The Committee continues to request a report, as included in House Report 117-96, examining how repealing Medicaid's IMD exclusion could affect access to and quality of mental health services, including mental health services for nonelderly, Medicaid-eligible adults. The report should include a cost estimate for repealing the exclusion. Infectious Disease Outbreaks.--The Committee requests a briefing within 90 days of the date of enactment of this Act on policy and administrative options, including a modifier to current evaluation and management (E/M) codes for infectious disease physicians and other types of clinicians, that CMS could take to reimburse clinicians for critical activities associated with managing infectious disease outbreaks that would automatically initiate payment to clinicians under the Physician Fee Schedule for services associated with these unanticipated events. Language Access.--The Committee recognizes the need to ensure that translated materials are culturally competent and written in a manner that can be adequately understood by limited English proficient populations (LEP). The Committee urges CMS to improve the quality and quantity of such materials, and consult community based organizations to help vet translated consumer-facing materials produced by CMS in at least the top 15 languages spoken by LEP people living in the United States. The Committee also encourages CMS to develop translation glossaries of common terms used within CMS programs in at least the top 15 languages spoken by LEP people. Limited Wraparound Coverage.--The Committee continues to remain concerned that the previous Administration allowed the limited wraparound coverage pilot program to expire. This failure has caused significant uncertainty for patients who depended on this program for several years. The Committee looks forward to receiving the report outlining a plan to ensure that participants impacted by the expiration of the pilot program will receive benefits equivalent to those of the limited wraparound coverage program as requested in House Report 117- 96. This report should include an analysis of the outcomes of the pilot program and an explanation for the decision by HHS, DOL, and Treasury not to extend it. The Committee continues to recommend this pilot program be made permanent and encourages the HHS, DOL, and Treasury to restore the program. Lowering the Cost of Care.--The agreement continues to encourage CMMI to consider creative pilot projects that lower the cost of care among older Americans and enable individuals who retire overseas to retain and utilize their Medicare primary healthcare benefits. The pilot should consider potential cost savings involving international collaborations where the quality of care is comparable and less expensive. The Committee requests an update on this effort in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification. Maximizing Deceased Donor Organ Recovery, Acceptance, and Utilization.--The Committee supports full implementation of the CMS final rule for Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs) Conditions for Coverage (CMS-3380-F), including efforts to decertify underperforming OPOs in advance of 2026 given the lives, Medicare costs, and urgent equity issues at stake. OPO failures are disproportionately borne by patients of color, which means OPO reform is an urgent health equity issue. This fact further emphasizes the need for effective implementation of the Final Rule, and to ensure effective and equitable OPO performance, the Committee encourages CMS to require OPO process data to be publicly available, in line with international best practice. Medicaid Dental Audits.--The Committee has previously raised concerns that failure to use professional guidelines or established State Medicaid manual parameters in the auditing process can result in inaccurate Medicaid dental audits, negatively impacting dentist participation in the program and impeding patient access to care. While State Medicaid agencies (SMA) have significant responsibility in managing provider audits, the Committee believes that as part of CMS oversight of the Medicaid program, it is appropriate to issue guidance to SMAs concerning best practices in dental audits and offer training in such practices. The Committee again urges CMS to develop such guidance for SMAs and looks forward to receiving the report on steps taken to develop such guidance as requested in House Report 117-96. Medicaid Parity in Territories.--The Committee supports the Administration's proposal to eliminate the Medicaid allotment caps for U.S. Territories and to align the territories' Federal matching rate to that of the States. Medicare Advantage and Long-Term Acute Care Hospitals (LTCHs).--The Committee is aware there is concern there are more barriers to LTCHs and Inpatient Rehabilitation Facilities (IRFs) in Medicare Advantage (MA) plans as compared to traditional Medicare. The Committee requests CMS review whether MA plan pre-authorization requirements and their use of proprietary or home-grown algorithms or admission criteria are consistent with current Medicare Part A coverage policy to protect MA enrollees' statutory right to comparable benefits. The review should also determine the validity of Medicare Advantage Plans denials of admissions to LTCH and IRF based on not offering the benefit of a Medicare approved level of care; verify that personnel being utilized by MA plans for pre- authorizations and denials have the necessary specialized rehabilitation education and training when requests from LTCHs and IRFs are being reviewed; review MA plans' process to provide pre-authorization review and appeals for denials within reasonable amount of time of planned discharge, including weekends, to allow for accelerated transfer to LTCHs and IRFs when necessary; review transparency of MA plans on how they determine medical necessity, as well as the specific standards and guidelines that lead to a denial; review transparency of MA Plans with regard to medical necessity, the number of initial pre-authorization denials, the number of initial denials overturned, and the number of second level appeals for pre- authorization for LTCHs and IRFs. Medicare Advantage Coverage of Substance Use Services.--The Committee is aware that enrollees of Medicare Advantage (MA) plans may face barriers to accessing timely and appropriate care for substance use disorder (SUD) compared to enrollees of other insurers. The Committee urges CMS to review how MA plans can improve access to care for SUD, including by measuring provider availability as part of network adequacy standards, such as by maintaining sufficient networks of providers for SUD and mental health care. The Committee also urges CMS to review how MA plans can improve access to care for SUD, including through reviewing level of care assessment tools that reflect generally accepted standards of care and informing beneficiaries of the plan's responsibility to arrange for medically necessary care outside of the network, but at in- network cost sharing, if the covered service is not provided in network. The Committee requests a report in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification on updates since the October 2020 report required by P.L. 115-271 on SUD treatment services that are provided by MA plans as supplemental benefits. Medicare Advantage Overpayments.--The Committee is concerned about the accuracy of CMS's payments to Medicare Advantage (MA) plans. The Committee urges CMS to consider making the following adjustments to MA plan payments: use the Demographic Estimate of Coding Intensity (DECI) model to evaluate the relationship of fee-for-service and MA risk scores for the overall system and plan sponsors; develop a Coding Intensity Adjustment (CIA) factors applied to MA payments using the DECI model; calculate the CIA factor to be used in MA Payments; set limits on the use of select factors and data for risk adjustment systems and risk score calculations; and use social determinants of health data in a potential new risk adjustment model. The Committee requests a report within 180 days of the date of enactment of this Act analyzing the impact of these potential adjustments on the accuracy of payments to MA plans. Medicare Coverage of Behavioral Health Services.--The Committee is concerned there is insufficient Medicare coverage of community-based behavioral health services for individuals in crisis. The Committee requests a report in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification on addressing the scope of Medicare coverage of behavioral health services for outpatient behavioral and mental health services. This report should include information on the total amount of Medicare spending on behavioral and mental health services in calendar years 2019 through 2021 by site of service, the amount spent on each code for services that could be furnished to individuals in behavioral or mental health crisis, and the provider types that billed for these services. Medicare Coverage of Home-based Extended Care Services.-- The Committee encourages CMS to consider options to improve extended care services for Medicare beneficiaries, such as through home-based extended care by home health agencies. Medicare Coverage of Medicines to Treat Obesity.--The Committee notes that access to obesity treatment, including anti-obesity medication is an important part of the Administration's effort to combat chronic disease, reduce health care costs and improve care. Obesity is associated with over 200 comorbid conditions and is a driver of health care costs and poor health outcomes for patients with heart disease, Alzheimer's, diabetes, cancer, among many others, and is a top modifiable risk factor for serious COVID-19 outcomes. Furthermore, consistent with the President's Executive Order on Advancing Racial Equity, the Committee acknowledges that obesity is a chronic disease that disproportionately impacts communities of color. Therefore, consistent with the Administration's priorities, the Committee believes and that it is a matter of health equity and key to reducing modifiable risk factors for cancer and Alzheimer's disease, to ensure that seniors have access to obesity treatments under Medicare Part D to complement coverage of intensive behavioral therapy and bariatric surgery under Medicare Part B. The Committee encourages CMS to ensure access to treatments for obesity in Part D by clarifying that an agent for ``weight loss'' does not include an FDA-approved anti-obesity agent as classified by the United States Pharmacopeia Drug Classification system. Mental Health Parity.--The Committee was pleased to see the 2022 Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA) Report to Congress from HHS, DOL, and Treasury implementing section 203 of Division BB of P.L. 116-260. The report points out, however, that several health insurance plans and issuers failed to accurately and timely submit comparative analyses on nonquantitative treatment limits (NQTLs). This has resulted in HHS, DOL, and Treasury being unable to issue final determinations of non-compliance, thus limiting enforcement of MHPAEA. The Committee urges the Secretary of HHS, jointly with DOL and Treasury, to complete its determinations of non- compliance and make public the findings related to NQTLs found to be in violation of MHPAEA. While it is encouraging that plans and issuers chose to remove problematic provisions voluntarily, the report suggests there has been sufficient denial of mental health services through the use of NQTLs. Navigators.--The Committee strongly supports the Navigators program, which helps consumers understand their health coverage options and sign up for health insurance coverage during enrollment periods. The Committee urges CMS to return to providing robust funding for Navigator activities. Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome.--The Committee recognizes the increasing incidence of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) in the United States, including increasing hospital stays and rates of NOWS among Medicaid- covered births. The Committee is concerned there are currently no quality measures for NOWS and prenatal opioid exposure, and requests a report within 180 days of the date of enactment of this Act on recommendations for quality measures to be implemented for improving the quality, safety, value, and consistency of care for newborns with opioid-exposure, including NOWS. In developing these recommendations, CMS should consider how they can be used to advance health equity and promote person-centered care. The Committee encourages CMS to consider these recommendations in the next Child Core Set annual update. Nuclear Medicine Quality Improvement.--The Committee is aware of evidence demonstrating the occurrence and consequence of extravasations in nuclear medicine procedures. These events can harm patients through compromised imaging that negatively affects care, repeated or additional procedures, increased costs, and unintended irradiation to patient tissue. The Committee supports CMS engagement with outside stakeholders on the issue. Obesity and Comorbidities.--The Committee notes obesity is a disease, and it leads to serious and costly health issues, including diabetes, heart disease, stroke, certain chronic liver diseases like nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and some types of cancer. Comprehensive management of obesity requires both lifestyle changes and physician-guided support including access to innovative pharmacological treatments. The Committee requests additional information in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification on how policies in Medicare could be improved to help reduce obesity and its comorbidities for those Americans who require clinical interventions and reduce the racial and ethnic disparities in health care outcomes for beneficiaries suffering from obesity. Ovarian Cancer Testing.--The Committee recognizes that ovarian cancer is the only gender-specific cancer with greater than 50 percent mortality rate, and accounts for more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system, especially among women of color. African American women have a 62 percent five-year mortality rate compared to 54 percent for Caucasian women. The most commonly used detection method may miss ovarian cancer 37 to 67 percent of the time in African American women. Asian Pacific Islanders have a higher risk of developing ovarian clear cell cancer, Hispanic women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer at an earlier age than non- Hispanic groups, and there are significant regional differences in the incidence and mortality of ovarian cancer among Native American women in the United States. FDA-cleared medical innovations that use multi-marker testing for ovarian cancer can improve early detection in women, and especially women of color, but are not universally reimbursed. The Committee recommends CMS cover and pay for multi-marker testing related to ovarian cancer for Medicare beneficiaries. In addition, the Committee requests a report not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act with the status and timeline for a national coverage determination for multi-marker tests for ovarian cancer. Patient Access to Home Health Care.--The Committee supports the intent of the network adequacy rules of CMS for Medicare Advantage organizations and for Medicaid managed care organizations under 42 C.F.R. 438 and 457 to maintain a network of qualified providers sufficient to provide adequate access for covered services to meet the health care needs of the patient population served. The Committee requests a report within 180 days of the date of enactment of this Act on regulatory actions related to network adequacy. Patient Advocate Program.--The Committee is concerned about barriers hospitalized patients face during time of discharge and the subsequent coordination of care at discharge. Patients from historically underserved racial and cultural groups suffer the greatest challenges in terms of care coordination. While some patients are able to contribute to the decision making process regarding healthcare, there are other patients who are unable to fully comprehend the coordination of care at discharge, including: access to nurse case managers, social workers, and/or mental health care providers. The number of patients assigned to a nurse case manager or social worker is high. Therefore, an additional level of patient advocacy and support is critical to the ongoing coordination of safe patient care at discharge from acute care and/or acute rehabilitation facilities. The Committee recommends $10,000,000 for the development of a patient advocacy program to support improved coordination of care and improve patient care outcomes for all patients discharged from acute care or acute rehabilitation settings. The Committee also requests a report within 180 days of the date of enactment of this Act to assess barriers to coordination of care for hospitalized patients, address disparities by race, ethnicity, and culturally responsive care. In addition, the Committee makes these recommendations to improve patient access to care within a hospital and/or acute rehabilitation setting. Pediatric ESRD Services.--The Committee recognizes that children with end stage renal disease (ESRD) have unique care needs and require services that are not typically required by adult ESRD patients, including specialized nursing care, nutritional support, social workers, and child life specialists. The Committee commends CMS for focusing on pediatric case-mix adjustment in its December 2020 technical expert panel and requesting information on the adequacy of reimbursement for pediatric services in the request for information included in the calendar year 2022 End Stage Renal Disease Prospective Payment System Proposed Rule. The Committee requests an update in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification on progress towards establishing adequate bundled payments for pediatric ESRD services. Peripheral Artery Disease.--The Committee is aware that an estimated 20 million Americans have peripheral artery disease and about 200,000 of them, disproportionately people of color, suffer avoidable amputations every year as a result. The Committee urges CMS to raise public awareness in Medicare beneficiaries and providers of racial disparities in amputations due to peripheral artery disease, diabetes, and related comorbidities through a nationwide awareness and education campaign. Further, the Committee encourages the Secretary to establish an interagency working group in coordination with CMS, the Indian Health Service (IHS), and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and to study the implementation of a comprehensive amputation reduction program within CMS and IHS based on the VA Preventing Amputations in Veterans Everywhere Program. The Committee directs the Secretary to provide recommendations not later than one year after the date of enactment of this Act on how to reduce amputations. Pharmacists and Patient Care Services.--The Committee is aware that certain Medicare Part B services and care frameworks have provisions to include pharmacists and their patient care services. However, CMS has few mechanisms to identify and evaluate the contributions of pharmacists to patient care and outcomes or to identify barriers within current service requirements that prevent scalable involvement of pharmacists. The Committee encourages CMS to create a mechanism to provide greater visibility into the scope and outcomes of the Medicare services currently provided by pharmacists. Pharmacist-Provided Incident to Physician Services.--The Committee is pleased with CMS's recognition in the calendar year 2021 physician fee schedule (PFS) final rule (FR 84583) that ``pharmacists could be considered QHPs [qualified health care professionals] or clinical staff, depending on their role in a given service,'' and that ``new coding might be useful to specifically identify these particular models of care.'' However, the Committee remains concerned with current CMS PFS requirements restricting physicians' and nonphysician practitioners' (NPPs) utilizing pharmacists under incident to models to bill at the lowest E/M code (99211), with an estimated time commitment of 7 minutes. The Committee understands this restriction has diminished providers' engagement with pharmacists in team-based care models across the country. CMS should consider how to ensure physicians and NPPs can optimize the use of pharmacists. The Committee encourages CMS identify mechanisms to attribute, report, and sustain pharmacists' patient care contributions to beneficiaries in the Medicare Part B program. Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly.--The Committee notes during the COVID-19 pandemic, Programs of All- Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) have been effective in keeping their medically complex, nursing home eligible population safe at home. PACE organizations furnish all Medicare and Medicaid covered services, long term care and supports, meals and other services as needed by participants, principally in participants homes. PACE participants have had one-third the COVID-19 cases and deaths as compared to the rates of nursing home residents. The Committee urges CMS to consider moving forward on PACE-specific pilots in fiscal year 2023, so this community-based model of care may be evaluated as to whether it increases access and affordability for Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries. Psychosocial Rehabilitation Model.--The Committee is concerned about the high prevalence of loneliness and social isolation among Americans with severe mental illness (SMI), especially given the body of research indicating that these factors, along with other social determinants of health, can strongly affect mental and physical health outcomes for this population. The Committee encourages CMS to explore alternative payment models that better reflect the significant health, economic, and overall societal benefits associated with alleviating social isolation among people with SMI. The Committee encourages CMS to consider how CMMI could integrate the value associated with reducing social isolation for people with SMI in current and future value-based models; how the Center for Clinical Standards of Quality could identify patient-reported outcome measures related to social isolation and loneliness that could be included in current and future value-based models; and how the Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services (CMCS) could encourage State Medicaid agencies to contract with payers that offer comprehensive psychosocial rehabilitation services that reduce social isolation and improve quality of life for people with SMI. Radiation Oncology Model.--Despite the delay in implementation, the Committee is concerned that the radiation oncology (RO) model as currently proposed could potentially reduce access to certain types of radiation therapy and negatively affect patient outcomes. The Committee looks forward to the report on the RO model requested in House Report 116- 450. In addition, the Committee encourages CMS to work with stakeholders to develop a RO model that supports patients access to care, patient quality, and the Medicare trust funds. Rare Diseases.--The Committee recognizes patients with rare and ultra-rare diseases experience significant challenges, and such challenges are likely to impact marginalized communities and communities of color disproportionately. The Committee requests a report within 180 days of the date of enactment of this Act on barriers to accessing treatments, diagnostics, clinicians, especially specialists, in both conditions affecting fewer than 20,000 patients, and in communities of color affected by diseases with fewer than 200,000 patients. The report should include an assessment of any legal, improper payment, and fraud implications of any denials of care for these patients, as well as recommendations for addressing any barriers to accessing treatments for such patients. Robotic Stereotactic Radiosurgery.--The Committee continues to support robotic stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and robotic stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). The Committee urges CMS to maintain sufficient payment for SRS and SBRT to ensure viability in both the freestanding and hospital outpatient setting, including in both traditional fee-for-service Medicare as well as in the context of any alternative payment models developed by CMS. Rural Pharmacies.--The Committee recognizes the importance of rural pharmacies in dispensing medications, providing care, educating patients, ensuring patient safety, and responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Committee is concerned that insufficient reimbursement and payments, increasing costs of operation, and narrowing profit margins threatens the viability of pharmacies in rural areas. The Committee requests a report within 180 days of the date of enactment of this Act that includes a review and assessment of the reimbursement and payment options for rural pharmacies. Saline Shortage.--The Committee notes the FDA has recognized a shortage of saline solution since at least 2013, when it was included on the FDA drug shortage list. Saline solution is delivered to patients through intravenous (IV) pumps. The shortage of saline highlights a potential risk for routine health care delivery and critical care during trauma events. The Committee encourages CMS to coordinate with the FDA and complete its coverage and payment reviews of products related to new classes of resuscitation fluids as expeditiously as possible. Site Neutral Reimbursement.--The Committee remains concerned with the financial impact of the Site Neutral Payment Rule on access to care, health disparities, and hospital finances for Sole Community Hospitals and other hospitals in underserved areas. The Committee encourages CMS to consider restoring payment rates for Sole Community Hospitals with excepted off-campus provider-departments. Social Determinants of Health.--The Committee is aware that social determinants of health are critical drivers of health outcomes and health care costs and that early childhood development is affected by social factors. The Committee commends CMS for the guidance on social determinants issued to States in January 2021 and encourages CMS to continue to clarify and disseminate strategies that States can implement under current Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) authority, or through waivers, to address social determinants of health (SDOH) in the provision of health care, including strategies specifically targeting the pediatric population. This should include guidance on how States can encourage and incentivize managed care organizations to address SDOH through contracts. Social Determinants of Health Analytics.--The Committee is encouraged that Medicare Advantage (MA) and Medicaid Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) have stated an intent to employ strategies to address SDOH, and the Committee supports work on SDOH given historic inequities that have existed among at-risk populations like communities of color and rural communities. However, in constructing SDOH-based recommendations for beneficiaries, many health plans are regularly using what is described as ``consumer data,'' which includes clinical, social, economic, behavioral, and environmental data that is individually identified, sometimes combining or allowing other entities to combine it with protected medical information governed by Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. The Committee requests a report within 180 days of the date of enactment of this Act on efforts by CMS to ensure the transparency by MA and MCO plans in the use of data of beneficiaries in addressing SDOH, how CMS ensures that MA and MCO plans notify beneficiaries of the use of protected or consumer data, and how ongoing CMS work with MA and MCOs around SDOH and the use of consumer data and protected medical information aligns with and improves health equity as per the goals of Executive Order 13985 and the HHS's Equity Action Plan. Sole Community Hospitals.--The Committee appreciates that CMS, during the COVID-19 public health emergency (PHE), waived distance requirements to ensure Sole Community Hospitals were able to focus on maintaining access to needed health care services for Medicare beneficiaries. The Committee encourages CMS to consider utilizing its regulatory flexibilities to provide a transition period for hospitals that may have fallen out of compliance with Sole Community Hospital requirements during the PHE. State All Payer Claims Databases.--The Committee includes sufficient funding to support grants of $1,000,000 to up to 25 eligible States under section 320B of the PHS Act for the first year of activities to establish a State All Payer Claims Database (APCD) or improve an existing State APCD. These grants will support the work the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation are currently conducting on APCD infrastructure. STI Screening and Treatment Initiative.--The Committee continues to be concerned with the high rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among young adults and pregnant women. As STIs continue to rise, reaching this vulnerable population is critical to curb the spread of these diseases. The Committee urges CMS to collaborate with the CDC's Division of STD Prevention to develop a screening, treatment, and education initiative under the Medicaid program. Supplemental Liquid Oxygen.--The Committee notes reports of ongoing supplemental oxygen shortage exacerbated by the increase in patients with COVID-19 and long COVID. The Committee is concerned about reports of Medicare beneficiary barriers to liquid oxygen for home and community use. The Committee encourages HHS to evaluate options to ensure the long-term availability of supplemental liquid oxygen. Supportive Services through Medicaid.--The Committee recognizes the importance of supportive services for individuals with a substance use or mental health disorder. Supportive services, like peer support workers, help people stay in treatment or recovery and avoid recurrence of substance use. The Committee urges CMS to continue working with States to incorporate support services, including peer support services, supportive employment services, and tenancy support services, into State Medicaid plans or waivers of such plans in a way that promotes sustainability of services and aligns with the best available evidence and contributes to supporting the full spectrum of treatment and recovery support services for behavioral health conditions. Telehealth and Health Care Access.--The Committee requests a report in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification on the impact of telehealth on health care access, utilization, cost, and outcomes, broken down by race, ethnicity, sex, age, disability status, and zip code under the Medicaid program and CHIP. Transportation for Dialysis.--The Committee continues to strongly urge CMS to delay further implementation of the Prior Authorization of Repetitive, Scheduled Non-Emergent Ambulance Transport model until it ensures appropriate alternative transportation to dialysis services and diabetes-related wound care for low-income beneficiaries who have no other means of transportation. The Committee further requests a plan within 90 days of the date of enactment of this Act to provide alternative transportation to the low-income Medicare-Medicaid full and partial dual eligibles who have no alternative transportation to dialysis and diabetes wound care services. Utilization Management for MOUD.--The Committee recognizes that frontline medical provider experience and research increasingly indicate that individuals who take oral buprenorphine for opioid use disorder (OUD) may benefit from doses higher than 24mg. The population of individuals who may need higher doses of buprenorphine to prevent cravings is expected to increase as fentanyl continues to proliferate the illicit opioid market. The Committee is aware that State Medicaid programs may have in place utilization management practices, including those that require a prior authorization before prescribing oral buprenorphine above 16mg or 24mg daily. The Committee requests that CMS examine State utilization management requirements related to oral buprenorphine, and whether such requirements unnecessarily delay access to treatment. Utilization of Z Codes for Social Determinants of Health.-- The Committee commends CMS for publishing a report on the Utilization of Z codes for SDOH among Medicare FFS beneficiaries. As the report notes, the COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected underserved communities. The Committee is concerned about whether the current Z codes definitions are expansive and specific enough to track the SDOH impacting underserved communities. To help reduce these barriers, the Committee encourages HHS to update the current Z code definitions and establish a national standard to review SDOH to ensure physicians nationwide use the same tools to analyze SDOH. The Committee requests a briefing within 180 days of the date of enactment of this Act on the current utilization of Z codes, how HHS suggests the Z codes definitions could be updated to better track SDOH impacting underserved communities and recommendations on how to increase the utilization of Z codes. Whole Child Health.--The Committee recognizes that SDOH influence health outcomes, particularly for children. The Committee further recognizes that the COVID-19 pandemic has placed additional social stressors on children and their families and has negatively impacted pediatric mental health. The Committee commends CMS for testing the Integrated Care for Kids Model and for its guidance on social determinants issued to States in January 2021. The Committee urges the CMCS to establish a whole child health demonstration program to address the health and social factors impacting children served by Medicaid and CHIP and to improve health equity. This demonstration program should include pediatric value-based care models and locally driven strategies to align financial incentives and resources across Medicaid and other public and private programs and resources. The Committee requests a report within 180 days of the date of enactment of this Act on the plan to establish the demonstration program, including cost estimates for implementation. Whole Genome Sequencing Guidance for Medicaid and CHIP Programs.--The Committee understands there is a growing body of evidence that whole genome sequencing (WGS), whole exome sequencing, and gene panel testing can save lives and save money when used to diagnose infants and children who are suspected of having a rare genetic disease. Under ``Project Baby Bear,'' a pilot program in California's Medicaid program, the use of rapid WGS helped physicians more accurately identify the exact cause of rare genetic diseases. The Committee also understands that other States are pursuing or considering similar initiatives. The Committee encourages CMS to develop guidance for State health officials on best practices for incorporating WGS, whole exome sequencing, and gene panel testing into their Medicaid and CHIP programs as a first-line diagnostic for infants and children who are suspected of having rare genetic diseases in the inpatient setting. This guidance should also include advice for States on how to encourage managed care organizations to cover WGS, whole exome sequencing, and gene panel testing for this population. The Committee requests a report within 180 days of the date of enactment of this Act on steps taken to develop such guidance. In addition, the Committee understands there are undiagnosed diseases that do not require hospital inpatient care. Therefore, the Committee encourages CMS to issue guidance on the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) Benefit on the usage of WGS, whole exome sequencing, and gene panel testing. State Survey and Certification The Committee provides $494,261,000 for State Survey and Certification activities, an increase of $96,927,000. State Survey and Certification supports certifications of Medicare and Medicaid certified health care facilities to ensure that beneficiaries receive care at facilities that meet health, safety, and quality standards required by CMS. Federal Administration The Committee provides $895,424,000 for Federal Administration activities related to the Medicare and Medicaid programs, an increase of $122,891,000. Federal Administration funding supports CMS staff, along with operating and administrative expenses for information technology, communication, utilities, rent and space requirements, as well as administrative contracts. Quality Improvement Organizations.--The Committee does not support the Administration's proposal to shift personnel costs to the Federal Administration account that have previously been funded by a mandatory appropriation. Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Account Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $873,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 899,000,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 899,000,000 Change from enacted level......................... +26,000,000 Change from budget request........................ - - - The Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Account (HCFAC) funds support activities conducted by CMS, the HHS Office of Inspector General, and the Department of Justice (DOJ). This appropriation includes a base amount of $323,000,000 and an additional $576,000,000 through a discretionary budget cap adjustment provided to meet the terms of H. Res. 1151. This is $26,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. This funding is in addition to other mandatory funding provided through authorizing legislation. The funding will provide resources to continue efforts for Medicaid program integrity activities, for safeguarding the Medicare prescription drug benefit and the Medicare Advantage program, and for program integrity efforts related to these programs carried out by the DOJ. Care Denials.--The Committee strongly encourages CMS to increase investigations of inappropriate care denials by private insurance companies. Senior Medicare Patrol.--The Committee includes $35,000,000 for the Senior Medicare Patrol program. The Committee continues to include modified bill language to enable the Secretary to fund the Senior Medicare Patrol program, which is administered by the Administration for Community Living, from either discretionary or mandatory funds provided to this account. Administration for Children and Families PAYMENTS TO STATES FOR CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT AND FAMILY SUPPORT PROGRAMS Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $2,795,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 2,883,000,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 2,883,000,000 Change from enacted level......................... +88,000,000 Change from budget request........................ - - - The Committee also recommends $1,300,000,000 in advance funding, as requested, for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 to ensure timely payments for Child Support Enforcement programs. These programs support State-administered programs of financial assistance and services for low-income families to promote their economic security and self-sufficiency. LOW INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $3,800,304,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 3,975,304,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 4,000,000,000 Change from enacted level......................... +199,696,000 Change from budget request........................ +24,696,000 The Committee recommends $4,000,000,000 for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance program, which is $199,696,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and $24,696,000 above the fiscal year 2023 budget request. The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) supports eligible families and households through programs providing assistance with energy costs. In addition to funding made available in this bill, the Committee notes that the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (P.L. 117-58) provided $500,000,000 in LIHEAP funding over five fiscal years, with $100,000,000 made available each fiscal year through September 30, 2026, to support eligible families with home energy costs. Hold Harmless.--While the Committee recognizes that progress has been made in recent years to limit annual decreases in State allocations to no more than three percent of what a State received in the previous year, the Committee continues to believe that all States have unmet needs and that all States benefit from the consistency of annual appropriations when the overall account is unchanged or increased. To correct this volatility and hold States, territories, and Tribes (funded through the States) harmless from annual reductions, the bill includes language directing the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) to distribute, at a minimum, no less than the amount of funding to each State, territory, and Tribe as was appropriated in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022. Technical Assistance.--The Committee recommends a $1,700,000 increase for HHS to establish a system to automate the formulation process to enable ACF staff to provide estimates more readily when requested by the Committee. REFUGEE AND ENTRANT ASSISTANCE Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $6,425,214,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 6,327,843,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 7,979,346,000 Change from enacted level......................... +1,554,132,000 Change from budget request........................ +1,651,503,000 The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) programs are designed to help refugees, asylees, Cuban and Haitian entrants, and trafficking victims become employed and self-sufficient. These programs also provide for care of unaccompanied children in Federal custody and survivors of torture. Funding for several of the programs within this account is highly dependent on estimates and as such, it is critical that ORR communicate changes to estimated numbers of arrivals and costs as they become available. The Committee directs ORR to provide monthly updates of arrivals each month by category, including refugees, asylees, Cuban and Haitian entrants, Special Immigrant Visas, and unaccompanied children, to include any updates in estimated funding needs as a result of changes in trends in those categories. Within the total, the Committee includes the following: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Budget Activity FY 2023 Committee ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Transitional and Medical Services................... $760,000,000 Victims of Trafficking............................... 35,000,000 Refugee Support Services............................. 450,000,000 Unaccompanied Children............................... 6,714,346,000 Survivors of Torture................................. 20,000,000 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Transitional and Medical Services The Committee includes $760,000,000, which is $196,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. The Transitional and Medical Services (TAMS) program provides grants to States and nonprofit organizations to provide refugees and other eligible populations with up to eight months of cash and medical assistance. Victims of Trafficking The Committee includes $35,000,000 for the Victims of Trafficking program, which is $5,245,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. The recommendation includes $5,500,000 for the National Human Trafficking Hotline. The Committee appreciates that the Office on Trafficking in Persons (OTIP) has integrated legal services into its comprehensive case management grant programs and encourages ACF to continue to increase access to legal services for both foreign national victims and U.S. citizen and legal permanent resident victims, consistent with demonstrated need. Refugee Support Services The recommendation includes $450,000,000, which is $142,799,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. The Refugee Support Services (RSS) program provides formula and competitive grants to States and nonprofit organizations to address barriers to employment and help refugees become self- sufficient. The Committee urges ORR to engage with the Department of Housing and Urban Development and Department of State on ways to align Federal efforts and reduce administrative costs across refugee support programs to maximize the efficient provision of safe housing and other services for eligible populations. Unaccompanied Children The Committee includes $6,714,346,000 for the Unaccompanied Children (UC) Program, which is equal to the amount requested in the fiscal year 2023 budget request (including both discretionary and contingency funding). The Committee notes that the request is approximately $1,300,000,000 below the amount that was provided for the program in fiscal year 2022, despite the continued impacts of COVID-19 and the high numbers of children seeking refuge at the Southern border. The Committee provides the funding requested for fiscal year 2023 with the understanding that the reduction of funding (compared to fiscal year 2022) is the result of strategic improvements ORR is making to plan for additional capacity when there are surges in arrivals, and the sustained focus on efforts to discharge children safely and expeditiously to vetted sponsors. The Committee recommends this funding level with the understanding that ORR will continue its commitment to invest in a network of licensed beds to the greatest extent possible, increase oversight and monitoring of all shelters, expand services for children while they are in care and post-release, and importantly, to maintain the closure of emergency intake sites. The Committee continues to stress the critical importance of increased services to children, and provides not less than $650,000,000, an increase of $92,000,000 over the fiscal year 2022 enacted level, for legal services, post-release services, and child advocates. The Committee directs ORR to report regularly the number of referrals from CBP, and to continue to provide quarterly reports on the number of children receiving services from legal service providers, the number receiving post-release legal and social services, and the number who are appointed child advocates, including the number of children on the waitlist for any of these services, in accordance with the directive in House Report 116-450. The Committee expects ORR to set targets for the number and percentage of children that will be provided such services so that the Committee can ensure that the number of children with access to such services significantly increases over fiscal year 2022. Age-Outs.--The Committee continues to direct ORR to develop tangible post-18 plans for every 17-year-old unaccompanied child in ORR care at least two weeks in advance of their 18th birthday to ensure that an appropriate non-secure placement, along with any necessary social support services, has been identified for the child prior to discharge from ORR. Case Management and Community Support Services.--The Committee expects HHS to coordinate with DHS to provide an analysis of existing case management programs, including the Alternatives to Detention Case Management pilot program being administered by the DHS Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, and to promptly brief the Committee within 180 days of enactment of P.L. 117-103. The Committee remains concerned that case management programs accountable only to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement may negatively impact the ability and willingness of community-based organizations to directly contract for community-based support services, and encourages HHS to evaluate which agencies or offices within HHS may be well-positioned to ensure that individuals and families receiving short term assistance upon entry can receive referrals for longer term community-based case management services through HHS when requested. Child Advocates.--The recommendation includes $12,000,000 for ORR to expand Child Advocate services and to ensure that child advocates are appointed to particularly vulnerable children, including victims of abuse or trafficking, children 12 years old and younger, children in residential treatment centers, children seeking review of their release or placement, pregnant and parenting children, children with disabilities or complex medical conditions, and children who are expected to remain in ORR custody for prolonged periods of time. The Committee encourages ORR to ensure that child advocates are able to communicate and share information essential to protecting a child's best interests with the child and the child's attorney. The recommendation continues language waiving matching requirements, and provides an increase in funding for the program to more than offset previous matching requirements. To ensure that child advocates have the visibility and capacity to be appointed to the most pressing cases in ORR custody, the Committee strongly urges ORR to proactively share census data from each facility with child advocates on a consistent basis. Such census should list the names, ages, countries of origins, languages, and lengths of stay of each child in the program, which will help child advocates identify the children in greatest need. Children with Prolonged Stays.--The Committee continues to direct ORR to submit a report every six months on the number of children who have been in ORR custody longer than a year. Such report should include how long each child has been in ORR custody and a status update on their case, including whether the child has any family or other potential sponsor(s) in the United States and a summary of ORR's efforts to place the child with a sponsor or in a long-term foster care setting. The Committee directs ORR to ensure that a care provider is taking all steps necessary to place every child in a home as expeditiously as possible and that no child is unaccounted for, resulting in prolonged detention. Communicating With Congress.--The Committee expects HHS to notify the Committee prior to making any administrative or policy changes expected to impact the number of children in ORR custody; shelter operations; the placement of children with sponsors; or any post-release services. Community-Based Facilities.--The Committee directs ORR to prioritize new grant or contract funding to small-scale, community-based residential care placements. As ORR adds State- licensed capacity to its network, the Committee expects that no less than 50 percent of beds added to the network be in small- scale shelters, transitional foster care, small group homes, or long-term foster care. The Committee further directs ORR to ensure there is an adequate supply of long-term foster care beds in the network to minimize the time it takes for a child to be moved to this least restrictive placement. In addition, ORR is directed to notify the Committee prior to all new funding opportunity announcements, grant or contract awards, or plans to release or acquire property. Further, the Committee strongly encourages ORR to post funding opportunity announcements more consistently and predictably, and to provide training and technical assistance to potential new providers. Legal Services.--The Committee supports the continued expansion of independent legal services for unaccompanied children and notes that services provided by independent and qualified legal counsel to unaccompanied children increase the efficiency, effectiveness, and fairness of immigration proceedings, significantly reduce the failure-to-appear rate of children who are released from HHS custody, and help relieve the immigration court backlog. The recommendation includes funding and direction for ORR to ensure in-person ``Know Your Rights'' and legal screenings for every child in custody, and for the continued expansion of direct representation for released unaccompanied children. The Committee emphasizes the vital importance of legal services for unaccompanied children both during ORR custody and following release and expects post- release direct representation to be made available to children up to funded capacity, without restrictions related to age while in ORR care; release date; estimated time to conclude a case; or other characteristics, provided the representation is initiated while the individual is still a minor. The Committee expects legal services to be in person absent exigent circumstances, such as for a public health emergency, and expects ORR to ensure that there is sufficient confidential space available for legal services at all facilities, including emergency or influx facilities. When services must be provided remotely, ORR shall make sufficient technology and confidential space available for communication via video whenever possible, or via telephone if necessary. In addition, the Committee strongly encourages ORR to work with legal service providers to develop a strategy to minimize the risks of any child having to go to immigration court without independent legal counsel. Within the amount for services for children, the recommendation includes up to $8,300,000 for legal service providers to recruit and train additional attorneys for the purposes of building the capacity necessary to provide independent representation to unaccompanied children with pending immigration cases. Mental Health Services.--The Committee appreciates the steps that ORR has taken to improve mental health services for children in its custody and urges ORR to further expand mental health services and the use of other interventions, and to provide in-person and continuous training to ORR-contracted staff on the specialized needs of children in ORR's care. The Committee directs ORR to work with residential care service providers, child welfare experts, and other stakeholders with relevant expertise to ensure compliance with Federal, State and local codes related to the standards of care or the well-being of young children and children with disabilities, and to develop policy guidelines regarding residential care and specialized, trauma-informed practices for the aforementioned groups of children, including regarding appropriateness of residential treatment centers as a form of residential care. The Committee directs ORR to include in its fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification information on these efforts, including details and metrics on the types of training offered to staff to ensure appropriate care is available for young children, children with disabilities, and children with mental health needs. Non-Parental Relatives.--The Committee strongly supports efforts to reduce the amount of time a child may be separated from a family member when referred from CBP as unaccompanied even though the child arrived at the border with a non-parental relative. The Committee further supports ORR's efforts to improve efficiency, including by deploying HHS staff to DHS facilities for the purposes of verifying relationships and initiating the sponsor suitability process for adult family members claiming a Category 2a or 2b relationship with the child (or children) with whom they arrived. Office of the Ombudsperson.--The Committee continues to support efforts to increase and improve independent oversight of the UC program through the establishment of an Office of the Ombudsperson. The Committee expects the briefing required in accordance with the Joint Explanatory Statement that accompanied P.L. 117-103 to include a strategy for establishment of the Office, including estimates of the resources necessary to do so. The Committee includes up to $10,000,000 for establishment of the Office. Post-Release Services.--The Committee includes an increase in funding for post-release services to enhance and extend case management services to more children to assist them with school enrollment; access to legal services, health care, mental health and community services; and to provide counseling to the child and families in the initial period after release. The Committee urges ORR to engage with current family reunification service providers, post-release service providers, and recently released children and sponsors to discuss needed services, the length of services, and how to improve coordination between shelters, providers and other community services providers, to help evaluate the current program, to identify new risks and opportunities for improvement. In addition to children already designated under law or policy to receive such services, the Committee encourages ORR to ensure that all pregnant or parenting teens, children whose primary language is neither English nor Spanish, as well as children who faced separation from a parent or legal guardian at the U.S.-Mexico border, are referred for post-release services. ORR should arrange for such services to be provided by non-governmental organizations with experience and expertise in working with these children. The Committee urges ORR to develop and make public on its website the criteria for how children are prioritized for post-release services, and the number of children receiving services in each fiscal year. Protection of Genetic Information.--The Committee continues to prohibit any governmental agency or private entity from accessing, using, or storing any genetic material, data, or information collected in this reunification effort, including for the purpose of criminal or immigration enforcement. Any genetic material, data, or information obtained by a government agency or private entity should be destroyed after testing and the probability of a genetic relationship is calculated. The entities conducting DNA testing shall obtain the consent of any individual over age 18 prior to testing, and shall make every effort to obtain the consent of a guardian prior to testing anyone under age 18. The Committee requests ORR continue to include in its annual Congressional Budget Justification the steps it is taking to protect the privacy and genetic material and data of individuals who are being tested as part of reunification efforts. Spend Plan.--The bill includes a general provision requiring the Secretary of HHS to continue to submit a comprehensive spend plan to the Committee every 60 days. The plan should continue to include a report on facilities, by facility type, including facility-specific data including number of licensed beds; operating status (open or not yet open); whether a facility is operated by a for-profit or non- profit company; and the availability of such facilities to legal, medical and social service resources. Tender Age Children.--The Committee directs ORR to include in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification information on efforts to ensure developmentally appropriate care is available for tender age children. The justification should detail how placement options, services, and staff training are tailored for tender age children, as well as an assessment of the circumstances under which very young children are referred to ORR. Unlicensed Facilities.--The Committee understands the challenges facing HHS in ensuring sufficient State-licensed shelter capacity amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and high numbers of children seeking protection at the Southern border. The Committee recognizes and shares HHS's commitment to ensuring that unaccompanied children are not subject to prolonged detention in U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) facilities--however, the Committee strongly supports the medical, psychological, and child welfare advocacy communities in their compelling arguments against, and well-founded reasons to limit, the use of any unlicensed facilities, especially large-capacity temporary shelters where large numbers of children reside in the same space and where access to services may be limited. The Committee acknowledges that ORR has discontinued the use of emergency intake sites--including by expanding services at some of those sites to meet influx standards--but continues to have concerns about how ORR will ensure that influx facilities maintain standards that are robust and comprehensive. The Committee directs ORR to submit, within 120 days of enactment of this Act, a report detailing plans to ensure independent, third-party monitoring of all unlicensed facilities to verify their compliance with required standards, as well as a plan for licensure for all unlicensed facilities, or a comparable plan for how ORR can independently verify that each such facility has satisfied requirements equivalent to applicable State licensing standards while such facilities are in use. In addition, the Committee is aware of actions recently taken by certain States that remove, exempt, or threaten to strip ORR facilities of State licenses and important safety and monitoring mechanisms. The Committee urges HHS to ensure State actions do not undermine the safety and well-being of unaccompanied children, and the Committee expects ORR to take steps to ensure third-party oversight and monitoring of affected ORR facilities, commensurate with State-licensed monitoring and oversight requirements and timelines. As part of the report requested above, the Committee directs ORR to include a section on the actions it is taking to appropriately monitor and oversee operations of any facilities affected by such State actions. Survivors of Torture The Committee includes $20,000,000 for the Survivors of Torture program, which is $2,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. The program funds non-profit organizations providing healing and support services to refugees, asylees and asylum seekers, who need help overcoming the effects of torture. PAYMENTS TO STATES FOR THE CHILD CARE AND DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $6,165,330,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 7,562,000,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 7,165,330,000 Change from enacted level......................... +1,000,000,000 Change from budget request........................ -396,670,000 The Committee recommends $7,165,330,000 for the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) program, which is $1,000,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. The Committee strongly supports the commitment in the budget to allot three percent for Indian Tribes, in addition to the set- aside of $184,960,000 included in this Act. The CCDBG provides funds according to a formula to States, territories, and Tribes to provide financial assistance to help low-income working families and families engaged in training or education activities access child care and to improve the quality of child care for all children. Child Care Facilities Needs Assessment.--The Committee appreciates that ACF has been conducting a feasibility study to determine how States could conduct needs assessments of their child care and early education facilities and requests a briefing within 30 days of enactment of this Act on the results of that analysis, including an estimate of the resources necessary to fund such Statewide needs assessments. Early Childhood Educator Workforce Pipeline.--The Committee encourages the Department of Health and Human Services to work with the Department of Education and the Department of Labor to develop and implement a strategy for strengthening the early educator workforce pipeline, including in the child care sector. Home-Based Providers.--The Committee recognizes the value of home-based providers to the field of child care, and directs ACF to develop and disseminate guidance clarifying authorities under existing law for use of CCDBG funds to support home-based child care providers, including relative providers, and offer examples of initiatives currently underway in States to do so. Homelessness Data.--The Committee encourages OCC to provide technical assistance to and conduct monitoring of States to improve the quality and completeness of the data States are required to collect on the homelessness status of children receiving childcare subsidies. The Committee expects OCC to annually publish on its website data gathered regarding homelessness status and related demographic data. SOCIAL SERVICES BLOCK GRANT Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $1,700,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 1,700,000,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 1,700,000,000 Change from enacted level......................... - - - Change from budget request........................ - - - The Social Services Block Grant provides grants to States by formula. States have the flexibility to determine what services and activities are supported, provided they are targeted at a broad set of goals, including reducing or eliminating poverty, achieving or maintaining self-sufficiency, and preventing neglect, abuse, or exploitation of children and adults. CHILDREN AND FAMILIES SERVICES PROGRAMS Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $13,438,343,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 15,311,822,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 15,167,344,000 Change from enacted level......................... +1,729,001,000 Change from budget request........................ -144,478,000 The Children and Families Services programs fund activities serving children, youth, families, the developmentally disabled, Native Americans, victims of child abuse and neglect and domestic violence, and other vulnerable populations. The Committee recommends the following amounts: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ FY 2023 Budget Activity Committee ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Programs for Children, Youth, and Families Head Start....................................... $12,396,820,000 Preschool Development Grants..................... 350,000,000 Runaway/Homeless Youth........................... 133,000,000 Abuse of Runaway Youth Prevention................ 22,000,000 State Child Abuse Prevention..................... 110,000,000 Discretionary Child Abuse Prevention............. 41,000,000 Community-based Child Abuse Prevention........... 75,000,000 Child Welfare Services........................... 273,735,000 Child Welfare Training........................... 38,984,000 Adoption Opportunities........................... 50,000,000 Adoption Incentives.............................. 75,000,000 Social Services Research and Demonstration....... 101,679,000 Native American Programs......................... 63,762,000 Community Services Community Services Block Grant................... 800,000,000 Community Economic Development................... 22,383,000 Rural Community Facilities....................... 12,000,000 Domestic Violence Hotline............................ 27,360,000 Family Violence/Battered Women's Shelters............ 300,000,000 Chafee Education and Training Vouchers............... 45,257,000 Disaster Human Services Case Management.............. 2,364,000 Program Direction.................................... 227,000,000 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Head Start The Committee recommends $12,396,820,000 for the Head Start program, which is $1,360,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and $193,366,000 above the fiscal year 2023 budget request. Head Start and Early Head Start promote school readiness of children under 5 from low-income families through education, health, social and other services. Cost-of-Living Adjustment.--The Committee recommends $596,000,000 for a cost-of-living adjustment. Early Head Start (EHS) Expansion and Early Head Start-Child Care (EHS-CC) Partnerships.--The Committee includes $500,000,000 to expand Head Start and Early Head Start programs for eligible children and families. The Committee understands that the EHS-CC Partnership grant program was designed to enhance the quality of child care to better meet the needs of working families, and supports the program's appreciation for how Head Start can be critically helpful to meeting those needs. However, the Committee is aware of certain communities for which there are significant barriers to establishing the EHS-CCP model and expects grants for EHS expansion or EHS-CC partnerships to be awarded based on the unique needs of each community with due consideration of local feasibility. The Committee requests a briefing within 30 days of enactment of this Act, on how the Office of Head Start (OHS) can promote the EHS-CCP model without awarding funding based on a predetermined spending level, and in a way that does not disadvantage communities where EHS-CCP is infeasible. The Committee urges OHS to ensure that the program is not expanded in a way that excludes children and babies whose parents do not qualify for child care, or pregnant women. The Committee continues to direct ACF to include in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification and each Congressional Budget Justification thereafter, the actual and estimated number of funded slots for each of the following: Head Start, EHS, and EHS-CC Partnerships. Migrant and Seasonal Head Start.--The Committee is concerned by reports that an increasing number of farmworker families with young children are finding it difficult to qualify for Migrant and Seasonal Head Start (MSHS) services despite regulatory flexibilities available to the program in the Head Start Act. The Committee is concerned that 2019 enrollment data indicates that MSHS programs may not be utilizing these flexibilities to the maximum extent allowable and urges the Secretary to continue to work with individual MSHS programs to maximize flexibilities related to income eligibility where under-enrollment is an issue. Within 120 days of enactment of this Act, the Committee directs OHS to provide a comprehensive list of the MSHS programs reporting under- enrollment in fiscal years 2021 and 2022 and to include program specific data on the percent of enrollees determined eligible by the allowable flexibilities (as outlined in the Report to Congress on Head Act Eligibility, April 2022), so that the Committee can better understand the eligibility issues facing MSHS programs and can continue to discuss any further actions that may be necessary. Quality Improvement Funding.--The Committee includes $262,000,000 in quality improvement funding. The Committee strongly believes the flexibility provided by this funding is necessary for Head Start programs to meet the local needs of programs, and expects funding to be prioritized for recruiting and retaining quality staff and improving facilities and classroom environments to support high quality program services, and address the rise of adverse childhood experiences. Tribal Colleges and Universities-Head Start Partnership Program.--The Committee includes $8,000,000 for the Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCU)-Head Start Partnership Program. Preschool Development Grants The Committee recommends $350,000,000 for Preschool Development Grants, which is $60,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. This program provides grants to States to build State and local capacity to provide preschool for 4-year- olds from low-and moderate-income families. The Committee encourages ACF to continue to support States that choose to use a portion of their renewal grant funding to award sub-grants to programs in a mixed delivery system across the State, particularly for low-income and disadvantaged children prior to entering kindergarten, or to improve the quality of local programs through the enhancement of early childhood systems.

The Committee supports the ability of grantees to provide prevention services regardless of enrollment in residential services, and urges the program to remind grantees that they are not required to enroll a young person in shelter or residential services, nor require the young person to physically travel to the grantee's location, in order for the young person who is deemed at risk of running away or becoming homeless to be eligible to receive prevention and supportive services, including counseling and case management. The program is encouraged to notify applicants if grant applications were successful at least 30 days before the grant is to begin, or no less than 30 days before an existing grant is set to end. The Committee strongly urges the program to ensure that service delivery and staff training comprehensively address the individual strengths and needs of youth, as well as be language appropriate, gender appropriate (interventions that are sensitive to the diverse experiences of male, female, and transgender youth and consistent with the gender identity of participating youth), and culturally sensitive and respectful of the complex social identities of youth (e.g., race, ethnicity, nationality, age, religion/spirituality, gender identity/expression, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, physical or cognitive ability, language, beliefs, values, behavior patterns, or customs).

Office of the Secretary GENERAL DEPARTMENTAL MANAGEMENT Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $571,122,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 665,067,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 639,622,000 Change from enacted level......................... +68,500,000 Change from budget request........................ -25,445,000 Of the funds provided, $75,728,000 shall be derived from evaluation set-aside transfers available under section 241 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, which is $10,900,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. This appropriation supports activities that are associated with the Secretary's roles as policy officer and general manager of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The Office of the Secretary also implements administration and Congressional directives, and provides assistance, direction and coordination to the headquarters, regions, and field organizations of the department. In addition, this funding supports the Office of the Surgeon General and several other health promotion and disease prevention activities that are centrally administered. Advertising Contracts for Small Business Owners.--The Committee understands that, as the largest advertiser in the United States, the Federal government should work to ensure fair access to its advertising contracts, including outdoor advertising, for small disadvantaged businesses and businesses owned by minorities and women. The Committee directs each department and agency to include the following information in its fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification: expenditures for fiscal year 2022 and expected expenditures for fiscal year 2024 for (1) all contracts for advertising services; and (2) contracts for the advertising services of (I) socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses concerns (as defined in section 8(a)(4) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)(4)); and (II) women- and minority-owned businesses. Bereaved Children.--The Committee is concerned with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on bereaved children. The consequences of losing a caregiver include higher risk of experiencing substance abuse and mental health problems, including anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder, as well as higher risk of reduced employment and housing instability. Bereaved children also experience lower rates of academic attainment and higher dropout rates. The COVID-19 pandemic created the additional stressor on bereaved children by reducing or limiting their access to critical social support systems commonly provided through consistent school or community. The Committee acknowledges the President's efforts to identify these children and families and make resources available to them and encourages HHS to coordinate with Congress and relevant agencies to establish a taskforce to ensure the social and emotional development of bereaved children. Blood Donation Education.--The Committee includes $1,000,000 for outreach and education to individuals who become newly eligible to donate blood due to evidence-based updates to FDA's deferral guidelines. The Committee directs HHS to conduct such community outreach in consultation with community stakeholders. Brain Aneurysms.--The Committee recognizes that although one in 50 Americans has a brain aneurysm, there are typically no warning signs or symptoms unless the aneurysm ruptures. Up to 50 percent of patients will not survive such a hemorrhage. Even when an aneurysm has ruptured, the symptoms are not widely known among health care professionals. The Committee reiterates the language included in House Report 115-862 directing the Secretary, in consultation with appropriate stakeholders-- including health care providers, brain aneurysm patient advocacy foundations, brain aneurysm survivors, and caregivers--to facilitate the development of best practices on brain aneurysm detection and rupture for first responders, emergency room physicians, primary care physicians, nurses, and advanced practice providers. The Committee encourages the Secretary to consider incorporating topics including, but not limited to, the symptoms of brain aneurysms, evidence-based risk factors for brain aneurysms, appropriate utilization of medical testing and diagnostic equipment, and screening recommendations. The Secretary shall continue to consult with appropriate stakeholders to develop a strategy for disseminating information about the best practices and begin implementing this strategy within one year after the date of enactment of this Act. The Secretary shall review research on brain aneurysm detection and diagnosis and update the best practices every three years, as appropriate. In addition, the Committee requests an update in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification outlining the Department's expenditures over the last five fiscal years on research and other activities related to brain aneurysms. Breastfeeding Services and Supplies.--The Committee acknowledges that HRSA updated its Women's Preventive Services Initiative (WPSI) Breastfeeding Services and Supplies recommendation which serves as the basis for insurer decisions around coverage of related services and supplies especially for Medicaid beneficiaries in expansion States. Concerns have been raised that the WPSI recommendation's lack of consideration for quality in its coverage recommendations will lead insurers to cover only the most inexpensive supplies without regard to the needs of individual infants and mothers. HHS is directed to provide, within 120 days of the date of enactment of this Act, the information first requested by the Committee in House Report 115-862 detailing how health insurers have implemented comprehensive lactation services, the standards insurers use to set reimbursement rates for breastfeeding supplies and services, and the current best practices used to provide coverage to help women breastfeed. HHS also is directed to respond to the request in House Report 115-244 to examine the impact of clinically recommended breastfeeding rates on associated Medicaid expenditures, urgent care costs, and direct and indirect medical costs, including workplace productivity and employee retention. Cardiovascular Disease Patients.--The Committee notes the growing prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and the economic burden this deadly disease has on the health care system. The Committee further notes that lipid-panel (cholesterol) screenings, diagnosis and appropriate treatment and management of CVD is vital to prevent major cardiac events and hospitalizations. Various disease prevention and progression therapies are widely available, including statins and modern biologic treatments that have demonstrated efficacy against certain types of CVD. However, such therapies often face barriers including prohibitive utilization management practices by health plans, which limit adoption. The Committee requests a report within 180 days of the date of enactment of this Act on challenges facing healthcare providers and patients with a specific focus on healthcare costs incurred related to postponed, delayed, or suboptimal treatments associated with CVD. Children's Interagency Coordinating Council.--The Committee notes that the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to a further decline in the economic standing, education, and physical and mental health status of low-income children, particularly among children in Hispanic, African American, Asian American, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, and American Indian/Alaska Native families. Data shows that the COVID-19 pandemic is causing more children to experience poverty and resulting in additional hardships including educational gaps and negative mental health impacts. The Committee supports collaboration amongst HHS, the Department of Energy, the Department of Justice, the Department of Agriculture (USDA), United States Agency for International Development, and other Federal agencies to address these pressing problems. To foster greater coordination, collaboration, and transparency on child policy across agency lines, the Committee again directs the Secretary to establish a Children's Interagency Coordinating Council. Among other tasks, the Council shall enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences to provide an annual report to Congress analyzing and monitoring how existing and emerging Federal policies have affected child poverty using the U.S. Census Bureau Supplemental Poverty Measure. In addition, the Council will examine and periodically report on a broad array of comprehensive and cross-cutting issues affecting child well- being. Combating Opioid Overdoses.--The Committee commends NIDA for funding studies on kratom based on promising results that unadulterated kratom may provide help for some Americans struggling with addictions, given its analgesic and less addictive properties as compared to opioids. Contraceptive Deserts.--The Committee notes that an estimated 19 million women in need of publicly funded contraception live in contraceptive deserts, counties in which there is no reasonable access to the full range of contraceptive options. A recent study found that contraceptive deserts vary across States, with between 17 and 53 percent of the State population living in a desert. Furthermore, it found that low-income people and people of color are more likely to live in contraceptive deserts. The Committee requests the Secretary undertake a study of contraceptive deserts and examine the extent to which Federal policy changes and resources can improve access to the full range of contraceptive options. The Committee requests this report within 180 days of the date of enactment of this Act, along with the Department's policy recommendations. Contraceptive Access Under the Affordable Care Act.--The Committee is concerned about access to care for patients seeking preventive services, including contraceptive services. The Committee directs the Secretary, in collaboration with the Departments of Labor (DOL) and Treasury, to engage in patient education to ensure patients understand their rights under the Affordable Care Act to access (without cost sharing) the contraceptive product that is determined best for the patient, in consultation with their health care provider. In addition, the Committee directs the Secretary to engage with health care providers to disseminate the latest guidance on contraceptive access for patients, as well as how to help patients seek access to contraceptive services (without cost sharing) through a health insurance plan's exceptions process. The Committee urges the Secretary to take action against health insurance plans that are not meeting their obligations to patients under the law. Cosmetic Safety.--The Committee encourages the Secretary of HHS to establish and maintain an interagency council for the purpose of sharing data, promoting collaboration on cosmetic safety, and generating solutions to address negative impacts on the health of women and girls of color, professional nail, hair, beauty, and salon workers, and other vulnerable populations caused by exposure to unsafe chemicals in cosmetic products. The interagency should include, but not be limited to, representatives from the Office of the Secretary FDA, NIH, CDC, the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health (or the Administrator's designee), the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (or the Administrator's designee), the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (or the Administrator's designee), and the Secretary of Labor (or the Secretary's designee). Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Advisory Committee.--The Committee looks forward to reviewing the HHS plan regarding myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) which was requested in House Report 116-62 and was required within 180 days of the date of enactment of that Act. In the interim, the Committee encourages HHS to foster interagency and stakeholder collaboration in addressing the related crisis in post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS) and ME/CFS by forming an Infection- Associated Chronic Illnesses Advisory Committee that includes, but is not limited to relevant agency representatives, patient representatives from long COVID, ME/CFS, and other infection- associated chronic illnesses communities, medical care providers, and disease experts. Decentralized Trials.--The Committee notes the COVID-19 pandemic has shown the possibility of conducting remote and decentralized clinical trials. In parallel, decentralized trials can foster greater participation, including by promoting increased diversity in clinical trial participants. The Committee directs the Secretary, in collaboration with NIH, FDA, ONC, CMS, and HRSA to evaluate policy options across the department to ensure health care providers and patients have tools to identify and participate in decentralized and remote clinical trials. This assessment should include steps to foster greater data sharing, including related to electronic health records, genomics, and imaging. The Committee requests a report not later than two years after the date of enactment of this Act, with findings from the assessment and proposals to accelerate decentralized clinical trials and foster trial diversity. Embryo Adoption Awareness Campaign.--The Committee includes $1,000,000 for the Embryo Adoption Awareness Campaign to educate Americans about the existence of frozen human embryos (resulting from in-vitro fertilization), which may be available for donation/adoption to help other couples build their families. The Committee includes bill language permitting these funds also to be used to provide medical and administrative services to individuals adopting embryos, deemed necessary for such adoptions, consistent with the Code of Federal Regulations. Food as Medicine.--The Committee directs the Secretary, in consultation with other Federal agencies, to develop and implement a Federal strategy to reduce nutrition-related chronic diseases and food insecurity and improve health and racial equity in the U.S., including diet-related research and programmatic efforts that increase Americans' access to food as medicine, and healthy, nutritious, organic, and affordable foods, especially in at-risk communities. The Committee includes $2,000,000 in the Office of the Secretary to establish a Food As Medicine pilot program, an integrative model for healthcare, that addresses food insecurity, social isolation, and chronic disease to advance health and racial equity. The model shall include the following as defined by the Secretary: a produce prescription of pesticide-free regenerative or regenerative organic produce; clinical nutrition training for healthcare providers; and nutritional and behavioral support for patients to integrate food interventions into daily habits. The Secretary may enter into competitively awarded contracts or cooperative agreements with, or provide grants to, public or private organizations or agencies within varying States. Additionally, the Committee requests a report within two years of the date of enactment of this Act on the implementation of the Federal strategy and an examination of the status of each pilot project; the results of the evaluation completed during the previous fiscal year; and to the maximum extent practicable the impact of the pilot project on appropriate health, nutrition, and associated behavioral outcomes among patients participating in the pilot project baseline information relevant to the stated goals and desired outcomes of the pilot project; and equivalent information about similar or identical measures among control or comparison groups that did not participate in the pilot project. Genetic Counseling Inequity.--The Committee recognizes that genetic counseling and testing provide individuals the opportunity to learn if they have an inherited genetic mutation, enabling them--and their families--to better understand their risk of developing breast (and other) cancers, help tailor future screening plans, and guide decision making about ways to reduce the risk of breast cancer. However, access and utilization of genetic counseling and testing are not the same for all communities; Black people in the U.S. do not participate in genetic testing at the same rate as Americans of European ancestry. The Committee encourages the Secretary to examine opportunities to increase utilization of genetic counseling and testing associated with breast cancer for Black women and requests an update in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification addressing barriers to increasing access to and utilization of genetic counseling and testing for all populations, including how to increase health equity in this area. Global Health Research.--The Committee requests an update in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification on how the Office of Global Affairs (OGA), CDC, FDA, BARDA, and NIH--including the Fogarty International Center--jointly coordinate global health research activities with specific measurable metrics used to track progress and collaboration toward agreed upon health goals. Health Attaches.--The Committee includes $3,000,000 to expand OGA's Health Diplomacy program to fund health attache offices in Africa, Asia, and Europe. Health Benefits of Proper Nutrition.--The Committee continues to recognize the value of proper nutrition and understands that many chronic medical conditions can be managed cost effectively by improved nutrition. The Committee again encourages the Secretary to establish an interagency collaboration with the Department of Education and the USDA to enhance nutritional education in K-12 schools and urges the Secretary to be proactive in promoting disease prevention by providing a plan to expand nutritional education and to increase access to nutritional foods for students. The Committee also requests a strategic plan, led by HHS in partnership with the USDA, on how culturally appropriate, food- based solutions can improve health outcomes and save money. Health Care Providers, Including Pregnancy Help Centers, Safety.--The Committee includes $5,000,000 for the Secretary to award grants to health care providers, including Pregnancy Help Centers, to pay for security services or otherwise to enhance the security of their facilities, personnel, and patients to ensure safe access. A health care provider, including a pregnancy help center, receiving a grant may use the grant to pay the costs of necessary security services or enhancements to physical access and cyber security, including video surveillance camera systems, data privacy enhancements, and structural improvements. Home Health Aides.--The Committee recognizes that home health aides (HHAs) are the foundation of professional home- based caregiving, and that the growing population of disabled, chronically ill, and elderly Americans receiving home-based care requires a skilled and highly trained HHA workforce prepared to manage complex care needs. The Committee encourages HHS to explore how HHAs are meeting clinical competencies necessary to provide high-quality home-based care. KidneyX.--The Committee continues to include a total of $5,000,000 for KidneyX to support a public private partnership to accelerate innovation in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of kidney diseases. An estimated 850 million people worldwide are living with kidney disease. KidneyX exit disclaimer icon seeks to improve their lives by accelerating the development of drugs, devices, biologics, and other therapies across the spectrum of kidney care. Local News Media.--The Committee encourages the Department to utilize local broadcasters and local newspapers, including those in small communities, in their public affairs Federal advertising campaigns. The Committee requests an update in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification on the Department's public affairs advertising campaigns by percentage of Federal funding spent on social media, national media, local news media, and outdoor advertising during fiscal years 2021 and 2022. In addition, the Committee encourages the Department's Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs, in consultation with other relevant offices, to consider a pilot project focusing on Federal advertising effectiveness in rural communities--with populations under 40,000 individuals or fewer than 20,000 households--utilizing local news media, including broadcast, radio, and non-daily newspapers, whose involvement in advertising campaigns and message delivery can assist in reaching under-served rural areas. LymeX Innovation Accelerator.--The Committee commends the Office of the Secretary and its Chief Technology Officer for the Lyme Innovation Initiative, launched November 2018, and the LymeX Innovation Accelerator announced in October 2020. LymeX is a $25,000,000 public-private partnership between HHS and the Steven & Alexandra Cohen Foundation to accelerate innovation in prevention, diagnostics, and treatments for Lyme and other tick-borne diseases. Medication Abortion.--The Committee urges the Department of Health and Human Services to use every tool at its disposal to ensure that medication abortion care is accessible, affordable, covered, and convenient for patients including through access to telehealth. Mental Health Parity.--The Committee continues to be concerned that after 12 years since enactment of the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA), there is still a lack of oversight and compliance among insurance companies and health plans not adequately covering mental and behavioral health services and providers. In December 2019, the GAO reported that this lack of compliance extends beyond plans investigated by the DOL and includes plans over which HHS has oversight authority. The Committee urges the HHS Secretary, jointly with the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of the Treasury, to comply with language included in House Report 117- 96 to establish a process through which employer-sponsored health plans and health insurance issuers subject to MHPAEA may submit a public report regarding nonquantitative treatment limitations while ensuring that any personal or confidential consumer information is protected. The Committee looks forward to receiving the report requested in House Report 117-96 on any auditing and enforcement of all plans and issuers within the jurisdiction of the respective Department. National Center on Antiracism and Health Equity.--The Committee continues to strongly support the Secretary's efforts to advance health equity and reduce disparities for communities of color. The Committee looks forward to reviewing the Secretary's plan to establish a National Center on Antiracism and Health Equity within the Department to lead efforts to identify and understand the policies and practices that have a disparate impact on the health and well-being of communities of color as requested in House Report 117-96. The Committee includes $10,000,000 for the Office of the Secretary to establish a grant program to support public and nonprofit entities, including community-based organizations, to build and strengthen coalitions focused on addressing structural racism in public health and activities that counter the disparate impact on the health and well-being of communities of color. The Committee requests a report not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act on the progress of this pilot program. Newborn Screening.--The Committee includes $1,000,000 for HHS to commission a study with the National Academy of Medicine to examine the current status of Newborn Screening systems, processes, and research and make recommendations for future improvements that would include: the recommended uniform screening panel review and recommendation process; the barriers and support to add new Recommended Uniform Screening Panel conditions to State screening panels; assessments of State capacity to strengthen current screening processes and implement screening for new conditions; recommendations for optimizing federally and privately funded newborn screening research; new and emerging technologies that would permit screening for new categories of disorders and how technology impacts States; technological and other infrastructure needs to improve diagnosis, follow-up and public health surveillance; communication and educational needs for stakeholders; data collection on disease prevalence and improved long term outcomes; and the impacts of newborn screening efforts on newborn morbidity and mortality. Pharmacists and COVID-19 Authorities.--The Committee appreciates HHS's recognition under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness (PREP) Act declaration authorities for pharmacists to order, treat, immunize, and provide other patient care services, including the ordering and administration of time-sensitive COVID-19 therapeutics. The Committee requests a report within 180 days of the date of enactment of this Act on the impact of these authorities on public health and proposed actions and recommendations on whether to make these authorities permanent. Population Health Task Force.--The Committee notes that the world's most advanced and innovative hospitals, clinics, pharmacies, research institutions, healthcare professional schools, managed care organization, and medical therapies are addressing social determinants of health by implementing population health management strategies and value-based care approaches to improve health outcomes, lower cost of care and optimize experience of care. The Committee includes $1,000,000 for the Secretary to establish and maintain a report on best practices of population health management through the creation of a population health task force. The task force should be comprised of representatives from, but not limited to, the Office of the Secretary, CMS, CDC, population health providers, experts on health equity, health technology, and value-based care. The Committee requests a report within a year of the date of enactment of this Act from the task force on population health, including the task force's initial recommendations. Prohibition on Contractors with Nondisclosure Agreements.-- The Committee recognizes that harassment, including sexual harassment and assault, continue to be pervasive in the workplace, and that the use of predispute nondisclosure and nondisparagement clauses as conditions of employment can perpetuate illegal conduct by silencing survivors and shielding perpetrators. The Committee directs the Department to include proposals in its fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification to eliminate the use of grants and contracts to employers that use this practice. Rare Kidney Diseases in Health Equity Initiatives.--The Committee recognizes the work across HHS to implement practices and policies to eliminate healthcare disparities in America, particularly for communities of color. Rare kidney diseases are underreported and understudied, especially among Black Americans. The Committee requests an update in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification on disparities in kidney care and the inclusion of rare kidney diseases in policies and programs aimed at eliminating health disparities in communities of color. Regional Councils and Councils of Governments.--The Committee encourages the Department to list regional councils and councils of governments as eligible entities in competitions for Federal funding whenever local governments or non-profit agencies are eligible entities. Furthermore, the Committee encourages the Department to seek opportunities for regional councils and councils of governments to serve as lead applicants and grantees to encourage and expand greater regional collaboration. Sickle Cell Interagency Working Group.--The Committee notes approximately 100,000 Americans are living with sickle cell disease, an inherited blood disorder that causes pain, infection, and stroke. This disease disproportionately affects Black Americans. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) report ``Addressing Sickle Cell Disease: A Strategic Plan and Blueprint for Action'' provides important recommendations for improving the health and quality of life for sickle cell disease patients, including a hub and spoke ``Centers of Excellence'' care model. The Committee urges HHS to encourage the Sickle Cell Interagency Working Group to utilize the NASEM report to develop a plan for treatment centers address the unmet care needs for patients with sickle cell disease, sickle cell trait and other heritable hemoglobinopathies. The Committee requests a report within 180 days of the date of enactment of this Act on the working group's progress. Social Determinants of Health.--The Committee directs the Social Determinants Council created by House Report 116-450 to continue to provide technical assistance to jurisdictions in this program. The Committee requests a report within 90 days of the date of enactment of this Act on the status of the selection of all Council members. Stillbirth Task Force.--The Committee provides an additional $1,000,000 for the Secretary to bolster the work for the Stillbirth Task Force. The task force should continue to include the CDC, NIH, outside specialty organizations, and maternal and fetal medicine specialists. The task force should work through the Office of the Secretary to identify current knowledge on stillbirth and prevention, areas of improvement for data collection, current resources for families impacted by stillbirth, and next steps to gather data and lower the rate of stillbirth in the United States. The Committee directs the Secretary to provide a report within 120 days of the date of enactment of this Act on the progress of the task force. Strategy to Reduce Nutrition Related Chronic Diseases.--The Committee encourages the Secretary, in consultation with other Federal agencies, to work through the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion to develop and implement a Federal strategy to reduce nutrition-related chronic diseases in the U.S., including diet-related research and programmatic efforts that increase Americans' access to food as medicine, and healthy, nutritious, organic, and affordable foods, especially in at-risk communities. The Committee requests a report within one year of the enactment of this Act on the implementation of the Federal strategy and its effectiveness in reducing nutrition related chronic diseases in the U.S. In developing the strategy, HHS shall reference the recommendation of the Government Accountability Office in its September 2021 report entitled ``Chronic Health Conditions: Federal Strategy Needed to Coordinate Diet-Related Efforts.'' Supporting Community Violence Intervention Programs.--The Committee notes HHS and its agencies, including CDC and SAMHSA, have a critical role to play in supporting community violence intervention, including by providing grant funding to eligible programs and technical assistance to grant recipients, and through evaluating the implementation of community violence intervention programs. The Committee urges the Department to evaluate its existing grant programs to determine which programs can be used to support community-based violence intervention activities and ensure that relevant funding opportunity announcements clearly articulate that they can fund community violence interventions. The Committee also urges the Department to conduct outreach to raise awareness about the funding available for community violence intervention programs, provide technical assistance to grant recipients and conduct research into program efficacy and implementation. Technology's Role in Healthcare Workforce.--The Committee recognizes the important role that HHS continues to provide to support and protect the public health workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Committee requests an update in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification on the challenges associated with hiring, recruiting, and retaining the Federal, State, local, tribal and territorial public health workforce. This update should include a specific analysis of how technology, especially hands-free technology, could help to protect clinicians' physical safety and ease the burden of patient care, thereby increasing retention of the public health workforce. Telehealth Data.--The Committee recognizes that demand for telemedicine increased in 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the Committee notes disparities in telehealth exist between and within racial and ethnic groups, rural and urban locations, and geographic regions as detailed in a December 2021 report by the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation. The Committee urges the Secretary, working with CMS and HRSA, to categorize telehealth usage data, including for audio-only services, by Health Professional Shortage Areas. The Committee further urges the Secretary to work across agencies to ensure that improvements to broadband availability are prioritized in those areas with lowest telehealth usage, highest audio-only usage, and a known health professional shortage. The Committee requests an update within 120 days of the date of enactment of this Act on this categorization and broadband availability. U.S.-Mexico Border Health Commission.--The Committee recognizes the important role the U.S.-Mexico Border Health Commission plays in promoting solutions to health issues unique to the Southern border. The Committee includes $2,500,000 for the Commission, an increase of $500,000. U.S.-Mexico Border Health Commission Vaccine Deployment Strategy.--The Committee notes the U.S. must work with Mexico to implement a binational COVID-19 strategy to ensure a full economic recovery both in border communities and nationally. The Committee encourages the U.S. section of the U.S.-Mexico Border Health Commission to engage with their Mexican counterparts to develop a COVID-19 vaccine deployment strategy for communities on both sides of the border. The Committee requests a report within 180 days of the date of enactment of this Act on these efforts. White House Initiative on Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders (AANHPI).--The Committee includes funding to support the White House Initiative on Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders, led by the Secretary of HHS, to advance health equity and economic justice for AANHPI communities that continue to face racism, nativism, and xenophobia. Minority HIV/AIDS Fund The Committee includes $60,000,000 for the Minority HIV/ AIDS Fund (MHAF), which is $3,100,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level, and encourages the Secretary to prioritize MHAF grants to HIV-based agencies that are minority led with preference given to organizations led by women, men, and transgender persons who identify as African American/Black, Latino, American Indian/Alaskan Native, Asian American, and/or Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander. Tribal Set-Aside.--The Committee notes that according to the CDC, HIV-positive status among Native Americans is increasing and nearly one-in-five HIV-positive Native Americans is unaware of their status. In addition, only three-in-five receive care and less than half are virally suppressed. To increase access to HIV/AIDS testing, prevention, and treatment, the Committee includes $5,000,000 as a tribal set-aside within the MHAF. Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health Commissioned Corps of the United States Public Health Service.--The Committee is aware that as of October 1, 2021, the Commissioned Corps of the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS Commissioned Corps) is issuing a ``Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty'' (DD Form 214) to USPHS Commissioned Corps officers who are released from active duty. The Committee requests a report within 90 days of the date of enactment of this Act on the feasibility of issuing a DD Form 214 to each USPHS Commissioned Corps Officer who retired or separated from USPHS Commissioned Corps service prior to October 1, 2021 and received a different statement of service. Hepatitis B Adult Vaccination.--The Committee encourages the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH) to host an interagency summit to discuss dissemination and implementation of the Advisory Committee Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendation that all adults between 19 and 59 be vaccinated for hepatitis B. The Committee is also aware that CDC is actively considering a complimentary universal hepatitis B vaccine screening policy and encourages OASH to support this process, as appropriate. Office of Climate Change and Health Equity.--The Committee includes $3,000,000 in funding for the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity (OCCHE) within OASH. HHS established OCCHE to enhance overall population health by serving at the intersection of social determinants of health and climate resiliency. Teen Pregnancy Prevention.--The Committee strongly supports the Teen Pregnancy Prevention (TPP) Program and provides $130,000,000, an increase of $29,000,000 above the enacted level. The TPP Program has been widely cited as a high-quality evidence-based program, including by the bipartisan Commission on Evidence-Based Policymaking. Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program Evidence Review.--The Committee includes $900,000 for the TPP Evidence Review, for a total of $7,700,000 in PHS Act section 241 evaluation set-aside transfers. The Evidence Review is an independent, systematic, rigorous review of evaluation studies that inform grantmaking and provide a clearinghouse of evidence-based programs for other Federal, State, and community initiatives. Office of Minority Health The Committee includes $80,835,000 for the Office of Minority Health (OMH), which is $16,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. The OMH works with U.S. Public Health Service agencies and other agencies of the Department to address the health status and quality of life for racial and ethnic minority populations in the United States. OMH develops and implements new policies; partners with States, Tribes, and communities through cooperative agreements; supports research, demonstration, and evaluation projects; and disseminates information. Center for Indigenous Innovation and Health Equity.--The Committee continues to recognize the importance of advancing Indigenous solutions to achieve health equity. The Committee includes $4,000,000, an increase of $2,000,000 to support the work of the Center for Indigenous Innovation and Health Equity. The Committee continues to urge HHS to consider partnering with universities with a focus on Indigenous health research and policy among Native Americans and Alaska Natives, as well as universities with a focus on Indigenous health policy and innovation among Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders. Community Health Worker Workgroup.--The Committee provides an additional $1,000,000 for the Community Health Worker Workgroup within OMH specifically to focus on increasing cultural competency in educational campaigns on public health vaccines and prevention, including but not limited to influenza and COVID-19. Healthcare Delivery and Faith-Based Organizations.--The Committee notes the emerging partnerships with faith-based organizations to deliver healthcare in underserved communities, including recent successful efforts to address the COVID-19 pandemic. The Committee understands that community partners and faith-based organizations can take on an expanded role and support efforts to address health disparities and promote health equity. HHS and OMH are encouraged to continue to pursue new and expanded opportunities. Language Access Services.--The Committee includes $3,000,000 to research, develop, and test methods of informing limited English proficient (LEP) individuals about their right to and the availability of language access services, including considerations related to literacy levels of LEP populations, the needs of older adults and speakers of indigenous languages, readability, and the usage of symbols, taglines, translated materials and other methodologies. OMH shall consult external experts and organizations with knowledge on or connections to LEP communities and partner with nonprofit community-based organizations to test solutions and solicit feedback from LEP populations. The goal of this research would preferably be to develop a universal symbol that, accompanied by a phone number or similar information, could be prominently placed on consumer-facing documents, websites and notices, about the availability of language access services. In addition, the Committee notes that the HHS language access plan has not been updated since 2013. The Committee requests a report not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, on HHS's plan to update its language access plan, including a timeline for publication on lep.gov. Minority Leaders Development Program.--The Committee provides a $1,000,000 increase for the Minority Leaders Development Program which aims to enhance skills and competencies necessary for Federal leadership service among participants through a curriculum focused on health care policy, leadership skill-building, and cultural competence. The initiative will fill a gap in Federal fellowship opportunities for individuals interested in working at HHS to advance health equity and address the social determinants of health through health policies, programs, and practices. National Lupus Training, Outreach, and Clinical Trial Education Program.--The Committee continues to support the National Lupus Training, Outreach, and Clinical Trial Education Program at $2,000,000. The Committee commends efforts by OMH to increase outreach, education, and awareness of opportunities to participate in lupus clinical trials among minority populations nationally. Shortage of Healthcare Providers.--The Committee is concerned about the growing shortage of providers including both primary and specialty healthcare providers that threatens the foundation of the health care system and health equity. A coordinated national strategy is needed to diversify the health care workforce and address shortages in rural and urban communities. The findings of The Roundtable on Black Men and Black Women in Science, Engineering, and Medicine outline racism and bias as significant reasons for this disparity in science, engineering, and medicine, with detrimental implications on individuals, health care organizations, and the nation as a whole. The Committee directs the Secretary to include a multi-year plan in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification to address the national primary care and specialty provider shortages to improve access to care. The plan shall include strategies to improve health outcomes by diversifying the field of primary care through the establishment of a pathway program for community college students to pursue premedical training and enter medical school. In addition, the Committee looks forward to receiving the report from the Advisory Committee on Minority Health advising HHS on the best efforts to create pipeline programs that start with pre-med students in underserved areas and end in more graduate medical education training programs in those underserved areas requested in House Report 117-96. The Committee recognizes the need to build and strengthen the pipeline for physicians who practice in medically underserved areas. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed how fragile the frontline provider workforce is because of the physician shortage crisis, and it is most pronounced in medically underserved areas. Office on Women's Health The Committee includes $48,140,000 for the Office on Women's Health (OWH), which is $10,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. Breastfeeding Analysis.--The Committee includes $1,250,000 for the Office on Women's Health to enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to provide an evidence-based, non-partisan analysis of the macroeconomic, health, and social costs of U.S. breastfeeding rates and national breastfeeding goals. This analysis should include a differential analysis of the current policies, programs, and investments aimed at increasing breastfeeding initiation, improving 3- and 6-month exclusive breastfeeding rates, reducing racial, geographic, and income-related breastfeeding disparities, and reducing U.S. reliance on formula. NAS should propose recommendations for achieving the Healthy People 2020 and 2030 breastfeeding goals by 2030. The Committee requests a briefing on this analysis within 90 days of the date of enactment of this Act. Combatting Violence Against Women.--The Committee includes $10,000,000 to combat violence against women through the State partnership initiative and directs the OWH to work in conjunction with the Family Violence Prevention and Services Program office.

OFFICE OF THE NATIONAL COORDINATOR FOR HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $64,238,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 103,614,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 86,614,000 Change from enacted level......................... +22,376,000 Change from budget request........................ -17,000,000 The Office of the National Coordinator (ONC) is the principal Federal entity charged with coordinating efforts to implement and use health information technology and exchange electronically health information. Electronic Health Information Security.--The Committee notes that as patients electronically access and share their electronic health information (EHI) in new ways, it is important that both patients and their healthcare providers have confidence in the privacy and security of that information regardless of which entities hold that data, including those that may not be subject to the HIPAA Rules. To better understand and protect against potential security vulnerabilities and cyberattacks to those entities not subject to the HIPAA Rules, the Committee urges the Secretary to examine and brief the Federal Trade Commission on the vulnerabilities to patients' EHI associated with increased use of application programming interfaces (APIs) by consumer- oriented app companies and consumer data aggregation services, the extent to which potential vulnerabilities may result because of a lack of consistent security safeguards for entities operating outside the bounds of Federal health information privacy and security rules, and potential Federal policy options to better protect the security of patients' health information. Information Blocking Guidance.--The Committee recognizes that the ONC's rule to implement the interoperability and information blocking provisions of the 21st Century Cures Act took significant steps forward to give patients greater access to and improve the electronic flow of electronic health information across care settings. Given the significant penalties and other consequences for information blocking, the Committee urges ONC to provide regulated entities and other affected stakeholders with clear, practical guidance regarding foundational concepts in the rule. Guidance should clearly outline how regulated entities can evaluate their particular circumstances and scenarios against the rule's provisions, including how to identify and apply relevant exceptions to the information blocking definition. Interoperability of Maternity Care Records.--The Committee recognizes that Personal Health Records for pregnant people are needed to improve patient health and safety as they move from one level of care to another during pregnancy, and that efforts must continue to improve the interoperability of electronic health records in order to optimize the care of pregnant persons. The Committee requests that within one year of enactment of this Act, HHS create and publish guidelines that address Perinatal Care and that leverage the skills of all providers, including physicians and midwives, and all sites of care, including hospitals and freestanding birth centers. The guidelines should also outline best practices for creating and maintaining accessible, longitudinal peri- and post-natal health records for patients. Patient Matching.--The Committee is concerned there is no consistent and accurate way to link patients to their health information as they seek care across the continuum, and believes health information must be accurate, timely, and robust to inform clinical care decisions for every patient. The recommendation includes $5,000,00 for ONC to work with industry to develop matching standards that prioritize interoperability, patient safety, and patient privacy. Standards for Interoperability.--The recommendation includes not less than $5,000,000 to support Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource standards-related activities needed to successfully achieve interoperability and information sharing for better health and health care.

TITLE III--DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION EDUCATION FOR THE DISADVANTAGED Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $18,229,790,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 21,280,551,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 21,260,551,000 Change from enacted level......................... +3,030,761,000 Change from budget request........................ -20,000,000 This account provides foundational funding to help ensure all children receive a fair, equitable and high-quality education. Of the total amount available, $10,306,490,000 is appropriated for fiscal year 2023 for obligation on or after July 1, 2024 and $10,841,177,000 is appropriated for fiscal year 2023 for obligation on or after October 1, 2024. Grants to Local Educational Agencies For fiscal year 2023, the Committee recommends $20,536,802,000 for Title I grants to Local Educational Agencies (LEAs or school districts), an increase of $3,000,000,000 over the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. Title I is the cornerstone of Federal K-12 education programs and critical to the nation's collective efforts to ensure that every child has the opportunity to obtain a high-quality education. The program serves an estimated 25 million students in nearly 90 percent of school districts and nearly 60 percent of all public schools. Providing additional resources so that children can succeed in school and in life is one of the Committee's highest priorities in the bill. Of the amounts provided for Title I programs, $6,459,401,000 is available for Basic Grants to LEAs, which is the same as the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. Basic grants are awarded to school districts with at least 10 low-income children who make up more than two percent of the school-age population. Within the amount for Title I Basic Grants, up to $5,000,000 is made available to the Secretary of Education (Secretary) on October 1, 2022, to obtain annually-updated LEA- level poverty data from the Bureau of the Census. The Committee recommends $1,362,301,000 for Title I Concentration Grants, which is the same as the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. Concentration Grants target funds to school districts in which the number of low-income children exceeds 6,500 or 15 percent of the total school-age population. The Committee recommends $6,357,550,000 for Title I Targeted Grants, which is $1,500,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. Targeted Grants provide higher payments to school districts with high numbers or percentages of low-income students. The Committee recommends $6,357,550,000 for Title I Education Finance Incentive Grants (EFIGs) which is $1,500,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. EFIGs provide payments to States and school districts that incorporate equity and effort factors to improve the equity of State funding systems. Fiscal Equity.--The Committee is concerned that school districts serving majority students of color and students from low-income backgrounds are more likely to be funded inadequately. Data shows school districts with the highest percentage enrollments of students of color receive nearly $1,800 per student less in State and local funding than school districts serving the fewest students of color, while districts serving the most students in poverty receive $1,000 less than districts serving the fewest students in poverty. Against the backdrop of these unacceptable inequities, Title I provides vital additional resources to support low- income students in school. Since fiscal year 2002, the Committee has directed increases to Title I through the Targeted and EFIG formulas. Under the Targeted and within-State EFIG formulas, a school district receives higher grants per child counted in the Title I formula the higher its poverty rate or number. A 2019 study of the Title I formulas by the National Center for Education Statistics illustrates their progressive structure--under Targeted, districts in the highest poverty quarter received $118 more per formula-eligible child than the lowest poverty quarter. Under EFIG, districts in the highest poverty quarter received $143 more per formula-eligible child than the lowest poverty quarter. The Committee regards the Targeted and EFIG formulas as essential tools for promoting funding equity nationwide; however, the Committee recognizes that State and local funding represents more than 90 percent of public K-12 funding nationwide. Accordingly, the Committee believes States can do far more to improve school district funding equity through improvements to school finance formulas. While some will argue that Federal legislative attention should exclusively focus on improvements to Title I formulas, the Committee believes such efforts represent work avoidance. Instead, the Committee believes States have an opportunity to combat urgent funding inequities through more progressive funding allocations to districts. For instance, if State-level funding to school districts were distributed via methods similar to the Federal Targeted and within-State EFIG formulas, the impact would be transformative for students attending the nation's highest-need schools. To begin this work, the Committee recommendation includes a new provision, which allows the Secretary to use up to $50,000,000 to award competitive grants to States for voluntary activities designed to identify and close funding gaps between high-poverty and low-poverty school districts. The Committee is supportive of efforts to provide financial assistance to States that request aid to identify disparities in State or local funding for high-need LEAs; engage with local communities in developing plans, goals and timelines for reducing identified disparities; and report on interim goals, progress and corrective actions. The Committee also acknowledges that the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) contains several provisions intended to reduce resource inequities between high-poverty and low-poverty school districts, particularly regarding school improvement activities. The Committee encourages the Department to continue its efforts to assist States in evaluating resource allocation in districts that serve a significant number of schools identified for improvement and districts in identifying resource inequities for schools identified for improvement as part of a comprehensive school support and improvement plan. Transportation and School Improvement.--The Committee recognized a longstanding barrier to the implementation of strategies to increase student diversity as a means of school improvement in the Department of Education Appropriations Act, 2019 when it removed two decades-old prohibitions on the use of Federal funds for transportation costs to carry out school desegregation efforts. Subsequently, in the Department of Education Appropriations Act, 2021, the Committee removed the last of these long-standing prohibitions in the Federal code in the General Education Provisions Act. With the recent removal of these prohibitions, the Committee remains concerned many States and districts may be unaware of their ability to use ESEA funding to support voluntary school integration efforts. In response, the Committee included a directive in House Report 117-96 requiring the Department to provide technical assistance to school districts regarding the use of school improvement funds under Title I, Part A for transportation to support voluntary school integration efforts. The Committee looks forward to receiving an update on the Department's progress in carrying out this work by September 30, 2022. Reservation for Homeless Students.--The Committee continues to urge that the Department support LEAs' development of plans under section 1112(b)(6) of the ESEA that describe the amount of funds for homeless students reserved under section 1113(c)(3)(A) of the ESEA, how such amount was determined, and the amount of the prior year's reservation that was spent on homeless students. The Committee further urges that the Department support State educational agencies' (SEAs) development of plans under section 1111(g)(1)(F) of the ESEA that describe how the SEA will monitor the amount and use of funds reserved for homeless students under section 1113(c)(3)(A) and provide technical assistance to assist LEAs in effectively using such funds to support homeless students. Diverse Texts in School Libraries.--The Committee believes that all students should be able to access texts that reflect their interests and diverse cultures. Unfortunately, too many Black, Latino, Asian-American, and Native students are unable to access such books and printed materials in their classrooms and school libraries. To address this challenge, the Committee supports classroom and school libraries that seek to include content that reflects the history and diversity of their student populations. School Names.--The Committee supports efforts by school districts that are home to populations of Latino, Black, Asian- American, and Native students to ensure public schools reflect the diversity of their districts, which may extend to the naming of schools to highlight the achievements of members from Latino, Black, Asian-American, and Native communities. History and Cultural Contributions of Racial and Ethnic Minorities.--The Committee recognizes the increasing diversity of student populations attending K-12 public schools in the United States, and the value in developing curricula that fully capture the history and cultural contributions of racial and ethnic minorities in the U.S. The Committee supports efforts by the Department to provide technical assistance to K-12 public schools and educators interested in developing such courses and curricula for their students. The Committee also supports efforts by the Department to provide technical assistance around professional development for K-12 educators to develop, implement, and teach these emerging curricula using research- based, culturally responsive teaching methods and best practices. The Committee recognizes that well-taught and well- designed courses highlighting the history and cultural contributions of diverse populations provide academic benefits to all students and contribute to students' sense of self and belonging in school. Increasing Equity in Advanced Coursework.--Research shows that Black, Latino, and Native American students, students with disabilities, and students from low-income families are underrepresented in advanced programs and courses (gifted and talented, advanced placement, international baccalaureate, honors courses, dual enrollment). A major barrier for these students is the over-reliance on subjective criteria not proven to predict course success. The Committee is encouraged by recent State and district actions to lessen these disparities, including the implementation of open enrollment, automatic enrollment for students who have demonstrated readiness, and/or universal screening for gifted and talented programs. The Committee notes that funds under ESEA may be used to implement open enrollment, automatic enrollment, and/or universal screening practices; as well as use these funds to increase course access and success, provide coaching and training for educators, purchase materials, and/or cover exam fees for underrepresented students. To ensure these resources advance student outcomes for historically underserved students, the Committee continues to encourage the Department to resume collecting data on passing rates for all Advanced Placement subject areas. Military Student Identifier.--The Committee notes that the ESEA recognizes military-connected students as a distinct subgroup of students. More than 80 percent of military- connected children attend public schools. Students with parents/guardians who serve full-time in the military move and change schools frequently. In addition, they may experience trauma resulting from separations from a parent/guardian due to their parents' service to the U.S. Military. The Military Student Identifier provides educators, school leaders, and policymakers with critical information to personalize attention and direct resources to better support military dependent children. Current law directs the Military Student Identifier toward the children of active duty families, leaving out the nearly one-half million children of the reserve component, both National Guard and Reserves. The Committee supports efforts to address the unique needs of children whose parents/guardians serve in the National Guard and reserve components. Comprehensive Literacy Development Grants The Committee recommends $192,000,000 for Comprehensive Literacy Development Grants, which is the same as the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. Funds are awarded to States to subgrant to school districts and/or early education programs to improve literacy instruction for disadvantaged students. Innovative Approaches to Literacy The Committee recommends $31,000,000 for Innovative Approaches to Literacy (IAL), which is $2,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. IAL funds support competitive grants to school libraries and national not-for-profit organizations to provide books and literacy activities to children and families in high-need communities. Underserved Urban School Districts.--The Committee directs the Department in any new fiscal year 2023 competition to continue prioritizing underserved communities in urban school districts in which students from low-income families make up at least 50 percent of enrollment. State Agency Programs: Migrant The Committee recommends $375,626,000 for the State Agency Program for Migrant Education, which is the same as the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. This program supports special educational and related services for children of migrant agricultural workers and fishermen, including: (1) supplementary academic education; (2) remedial or compensatory instruction; (3) English for limited English proficient students; (4) testing; (5) guidance counseling; and (6) other activities to promote coordination of services across States for migrant children whose education is interrupted by frequent moves. State Agency Programs: Neglected and Delinquent For the State Agency Program for Neglected and Delinquent Children, the Committee recommends $48,239,000, the same as the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. This formula grant program supports educational services for children and youth under age 21 in State-run institutions, attending community day programs, and in correctional facilities. A portion of these funds is provided for projects that support the successful re-entry of youth from the criminal justice system into postsecondary and vocational programs. Support for At-risk Youth.--The Committee is concerned with findings from the Department's report to Congress on Neglected and Delinquent Programs, which found that State-level data on re-entry activities required under ESEA is insufficient to provide an accurate sense of the success of such efforts nationally. Given the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the youth justice system, the Committee believes it is essential that the Department monitor and ensure compliance with re-entry activities required under ESEA. In the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification, the Committee requests information regarding how the Department will support each State in meeting the data reporting and re-entry requirements for youth included in ESEA. Children and Youth in Foster Care The Committee includes $18,761,000 for a new program, Improving Outcomes for Children and Youth in Foster Care. The Committee notes the importance of mentoring in helping children and youth in foster care thrive and strongly encourages the Department to prioritize partnership grants that match students in foster care with mentors and tutors. Special Programs for Migrant Students The Committee recommends $58,123,000 for the Special Programs for Migrant Students, which is $10,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. These programs make grants to colleges, universities, and nonprofit organizations to support educational programs designed for students who are engaged in migrant and other seasonal farm work. The High School Equivalency Program (HEP) recruits migrant students age 16 and over and provides academic and support services to help those students obtain a high school equivalency certificate and subsequently to gain employment or admission to a postsecondary institution or training program. The College Assistance Migrant Program (CAMP) provides tutoring and counseling services to first-year, undergraduate migrant students and assists those students in obtaining student financial aid for their remaining undergraduate years. IMPACT AID Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $1,557,112,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 1,541,112,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 1,614,112,000 Change from enacted level......................... +57,000,000 Change from budget request........................ +73,000,000 This account supports payments to school districts affected by Federal activities, such as those that educate children whose families are connected with the military or who live on Indian land. Basic Support Payments The Committee recommends $1,464,242,000 for Basic Support Payments to LEAs, which is $55,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. Basic Support Payments compensate school districts for lost tax revenue and are made on behalf of Federally-connected children, such as children of members of the uniformed services who live on Federal property. Payments for Children With Disabilities The Committee recommends $48,316,000 for Payments for Children with Disabilities, which is the same as the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. These payments compensate school districts for the increased costs of serving Federally- connected children with disabilities. Facilities Maintenance The Committee recommends $4,835,000 for Facilities Maintenance, which is the same as the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. These capital payments are authorized for maintenance of certain facilities owned by the Department. Construction The Committee recommends $17,406,000 for the Construction program, which is the same as the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. Funding is allocated by formula to eligible LEAs for school construction activities under section 7007(b) of ESEA. Payments for Federal Property The Committee recommends $79,313,000 for Payments for Federal Property, which is $2,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. Funds are awarded to school districts to compensate for lost tax revenue as the result of Federal acquisition of real property since 1938. Data for Eligible Communities.--The reporting method used to calculate the amount of Impact Aid a school receives is critical to ensuring accurate data for eligible communities. Correct student counts ensure adequate resources are provided for students. The Committee repeats its request that the Department assess the merits of such flexibilities in future years, along with other potential process modifications, in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification. In addition, the Committee requests recommendations for helping LEAs plan for discrepancies between estimated and actual award levels. SCHOOL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $5,595,835,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 5,525,982,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 5,905,642,000 Change from enacted level......................... +309,807,000 Change from budget request........................ +379,660,000 The Committee recommendation includes $5,905,642,000 for the School Improvement Programs account. Supporting Effective Instruction State Grants The Committee recommends $2,270,080,000 for Supporting Effective Instruction State Grants (Title II-A), which is $100,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. Title II-A grants provide States and school districts with a flexible source of funding to strengthen the skills and knowledge of teachers, principals, and administrators to enable them to improve student achievement. Educator Diversity.--Research shows that all students, and in particular students of color, benefit from a racially diverse workforce. Research shows that students benefit both academically and through the positive relationships they build with educators. However, barriers such as unfavorable working conditions or antagonistic work cultures mean that teachers of color leave the profession at higher rates than their peers. The Committee recognizes that the need for a more diverse educator workforce is always pressing, but is especially urgent right now, as nearly half of U.S. schools are facing COVID- related staff shortages. The Committee is encouraged by efforts to address factors undergirding teacher shortages and lack of teacher diversity in States and districts, including using evidence-based models such as Grow Your Own programs. The Committee's increase to Title II-A for fiscal year 2023 is intended to address concerns about staffing shortages, increase educator diversity, and implement evidence-based programs. The Committee encourages the Department to ensure funds support States and districts with the greatest need and programs that specifically aim to increase the diversity of the teaching workforce. Materials from Teacher Professional Development.--Given the importance of funds under Title II-A in helping teachers advance their own professional development and meet the needs of their students, the Committee encourages the Department to issue guidance clarifying allowable uses of funds. Teachers often take professional development training that, in turn, requires access to additional funding for instructional materials to be able to utilize their training in the classroom. The Committee continues to support efforts by the Secretary to offer guidance on how an LEA may use Title II-A funds on instructional materials that are directly connected to teacher professional development training. In addition, the Committee continues to note the benefits of posting guidance online and communicating about guidance with outside stakeholders, particularly district superintendents. Supplemental Education Grants The Committee recommends $24,464,000 for Supplemental Education Grants to the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands, which is $4,807,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. The Compact of Free Association Amendments Act of 2003 (P.L. 108-188) authorizes these entities to receive funding for general education assistance. Nita M. Lowey 21st Century Community Learning Centers The Committee recommends $1,409,673,000 for Nita M. Lowey 21st Century Community Learning Centers, $120,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and $100,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 budget request. Funds are awarded by formula to States, which in turn distribute funds on a competitive basis to local school districts, nonprofit organizations, and other public entities. The Committee notes that only one in three 21st Century Community Learning Centers grant applications is awarded, reflecting substantial unmet demand for these opportunities. The $120,000,000 increase over fiscal year 2022 will help communities providing afterschool programs serve 144,000 more students than in fiscal year 2022. State Assessments The Committee recommends $390,000,000 for State Assessments, which is the same as the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. Funds are available to develop and implement academic standards and assessments. The program includes a set-aside for audits to identify and eliminate low-quality or duplicative assessments. Education for Homeless Children and Youth The Committee recommends $122,000,000 for the Education for Homeless Children and Youth program, which is $8,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. Grants are allocated to States in proportion to the total each State receives under the Title I program. Training and Advisory Services The Committee recommends $6,575,000 for Training and Advisory Services authorized by Title IV-A of the Civil Rights Act, which is the same as the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. Title IV-A authorizes technical assistance and training services for school districts to address problems associated with desegregation on the basis of race, sex, or national origin. The Department awards three-year grants to regional Equity Assistance Centers (EACs) located in each of the 10 Department of Education regions. The EACs provide services to school districts upon request. Typical activities include disseminating information on successful education practices and legal requirements related to nondiscrimination on the basis of race, sex, and national origin in educational programs. Education for Native Hawaiians The Committee recommends $40,897,000 for the Education for Native Hawaiian program, which is $2,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. Funds are used to provide competitive awards for supplemental education services to the Native Hawaiian population. Construction.--The Committee's $2,000,000 increase to this program will specifically focus on construction needs for schools that serve Native Hawaiian students. The Committee is supportive of resources to public elementary and secondary schools that serve Native Hawaiian students, including activities for construction, renovation, and modernization of any public elementary school, secondary school, or structure related to a public elementary school or secondary school, as authorized under part B of Title VI. The Committee encourages the Department to prioritize funding to organizations with construction needs that have experience providing supplemental education services to Native Hawaiian children and youth. Applicant Support.--For the fiscal year 2023 Education for Native Hawaiians competition, the Committee encourages the Department to offer technical assistance to quality applicants who have not received awards in previous competitions in order to promote grantee diversity among schools and programs that have experience providing education services to Native Hawaiian children and youth. Alaska Native Education Equity The Committee recommends $37,953,000 for the Alaska Native Education Equity program, which is the same as the fiscal year 2022 level. Funds are used to provide competitive awards for supplemental education services to the Alaska Native population. Rural Education The Committee recommends $195,000,000 for Rural Education programs, which is the same as the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. There are two dedicated programs to assist rural school districts with improving teaching and learning in their schools: the Small, Rural Schools Achievement program, which provides funds to rural districts that serve a small number of students; and the Rural and Low-Income Schools program, which provides funds to rural districts that serve concentrations of poor students, regardless of the number of students served by the district. Funds appropriated for Rural Education shall be divided equally between these two programs. Comprehensive Centers The Committee recommends $54,000,000 for Comprehensive Centers, which is the same as the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. The Comprehensive Centers program includes support for regional centers that provide training, technical assistance, and professional development to build State capacity to provide high-quality education to all students. Student Support and Academic Enrichment State Grants The Committee recommends $1,355,000,000 for Student Support and Academic Enrichment (SSAE) State Grants, which is $75,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. SSAE grants provide SEAs and LEAs with flexible resources that provide students with access to a well-rounded education, including rigorous coursework, and improve school conditions and the use of technology. Arts and Entertainment Pipeline Programs.--The Committee continues to encourage the Department to work with States and school districts that serve diverse youth to explore using SSAE funding to support and create youth pipeline programs in the arts and entertainment industries. The Committee is aware of programs that focus on closing student opportunity gaps by bringing filmmakers into Title I schools to partner with teachers to expand access to the arts, implement social and emotional learning strategies, and support rigorous academic curricula. A 2019 evaluation by the Stanford Center for Assessment, Learning, and Equity found that such programs create a positive environment and learning community, promote active and social learning, provide in-depth instruction of vocabulary practices, and cultivate social and emotional learning competencies. Accelerated Learning Programs.--The Committee continues to support efforts by States and LEAs to increase diversity in accelerated student learning programs, such as advanced placement courses, gifted and talented classes and honors programs. The Committee supports the use of ESEA funding to create State or local equity offices. Equity offices could evaluate current data on the students enrolled in accelerated student learning programs and use such data to inform recommendations to LEAs on how to improve the diversity of those programs. The Committee recognizes that Black, Latino, and Native students, students living in poverty, and English learners are historically underrepresented in accelerated learning programs. Research shows that developing targeted recruitment and outreach plans, as well as universal screening for talented and gifted programs help address inequitable access that lock students out of opportunities that engage them more meaningfully in school and expand their postsecondary success. Menstrual Health.--The Committee is concerned about the disruptions to educational opportunities that children living in period poverty experience. Industry reports found that one in five school age children have missed school due to lack of access to safe and affordable menstrual products. In the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification, Committee directs the Department to provide an update on the Department's implementation of the directive provided under this heading in House Report 117-96. In addition, the Committee requests information around the feasibility of supporting free menstrual product programs through the Nita M. Lowey 21st Century Community Learning Centers program. School Diversity.--The Committee strongly encourages the Department to use the two percent set-aside for technical assistance and capacity building under SSAE to award capacity- building grants to LEAs and SEAs to reduce racial and socioeconomic segregation across and within school districts. Eye-care Services--The Committee is supportive of efforts by SEAs and LEAs to provide on-campus eye-care services free of charge to students in public elementary or secondary schools. Youth Mental Health and Social and Emotional Learning.--In the face of a youth mental health crisis, the Committee believes it is critical to invest in key social and emotional learning programs that build essential life skills as an effective component of promoting student mental wellness and preventing the development of substance use, child sexual abuse, bullying, and youth suicide. Investments in evidence- based social and emotional learning programs return $11 for every dollar invested and the Committee encourages the Department to work with the Department of Health and Human Services on youth mental health to prioritize access to primary prevention programs and ensure such programs across the government are coordinated and leveraged for the maximum impact. Mentoring to Address Chronic Absence.--The Committee is concerned about the high rates of student chronic absenteeism across the country since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and encourages the Department to inform SEAs on how Title IV-A and other Federal funding sources can be used to support early warning data systems that identify populations of students who are chronically absent and successful interventions to address chronic absence and school engagement, such as mentoring. Technical Assistance on Inclusive Practices.--The Committee notes that SSAE provides flexible funding to support activities that promote a safe and healthy learning environment. With respect to these authorized activities, the Committee believes there is no more urgent charge than to support students through inclusive practices that are evidence-based and address the needs of the whole child. Further, the Committee is concerned by efforts that would promote SSAE for unintended purposes, including purposes that generate disproportionate negative impacts on specific student subgroups. Accordingly, the Committee directs the Department to describe the technical assistance it provides on inclusive, evidence-based practices that address the needs of the whole child in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification. Trafficking Prevention Activities.--The Committee supports the Department's current technical assistance support to SEAs and LEAs in implementing human trafficking prevention activities and encourages the Department to offer additional support for these efforts. Indian Education Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $189,246,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 186,239,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 195,246,000 Change from enacted level......................... +6,000,000 Change from budget request........................ +9,007,000 This account supports programs authorized by part A of title VI of the ESEA. Grants to Local Educational Agencies The Committee recommends $110,381,000 for Grants to Local Educational Agencies, which is $500,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. This program provides assistance through formula grants to school districts and schools supported or operated by the Bureau of Indian Education. The purpose of this program is to improve elementary and secondary school programs that serve American Indian students, including preschool children. Grantees must develop a comprehensive plan and ensure that the programs they carry out will help Indian students reach the same challenging standards that apply to all students. This program supplements the regular school program to help American Indian children sharpen their academic skills, bolster their self-confidence, and participate in enrichment activities that would otherwise be unavailable. Special Programs for Indian Children The Committee recommends $72,000,000 for Special Programs for Indian Children, which is $2,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. These programs make competitive awards to improve the quality of education for American Indian students. The program also funds the American Indian Teacher Corps and the American Indian Administrator Corps to recruit and support American Indians as teachers and school administrators. The Committee's investment for Special Programs for Indian Children is intended to help address the shortage of Native American educators nationwide. National Activities The Committee recommends $12,865,000 for National Activities, which is $3,500,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. Within this account, funding is provided for grants to Tribes for education administrative planning, development, and coordination, grants to support Native language immersion schools and programs. Funds under this authority also support research, evaluation and data collection to provide information about the educational status of Indian students and the effectiveness of Indian education programs. Native American Language Immersion and the State-Tribal Education Partnership Program.--The Committee provides a $3,000,000 increase to the Native American Language Immersion and the State-Tribal Education Partnership (STEP) programs above the fiscal year 2022 enacted levels for these programs. The Committee looks forward to a new fiscal year 2023 STEP competition and directs a portion of this increase to support new STEP awards. Native American Language Resource Centers.--Within this account, the Committee provides no less than $1,500,000 to support American Indian, Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian language activities for the Native American Language Resource Center program established in the explanatory statement accompanying the Department of Education Appropriations Act, 2022. INNOVATION AND IMPROVEMENT Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $1,300,730,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 1,572,000,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 1,484,608,000 Change from enacted level......................... +183,878,000 Change from budget request........................ -87,392,000 The Committee recommends $1,484,608,000 for programs within the Innovation and Improvement account. Education Innovation and Research The Committee recommends $384,000,000 for the Education Innovation and Research (EIR) program, which is $150,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. This program makes competitive grants to support the replication and scaling-up of evidence-based education innovations. Social and Emotional Learning Grants.--On April 6, 2022, the Subcommittee on Labor-HHS Education-Related Agencies held a hearing entitled ``Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) and Whole Child Approaches in K-12 Education,'' during which the Subcommittee heard from a panel of national experts on the robust evidence of effectiveness for whole child interventions, including SEL. The Subcommittee discussed how high-quality SEL programs that support students' social, emotional, and cognitive development result in lasting positive academic and life outcomes. In addition, the Subcommittee explored how dedicated Federal resources for these approaches are vital to expanding their reach nationwide. To address these critical needs, within the total for EIR, the agreement includes $132,000,000, $50,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level, to provide high-quality, evidence-based SEL grants. To fulfill the SEL set-aside, the Committee urges prioritization of SEL for both the early- and mid-phase evidence tiers. The Committee requests a briefing within 90 days of enactment of this Act on plans for carrying out the SEL competition. In addition, the Department shall provide notice and a briefing to the Committees at least seven days before grantees are announced. SEL Interventions for Educational Staff.--The Committee notes that the EIR SEL competition can also support evidence- based interventions for educational staff, including but not limited to teachers, school counselors, school psychologists, and school social workers. In light of the significant challenges educators have faced during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Committee recognizes that educational staff may experience fatigue or stress related to their work in supporting students and their families, as well as burnout due to a combination of factors related to their work. While teacher retention and teacher shortage challenges remain multifaceted, the Committee recognizes the value of mental health resources and SEL interventions in order to support the emotional and mental health and wellbeing of educational staff. STEAM and Computer Science Grants.--In addition, within the total for EIR, the Committee recommendation includes $87,000,000 for STEAM education, including computer science, $5,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. Within the STEAM and computer science set-aside, awards should expand opportunities for underrepresented students such as minorities, girls, and youth from families living at or below the poverty line to help reduce the enrollment and achievement gap. Teacher Education Programs in Computer Science.--The Committee notes that the EIR STEAM and computer science competition can also support grants to institutions of higher education for teacher education programs in computer science. Such grants can prepare aspiring teachers with the training, experience, and resources needed to become successful computer science educators; hire and retain faculty to carry out robust computer science education research; train doctoral students in the computer science field; educate graduate and undergraduate students preparing to become teachers in computer science; develop resources for computer science teachers or teachers in- training, informed by credible computer science education research or best practices from the computer science education field; and provide scholarships to students, particularly for students from traditionally underrepresented groups in computer science and based on financial need. Technology Access and Engagement.--The Committee notes that the EIR STEAM and computer science competition can also support grants that facilitate the implementation or expansion of technology-focused experiences that strengthen STEAM education. The Committee recognizes providing learning experiences to students that incorporate innovative technologies, such as digital learning platforms, improves STEM learning outcomes and equips students with vital skills high-demand fields like computer science and engineering. The Committee encourages the Department to provide priority to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs) and applicants seeking to implement or scale technology- enabled learning experiences in K-12 schools, including via the creation or acquisition of technological resources. Publicizing Research Findings.--The Committee continues to be supportive of efforts by the Department to publicize research findings from the EIR program as described in House Report 117-96. Diverse Geographic Areas.--The Committee encourages the Department to take steps necessary to ensure the statutory set- aside for rural areas is met and that EIR funds are awarded to diverse geographic areas. Teacher and School Leader Incentive Grants The Committee recommends $88,500,000 for the Teacher and School Leader Incentive Grants program, which is $84,500,000 less than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. This program provides grants to States, school districts, and partnerships to develop, implement, improve, or expand human capital management systems or performance-based compensation systems in schools. American History and Civics Academies The Committee recommends $3,000,000 for American History and Civics Academies, which is the same as the fiscal year 2022 enacted. American History and Civics National Activities The Committee recommends $12,500,000 for American History and Civics National Activities, which is $7,750,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. Civics Secures Democracy.--The Committee acknowledges the need for broad investment in civics education. In addition, the Committee recognizes that students who receive quality civics education are more likely to vote and to discuss politics at home, complete college and develop skills that lead to employment, and give back to their communities through volunteering and working on community issues. The Committee believes that Civics education in the United States is crucial to preserving democracy and the future safety of our nation. Therefore, the Committee directs the Department to run a new competition in fiscal year 2023 for grants supporting evidence-based practices proven to contribute to the effectiveness of educational programs in civics, including innovative and engaging classroom instruction in civics, government, and history; community service linked to classroom learning; learning through participation in models and simulations of democratic processes; meaningful participation in school governance; and instruction in media literacy through the study of common informal fallacies in logic. The Department is directed to prioritize grants that support traditionally underserved communities, including students from low-income urban and rural school districts, English learners, and students with disabilities. Eligible entities shall include LEAs, SEAs, and consortia of LEAs. Improving Civics Education Engagement.--The Committee recognizes that additional efforts are needed to ensure that our elementary, secondary, and postsecondary schools and institutions are coherently supporting civic education and experiences, rather than reinforcing siloed approaches. Accordingly, the Committee encourages partnerships that connect elementary and secondary civic education efforts with similar efforts at institutions of higher education. The Committee encourages such efforts to prioritize LEA partnerships with HBCUs and MSIs. Supporting Effective Educator Development The Committee recommends $90,000,000 for the Supporting Effective Educator Development (SEED) grant program, which is $5,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 level. SEED provides competitive grants to support alternative certification and other professional development and enrichment activities for teachers, principals, and other school leaders. Funds are included to fully support continuation costs for grants made in prior years. SEL and Whole Child Education.--The Committee continues to support the SEL competitive preference priority within the SEED competition. The priority supports professional development that helps educators incorporate SEL practices into teaching and supports pathways into teaching that provide a strong foundation in child development and learning, including skills for implementing SEL strategies in the classroom. The Committee directs the Department to include the competitive preference priority in any new SEED competition in fiscal year 2023. If the Department issues a new notice inviting application for fiscal year 2023, the Committee requests a briefing within 90 days of enactment of this Act on plans for carrying out the SEL competitive preference priority in SEED. In addition, the Department shall provide notice and a briefing to the Committees at least seven days before grantees for a new competition are announced. Computer Science and Native Students.--The Committee continues to encourage the Department, through the SEED program, to support projects that increase the number of teachers with computer science certifications with a priority to increase the number of such teachers in rural public schools and public schools serving high percentages of Native students. Charter Schools Grants The Committee recommends $400,000,000 for Charter School Program (CSP) Grants, which is $40,000,000 below the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the fiscal year 2022 budget request. CSP awards grants to SEAs or, if a State's SEA chooses not to participate, to charter school developers to support the development and initial implementation of public charter schools. State Facilities Incentive Grants and Credit Enhancement for Charter School Facilities awards help charter schools obtain adequate school facilities. These programs work in tandem to support the development and operation of charter schools. For-profit Entities.--The Department has long recognized the particular risks posed by for-profit education management organizations (EMOs). In response to a 2016 audit, the Department conceded to the Inspector General, ``ED is well aware of the challenges and risks posed by CMOs and, in particular, EMOs, that enter into contracts to manage the day- to-day operations of charter schools that receive Federal funds. We recognize that the proliferation of charter schools with these relationships has introduced potential risks with respect to conflicts of interest, related-party transactions, and fiscal accountability, particularly in regard to the use of federal funds.'' Since that initial acknowledgement by the Department regarding for-profit EMOs, the Committee has been made aware of concerning instances of criminal fraud, conflicts of interest, and inadequate transparency. In addition, the Committee is deeply concerned that for- profit charter schools, including those run by for-profit EMOs, deliver concerning outcomes for students. A 2017 report from Stanford University's Center for Research on Education Outcomes compared student performance at non-profit charters, for-profit charters, and traditional public schools and found that for- profit charters perform worse in reading, and significantly worse in math, than non-profit charters. In addition, the report found that for-profit charters perform worse in math than traditional public schools. That is why the Committee is strongly supportive of the Department's proposal to prohibit Federal CSP funding from supporting for-profit EMOs through its notice published in the Federal Register on March 14, 2022 (87 Fed. Reg. 14197). The Committee includes bill language codifying the prohibition to establish this precedent for fiscal year 2023 and for future years. Moving forward, the Committee urges the Secretary to work with Congress on efforts to fully phase out the concerning for-profit EMO sector. Such efforts could include reasonable transition periods that allow schools run by for-profit EMOs to shift to independent or nonprofit management. In the interim, the Committee is committed to continuing its oversight of the for-profit EMO sector and ensuring fewer taxpayer dollars enrich for-profit EMO shareholders. Defunct CSP Grantees.--The Committee is deeply concerned by the Department's analysis that fifteen percent of the charter schools receiving CSP funding since 2001 have never opened or closed before their three-year grant period is complete, representing an unacceptable waste of at least $174,000,000 in taxpayer funds. Accordingly, the Committee is strongly supportive of the Department's fiscal year 2022 CSP notice (87 Fed. Reg. 14197) that requires applicants to demonstrate local demand for new schools. The Committee rejects the premise that grant failure and school closure is the cost of doing business in CSP and welcomes reforms that will improve its performance. GAO Mandate from House Report 116-450.--The Committee continues to be supportive of GAO's work on the mandate included in House Report 116-450 regarding the Department's oversight over CSP and whether the program is being implemented effectively among grantees and subgrantees. The Committee is particularly interested in the issue of CSP-funded schools that eventually closed or received funds but never opened; the relationships between charter schools supported by CSP grants and charter management organizations; and enrollment patterns at these schools, especially for students with disabilities. In addition, the Committee is interested in recommendations on potential legislative changes to the program that would reduce the potential for mismanagement and ineffective operations. Oversight from the Office of Inspector General.--The Committee continues to support efforts by the Department's Office of Inspector General (OIG) to examine grantee administration of Replication and Expansion Grants, including charter management organization grantees. The Committee also supports the OIG's efforts to evaluate whether the Department adequately monitored grantees' performance and uses of funds for CSP competitions. Students with Disabilities and English Learners.--The Committee encourages the Department to continue including in their evaluation of State CSP grants the extent to which State entities are utilizing the seven percent of funding received under the program to ensure that charter schools receiving CSP grants are equipped to appropriately serve students with disabilities and, by extension, prepared to become high-quality charter schools. In addition, the Committee urges the Department to ensure subgrantees are equipped to meet the needs of English learners. The Committee directs the Department to provide an update on these efforts in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification. Charter School Effects on School Segregation.--The Committee is concerned by findings from a 2019 Urban Institute report which concluded that growth in charter school enrollment increases the segregation of Black, Latino, and white students. To address this concern, the Committee urges the Department to give priority to applicants that plan to use CSP funds to operate or manage charter schools intentionally designed to be racially and socioeconomically diverse. The Committee is strongly supportive of proposed requirements in the Department's fiscal year 2022 CSP notice (87 Fed. Reg. 14197) that grantees show that they will not exacerbate school segregation. Accordingly, the Committee urges the Department to examine the merits of diversity reporting that compares demographic data of grantees to that of local districts. The Committee directs the Department to share its assessment of CSP diversity reporting, along with any prospective plans for implementation, in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification. Magnet Schools Assistance The Committee recommends $149,000,000 for the Magnet Schools Assistance program (MSAP), which is $25,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. This program makes competitive grants to support the establishment and operation of magnet schools that are a part of a court-ordered or Federally-approved voluntary desegregation plan. Inter-district Magnet Schools.--A 2019 report by Urban Institute finds that two-thirds of total school segregation in metropolitan areas is due to segregation between, rather than within, school districts. Consortia of LEAs and regional education services agencies are eligible to receive MSAP grants to establish magnet schools that address inter-district school segregation; however, the Committee is concerned that these critical projects are infrequently funded. To address the urgent issue of inter-district segregation, the Committee continues to direct the Department to include a priority for applicants seeking to establish new inter-district magnet schools for any new competition in fiscal year 2023. Whole School Magnet Programs.--A recent Learning Policy Institute report finds that whole school magnet programs are more effective at fostering diversity than in-school magnet programs, which can create separate tracks and programs for different student populations. The Committee urges the Department to prioritize applicants seeking to establish and operate whole school magnet programs. Ready to Learn Programming The Committee recommends $32,500,000 for Ready to Learn Programming, which is $2,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. This program supports the development and distribution of educational video programming for preschool and elementary school children and their parents, caregivers, and teachers. Arts in Education The Committee recommends $38,500,000 for Arts in Education, which is $2,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 level. This program provides competitive grants to support professional development and the development of instructional materials and programming that integrate the arts into the curricula. Javits Gifted and Talented Education The Committee recommends $16,500,000 for the Javits Gifted and Talented Education Program, which is $2,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. Funds are awarded through grants and contracts to States, schools districts, and other organizations to support a coordinated program of research, demonstration projects, innovative strategies, and other activities to help schools identify gifted and talented students and address their unique educational needs. Underrepresented Populations.--The Committee encourages the Department to use funds to increase the number of grants that assist schools in the identification of, and provision of services to, gifted and talented students who may not be identified and served through traditional assessment methods, such as children with disabilities, English learners, children of color, and economically disadvantaged students. Statewide Family Engagement Centers The Committee recommends $16,000,000 for the Statewide Family Engagement Centers program, which is $1,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. Funds are awarded through grants to organizations to provide technical assistance and training to State and local educational agencies in the implementation and enhancement of systemic and effective family engagement policies, programs, and activities that lead to improvements in student development and academic achievement. Fostering Diverse Schools The Committee includes $100,000,000 for a new competitive grant program, Fostering Diverse Schools. The program establishes competitive grants to local educational agencies and State educational agencies to reduce racial and socioeconomic segregation across and within school districts. A 2019 report by Urban Institute finds that two-thirds of total school segregation in metropolitan areas is due to segregation between, rather than within, school districts. In response to this concerning dynamic, the Committee directs the Department to prioritize resources to address segregation across districts. The Committee notes the promise of strategies and models such as inter-district magnet schools, voluntary two-way transfer programs between segregated districts, district regionalization, and regional education service agency governance structures. The State of School District Secessions.--The Committee is concerned by research indicating that more than 128 school districts have attempted to break off, or ``secede'', from their school districts since the year 2000, and the likelihood of this trend increasing school segregation throughout the United States. The Committee continues to encourages the Department, in consultation with the Department of Justice, to issue a report describing the scope of the issue of school district ``secession'' and its impact on school segregation. Such a report could note which districts are party to Federal desegregation orders and explain whether these secessions are in violation of those orders. The report could also note what oversight exists on the part of State agencies regarding school district secession in the States where they have occurred. Community Project Funding Within the funds included in this account, $154,108,000 shall be used for the projects, and in the amounts, specified in the table titled ``Labor, HHS, Education Incorporation of Community Project Funding Items'' at the end of this report. SAFE SCHOOLS AND CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $361,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 1,693,000,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 1,708,000,000 Change from enacted level......................... +1,347,000,000 Change from budget request........................ +15,000,000 The Committee recommends a total of $1,708,000,000 for activities to promote safe schools, healthy students, and citizenship education, which is $1,347,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. Promise Neighborhoods The Committee recommends $96,000,000 for Promise Neighborhoods, which is $11,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. Promise Neighborhoods supports grants to nonprofit, community-based organizations for the development of comprehensive neighborhood programs designed to combat the effects of poverty and improve educational outcomes for children and youth, from birth through college. Planning Grants.--The Committee is supportive of planning grants within Promise intended to strengthen communities' abilities to scale city and regional reinvestment strategies and allow for direct services. These planning grants can support the alignment of resources and efforts across multiple sectors and focus on measurable shared goals. School Safety National Activities The Committee recommends $1,134,000,000 for School Safety National Activities, which is $933,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. The Committee's recommendation provides up to $5,000,000 for the Project School Emergency Response to Violence (Project SERV) program. School-based Mental Health Professionals.--The Committee applies the $1,000,000,000 fiscal year 2023 budget request for school-based mental health professionals to provide $500,000,000 for the Mental Health Services Professional Demonstration Grants program established in the Department of Education Appropriations Act, 2019 and $500,000,000 for the School-Based Mental Health Services Grants program established in the Department of Education Appropriations Act, 2020. The Committee does not expand the scope of these grants to include school nurses; however, the Committee helps address these urgent needs through increased support for School-based Health Centers administered by the Health Resources & Services Administration. The Committee notes that the School-Based Mental Health Services Grants program was created to award grants to SEAs, LEAs, or consortia of LEAs to increase the number of qualified, well-trained mental health professionals in schools. To achieve this critical goal, the Committee urges the Department to focus any new fiscal year 2023 competition on directly increasing the number of these vital mental health professionals, including school counselors, social workers, psychologists, or other mental health professionals qualified to provide school-based mental health services. In recognition of the role LEAs play in mental-health personnel decision making, the Committee directs the Department to guarantee no less than 75 percent of grants support LEA recipients. The Committee notes that the explanatory statement accompanying the Department of Education Appropriations Act, 2020 seeks to promote the sustainability of these services, by requiring that awards include a 25 percent match from grantees and by requiring that the awards do not supplant existing mental health funding. The Committee notes that other mandatory appropriations provided in fiscal year 2022 for School-Based Mental Health Services Grants are intended to supplement resources provided by the Committee through the Department of Education Appropriations Act, 2022 under a single competition that makes awards to school districts prior to December 31, 2022. The Committee looks forward to a briefing in the coming months on these transformative investments, which will assist school districts in their efforts to increase the number of qualified mental health professionals supporting students. The Committee requests a briefing within 90 days of enactment of this Act on plans for carrying out any new fiscal year 2023 Mental Health Services Professional Demonstration Grants and the School-Based Mental Health Services Grants competitions. In addition, the Department shall provide notice and a briefing to the Committees at least seven days before grantees for any new competitions are announced. Active Shooter Drills.--The Committee is concerned about the possible mental, emotional, and behavioral health effects on students and staff resulting from lockdown drills and active shooter drills conducted in elementary and secondary schools. In response, the Committee provides $1,000,000 for the Department to enter into an agreement with the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (National Academies) under which the National Academies will conduct a study to assess the science on the potential mental, emotional, and behavioral health effects of firearm violence prevention activities on students and staff in elementary and secondary school settings. The study and subsequent report should include an analysis of the effects of active shooter simulations, full- scale lockdowns, secured-perimeter lockouts, and other school security measures (e.g. metal detectors, visibility of police/ policing on campus) and their mental, emotional and behavioral consequences. The assessment should review the potential effects on children and youth of different ages and on students with disabilities. The National Academies report should identify practices and procedures that can minimize any adverse mental, emotional, and behavioral health effects on children, youth, and staff in elementary and secondary schools resulting from the drills and make recommendations where appropriate. School Climate and Safety Pilot.--Within School Safety National Activities, the Committee recommends $5,000,000 to establish a pilot program that would provide competitive grants to States to develop comprehensive school climate and safety plans that include effective, culturally competent, and evidence-based initiatives to strengthen, promote, and enhance school climates, affirm identities, and ensure school safety. Grant applications should be designed and submitted in consultation with a State multidisciplinary team of education and mental health professionals and should maintain the rights and dignity of all students. In addition, the plans must include diversity in placement, hiring, and retention of specialized instructional support personnel, including restorative practice practitioners, counselors, school social workers, school psychologists, and other supportive school staff. Once awarded, States should provide competitive grants to LEAs to implement the plan developed by the State and preference LEAs that utilize alternatives to exclusionary discipline, culturally sustaining education programs, community-based programs, and alternatives to law enforcement involvement. Digital Citizenship Education.--Technology has become an integral part of classroom learning, and students of all ages have access to digital media and devices at school. This dynamic highlights a significant need for students to partake in educational opportunities within the school setting focused on digital citizenship education, such as screen time balance, privacy and security, digital footprint, online relationships and communication, cyberbullying, civic engagement and news and media literacy, among other topics. The Committee continues to recognize the increased need to provide students with the tools and skills necessary to participate safely and responsibly in the digital world. To ensure the digital safety and well-being of K-12 students, the Committee continues to strongly urge the Department to raise awareness of digital citizenship education and identify opportunities to improve and expand digital citizenship education in K-12 schools. Mental Health Services.--The Committee recognizes that even prior to COVID-19, significant need existed among students for mental health services, while schools faced critical shortages of open positions and qualified practitioners, which includes school counselors, school psychologists, and school social workers. As schools reopen and efforts are underway to meet the academic needs of students, capacity to address their mental and emotional well-being is imperative. Adequate access to school-employed mental health professionals improves delivery and integration of school-wide programming to foster positive school climate, prevent violence, and balance physical and psychological safety. Without a highly qualified workforce of school-employed mental health professionals, schools lack the capacity to provide comprehensive social and emotional learning and mental, behavioral, and academic interventions and supports. The Committee's robust investments in initiatives to increase the amount of school-based mental health professionals and related programs that recruit, train, and retain well- trained, high-qualified school-based mental health professionals are a high priority in this bill. The Committee believes this bill's investments will lay the foundation for a future where all students nationwide can benefit from a mental health professional working in their school. School Infrastructure.--The Committee strongly supports the Department's plans to fund a National Clearinghouse on School Infrastructure and Sustainability and to establish an Office of School Infrastructure and Sustainability, as described in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification, and provides sufficient funding under this account, and under Program Administration, for those purposes. Trauma-informed Practices.--The Committee encourages the Department to prioritize trauma-informed practices in grant activities. Secure Firearm Storage.--The Committee is concerned by studies showing that between 73 and 80 percent of school shooters under the age of 18 obtained their firearm(s) from their home or the home of a close relative or friend. In addition, the Committee is aware that researchers estimate roughly 4,600,000 children in the United States live in a home with an unsecured and loaded firearm. Accordingly, the Committee encourages the Department to offer support to Federal agencies that are leading efforts to promote secure household firearm storage. Full-Service Community Schools The Committee recommends $468,000,000 for Full-Service Community Schools, which is $393,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 level. This program makes competitive grants to support school-based comprehensive services for students, families, and communities. Integrated Student Supports The Committee recommends $10,000,000 for a new competitive grant program that would help school districts design and implement integrated student supports focused on addressing a range of student and family needs. Mentorship.--The Committee recognizes the importance of the coordination of mentorship programs with student participants' schools in order to support the goals of whole child learning and social and emotional learning. The Committee encourages the funding of activities that advance student success in the classroom in a manner that is informed by the coordination, insight, and partnership of mentorship programs. ENGLISH LANGUAGE ACQUISITION Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $831,400,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 1,075,000,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 1,000,000,000 Change from enacted level......................... +168,600,000 Change from budget request........................ -75,000,000 This program provides formula grants to States to serve Limited English Proficient (LEP) students. Grants are based on each State's share of the National LEP students and recent immigrant student population. Funds under this account also support professional development to increase the pool of teachers prepared to serve LEP students as well as evaluation activities. The bill continues language to calculate all State awards based on a three-year average of data from the American Community Survey. The Committee recommends $1,000,000,000 for English Language Acquisition (ELA) in fiscal year 2022, which is $168,600,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. Federal data shows that significant achievement gaps exist between English learners (ELs) and their peers. Since fiscal year 2020, the Committee has increased support for EL students by $94,000,000; however, at a time when many States and school districts have experienced rapid growth in their EL populations, the Committee remains concerned that services and supports for EL students are not adequately funded. Providing increased resources to improve educational quality for EL students is a top priority for the Committee in fiscal year 2023. Translation and Interpretation Services.--The Committee continues to recognize that parents of ELs often need translation and interpretation services to stay abreast of school activities, help with homework, and support their children's college and career readiness goals. Many schools lack dedicated funding for translation and interpretation services, despite a growing EL population. In response to these concerns, the Committee encourages the Office of English Language Acquisition (OELA) to support LEAs and SEAs in providing robust translation and interpretation services for parents and guardians of ELs. Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AANHPI) Data Disaggregation.--The Committee is concerned that aggregated AANHPI racial and ethnic subgroup data continues to obscure the experiences of AANHPI students. The Committee encourages OELA to prioritize funding for AANHPI data disaggregation within ELA national activities to support additional racial and ethnic subgroup data collection and reporting. Resources for EL Students.--The Committee recognizes that EL students have been the fastest growing student population in U.S. schools and that many schools and do not receive sufficient funding to meet the needs of these students. To promote EL student success, the Committee encourages the Department to prioritize technical assistance to SEAs and LEAs on how Title I and Title III funding in ESEA can improve academic achievement. In the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification, the Committee requests information on how the Department assists SEAs and LEAs to ensure Title I and Title III funds support complementary activities for maximizing impact on EL student outcomes. SPECIAL EDUCATION Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $14,519,119,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 18,130,170,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 17,760,679,000 Change from enacted level......................... +3,241,560,000 Change from budget request........................ -369,491,000 Of the total amount available, $8,036,736,000 is available for obligation on July1, 2023, and $9,283,383,000 is available for obligation on October 1, 2023. These grants help States and localities pay for a free, appropriate education for students with disabilities aged 3 through 21. Grants to States This program provides formula grants to assist States in meeting the costs of providing special education and related services to children with disabilities. States generally transfer most of the funds to LEAs; however, they can reserve some funds for program monitoring, technical assistance, and other related activities. In order to be eligible for funds, States must make free appropriate public education available to all children with disabilities. The Committee recommends $16,259,193,000 for Part B Grants to States, which is $2,915,489,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. Preschool Grants The Committee recommends $439,620,000 for Preschool Grants, which is $30,071,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. These funds provide additional assistance to States to help them make free, appropriate public education available to children with disabilities ages 3 through 5. Grants for Infants and Families The Committee recommends $621,306,000 for Grants for Infants and Families, which is $125,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. These funds provide additional assistance to States to help them make free, appropriate public education available to children with disabilities from birth through age 2. The Committee continues bill language to promote the continuity of services for eligible infants and their families. In addition, the Committee recommendation includes new bill language to increase access for infants and families who have been traditionally underrepresented in the program, eliminate out-of-pocket costs for participating families, and conduct certain activities with individuals expecting to become parents of infants or toddlers with disabilities. IDEA National Activities The Committee recommends $440,560,000 for IDEA National Activities, which is $171,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. The IDEA National Activities programs support State efforts to improve early intervention and education results for children with disabilities. Educational Technology, Media, and Materials.--The Committee recommends $32,433,000 for Educational Technology, Media, and Materials, which is $2,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. This program makes competitive awards to support the development, demonstration, and use of technology and educational media activities of educational value to children with disabilities. Within these amounts, the Committee provides no less than $11,000,000 for Educational Materials in Accessible Formats for Children and Students with Visual Impairments and Print Disabilities grants. The Department is encouraged to continue to expand this program's reach to K-12 students in underserved areas, further support eligible students enrolled in postsecondary schools, and expand or enhance models for postsecondary schools to produce and disseminate accessible educational materials and textbooks that align with the key recommendations from the Advisory Commission on Accessible Instructional Materials in Postsecondary Education for Students with Disabilities. Parent Information Centers.--The Committee recommends $40,152,000 for Parent Information Centers, which is $10,000,000 above the 2022 enacted level. This program makes awards to parent organizations to support Parent Training and Information Centers, including community parent resource centers. These centers provide training and information to meet the needs of parents of children with disabilities living in the areas served by the centers, particularly underserved parents and parents of children who may be inappropriately identified. Technical assistance is also provided under this program for developing, assisting, and coordinating centers receiving assistance under this program. Personnel Preparation.--The Committee recommends $250,000,000 for Personnel Preparation, which is $155,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. This program supports competitive awards to help address State-identified needs for qualified personnel to work with children with disabilities, and to ensure that those personnel have the necessary skills and knowledge to serve children with special needs. Awards focus on addressing the need for leadership and personnel to serve low-incidence populations. Funds are included to fully support continuation costs for grants made in prior years. The Committee notes the critical role the Personnel Preparation program plays in helping to address the nation's shortage of teachers for students with disabilities. On May 25, 2022, the Subcommittee on Labor-HHS Education- Related Agencies held a hearing entitled ``Tackling Teacher Shortages,'' during which the Subcommittee heard from a panel of national experts on the scope and severity of nationwide teacher shortages. The Subcommittee discussed root causes of teacher shortages and explored acute challenges with the retention and recruitment of educators of color and special educators. In addition, the Subcommittee identified strategies to help rebuild educator pipelines and address shortages and highlight needed investments in programs funded in this bill that support educator pipelines and address challenges related to recruitment and retention. The Committee is strongly supportive of the proposed increase in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification within Personnel Preparation for doctoral-level personnel preparation in special education. The Committee agrees that this investment would expand the teacher preparation pipeline and ensure that more well-prepared special education teachers enter the classroom per year than ever before. State Personnel Development.--The Committee recommends $38,630,000 for State Personnel Development, which is the same as the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. This program supports grants to States to assist with improving personnel preparation and professional development related to early intervention and educational and transition services that improve outcomes for students with disabilities. Funds are included to fully support continuation costs for grants made in prior years. Technical Assistance and Dissemination.--The Committee recommends $44,345,000 for Technical Assistance and Dissemination, which is the same as the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. Funding supports technical assistance, demonstration projects, and information dissemination. These funds support efforts by State and local educational agencies, IHEs, and other entities to build State and local capacity to make systemic changes and improve results for children with disabilities. Special Olympics Education Programs.--The Committee recommends $35,000,000 for Special Olympics Education Programs, which is $4,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level, to support activities authorized by the Special Olympics Sport and Empowerment Act, including Project UNIFY. This funding supports efforts to expand Special Olympics programs and the design and implementation of Special Olympics education programs that can be integrated into classroom instruction and are consistent with academic content standards. Prohibition on Use of Federal Funds for Electric Shock Devices.--The Committee is deeply concerned that Federal funds support services for children at private schools that use electric shock devices and equipment for student discipline and conditioning. The Committee includes new bill language to prohibit Federal funds from supporting institutions that carry out this horrific practice. Parent Supports.--The Committee encourages the Department to support SEAs and LEAs to counsel parents of children with 504 plans, prior to them turning 18, on options for support once the child leaves the K-12 education system, including but not limited to the guardianship process. Students with Speech-Language Disorders.--The Committee encourages the Department to offer technical assistance to support students with speech-language disorders within school settings. The Committee notes the importance of providing guidance and sharing best practices to ensure the delivery of effective services for all children and youth with disabilities and speech-language disorders. REHABILITATION SERVICES Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $3,862,645,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 4,125,906,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 4,104,906,000 Change from enacted level......................... +242,261,000 Change from budget request........................ -21,000,000 The programs in this account are authorized by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Helen Keller National Center Act, and the Randolph-Sheppard Act. Vocational Rehabilitation State Grants The Committee recommends $3,949,707,000 in mandatory funding for Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) State Grants, which is $230,586,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. This program supports vocational rehabilitation services through formula grants to States. These grants support a wide range of services designed to help persons with physical and mental disabilities prepare for and engage in gainful employment to the extent of their capabilities. Emphasis is placed on providing vocational rehabilitation services to persons with the most significant disabilities. The Committee's recommendation provides the cost-of-living adjustment for Vocational Rehabilitation Grants to States, as authorized. Client Assistance State Grants The Committee recommends $13,000,000 for Client Assistance State Grants, which is the same as the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. Client Assistance State Grants support services for eligible individuals and applicants of the VR State Grants program, and other programs, projects, and services funded under the Rehabilitation Act. These formula grants are used to help persons with disabilities overcome problems with the service delivery system and improve their understanding of services available to them under the Rehabilitation Act. Training The Committee recommends $29,388,000 for the Training program, which is the same as the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. The program supports long-term and short-term training, in-service personnel training, and training of interpreters for deaf persons. Projects in a broad array of disciplines are funded to ensure that skilled personnel are available to serve the vocational needs of persons with disabilities. Funds are included to fully support continuation costs for grants made in prior years. Demonstration and Training Programs The Committee recommends $15,796,000 for Demonstration and Training Programs, which is $10,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. These programs support activities designed to increase employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities by expanding and improving the availability and provision of rehabilitation and other services. The Committee recommendation includes no less than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level for parent information and training programs. National Consortium of Interpreter Education Centers (NCIEC) and Regional Interpreter Education Centers (RIEC).--The Committee commends the work by the Rehabilitation Services Administration to create resources for deaf, hard of hearing, and deaf-blind individuals and commends their support of special needs and sensory disabled persons. In addition, the Committee recognizes the positive impact the NCIEC and RIEC have had on the deaf, hard of hearing, and deaf-blind community through a variety of educational resources, interpreter development programs, and specialized services. Protection and Advocacy of Individual Rights The Committee recommends $21,150,000 for Protection and Advocacy of Individual Rights, which is $2,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. Grants are awarded to entities that have the authority to pursue legal, administrative, and other appropriate remedies to protect and advocate for the rights of persons with disabilities. Supported Employment State Grants The Committee recommends $22,548,000 for Supported Employment State Grants, which is the same as the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. These formula grants assist States in developing collaborative programs with public agencies and nonprofit agencies for training and post-employment services leading to supported employment. In supported employment programs, persons with the most significant disabilities are given special supervision and assistance to enable them to work in integrated settings. Independent Living Services for Older Individuals Who Are Blind The Committee recommends $33,317,000 for Independent Living Services for Older Individuals Who Are Blind, which is the same as the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. Funds are distributed to States according to a formula based on the population of individuals who are 55 or older and provide support for services to persons 55 years old or over whose severe visual impairment makes gainful employment extremely difficult to obtain, but for whom independent living goals are feasible. Helen Keller National Center The Committee recommends $20,000,000 for the Helen Keller National Center for Deaf-Blind Youth and Adults, which is $2,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. These funds are used for the operation of a national center that provides intensive services for deaf-blind individuals and their families at Sands Point, New York, and a network of ten regional offices that provide referral, counseling, transition services, and technical assistance to service providers. SPECIAL INSTITUTIONS FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $275,292,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 265,292,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 291,292,000 Change from enacted level......................... +16,000,000 Change from budget request........................ +26,000,000 The Committee recommends $291,292,000 for Special Institutions for Persons with Disabilities, which is $16,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. AMERICAN PRINTING HOUSE FOR THE BLIND Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $40,431,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 37,431,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 43,431,000 Change from enacted level......................... +3,000,000 Change from budget request........................ +6,000,000 This funding subsidizes the production of educational materials for legally blind persons enrolled in pre-college programs. The American Printing House for the Blind (Printing House), which is chartered by the Commonwealth of Kentucky, manufactures and maintains an inventory of educational materials in accessible formats that are distributed free of charge to schools and States based on the number of blind students in each State. The Printing House also conducts research and field activities to inform educators about the availability of materials and how to use them. Innovative Braille and Tactile Display Products.--Within amounts for the Printing House, the Committee provides $1,500,000 to support field testing of an innovative braille and tactile display product developed by the Printing House and its partners. NATIONAL TECHNICAL INSTITUTE FOR THE DEAF Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $88,500,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 84,500,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 91,500,000 Change from enacted level......................... +3,000,000 Change from budget request........................ +7,000,000 Congress established the National Technical Institute for the Deaf (Institute) in 1965 to provide a residential facility for postsecondary technical training and education for deaf persons with the purpose of promoting the employment of these individuals. The Institute also conducts applied research and provides training related to various aspects of deafness. The Secretary of Education administers these activities through a contract with the Rochester Institute of Technology in Rochester, New York. GALLAUDET UNIVERSITY Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $146,361,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 143,361,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 156,361,000 Change from enacted level......................... +10,000,000 Change from budget request........................ +13,000,000 Gallaudet is a private, non-profit educational institution Federally chartered in 1864 providing elementary, secondary, undergraduate, and continuing education for deaf persons. In addition, the University offers graduate programs in fields related to deafness for deaf and hearing students, conducts research on deafness, and provides public service programs for deaf persons. CAREER, TECHNICAL, AND ADULT EDUCATION Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $2,091,436,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 2,308,981,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 2,214,981,000 Change from enacted level......................... +123,545,000 Change from budget request........................ -94,000,000 This account includes vocational education programs authorized by the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006, as recently reauthorized by the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act, and the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA). Career and Technical Education: State Grants The Committee recommends $1,424,848,000 for Career and Technical Education (CTE) State Grants, which is $45,000,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. Of these funds, $633,848,000 will become available on July 1, 2023, and $791,000,000 will become available for obligation on October 1, 2023. State Grants support a variety of career and technical education programs developed in accordance with the State plan. This program focuses Federal resources on institutions with high concentrations of low-income students. The populations assisted by State Grants range from secondary students in prevocational courses to adults who need retraining to adapt to changing technological and labor markets. Funding for State Grants will continue support for state-of-the art career and technical training to students in secondary schools and community and technical colleges. CTE Teacher Shortages.--The Committee is concerned about the growing shortage of qualified public school teachers at all levels of education and the lack of Federal data on CTE teacher shortages. Specifically, the Department's Teacher Shortage Area database does not account for schools which have ceased to offer a CTE course due to a staffing shortage. Further, the Department does not currently collect data on the characteristics of the CTE teacher workforce including demographic information, salary, years of industry experience, and highest level of educational attainment. In the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification, the Committee requests for the Department to identify Federal data that can help Congress and stakeholders better understand CTE teacher shortages. If such data are unavailable, the Committee requests the Department suggest methods for obtaining necessary data prospectively. National Programs The Committee recommends $57,421,000 for National Programs, which is $50,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. Career-Connected High Schools.--Within amounts for CTE National Programs, the Committee includes $50,000,000 and new bill language supporting the Department's proposal for Career- Connected High Schools. The Committee encourages the Department to prioritize applications that establish plans with State agencies to improve policy and program alignment between K-12, higher education, and workforce systems, including through statewide credit transfer agreements and alignment of high school graduation requirements with college entrance requirements. In addition, the Committee encourages the Department to establish a competitive preference priority for LEAs serving students historically underrepresented in higher education and to require applicants to set goals for Career- Connected High School enrollment to be representative of the LEAs' overall population. Finally, the Committee encourages the Department to require Career-Connected High School applicants to offer articulated course pathways that terminate in at least a two-year credential and to require Career-Connected High School applicants to offer at least 12 credits of dual enrollment, including both academic and CTE coursework. Cybersecurity Skills.--The Committee recognizes the cybersecurity threats facing our nation's critical infrastructure sectors and the need for workers in these industries, including those who operate cyber physical systems, to be equipped with skills to keep systems secure. The Committee acknowledges that many of these operators are educated through CTE programs that do not incorporate cybersecurity skills. Therefore, the Committee encourages the Secretary to support CTE programs that integrate cybersecurity into curricula used by students preparing for careers in critical infrastructure sectors. Youth Entrepreneurship and Financial Literacy.--The Committee recognizes the importance of preparing our students for the 21st century workforce through CTE programs, including entrepreneurship and financial literacy. The Committee is supportive of efforts to provide technical assistance and make resources available to help LEAs and IHEs prepare students for successful employment and attain high-skilled jobs through the implementation of entrepreneurship and financial literacy programs during and after school. Adult Basic and Literacy Education State Grants The Committee recommends $714,000,000 for Adult Basic and Literacy Education State Grants, which is $23,545,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. State formula grants, authorized under the AEFLA, support programs to enable adults to acquire basic literacy skills, to enable those who so desire to complete secondary education, and to make available to adults the means to become more employable, productive, and responsible citizens. Adult Education National Leadership Activities The Committee recommends $18,712,000 for National Leadership Activities, which is $5,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. This program supports applied research, development, dissemination, evaluation, and program improvement efforts to strengthen the quality of adult education services. Improved Coordination between Career and Technical Education and Adult Education.--To ensure that individuals can succeed in today's economy, the Committee encourages the Department to identify and pursue opportunities to better align the postsecondary CTE system with the adult education system. Adult education can be an effective on-ramp to postsecondary CTE and a valuable partner in designing and implementing integrated education and training (IET) models that blend basic skills instruction and occupational training to expand equitable access to skills training, high-quality credentials and family-supporting careers. STUDENT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $24,580,352,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 26,345,352,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 24,639,234,000 Change from enacted level......................... +58,882,000 Change from budget request........................ -1,706,118,000 Pell Grants The Committee recommends $22,475,352,000 in discretionary funding for the Pell Grant program, which is the same as the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. These funds will support Pell grants to students for the 2023-2024 academic year. Combined with mandatory funding streams, the Committee recommendation supports a maximum Pell Grant in academic year 2023-2024 of $7,395, a $500 increase over fiscal year 2022. Pell Grants help to ensure access to educational and economic opportunities for low- and middle-income students by providing need-based financial assistance. Grants are determined according to a statutory formula, which considers income, assets, household size, and the number of family members in college, among other factors. Pell Grants are the foundation of Federal postsecondary student aid programs. The Committee recognizes that Pell Grants help to ensure access to education and economic opportunities for low-and-middle-income students by providing need-based financial assistance. The recommendation includes new language extending eligibility for DACA-eligible students for all Title IV Student Assistance programs in the Higher Education Act (HEA), including Pell Grants. Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants The Committee recommends $920,000,000 for the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (SEOG) program, which is $25,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. SEOG provides funds to postsecondary institutions for need- based grants of up to $4,000 to undergraduate students, with priority given to students who are Pell-eligible. Approximately 67 percent of dependent recipients have annual family incomes under $30,000 and 70 percent of independent SEOG recipients have annual family incomes under $20,000. Institutions must contribute a 25 percent match toward their SEOG allocation. The recommendation includes new language extending eligibility for DACA-eligible students for all Title IV Student Assistance programs in the Higher Education Act (HEA), including SEOG. Federal Work-Study The Committee recommends $1,243,882,000 for the Federal Work-Study program, which is $33,882,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. Federal Work-Study funds are provided through institutions to students who work part-time. The funds assist with paying for the cost of education. Approximately 3,200 colleges and universities receive funding, according to a statutory formula, and may allocate it for job location and development centers. Work-study jobs must pay at least the Federal minimum wage and institutions must provide 25percent of student earnings. The Committee recommendation continues funding for the Work Colleges program, which supports institutions that require all resident students to participate in a work-learning program. The recommendation includes new language extending eligibility for DACA-eligible students for all Title IV Student Assistance programs in the Higher Education Act (HEA), including Work Study. Social Work Students.--The Committee notes that social work students at the undergraduate and graduate levels are required to complete hundreds of hours of field experience; however, the Committee is concerned that many times these experiences are unpaid. In the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification, the Committee directs the Department to share information around the feasibility of using its Experimental Sites authority for a pilot to use Federal Work Study and other financial aid funding to support social work students involved in internships and field experiences. For-profit College Accountability.--The 85/15 Rule was first implemented in 1992 as a bipartisan amendment to the Higher Education Act (HEA). It is based on the rationale that if an institution provides a quality education, individuals without access to Federal funding sources should be willing to pay for it. The rule prevented for-profit postsecondary institutions from deriving more than 85 percent of revenues from Title IV of the HEA. It was based on a longstanding principle first enacted in 1952 to protect veterans from for- profit college abuses dating back to the original GI Bill (the Servicemen's Readjustment Act) in 1944, and was in response to widespread reports that many for-profit colleges were using aggressive, sometimes fraudulent recruiting tactics in order to profit off of students with access to Federal student aid funding. In 1992, the rule was amended to allow for-profits to derive an extra five percent of their revenue from Title IV and became known as the 90/10 Rule. Since that time, thousands of students have been defrauded by schools that have since gone out of business. Students who graduate from these schools can obtain degrees that often offer little value. A 2016 National Bureau of Economic Research study using data from the Department and the Internal Revenue Service found that the earnings of students who attend for-profit colleges or universities are lower than if they had never enrolled at all. And while the for-profit college sector enrolls only nine percent of all students, 33 percent of all borrower who defaulted on student loans attend for-profit colleges. Given these deeply disappointing outcomes, the Committee believes that reverting back to the 85/15 ratio is a critical step in holding for-profit colleges accountable and protecting students from predatory practices and taxpayer dollars from being wasted. Therefore, the Committee includes new bill language requiring that for-profit institutions of higher education receive not more than 85 percent of their revenue from Federal sources. Federal Direct Student Loan Program Account Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $25,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2022...................... - - - Committee Recommendation.............................. - - - Change from enacted level......................... -25,000,000 Change from budget request........................ - - - Since fiscal year 2018, the Committee has provided $825,000,0000 for the Federal Direct Student Loan Program Account program (also known as Temporary Extended Public Service Loan Forgiveness or TEPSLF). Congress created the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program in 2007 to provide loan relief to borrowers pursuing careers in public service. After making 120 qualifying payments, the equivalent of 10 years, borrowers first became eligible for forgiveness under the program in 2017. TEPSLF was established to address the administrative challenges associated with the PSLF program. This account provides funding for loan forgiveness for borrowers who were led to believe they qualified for PSLF by their loan servicers but were denied forgiveness. However, many of the constraints and program features of TEPSLF have made the program similarly difficult to access. As of May 2022, the Department estimates that unused, previously appropriated TEPSLF resources provided in this account could forgive approximately $821,000,000 in loan volume for affected borrowers. The Committee is strongly supportive of the Department's Limited PSLF Waiver, established in October 2021, which has offered a more streamlined pathway to loan forgiveness for borrowers who dedicated a decade of their lives to public service. To date, the waiver has provided over $7,300,000,000 in relief to over 127,000 student borrowers. To build on the success of the Department's administrative action, the Committee includes new bill language applying the streamlined terms and features of the Department's PSLF waiver to unused TEPSLF resources. The Committee hopes an enhanced TEPSLF, with similar terms to the Department's PSLF waiver, will allow for a seamless transition for affected borrowers after the PSLF waiver expires. The Committee requested an update in the fiscal year 2023 Congressional Budget Justification identifying areas where the Department can further improve the administration of the PSLF and TEPSLF programs and directs the Department to provide a clear, comprehensive update on this topic in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification. Student Aid Administration Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $2,033,943,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 2,654,034,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 2,579,034,000 Change from enacted level......................... +545,091,000 Change from budget request........................ -75,000,000 Programs administered under the Student Aid Administration (SAA) include Pell Grants, campus-based programs, Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) grants, and Federal student loan programs. Salaries and Expenses.--Within the total provided for SAA, the Committee recommends $1,187,788,000 for salaries and expenses, which is $128,845,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. Loan Servicing Activities.--Within the total provided for SAA, the Committee recommends $1,391,246,000 for Loan Servicing Activities, which is $416,246,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. Quarterly Briefings.--The Department is directed to provide quarterly briefings to the Committee on general progress related to solicitations for Federal student loan servicing contracts. Spend Plans.--Not later than 60 days after enactment, the Committee directs the Department to provide a detailed spend plan of anticipated uses of funds made available in this account for fiscal year 2023 and provide quarterly updates on this plan (including contracts awarded, change orders, bonuses paid to staff, reorganization costs, and any other activity carried out using amounts provided under this heading for fiscal year 2023). State and Nonprofit Subcontracting.--The Committee encourages the Department to evaluate opportunities for qualified State and nonprofit organizations to contribute in the new servicing environment. Transparency in College Costs.--The Committee looks forward to the briefing it requested in House Report 117-96 on the Department's efforts to work with institutions of higher education to improve college cost transparency. Online Program Management (OPM) Companies.--The Committee is deeply concerned by the proliferation of for-profit OPMs in higher education. Specifically, the Committee is troubled by how tuition-sharing agreements between universities and for- profit OPM companies can create perverse incentives that drive up costs, waste taxpayer dollars, and rip off students. In addition, the Committee is concerned by the role OPMs play in saddling graduate students with unsustainable student debt by taking advantage of the Grad Plus program, which lets students borrow as much as colleges charge. Though the practice has proven to be a valuable revenue stream for OPMs and universities, the Committee is not persuaded that these relationships are in the best interests of students. A November 2021 Wall Street Journal investigation revealed how for-profit OPM 2U and the University of Southern California (USC) recruited thousands of students to an expensive online graduate program which left student borrowers with median debt of $112,000 and median earnings of $52,000 two years later. 2U, which received 60 percent of the program's total revenue, helped USC use demographic profiles to target low-income and minority students to maximize profits. The Committee believes this behavior is straight from the playbook of the predatory for-profit colleges. Further, the Committee believes a status quo that allows for the continuation and proliferation of wasteful, abusive relationships between OPMs and universities is untenable. The Committee is disappointed by the inappropriately loose regulatory environment and sparse enforcement that has allowed OPMs to gain their foothold across the higher education landscape. The Committee is aware of GAO's recent report (GAO-22- 104463) and agrees with recommendations for the Department to improve its audit and review process regarding OPM arrangements, including via revisions to the Compliance Supplement; however, given the severity of OPM-driven waste and abuse, the Committee supports stronger, more urgent measures. Specifically, the Committee supports the complete rescission of March 2011 sub-regulatory guidance that established a loophole to the statutory incentive compensation ban. Under the HEA, individuals and entities cannot provide commissions, bonuses, or incentive payments based on securing enrollments or the awarding of Federal student aid. However, the misguided 2011 guidance establishes a loophole if recruiting is part of a ``bundle of services'' provided by an ``unaffiliated third party'' contractor, such as an OPM. The Committee strongly urges the Department to immediately rescind the 2011 bundled services guidance and to establish a process to wind down institutions' inappropriate reliance on wasteful, abusive OPM tactics. In the interim, the Committee strongly urges the Department to immediately enforce commonsense aspects of the otherwise flawed guidance. Specifically, the Committee urges the Department to ensure any contractors are independent entities, unaffiliated with the institution, and uninvolved in decision making. The Committee believes several common practices by OPMs clearly overstep the existing guidance, including, the establishment of steering committees or other governing bodies that give the OPM an official and regular role in decision making; higher shares of revenue paid to the OPM as enrollment increases; and OPM control over marketing and recruiting, in the name of school. The Committee urges the Department to employ meaningful consequences and penalties to deter predatory behavior. Finally, the Committee urges the Department to develop adequate guidance to institutions that indicates when marketing could be considered a covered activity under the ban on incentive compensation payments. In addition, the Committee urges the Department to revise audit and program review guides to meet oversight goals of the incentive compensation ban. Moving forward, the Committee is committed to vigorous oversight of relationships between universities and for-profit OPMs and urges the Department to crack down on OPM waste and abuse to protect students and the overall integrity of taxpayer-funded Federal student aid programs. Graduate Student Debt.--According to the fiscal year 2023 budget request, excluding consolidations, graduate student loans are expected to make up over 47 percent of new Federal student loan originations in fiscal year 2023. This proportion is significantly up from the 34 percent of new loan originations graduate student debt represented in fiscal year 2014. While OPMs play a concerning role in this trend, the Committee is also concerned about the broader landscape of graduate student debt. In response, the Committee urges the Department to analyze the disproportionate share of new student loan originations represented by graduate student programs and to determine whether graduate student programs leave students with reasonable debt levels. In addition, the Committee strongly urges the Department to take actions to ensure that graduate program outcomes are commensurate with the debt levels of their students. Borrower Defense Recoupment and OPMs.--The Committee is strongly supportive of the Department's most recent proposal for an automatic, formalized process for recouping funds from institutions that commit wrongdoings against student borrowers. Under the proposal, schools that commit wrongdoings are fully liable for any amounts discharged through the Borrower Defense process except under certain reasonable circumstances. The Committee notes that institutions in partnerships with predatory for-profit OPMs will incur liabilities for discharges resulting from predatory behavior. To build on these strong protections, the Committee urges the Department to clarify that OPMs function as third party servicers. Further, the Committee urges the Department to develop methods for determining when Borrower Defense liabilities should be shared jointly between the institution and OPM. Under such circumstances, the Committee urges the Department to recoup funds from both entities. The Committee notes that investors and shareholders have contributed to the growth of the OPM industry under an expectation of loose regulation or non-existent oversight. Accordingly, the Committee's recommendations regarding OPMs are intended to indicate that such assumptions are outdated, and that unscrupulous behavior will yield straightforward, substantial financial consequences. Appropriate Conditions for High-risk Schools.--The Committee recognizes that use of Federal student aid by institutions of higher education is contingent on their eligibility to be certified to do so under the Title IV of the HEA. To ensure that institutions are responsible stewards of Federal student aid, the Committee encourages the Department to place appropriate conditions on high-risk schools and to clarify procedures for when a high-risk institution may be eligible for a provisional program participation agreement. Spousal Consolidation Loans.--The Committee is aware that hundreds of borrowers remain in the spousal consolidation loan program which stopped originating new loans in 2006. The Committee is concerned that these loans cannot be separated and leave both borrowers liable for the entire debt, even after a divorce. The Committee believes it is deeply unwise for a Federal program to link the financial fates of two borrowers when their personal relationships may have deteriorated or perhaps become abusive. In response, the Committee urges the Department to assist struggling spousal consolidation loan borrowers and directs the Department to describe such efforts in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification. Postsecondary Research and Analysis.--The Committee is supportive of the Office of the Chief Economist's mission to conduct rigorous research in postsecondary education and notes that the Department maintains robust data sets that provide vital information on student outcomes, including those for student borrowers. The Committee supports the Department's continuous efforts to provide user-friendly, accessible postsecondary data through enhanced fields on the College Scorecard; however, the Committee believes the Department has fallen short in its efforts to interpret these data for policymakers and stakeholders. Accordingly, the Committee encourages the Office of the Chief Economist to produce regular working papers that present meaningful original research on the Department's postsecondary data, including outcomes for student borrowers. Specifically, the Committee is interested in analysis around the rapid growth of graduate student borrowing and whether this expansion in borrowing is beneficial to student borrowers and the overall economy.

In addition, it expands academic offerings and enhances program quality at IHEs educating the majority of Hispanic college students. Strengthening Historically Black Colleges and Universities The Committee recommends $402,619,000 for Strengthening Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), which is $39,796,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. This program provides operating subsidies to accredited HBCUs that were established prior to 1964, with the principal mission of educating Black Americans. Funds are distributed through a formula grant based on the enrollment of Pell Grant recipients, number of graduates, and the number of graduates entering graduate or professional schools in which Black students are underrepresented. Maximum Higher Education Emergency Relief Funding (HEERF) Flexibility.--The Committee urges the Department to use the broadest possible interpretation of allowable uses of funds when evaluating applications for grants awarded under the HEERF program as allocated in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (HEERF I), Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act (HEERF II) and American Rescue Plan Act (HEERF III). These flexibilities are critical as institutions of higher education, such as HBCUs and MSIs, navigate ongoing and emerging challenges. HEERF fund flexibilities for HBCUs and MSIs could be used by these institutions to make critical investments in campus infrastructure, deferred maintenance projects, technological updates, and more robust building construction. Strengthening Historically Black Graduate Institutions The Committee recommends $102,313,000 for the Strengthening Historically Black Graduate Institutions (HBGIs) program, which is $9,184,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. The program provides five-year grants to postsecondary institutions that are specified in section 326(e)(1) of the HEA. Institutions may use funds to build endowments, provide scholarships and fellowships, and to assist students with the enrollment and completion of postbaccalaureate and professional degrees. Strengthening Predominantly Black Institutions The Committee recommends $23,218,000 for the Strengthening Predominantly Black Institutions (PBIs) program, which is $5,100,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2022 budget request. This program provides grants to PBIs to increase their capacity to serve the academic needs of students. The bill continues bill language allowing certain PBIs to be eligible for additional grants. Strengthening Asian American and Native American Pacific-Islander- Serving Institutions The Committee recommends $20,120,000 for the Strengthening Asian American and Native American Pacific-Islander-Serving Institutions (AANAPISIs) program, which is $9,184,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. This program provides grants to undergraduate institutions that have an undergraduate student enrollment of at least 10 percent Asian American or Native American Pacific Islander. Strengthening Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian-Serving Institutions The Committee recommends $25,044,000 for the Strengthening Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian-Serving Institutions program, which is $3,673,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. Through the Strengthening Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian-Serving Institutions program, the Department provides grants to assist institutions of higher education in serving Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian students. Strengthening Native American Serving Non-Tribal Institutions The Committee recommends $12,120,000 for the Native American Serving Non-Tribal Institutions program, which is $4,286,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. This program makes grants to IHEs at which enrollment is at least 10 percent Native American students and that are not Tribally Controlled Colleges or Universities. Strengthening Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities The Committee recommends $53,080,000 for the Strengthening Tribally Controlled Colleges and Universities (TCCUs) program, which is $9,184,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. This program makes grants to TCCUs to increase their capacity to serve the academic needs of students. Strengthening HBCU Masters Program The Committee recommends $20,956,000 for the Strengthening HBCU Masters Programs, which is $6,122,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. This program provides grants to specified colleges and universities making a substantial contribution to graduate education opportunities at the Master's level in mathematics, engineering, the physical or natural sciences, computer science, information technology, nursing, allied health, or other scientific disciplines. International Education and Foreign Language Studies Domestic Programs.--The Committee recommends $76,853,000 for the Domestic Programs of the International Education and Foreign Languages Studies program, which is $5,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. Authorized by Title VI of the HEA, these programs include National resource centers, foreign language and area studies fellowships, undergraduate international studies and foreign language programs, international research and studies projects, business and international education projects, international business education centers, language resource centers, American overseas research centers, and technological innovation and cooperation for foreign information access. Overseas Programs.--The Committee recommends $11,811,000 for the Overseas Programs, which is $2,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. Funding for these programs support group projects, faculty research, special bilateral research, and doctoral dissertation research conducted abroad. Model Comprehensive Transition and Postsecondary Programs for Students With Intellectual Disabilities The Committee recommends $15,180,000 for the Model Comprehensive Transition and Postsecondary Programs for Students with Intellectual Disabilities (TPSID) program, which is $1,380,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. TPSID supports grants to create model transition programs into postsecondary education for students with intellectual disabilities. Minority Science and Engineering Improvement The Committee recommends $18,370,000 for the Minority Science and Engineering Improvement Program, which is $3,831,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. This program awards grants to improve mathematics, science, and engineering programs at institutions serving primarily minority students and to increase the number of minority students who pursue advanced degrees and careers in those fields. Tribally Controlled Postsecondary Career and Technical Institutions The Committee recommends $10,953,000 for this program, which is the same as the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. The Tribally Controlled Postsecondary Career and Technical Institutions program awards competitive grants to Tribally controlled postsecondary career and technical institutions to provide career and technical education to Native American students. Federal TRIO Programs The Committee recommends $1,297,761,000 for TRIO programs, which is $160,761,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. The TRIO programs provide a variety of outreach and support services to encourage low-income, first-generation college students and individuals with disabilities to enter and complete college. Discretionary grants of up to four or five years are awarded competitively to IHEs and other nonprofit organizations. At least two thirds of the eligible participants in TRIO must be low-income, first-generation college students. The recommendation includes new language extending eligibility for DACA-eligible students for all Title IV Student Assistance programs in the HEA, including TRIO. The Committee directs the Department to allocate increases to each TRIO program. In addition, the Committee directs the Department to fund down the slate of unfunded high-quality applications from the Student Support Services competition held in fiscal year 2020; the Talent Search and Educational Opportunity Centers competitions in fiscal year 2021; and the Upward Bound, Upward Bound Math-Science, Veterans Upward Bound, and McNair Postbaccalaureate Achievement competitions in fiscal year 2022. Further, the Committee directs that such grantees are eligible for prior experience points for demonstrated performance outcomes in subsequent competitions. Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs The Committee recommends $408,000,000 for Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP), which is $30,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. GEAR UP provides grants to States and partnerships of low-income middle and high schools, IHEs, and community organizations to target entire grades of students and give them the skills, encouragement, and scholarships to pursue successfully postsecondary education. The Committee continues bill language allowing the Department to maintain the GEAR UP evaluation set-aside at 1.5 percent to work with the GEAR UP community and grantees to standardize data collection, including through the use of third-party data systems. The recommendation includes new language extending eligibility for DACA-eligible students for all Title IV Student Assistance programs in the HEA, including GEAR UP. Furthermore, the Committee directs the Department to announce Notices Inviting Applications for New Awards for State Grants and Partnership Grants in the Federal Register. In making new awards, the Committee directs the Department to ensure that not less than 33 percent of the new award dollars are allocated to State awards, and that not less than 33 percent of the new award dollars are allocated to Partnerships awards, as described in section 404B of the HEA. In such notice for State grants, the Committee directs the Department to uphold the long-standing guidance that States may only administer one active State GEAR UP grant at a time. The Secretary is directed to provide written guidance in the Federal Register notifying applicants that only States without an active State GEAR UP grant, or States that have an active State GEAR UP grant that is scheduled to end prior to October 1, 2023, will be eligible to receive a new State GEAR UP award funded in whole or in part by this appropriation. The Secretary is further directed to ensure that no request from a State Grant applicant to receive an exception to the GEAR UP scholarship (as described in section 404E(b)(2) of the HEA) shall be denied on the basis of 34 CFR 694.14(c)(3). Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need The Committee recommends $24,047,000 for the Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need (GAANN) program, which is $500,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. GAANN provides fellowships through grants to degree granting postsecondary institutions, for students of high financial need studying in areas of national need. The Department consults with appropriate agencies and organizations to designate the fields of study ``in areas of national need.'' GAANN offers innovative graduate education programs, with associated fellowship opportunities, at the intersection of humanities, arts, STEM, and health associated fields in order to prepare our national graduate students for increasingly interdisciplinary global challenges. Recent examples include engineering, nursing, and physics. Teacher Quality Partnership Grants The Committee recommends $132,092,000 for the Teacher Quality Partnerships (TQP) program, which is $73,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. The TQP program helps improve the quality of teachers working in high-need schools and early childhood education programs by creating model teacher preparation and residency programs. State Teaching Fellowship Programs.--The Committee recognizes the importance of State teaching fellowship programs and encourages the Department to continue to work with eligible State teaching fellowship programs that wish to apply for the TQP program. Teacher Preparation to Support EL Students.--The Committee recognizes the needs of the nation's growing EL student population, including a robust teacher workforce equipped with the skills to teach them. The Committee is concerned by the shortage of EL teachers in the majority of States, as well the academic achievement gap between ELs and their native English- speaking peers. Therefore, the Committee encourages the Secretary to support the development and strengthening of high- quality teacher preparation programs that enable graduates to meet licensure or certification requirements to teach ELs. Teacher Residency Programs.--The Committee notes that high- quality teacher residency programs prepare diverse cohorts of teachers to serve high-need schools, improve teacher efficacy in the classroom, and are a high-retention teacher preparation pathway. In fact, 49 percent of residents are teachers of color, while only 20 percent of all teachers nationally are teachers of color. Further, a review of teacher residency programs shows that residents tend to have higher retention rates over time than nonresident teachers. As such, the Committee encourages the Department to prioritize grants under TQP for applicants that apply to fund high-quality teacher residency programs as authorized under Section 202(e) of the HEA. The Department is further encouraged to include a priority for teacher residency program applicants that include explicit admissions goals and priorities, as permitted under Section 202(e)(2)(A)(vi)(II), for the consideration of teacher residency applicants from underrepresented populations in the teaching profession. Child Care Access Means Parents in School The Committee recommends $95,000,000 for the Child Care Access Means Parents in School program, which is $30,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. This program makes competitive grants to colleges and universities to support or establish a campus-based childcare program primarily serving the needs of low-income students enrolled at the institution. The Committee continues bill language that lifts the statutory cap on grant awards to institutions of higher education, to more accurately reflect the costs of providing high-quality, convenient child care options for students. Consistent with this bill language, the Committee urges the Department to establish a maximum grant cap based on a reasonable estimation of the costs of providing child care rather than a fixed percentage of Pell Grant funding received by an institution. Additionally, the Committee urges the Department to prioritize applications from programs that connect parenting students with public benefits, case management, or sources of additional financial support, and to provide an application period of no less than 60 days. Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education The Committee recommendation includes $520,000,000 for the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education, which is $452,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ FY 2023 Budget Activity Committee ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Basic Needs Grants................................... $15,000,000 Centers of Excellence for Veteran Student Success 15,000,000 Program.............................................

The Committee includes $15,000,000 for competitive grants to institutions of higher education, as defined by section 101 of the HEA, or consortia or systems of such institutions, to advance systemic solutions to student basic needs insecurity. Such grants shall include one or more of the following activities: establishing processes to automatically identify and conduct outreach students who may be eligible for public benefit programs in accordance with recent Federal guidance; conducting surveys and assessments of student basic needs security, including surveys of student needs conducted upon enrollment; or providing referrals and case management to students to enroll in local, State, and Federal public benefit programs. Activities may also include coordinating and collaborating with government and community- based organizations and providing direct services such as temporary housing, secure sleeping arrangements, free or subsidized food, access to on-campus childcare. At least 25 percent of grants must go to community colleges and at least 25 percent must go to four-year HBCUs, HSIs, and other MSIs. Grant priority will go to institutions serving a significant number of students with low incomes using multiple indicators of student financial need. Centers of Excellence for Veteran Student Success Program.--The Committee includes $15,000,000 to support existing and new grantees for the Centers of Excellence for Veterans Student Success Program, as authorized by section 873 of the HEA. Over one million veterans attend college every year and often need assistance receiving their benefits or transitioning to student life. Veteran Student Centers provide a one-stop- shop for academic support, networking opportunities, peer mentorship, financial assistance, counseling, and career services. The Department should ensure that this program continues to support comprehensive services including veteran benefits assistance, tutoring, counseling, and housing. The Committee directs the Department to brief the Committees on Appropriations no later than 90 days after enactment of this Act on its plan to continue to carry out this program, as well as a plan for evaluation and accountability, and to notify the Committees no later than 15 days in advance of making any new grant award or changes to the programs. Distributed Digital Learning Infrastructure Pilot.--The Committee includes $10,000,000 to establish pilot programs for an institution of higher education with established remote learning infrastructure to work with MSIs in the grantee's region to provide support and technical assistance to expand MSI digital learning infrastructure. Emergency Aid Grants.--The Committee is aware of the large number of postsecondary students dropping out of school or failing to graduate due to not having the financial resources to cover emergency situations such as paying for a car repair, paying a late utility bill, or covering unforeseen or increased living costs. The COVID-19 pandemic raised the awareness of the public of these often small, but insurmountable financial challenges delaying or halting a student's education. The Committee includes $5,000,000 in competitive grants to institutions of higher education to provide direct financial support to their students to cover these emergency costs. To apply, institutions are required to submit a plan to the Secretary that defines how the institution would establish criteria to determine a student's eligibility for a direct emergency financial aid grant that would enable a student to enroll, stay enrolled or complete their program of study. Institutions that receive such grants must provide direct payments to such students and conduct outreach and awareness activities as to the existence of this program at the institution. Increasing MSI PhDs Pilot.--The Committee includes $5,000,000 to create the Increasing MSI PhDs Pilot program. This funding should support awards to a consortium of MSIs, including HSIs, that award PhDs to underrepresented student populations. Funding should be used to develop and test new models of cross-institutional intellectual, research, and resource-sharing communities, create mentorship programs for PhD students, support graduate research experiences, and other uses associated with the pursuit of PhDs by underrepresented postsecondary students. Matched Savings Grants.--The Committee includes $10,000,000 for to establish matched savings programs for Pell-eligible postsecondary students. Grants will be awarded as partnerships between States and non-profits to establish and expand matched savings programs for eligible students that provide postsecondary cost assistance and financial literacy training. The grantees will establish savings accounts for each participating student, support financial literacy education, and support matching funds for amounts deposited by students and their families. A December 2020 report on matched savings programs by the Urban Institute found that safe, affordable matched savings account programs that offer strong match rates and provide financial education can help low-income families save and increase their financial well-being. The Committee is encouraged by the evidence base behind this innovative approach to improving the affordability of postsecondary education. Menstrual Products Programs.--Congress recognizes that the lack of access to menstrual products impedes the academic success of many college and graduate students as well as impacts their physical and mental well-being. Congress includes $5,000,000 for competitive grants to at least ten institutions of higher education, as defined by section 101 of the HEA, to support institutional programs that provide free menstrual products to students, as well as report on best practices. In order to qualify, grantees must agree to use funds to carry out or expand activities that fund programs that support direct provision of menstrual products in appropriate campus locations including, but not limited to, campus restroom facilities, wellness centers, on campus residential buildings; conduct outreach to students to encourage participation in menstrual equity programs and services; help eligible students apply for and enroll in local, State, and Federal public assistance programs; or coordinate and collaborate with government and/or community-based organizations. At least 50 percent of grants must go to community colleges. Grant priority will go to institutions with 25 percent or higher Pell enrollment, HBCUs, HSIs, AANAPISIs, and other MSIs. Modeling and Simulation Programs.--The Committee includes $10,000,000 for Modeling and Simulation Programs as authorized under section 891 of the HEA. Modeling and simulation technology has numerous applications for Federal and State governments and their partners in the defense, education, gaming, shipbuilding, and workforce training sectors, allowing them to generate data to help make decisions or predictions about their systems. Open Textbook Pilot.--The Committee includes $10,000,000 to continue the Open Textbook Pilot and fund a new grant competition in fiscal year 2023. The Department shall issue a notice inviting applications consistent with notice and comment procedures and allow for a 60-day application period. This funding should support a significant number of grant awards to IHEs as defined by 20 U.S.C. 1001, a group of IHEs, or State higher education agencies that lead the activities of (and serve as fiscal agent for) a consortium. Funding should be used to create new open textbooks and expand the use of open textbooks in courses that are part of a degree granting program, and particularly those with high enrollments. Allowable uses of funds should include professional development for faculty and staff, including relating to the search for and review of open textbooks; the creation or adaptation of open textbooks; development or improvement of tools and informational resources that support the use of open textbooks, including accessible instructional materials for students with disabilities; and research evaluating the efficacy of the use of open textbooks for achieving savings for students and the impact on instruction and student learning outcomes. The Secretary shall require that any open textbooks created with these funds shall be released to the public under a non- exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, and irrevocable license to exercise any of the rights under copyright conditioned only on the requirement that attribution be given as directed by the copyright owner. Further, any tools, technologies, or other resources that are created, developed, or improved wholly or in part with these funds for use with any open textbook must be similarly licensed. Any eligible entity receiving a grant through the Open Textbooks Pilot, upon completion of the supported project, shall report to the Secretary regarding the effectiveness of the project in expanding the use of open textbooks and in achieving savings for students; the impact of the project on expanding the use of open textbooks at IHEs outside of the institution receiving the grant; open textbooks created or adapted under the grant, including instructions on where the public can access each open textbook; the impact of the project on instruction and student learning outcomes; and all project costs, including the value of any volunteer labor and institutional capital used for the project. The Secretary shall make such reports publicly available. Postsecondary Student Success Grants (PSSG).--The Committee provides $200,000,000 for grants to support evidence-based activities to improve postsecondary retention and completion rates, including critical persistence benchmarks. Eligible applicants may include institutions of higher education, a consortium of institutions of higher education, statewide systems of higher education, a non-profit organization, or any of the preceding entities in partnership with a non-profit or business. The Committee directs the Secretary to execute this program as a tiered-evidence competition through the same structure as the EIR program authorized under ESEA. Under PSSG, the Secretary may award early-phase, mid-phase, or expansion grants that differ in terms of the level of prior evidence of effectiveness required for consideration for funding, the expectations regarding the kind of evidence and information funded projects should produce, the level of scale funded projects should reach, and, consequently, the amount of funding available to support each type of project. Early-phase grants will be supported by promising evidence, mid-phase grants will be supported by moderate evidence, and expansion grants will be supported by strong evidence as defined in the Department's fiscal year 2022 EIR notices. Under PSGG, all grantees must carry out rigorous, independent evaluations of the effectiveness of their projects. In carrying out PSGG, the Committee strongly encourages the Department to leverage the expertise of staff within the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education and the Institute of Education Sciences who have made EIR a highly successful program. The Committee is strongly encouraged by the evidence base behind comprehensive approaches to student success programs such as the What Works Clearinghouse-recognized CUNY ASAP program, which has been found to nearly double participant graduation rates. In addition, the Committee recognizes that other rigorously evaluated, effective comprehensive support programs such as One Million Degrees and Bottom Line have not yet been included in the Clearinghouse. In advance of the fiscal year 2023 competition, the Committee encourages the Department to review additional studies and strive to increase the number of postsecondary interventions included in the Clearinghouse. The Committee believes that the evidence of effectiveness for high-quality comprehensive support programs is transformative and that it is vital to expand their reach to more postsecondary students. Accordingly, for the fiscal year 2023 PSSG competition, the Committee directs the Department to provide no less than $100,000,000 for grants at the mid-phase or expansion levels. By ensuring at least half of resources fund proven strategies, PSGG will strike a balance between testing innovative interventions and funding what works to help students succeed. The Committee directs the Department to brief the Committees on Appropriations no later than 90 days after enactment of this Act on its plan to continue to carry out this program, as well as a plan for evaluation and accountability, and to notify the Committees no later than 15 days in advance of making any new grant award or changes to the programs. Research and Development Infrastructure Grants.--The Committee provides $225,000,000 for planning and implementation grants designed to promote transformational investments in research infrastructure, including physical infrastructure and human capital development. Eligible entities include four-year HBCUs, TCUs, or other MSIs, either alone or as the lead entity in consortia including other academic partners such as community colleges, industry, and philanthropic partners. Transitioning Gang-Involved Youth to Higher Education.--The Committee directs the Department to work in conjunction with the Department of Labor to allocate no less than $10,000,000 to provide a funding opportunity for organizations that work directly with gang-involved youth to help such youth pursue higher education opportunities. National Center for College Students with Disabilities.-- The Committee encourages the National Center for College Students with Disabilities to continue providing technical assistance and best practice information about disability as students transition to institutions of higher education, collect information and research on disability services on college campuses, and report to the Department about the status of college students with disabilities in the United States. Reasonable Modifications at Institutions of Higher Education.--The Committee is interested in information pertaining to reasonable modifications and the provision of auxiliary aids and services, including those to access educational media, required by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 for college students with disabilities at institutions of higher education. The Committee directs the Department to include information on how it monitors institutional support for college students with disabilities, and information on technical assistance it provides to colleges regarding students with disabilities, in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification. Workforce Development Funding for University Consortia Focused on High-skill Fields.--The Committee is supportive of funding to consortia of institutions of higher education for innovative approaches to improve rates of baccalaureate exposure to artificial intelligence, data science, cyber security, additive manufacturing, clean energy and other high- skill, high-wage, and in-demand industry sectors and occupations within a State region. Specifically, the Committee is supportive of funding that supports the development of career pathways in these sectors that support and subsidize wages for students in work-based learning settings. Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) Programs.--The Committee applauds all universities and colleges that host ROTC programs as they assist in the creation of each of the Services' officer corps. However, the Committee is concerned that some hosting ROTC activities may face challenges in maintaining the infrastructure needs to meet the ROTC mission goals. To ensure that ROTC candidates have the structures they need to become successful officers in their respective Services, the Committee encourages the Department to facilitate Service Secretaries' efforts to analyze the functionality and utilization of all ROTC facilities on university and college campuses. Foreign Gift Disclosures.--The Committee notes that, under section 117 of the HEA, colleges and universities receiving Federal funds must disclose certain gifts from or contracts with foreign entities and that the Department makes such information publicly available on its website. The Committee supports efforts by the Department to work with institutions to improve the reporting process in order to increase transparency, protect our national security, and preserve academic integrity. Community Project Funding Within the funds included in this account, $209,301,000 shall be used for the projects, and in the amounts, specified in the table titled ``Labor, HHS, Education Incorporation of Community Project Funding Items'' at the end of this report. Augustus F. Hawkins Centers of Excellence The Committee recommends $30,000,000 for the Hawkins Centers of Excellence program, which is $22,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. This program provides five- year competitive grants to eligible institutions (HBCUs, HSIs, TCUs, and other MSIs) to establish centers of excellence. These centers will help strengthen and improve teacher preparation programs, increase the availability of educators from diverse backgrounds, and aid in the retention of teachers and principals of color. Comprehensive Educator Preparation.--The Committee notes that greater diversity in the teaching profession can have positive impacts on students' educational experiences and outcomes, especially for students of color. For example, one reanalysis of test score data from the Tennessee STAR class size study found that Black elementary students with Black teachers had reading and math test scores 3 to 6 percentile points higher than students without Black teachers and that gains in test scores accumulated with each year that Black students were in a class with a Black teacher. The Committee also notes that our current educator workforce does not reflect the increasing diversity of our nation or its students. The Committee also recognizes that HBCUs, TCUs, and other MSIs play a disproportionate and important role in preparing teachers of color, for example, preparing nearly 40 percent of Black teachers with bachelor's degrees in the United States. The Committee recognizes the importance of comprehensive educator preparation on student learning and educator retention, and therefore encourages the Department to create an absolute grant priority for eligible institutions that propose to establish or scale up comprehensive educator preparation programs as outlined in sections 202 (d),(e), and (f), of the HEA. The Committee also encourages the Secretary to prioritize grants to eligible institutions that will provide scholarships or grants to students based on financial need, for use in students accessing comprehensive educator preparation pathways that offer extensive preservice clinical training and mentoring by exemplary teachers. Preservice Clinical Training and Mentoring.--The Committee recognizes the importance of high-quality teacher preparation on student learning and teacher retention, and therefore encourages the Secretary to prioritize grants to eligible institutions that propose to establish or scale up high-quality teacher preparation pathways that offer extensive preservice clinical training and mentoring by exemplary teachers in grade and subject areas deemed high need by their State. The Committee also recognizes the value of a racially diverse teacher workforce and directs the Secretary to prioritize grants to eligible institutions that commit to increasing the number and proportion of students of color they serve by providing scholarships or grants, based on financial need, as well as academic supports to help teacher candidates successfully complete the preparation program and State licensure requirements, and to publicly report on these efforts and outcomes. The Committee also encourages the Department to include the establishment of formal partnerships between eligible institutions of higher education and local school districts as an allowable use of grant funding as well as programming that includes tutoring and support to prepare for licensure exams and funding to compensate mentors during the preservice clinical experience. Shortages of Black Male Teachers.--The Committee is concerned that Black men make up just two percent of teachers nationwide. The Committee's support for Hawkins is intended to address such shortages. In addition, the Committee encourages the Department to leverage the expertise and institutional capacity of HBCUs in mitigating this problem.

Within the total, the agreement includes $150,000,000 to support construction of a new hospital. These amounts are in addition to the $107,000,000 provided for hospital construction in fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2022. The hospital serves as a major acute and ambulatory care center for the District of Columbia, and functions as a teaching facility. To continue this vital function, the Committee notes the need to modernize the hospital's facilities. COLLEGE HOUSING AND ACADEMIC FACILITIES LOANS PROGRAM Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $435,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 298,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 298,000 Change from enacted level......................... -137,000 Change from budget request........................ - - - Previously, these programs helped to ensure that postsecondary institutions were able to make necessary capital improvements to maintain and increase their ability to provide a high-quality education. Since 1994, no new loans have been made, and the Department's role has been to manage the outstanding loans. HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY CAPITAL FINANCING PROGRAM ACCOUNT Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $20,484,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 20,678,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 20,678,000 Change from enacted level......................... +194,000 Change from budget request........................ - - - The Committee recommends $20,678,000 for the HBCU Capital Financing program, which is $194,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. This program is authorized under part D of Title III of the HEA and makes capital available for repair and renovation of facilities at HBCUs. In exceptional circumstances, capital provided under the program can be used for construction or acquisition of facilities. Within the total provided for this program, the Committee recommendation includes $528,000 for the administrative expenses to carry out the program and $20,150,000 for loan subsidy costs. In addition, the Committee raises the limit to the amount of bonds that may be insured under the HBCU Capital Financing program to $752,000,000, an increase of $477,916,725 over the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. INSTITUTE OF EDUCATION SCIENCES Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $737,021,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 662,516,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 844,075,000 Change from enacted level......................... +107,054,000 Change from budget request........................ +181,559,000 The Committee recommends $844,075,000 for the Institute of Education Sciences (IES), $107,054,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. Research, Development, and Dissemination The Committee recommends $289,877,000 for Research, Development, and Dissemination, which is $85,000,000 more that the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. This account supports research, development, and national dissemination activities that are aimed at expanding fundamental knowledge of education and promoting the use of research and development findings in the design of efforts to improve education. National Center for Advanced Development in Education.-- Within amounts for Research, Development, and Dissemination, the Committee provides $75,000,000 for a new National Center for Advanced Development in Education (NCADE). Modeled on the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Department of Defense's renowned research and development center, NCADE will invest in high-reward, scalable solutions to address longstanding deficits and inequities in the education system. NCADE will be housed at IES and have a management structure that prioritizes solutions aligned with the science of learning and development that have the potential to dramatically improve student achievement and address gaps between advantaged and disadvantaged students. Specifically, NCADE programs will invest in breakthrough technologies; new pedagogical approaches; innovative learning models; and more efficient, reliable, and valid forms of measurement of student learning, experiences, and opportunities. Amounts for NCADE provided under Research, Development, and Dissemination will specifically support the Center's high-reward project funding. Personnel costs to support the Center's nimble program management structure will be supported through funding provided under IES Program Administration. Building State and Local Research and Development Capacity.--The Committee encourages IES to build State and local research and development capacity by creating a matching competitive grant program for American Rescue Plan Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief funds. These funds would allow States or districts to develop or implement diverse approaches specifically tailored to their contexts, including building research-practice partnerships, recruiting research and data talent into their agencies, and investing in their own research and development priorities to develop or implement more evidence-based solutions. Statistics The Committee recommends $111,500,000 for the activities of the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), which is the same as the the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. Statistics activities are authorized under Title I of the Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002. NCES collects, analyzes, and reports statistics on all levels of education in the U.S. Activities are carried out directly and through grants and contracts and include projections of enrollments, teacher supply and demand, and educational expenditures. NCES also provides technical assistance to State and local educational agencies and postsecondary institutions. Governing Boards of Institutions of Higher Education.--The Committee is interested in the disclosure of the gender, racial, and ethnic composition of governing boards of institutions of higher education in an ongoing effort to increase transparency and promote inclusive and equitable educational institutions. The Committee encourages the Department to ensure governing body composition, including the gender, racial, and ethnic composition of members, is included as a data component in surveys administered by the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) or other Federal postsecondary institution data collection effort. The Committee directs the Department to assess the feasibility of including such data in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification. Non-Academic Considerations in Postsecondary Data.--The Committee is aware of a 2019 report from NCES detailing recommendations to include non-academic considerations to improve and expand the IPEDS Admissions survey component (ADM) for prospective students, their families, and researchers interested in the college admissions process. The Committee is also aware of the lack of data available demonstrating how legacy status, or relationship to alumni of the institutions, factors in first-time, first-year degree-seeking admissions decisions. The Committee encourages the NCES to include non- academic items, including alumni relationship, as factors for admissions in the next IPEDS ADM. Regional Educational Laboratories The Committee recommends $63,733,000 for Regional Educational Laboratories (RELs), which is $5,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. This program supports a network of 10 laboratories that promote the use and development of knowledge and evidence to increase student learning and further school improvement efforts. The Committee notes the critical role RELs play in helping to translate education research to policymakers and practitioners, which assists SEAs and LEAs in implementing the ESEA and providing a high-quality education for more children. Research in Special Education The Committee recommends $64,255,000 for Research in Special Education, which is $4,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. This program supports competitive awards to produce and advance the use of knowledge to improve services and results for children with disabilities. The program focuses on producing new knowledge, integrating research and practice, and improving the use of knowledge. Special Education Studies and Evaluations The Committee recommends $13,318,000 for Special Education Studies and Evaluations, which is the same as the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. This program awards competitive grants, contracts and cooperative agreements to assess the implementation of the IDEA and the effectiveness of State and local efforts to provide special education and early intervention programs and services to infants, toddlers, and children with disabilities. Statewide Data Systems The Committee recommends $35,500,000 for Statewide Data Systems, which is $2,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. Competitive grants under this authority are made to SEAs to help them manage, analyze, disaggregate and use student data consistent with the ESEA. Growing Statewide Longitudinal Data Systems (SLDS).--The Committee supports the growth of the SLDS program to so that every State and locale has a robust data infrastructure capable of supporting effective education and talent development practices. The Committee believes these investments provide for the data backbone of education transparency, monitoring, and evidence building. Assessment The Committee recommends $192,799,000 for Assessment, which is $5,054,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. This amount includes $7,779,000 for the National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB), which is $54,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the only nationally representative and continuing survey of educational ability and achievement of students in the U.S. The primary goal of the assessment is to determine and report the status and trends of the knowledge and skills of students, subject by subject. Subject areas assessed in the past have included reading, writing, mathematics, science, history, citizenship, literature, art, and music. The NAEP is operated by contractors through competitive awards made by the NCES. The NAGB formulates the policy guidelines for the program. Civics and U.S. History Assessment.--Assessment.--The Committee's recommendation will support the current assessment schedule for the National Assessment of Educational Progress, including administration in 2022 of the Civics and U.S. History assessment in 8th grade at the national level; necessary research and development needed to maintain assessment quality, integrity and continuity, and achieve efficiencies; and maintain plans for the administration of a State-level Civics assessment in future years. The Committee directs NAGB and IES to consult with the Committee as it considers strategies in achieving cost efficiencies in and upgrades of its assessment program. Further, the Committee directs the Department to describe implemented and planned strategies for cost efficiencies and necessary research and development projects in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification. Program Administration The Committee recommends $73,093,000 for Program Administration, which is $6,000,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. Operating Plan.--The agreement directs the Director to submit an operating plan within 90 days of enactment of this Act to the Committees detailing how IES plans to allocate funding available to the Institute for research, evaluation, statistics, administration and other activities. School Pulse Panel.--The Committee is supportive of IES' School Pulse Panel, which tracks the effects of COVID on schools through a national sample of elementary, middle, and high schools. This program has provided invaluable information as one of the nation's few sources of reliable data focused on school reopening efforts, as reported by school district staff and principals in U.S. public schools. Unique Needs of Military-Connected Youth in Mentorship Programs.--The Committee recognizes the unique circumstances of highly mobile students, including youth growing up in military- connected families. The Committee supports IES' uplifting of mentorship programming tailored to military families' needs. DEPARTMENTAL MANAGEMENT Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $ 594,407,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 785,752,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 690,252,000 Change from enacted level......................... + 95,845,000 Change from budget request........................ -95,500,000 Program Administration The Committee recommends $462,500,000 for Program Administration, which is $67,593,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted. These funds support the staff and other costs of administering programs and activities at the Department. Items include personnel compensation, health, retirement, and other benefits as well as travel, rent, telephones, utilities, postage fees, data processing, printing, equipment, supplies, technology training, consultants, and other contractual services. Advertising Contracts.--The Committee understands that, as the largest advertiser in the U.S., the Federal Government should work to ensure fair access to its advertising contracts for small disadvantaged businesses and businesses owned by minorities and women. The Committee directs the Department to include the following information in its fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification: Expenditures for fiscal years 2022, 2023, and expected expenditures for fiscal year 2024 respectively, for (1) all contracts for advertising services; and (2) contracts for the advertising services of (I) socially and economically disadvantaged small business concerns (as defined in section 8(a)(4) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)(4)); and (II) women- and minority-owned businesses. Investments in Impoverished Areas.--The Committee is deeply appreciative to the Department for its thorough work on a report on educational investments in impoverished areas, particularly in persistent poverty counties and in other high poverty census tracts as described in House Report 117-81. The Committee directs the Department to update the report to include persistent poverty percentages for competitions in fiscal year 2022 once those data are available. Lead Testing and Remediation.--The Committee strongly agrees with recommendations from a 2018 GAO report, Lead Testing of School Drinking Water Would Benefit from Improved Federal Guidance, that the Assistant Secretary for Elementary and Secondary Education should collaborate with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to disseminate guidance related to lead testing and remediation in schools. The Committee is aware that EPA has made available updated guidance and web-based toolkits for lead testing and remediation in schools. The Committee is also aware that EPA is soliciting applications from education officials to provide grant funds to assist States and local education agencies with testing and remediation efforts. The Committee appreciates the technical assistance provided by the Department to school districts in response to language included in House Report 116-62. The Committee directs the Department to continue coordinating with EPA in disseminating this new guidance and resources, assisting school systems seeking to remediate lead contamination in working with EPA, and sharing best practices among States and local school systems. The Committee directs the Department to report on ongoing efforts on these issues in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification. FTE and Attrition Report.--The Committee directs the Department to provide the Committees on Appropriations a report, not later than 30 days after the conclusion of each quarter, detailing the number of full-time equivalent employees and attrition by principal office and appropriations account. Protecting Scientific Research on Marihuana.--Through scientific research, institutions of higher education advance our understanding and knowledge of various aspects of our world. Moreover, when in the public interest, such institutions should be able to conduct such research without fear of reprisal or loss of Federal funding. This includes research on cannabis, a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act. As more States and localities move to legalize cannabis, many institutions of higher education are expanding the knowledge-base on this controlled substance. As a result, the Committee notes that such research is in the public interest, and the recommendation includes new bill language prohibiting the Department from penalizing institutions of higher education that conduct scientific research on marihuana. Evidence-based Grants and Policy.--The Committee requests an update in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification on implementation of the Foundations for Evidence-based Policymaking Act (P.L. 115-435) and implementation plans for the coming year. The Committee encourages the Secretary to develop guidance to ensure relevant participants and grantees are involved in the Department-wide process of prioritizing evidence needs, including participating in Department led evaluations. Consistent with program statutes, the Committee encourages the Secretary to ensure that evidence of effectiveness is a consideration in grant opportunities. Film Programs at Institutions of Higher Education.--The Committee recognizes the importance of ensuring diversity in student populations enrolled in film programs at institutions of higher education that receive any Federal funds and grants administrated by the Department of Education. The Committee encourages institutions of higher education to continue building on best practices in recruitment and retention to ensure student enrollment is reflective of the American population's diverse demographics. Customer Service.--The Committee continues to support efforts to improve customer service in accordance with Executive Order 13571--Streamlining Service Delivery and Improving Customer Service. The Committee directs the Secretary to develop standards to improve customer service and incorporate the standards into the performance plans required under 31 U.S.C. 1115. The Committee further directs the Department to include an update on the progress of these efforts in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification. Performance Measures.--The Committee directs the Department to comply with title 31 of the United States Code, including the development of organizational priority goals and outcomes such as performance outcome measures, output measures, efficiency measures, and customer service measures. The Committee further directs the Department to include an update on the progress of these efforts in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification. Regional Councils and Councils of Governments.--The Committee encourages the Department to list regional councils and councils of governments as eligible entities in competitions for Federal funding whenever local governments or non-profit agencies are eligible entities. Furthermore, the Committee encourages the Department to seek opportunities for regional councils and councils of governments to serve as lead applicants and grantees to encourage and expand greater regional collaboration. Predispute Nondisclosure and Nondisparagement Clauses.--The Committee recognizes that harassment, including sexual harassment and assault, continue to be pervasive in the workplace, and that the use of predispute nondisclosure and nondisparagement clauses as conditions of employment can perpetuate illegal conduct by silencing survivors and shielding perpetrators. The Committee directs the Department to include proposals in its fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification to eliminate the use of grants and contracts to employers that use this practice. Geographical Distribution of Grants and Poverty.--The Committee acknowledges the value of ensuring K-12 grant competitions support entities across geographically diverse areas, including urban, suburban, and rural areas; however, the Committee is concerned that, without careful consideration and planning, efforts to prioritize specific geographical areas may have unintended negative consequences. The Department's 2021 Condition on Education finds that 41 percent of students attending public schools in cities attend high-poverty schools, compared with 20 percent of students who attend schools in towns, 17 percent of students who attend suburban schools, and 15 percent of students who attend rural schools. Given the significant differences in the share of students attending high-poverty schools across areas, the Committee urges the Department to consider the socioeconomic and racial equity implications of prioritizing specific geographic areas over cities in competitive grants. Out of School Time Organizations Supporting Mental Health for Youth.--The Committee notes that thousands of out of school time organizations are working with State governments, districts, schools, and youth to supplement the critical work of school-based mental health organizations without significant support from Federal funding streams. In order to better understand the Federal resources available, the Committee encourages the Department, in partnership with other relevant Federal agencies, to provide information on the ways community- based organizations, specifically out of school time organizations, can utilize existing Federal funding streams to provide mental health and student support services that supplement school-based mental health services. OFFICE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $135,500,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 161,300,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 151,300,000 Change from enacted level......................... +15,800,000 Change from budget request........................ -10,000,000 The Office for Civil Rights (OCR) is responsible for enforcing laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, disability, and age in all programs and institutions that receive funds from the Department. These laws extend to SEAs, LEAs, and IHEs, including proprietary schools. They also extend to State rehabilitation agencies, libraries, museums, and other institutions receiving Federal funds. The Committee recommendation includes $151,300,000, which is $15,800,000 more than the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. The School to Prison Pipeline.--The Committee directs GAO to study the role and oversight of policing in schools, including the impact of school policing on Black and Latino students. The study should also explore the extent to which school resource officers and evidence-based interventions, such as restorative justice practices, can enhance school safety, student well-being, and--to the extent practical--student outcomes. GAO should begin this work no later than September 2022 and issue a final report on a date thereafter as agreed between GAO and the Committee. The State of Desegregation Orders.--The Committee is concerned by research from the UCLA Civil Rights Project indicating that schools and school districts are becoming increasingly racially and socioeconomically segregated across the country. At the same time, there is no clear or accurate reporting or transparency on the number of Federal desegregation orders, the status of these orders, or the impact they have had on segregation in districts. The Committee, therefore, continues to urge OCR to make a report publicly available on the Department's website, detailing a comprehensive list of all existing Federal desegregation orders in the United States, their principle requirements, and the status of the affected districts' compliance with these orders. Racial and Economic Segregation in Schools.--The Committee looks forward to receiving the report the Department was directed to complete in House Report 117-96. OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $64,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 76,452,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 76,452,000 Change from enacted level......................... +12,452,000 Change from budget request........................ - - - OIG has authority to inquire into all program and administrative activities of the Department as well as into related activities of grant and contract recipients.

TITLE IV--RELATED AGENCIES Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled SALARIES AND EXPENSES Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $11,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 13,124,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 13,124,000 Change from enacted level......................... +2,124,000 Change from budget request........................ - - - The Committee believes oversight is necessary to ensure the program is operating in accordance with statutory requirements that blind or other severely disabled individuals provide at least 75 percent of hours of direct labor required for the production or provision of the products or services to Federal government agencies. To ensure the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (AbilityOne Commission) maintains its oversight capacity, the Committee continues bill language requiring the AbilityOne Commission to establish written agreements with central nonprofit agencies. The written agreements ensure the AbilityOne Commission can conduct appropriate audit, oversight, and reporting functions in accordance with standard Federal procurement policies. Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled--Requested Reports.--The Committee requests the reports as described in the explanatory statement accompanying P.L. 117-103. Office of Inspector General.--The Committee recommends not less than $3,124,000 for the Office of Inspector General. Corporation for National and Community Service OPERATING EXPENSES Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $865,409,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 982,126,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 947,829,000 Change from enacted level......................... +82,420,000 Change from budget request........................ -34,297,000 The Committee recommends $947,829,000 for operating expenses for the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS), an increase of $82,420,000 over the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and $34,297,000 below the fiscal year 2023 budget request. Service Learning.--Within the total for Operating Expenses, the Committee directs $20,000,000 for CNCS to support service- learning activities, such as the Summer of Service and Semester of Service, within existing programs. The Committee further recommends that CNCS prioritize grants directed to public schools and institutions of higher education in economically disadvantaged communities. Civic Bridgebuilding.--The Committee supports CNCS' goal of uniting Americans through national service and recognizes that national service is a proven model of civic bridgebuilding. To advance these shared goals, the Committee directs $15,000,000 to CNCS for bridgebuilding activities, such as those modeled in the bipartisan Building Civic Bridges Act (H.R. 6843), within existing programs. These initiatives may include administering a grant program to support civic bridgebuilding programs and establish standardized criteria to track the effectiveness of funded projects and activities; providing training in civic bridgebuilding skills and techniques to AmeriCorps members and host sites; the establishment of a committee to advise on civic bridgebuilding initiatives at CNCS; the creation of a public research base focused on civic engagement, civic bridgebuilding, and civic renewal; and providing resources that can be publicly disseminated to support local civic bridgebuilding efforts, among other activities. Volunteers in Service to America The Committee recommends $106,264,000 for Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA), an increase of $5,979,000 over the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2023 budget request. This program provides capacity building for small, community-based organizations with a mission of combating poverty. VISTA members raise resources, recruit, and organize volunteers, and establish and expand programs in housing, employment, health, and economic development. National Senior Volunteer Corps The Committee recommends $245,145,000 for the National Senior Volunteer Corps programs, an increase of $14,377,000 over the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2023 budget request. Senior Corps is a collection of programs that connect individuals older than the age of 55 with opportunities to contribute their job skills and expertise to community projects and organizations. The Committee intends for all funding to be used to support programs and volunteers. The funding breakout by program is as follows: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ National Senior Volunteer Corps: FY 2023 Committee ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Foster Grandparents Program.......................... $131,335,000 Senior Companion Program............................. 58,705,000 Retired Senior Volunteer Program..................... 55,105,000 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ AmeriCorps State and National Grants The Committee recommends $522,797,000 for AmeriCorps State and National Grants, an increase of $56,048,000 over the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. This program provides funds to local and national organizations and agencies to address community needs in education, public safety, health, and the environment. The increase supports enhanced opportunities for more individuals to serve as AmeriCorps State and National members by increasing disability accommodation and eligibility for Segal Education awards for individuals with DACA status. AmeriCorps State and National members support children to achieve academic success, respond to natural disasters, build and renovate homes for families in under-resourced communities, give back to veterans and their families, preserve and restore the environment, and address other needs identified by communities. Digital Equity.--The Committee recognizes that digital equity needs persist in underserved or marginalized communities at a time when more Americans than ever before depend on, or could significantly benefit from, access to digital services. The Committee recognizes the role that national service organization volunteers through CNCS could play in helping to meet the IT needs of these communities across the country while also supporting IT skills and career development among participating volunteers. The Committee encourages CNCS to support existing programs that would focus on digital equity and digital literacy projects for underserved communities.

Corporation for Public Broadcasting Appropriation, fiscal year 2024....................... $525,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2025...................... 565,000,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 565,000,000 Change from enacted level......................... +40,000,000 Change from budget request........................ - - - The Committee recommends $565,000,000 as an advance appropriation for fiscal year 2025, an increase of $40,000,000 over the fiscal year 2024 advance and the same as the fiscal year 2023 budget request. In addition, the Committee recommendation includes $60,000,000 in fiscal year 2023 for continued support of CPB in replacing and upgrading the public broadcasting interconnection system and further investing in system-wide infrastructure and services. National Multicultural Alliance.-- According to the Public Broadcasting Act, one of the greatest priorities of public broadcasting is to address the ``needs of unserved and underserved audiences, particularly children and minorities.'' Programming that reflects the histories and perspectives of diverse racial and ethnic communities is a core value and responsibility of public broadcasting. Therefore, the Committee supports continued investment in the National Multicultural Alliance to help accomplish this goal. The Corporation is directed to provide a briefing to the Committee within 90 days of enactment of this Act on this investment. Continued Access to Public Broadcasting.--The Committee recognizes the importance of continued access to public broadcasting in local communities. The Committee directs Federally funded public radio stations to engage in public- private partnerships with State and local entities, including nonprofits, in this effort. The Committee looks forward to information in the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification on how public private partnerships may be used to ensure continued access to public broadcasting in underserved areas. Diversity in CPB Funded Programming.--The Committee recognizes the importance of diversity and inclusion in federally funded public media in television and radio programming. The Committee requests CPB include in its fiscal years 2024/2026 Congressional Budget Justification information on its diversity and inclusion efforts, including programming supported by funding from the Corporation, as well as professional development opportunities and services provided by CPB for individuals from underrepresented communities. Diverse Content and Content Creators.--In recognizing the importance of public media and the inclusion of diverse and independent voices, Congress encourages CPB to continue to support the Independent Television Service (ITVS) and the National Multicultural Alliance (NMCA) and encourages CPB to expand its support through other established and emerging intermediaries that fund and support diverse filmmakers and production of diverse content. The Committee further encourages CPB to continue fulfilling its Congressional mandate to enrich the public media landscape with diverse content on broadcast and digital platforms by funding more content creators and producers from underrepresented backgrounds. As the federal funding provided for CPB also supports the work of ITVS, the Committee urges CPB to ensure that the increases in funding for future fiscal years are also used to provide additional financial support for ITVS, the National Multicultural Alliance, and content creators and producers from underrepresented backgrounds.

Online Education Programs.--Bringing quality, online career high school education to adults is essential for entering the skilled workforce and/or matriculating into the community college system. Local libraries play a vital, central role in providing adult online high school education to patrons in their local communities. The Committee encourages IMLS to prioritize state grants to local libraries to further develop ways for libraries to adopt and utilize adult online career high school education programs. Program Administration The Committee recommends $18,500,000 for Program Administration, which is the same as the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. These funds provide administrative and management support for all programs administered by IMLS. The Committee also includes $5,650,000 for IMLS' activities in policy, research, and data collection, including functions formerly conducted by the National Commission on Libraries and Information Science. Holocaust Education and Survivor Stories.--The Committee is aware that the number of Holocaust survivors in the U.S. is diminishing due to the advanced age of the survivors. The Committee continues to commend the work that museums, libraries, and archives are doing to preserve their memories and to educate the public of the Holocaust. The Committee encourages IMLS to support the work organizations are doing across the country to preserve and present the living memories of Holocaust survivors in an interactive format, which can help educate future generations about the atrocities of the Holocaust. Information Literacy Taskforce.--The Committee encourages IMLS to support the Information Literacy Taskforce funded in fiscal year 2023 and to continue to follow the guidelines and priorities described in the explanatory statement accompanying P.L. 117-103. Public Library Assessment.--The Committee notes growing concern regarding the physical condition of public libraries. The Committee supports efforts to assess the availability and condition of public library facilities, the availability and condition of public library facilities located in economically disadvantaged or underserved communities, the accessibility of public library facilities for individuals with disabilities, the condition of public library facilities affected by natural disasters and extreme weather, and potential costs associated with bringing public library facilities to a state of good repair. Medicare Payment Advisory Commission SALARIES AND EXPENSES Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $13,292,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 13,440,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 13,824,000 Change from enacted level......................... +532,000 Change from budget request........................ +384,000 The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) is an independent agency tasked with advising the Congress on issues affecting the Medicare program.

The Committee includes $319,424,000 for the NLRB, which is $45,200,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2023 budget request. Within this amount, at least $1,000,000 is provided, along with new bill language, for the Board to develop and implement an electronic voting system. National Mediation Board SALARIES AND EXPENSES Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $14,729,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 15,113,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 15,113,000 Change from enacted level......................... +384,000 Change from budget request........................ - - - The National Mediation Board (NMB) is an independent agency that coordinates labor-management relations within the U.S. railroads and airlines industries.

The Committee urges NMB to use this increase to supplement, not supplant, existing resources devoted to Section 3 arbitrator salaries and expenses and to address the backlog of Section 3 arbitration cases at the NMB. The Committee has prioritized these additional funds to allow the Board to better accomplish its statutory mission in a timelier manner.

The Committee includes a provision permitting a portion of these funds to be derived from income tax receipts on dual benefits as authorized by law. The Railroad Retirement Board (``RRB'') estimates that approximately $1,000,000 may be derived in this manner. FEDERAL PAYMENT TO THE RAILROAD RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $150,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 150,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 150,000 Change from enacted level......................... - - - Change from budget request........................ - - - LIMITATION ON ADMINISTRATION Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $124,000,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 131,666,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 131,666,000 Change from enacted level......................... +7,666,000 Change from budget request........................ - - - The Committee recommends $131,666,000 for Limitation on Administration, an increase of $7,666,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the same as the fiscal year 2023 budget request.

SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME PROGRAM Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $45,913,823,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 48,828,722,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 48,713,576,000 Change from enacted level......................... +2,799,753,000 Change from budget request........................ -115,146,000 The Committee recommends $15,800,000,000 in advance funding for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, as requested. Research and Demonstration Section 1110 of the Social Security Act provides authority to the Social Security Administration (SSA) for conducting research and demonstration projects related to SSA's programs. Within the appropriation for Supplemental Security Income (SSI), the Committee recommends $86,000,000 for research and demonstration activities, which is equal to the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and the fiscal year 2023 budget request. Administration Within the appropriation for SSI, the Committee recommends $4,878,576,000, which is $346,895,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level. This funding is for payment to the Social Security trust funds for SSI's share of the administrative expenses of SSA. LIMITATION ON ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES Appropriation, fiscal year 2022....................... $11,494,945,000 Budget request, fiscal year 2023...................... 12,833,300,000 Committee Recommendation.............................. 12,501,945,000 Change from enacted level......................... +1,007,000,000 Change from budget request........................ -331,355,000 The Limitation on Administrative Expenses (LAE) funds the administrative and operational costs for administering the Old Age and Survivors Insurance, Disability Insurance, and Supplemental Security Income programs, and associated costs for support to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in administering their programs. The Committee recognizes that Social Security is an essential component of the nation's economic security, and that SSA faces unprecedented challenges as it recovers from years of underfunding and a pandemic that severely disrupted its operations, closing offices to most in-person visitors and generating delays in services and decisions on disability claims. The Committee believes that the critical need to rebuild the Social Security Administration's ability to serve the American people starts with adequately funding fixed cost increases. The recommendation includes funding to cover Federal employee salaries and benefits, fixed cost increases for State DDS partners, facilities, and other contracted expenses that will be necessary to fund regardless of investments that can be made to improve SSA operations in fiscal year 2023. In addition, the Committee includes increased funding necessary to help correct long-standing deficiencies, improve operations, and better serve the public. Within the total recommended increase, the Committee expects SSA to direct not less than $630,000,000 for field offices, teleservice centers, and program service centers, and $190,000,000 to replace losses and build capacity at the State Disability Determination Services (DDS) agencies that make disability determinations for SSA. In addition, within the recommended funding level, the Committee provides $89,500,000 for SSA to mail paper statements to all contributors aged 25 and older not yet receiving benefits, in accordance with Section 1143 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320b-13). Administrative Appeals Hearings.--The Committee continues to consider the Final Rule ``Hearings Held by Administrative Appeals Judges of the Appeals Council'' (85 Fed. Reg. 73138, December 16, 2020) to be an unjustified erosion of due process for individuals who are appealing a denial of Social Security or SSI benefits. As part of a beneficiary's right to an impartial appeal process, an on-the-record hearing, conducted by an impartial judge with decisional independence, must be conducted in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act to ensure due process, without agency interference, or political bias. Replacing this appeals step and the role of independent administrative law judges (ALJs) with SSA employees jeopardizes the independence of the process. In light of the harm that would be caused by this policy change, the Committee strongly urges SSA not to exercise this authority. Authorization of Disability Evidence Collection.--The Committee appreciates that SSA is working to increase its ability to directly obtain electronic medical records and other evidence necessary for disability claims determination. The Committee expects that the Commissioner will continue to ensure that evidence is only accessed under a voluntary, time-limited, and revokable authorization by the claimant to permit medical providers and other sources to disclose information directly to SSA, consistent with Federal, State, and local laws. Disability Backlogs.--The Committee recognizes that the pandemic disrupted SSA operations, generating significant new delays in initial disability claims and reconsideration appeals, and temporarily halting in-person hearings before ALJs. The Committee requests SSA submit to the Committee within 90 days of enactment of this Act a plan for reducing the initial and reconsideration claims backlogs, and continue to submit to the Committee quarterly reports on disability hearings backlogs until SSA has eliminated the hearings backlog and achieved its monthly average processing time goal. The Committee urges the Commissioner to prioritize the hiring of additional staff at the DDS agencies to determine initial claims and reconsideration appeals, as well as ALJs and requisite staff to adjudicate backlogged hearings claims. Disability Determinations.--The Committee remains concerned about the time it takes SSA to effectuate favorable SSI and/or SSDI disability determinations and requests a briefing on the issue withing 30 days of receiving the report on Disability Determinations as requested in House Report 117-96. Employee Incentives.--The Committee directs SSA to submit a report to the Committee within 180 days of enactment of this Act exploring the feasibility of using employee incentives, including an agency student loan repayment program, to improve recruitment and retention for qualified candidates across the agency. Field Office Closures.--The Committee recognizes the essential role that field offices play in the public's ability to access SSA benefits and services and strongly encourages the Commissioner to take every action possible to maintain operations at existing field offices. The Committee urges SSA to ensure its policies and procedures for closing field offices include at least 120 days advance notice to the public, SSA employees, Congress, and other stakeholders. Such notice should include a rationale for the proposed closure, and an evaluation of the effects on the public and SSA operations. Improving Ticket to Work Administration and Reducing Overpayments.--The Committee recognizes that overpayments due to delays in SSA processing are an issue for beneficiaries who are attempting to return to work, including through the Ticket to Work program. The Committee recommends SSA work to identify the root causes of overpayments and requests a briefing within 90 days of enactment of this Act on agency efforts to improve administrative processes to reduce overpayments. Information Technology.--The Committee is concerned that SSA's antiquated Information Technology (IT) service management system is adversely impacting agency staff's ability to deliver the value, service, and efficiency that the public expects and deserves. The Committee recognizes that SSA began modernizing its IT Service Management tools in fiscal year 2021, and expects SSA to continue working on IT solutions to improve customer service, ensure high availability and service continuity, optimize operational efficiency, and maximize enterprise productivity. The Committee continues to monitor the IT Modernization Plan and encourages SSA to focus on improvements to customer service and efficiency as it makes updates to the plan. In addition, SSA should take steps to automate manual processes performed by staff, to reduce human error and improve processing time. The Committee continues to request an update of the plan referenced under this heading in House Report 114- 699. Legal Assistants.--The Committee understands that the Office of Hearings Operations (OHO) relies on legal assistants to conduct a broad range of work supporting hearings and reviewing work of its administrative law judges, and urges SSA to examine the position descriptions of legal assistants, pay and actual work conducted, to ensure that job classifications and compensation are commensurate with current duties. Pilot Program Metrics.--The Committee expects SSA to continue to follow the guidance and directives under this heading in House Report 116-450 for fiscal year 2023, and to include descriptions of pilots and associated pilot program metrics in its fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification. Professional Representatives.--The Committee believes that quality representation in matters with SSA assists claimants and beneficiaries, and can also help SSA work more accurately and efficiently. The Committee appreciates that the Commissioner is raising the cap on fees payable via fee agreement, and encourages the Commissioner to index the cap to account for inflation in future years. Program Integrity.--The Committee notes that the FY 2023 President's Budget again proposes language for this account to expressly prohibit program integrity funding from being reprogrammed or transferred for non-program integrity activities. With respect to the reprogramming restriction portion of the proposal, the Committee does not accept this proposal again because the Congress need not expressly prohibit actions that it has not authorized. Under the statutory terms of the appropriation, amounts provided for program integrity activities may not be reprogrammed to base activities (or to any other non-program integrity activity). That is because this appropriation account statutorily establishes a required appropriation amount for program integrity activities--in this bill, at $1,799,000,000--which is provided by the sum of the amounts specified in the first and second provisos of the account's second paragraph. The bill also continues to emphasize that ``no more than'' that required sum for program integrity activities may be used for program integrity purposes. The Committee reminds SSA that this emphasis has been included since FY 2017 in response to SSA's view that other funds in the account, in addition to the sum statutorily required for program integrity activities, were otherwise available for program integrity activities. The Committee continues to agree with the explanatory statement accompanying the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 that this emphasis ``is for SSA to support program integrity activities solely from funds available for that purpose.'' Finally, with respect to the transfer prohibition portion of the proposal, the Committee has not been apprised of any applicable transfer authority available to SSA that the President's Budget proposal seeks to prevent and therefore does not accept the proposal again. Report on LAE Expenditures.--The Committee continues to request that the data referenced under this heading in House Report 114-699 be included in future budget justifications. In addition, the Committee requests the fiscal year 2024 Congressional Budget Justification include a historical table of costs and fiscal year 2024 requests for personnel and benefits, by major SSA component to include Operations (field offices, teleservice centers, processing centers, and regional offices); Office of Hearings Operations; Systems; Office of Analytics, Review, and Oversight; and Headquarters. Service to the Public.--SSA uses Public Service Indicators to measure the agency's progress in meeting the needs of the public in local field offices and teleservice centers. The Committee directs SSA to submit to the Committee within 90 days of enactment of this Act an updated report on Public Service Indicators for field offices and teleservice centers, providing the indicators and performance for Fiscal Years 2016 to 2022. Such report shall also detail any staffing needs and resources necessary in its field offices and teleservice centers to restore previous levels of public service. Telework.--The Committee reiterates its support for well- managed telework programs in the Federal workplace and understands that SSA is in the process of evaluating how telework affects service delivery during the reentry evaluation period of March 30 through September 30, 2022. Within 90 days of enactment of this Act, the Committee requests a briefing on how the results of that evaluation will be used to measure and monitor the impact of telework on customer satisfaction, service availability including continuity of operations, workloads management, employee experience, stewardship, and environmental considerations. In addition, the Committee directs SSA to submit an update of the report that was requested under this heading in House Report 117-96, with updated data on the number of employees eligible and ineligible to telework, and any limitations or restrictions on the frequency of telework as a result of the evaluation. Video Hearings.--The Committee appreciates that SSA has resumed in-person hearings, and reiterates its support for SSA allowing a claimant to choose to use video and telephone hearings on a voluntary basis or to have an in-person hearing or proceeding if the party chooses to do so. Work Incentives Planning and Assistance (WIPA) and Protection and Advocacy for Beneficiaries of Social Security (PABSS).--The recommendation includes $23,000,000 for WIPA grants and $10,000,000 for PABSS. Social Security Advisory Board The Committee recommends $2,700,000 for the Social Security Advisory Board (SSAB), $100,000 above the fiscal year 2022 enacted level and $50,000 below the fiscal year 2023 budget request.

PROGRAMS TO REDUCE UNDERAGE DRINKING. (a) Definitions.--For purposes of this section: (1) The term ``alcohol beverage industry'' means the brewers, vintners, distillers, importers, distributors, and retail or online outlets that sell or serve beer, wine, and distilled spirits. (2) The term ``school-based prevention'' means programs, which are institutionalized, and run by staff members or school-designated persons or organizations in any grade of school, kindergarten through 12th grade. (3) The term ``youth'' means persons under the age of 21. (4) The term ``IOM report'' means the report released in September 2003 by the National Research Council, Institute of Medicine, and entitled ``Reducing Underage Drinking: A Collective Responsibility''. (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that: (1) A multi-faceted effort is needed to more successfully address the problem of underage drinking in the United States. A coordinated approach to prevention, intervention, treatment, enforcement, and research is key to making progress. This Act recognizes the need for a focused national effort, and addresses particulars of the Federal portion of that effort, as well as Federal support for State activities. (2) The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall continue to conduct research and collect data on the short and long-range impact of alcohol use and abuse upon adolescent brain development and other organ systems. (3) States and communities, including colleges and universities, are encouraged to adopt comprehensive prevention approaches, including-- (A) evidence-based screening, programs and curricula; (B) brief intervention strategies; (C) consistent policy enforcement; and (D) environmental changes that limit underage access to alcohol. (4) Public health groups, consumer groups, and the alcohol beverage industry should continue and expand evidence-based efforts to prevent and reduce underage drinking. (5) The entertainment industries have a powerful impact on youth, and they should use rating systems and marketing codes to reduce the likelihood that underage audiences will be exposed to movies, recordings, or television programs with unsuitable alcohol content. (6) The National Collegiate Athletic Association, its member colleges and universities, and athletic conferences should affirm a commitment to a policy of discouraging alcohol use among underage students and other young fans. (7) Alcohol is a unique product and should be regulated differently than other products by the States and Federal Government. States have primary authority to regulate alcohol distribution and sale, and the Federal Government should support and supplement these State efforts. States also have a responsibility to fight youth access to alcohol and reduce underage drinking. Continued State regulation and licensing of the manufacture, importation, sale, distribution, transportation and storage of alcoholic beverages are clearly in the public interest and are critical to promoting responsible consumption, preventing illegal access to alcohol by persons under 21 years of age from commercial and non-commercial sources, maintaining industry integrity and an orderly marketplace, and furthering effective State tax collection.

(B) State performance measures.-- (i) In general.--The Secretary shall develop, in consultation with the Committee, a set of measures to be used in preparing the report on best practices.

(iii) Not later than 45 days after the date on which the Secretary receives a notification under subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall make a determination of whether the practitioner involved meets all requirements for a waiver under subparagraph (B) and shall forward such determination to the Attorney General. If the Secretary fails to make such determination by the end of the such 45-day period, the Attorney General shall assign the practitioner an identification number described in clause (ii) at the end of such period. (E)(i) If a practitioner is not registered under paragraph (1) and, in violation of the conditions specified in subparagraphs (B) through (D), dispenses narcotic drugs in schedule III, IV, or V or combinations of such drugs for maintenance treatment or detoxification treatment, the Attorney General may, for purposes of section 304(a)(4), consider the practitioner to have committed an act that renders the registration of the practitioner pursuant to subsection (f) to be inconsistent with the public interest. (ii)(I) Upon the expiration of 45 days from the date on which the Secretary receives a notification under subparagraph (B), a practitioner who in good faith submits a notification under subparagraph (B) and reasonably believes that the conditions specified in subparagraphs (B) through (D) have been met shall, in dispensing narcotic drugs in schedule III, IV, or V or combinations of such drugs for maintenance treatment or detoxification treatment, be considered to have a waiver under subparagraph (A) until notified otherwise by the Secretary, except that such a practitioner may commence to prescribe or dispense such narcotic drugs for such purposes prior to the expiration of such 45-day period if it facilitates the treatment of an individual patient and both the Secretary and the Attorney General are notified by the practitioner of the intent to commence prescribing or dispensing such narcotic drugs. (II) For purposes of subclause (I), the publication in the Federal Register of an adverse determination by the Secretary pursuant to subparagraph (C)(ii) shall (with respect to the narcotic drug or combination involved) be considered to be a notification provided by the Secretary to practitioners, effective upon the expiration of the 30-day period beginning on the date on which the adverse determination is so published. (F)(i) With respect to the dispensing of narcotic drugs in schedule III, IV, or V or combinations of such drugs to patients for maintenance or detoxification treatment, a practitioner may, in his or her discretion, dispense such drugs or combinations for such treatment under a registration under paragraph (1) or a waiver under subparagraph (A) (subject to meeting the applicable conditions). (ii) This paragraph may not be construed as having any legal effect on the conditions for obtaining a registration under paragraph (1), including with respect to the number of patients who may be served under such a registration.

Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this subsection, such term shall not, except for purposes of subsection (a)(2), include any institution which is primarily for the care and treatment of mental diseases unless it is a psychiatric hospital (as defined in subsection (f)). The term ``hospital'' also includes a religious nonmedical health care institution (as defined in subsection (ss)(1)), but only with respect to items and services ordinarily furnished by such institution to inpatients, and payment may be made with respect to services provided by or in such an institution only to such extent and under such conditions, limitations, and requirements (in addition to or in lieu of the conditions, limitations, and requirements otherwise applicable) as may be provided in regulations consistent with section 1821.

Post-Hospital Extended Care Services (i) The term ``post-hospital extended care services'' means extended care services furnished an individual after transfer from a hospital in which he was an inpatient for not less than 3 consecutive days before his discharge from the hospital in connection with such transfer. For purposes of the preceding sentence, items and services shall be deemed to have been furnished to an individual after transfer from a hospital, and he shall be deemed to have been an inpatient in the hospital immediately before transfer therefrom, if he is admitted to the skilled nursing facility (A) within 30 days after discharge from such hospital, or (B) within such time as it would be medically appropriate to begin an active course of treatment, in the case of an individual whose condition is such that skilled nursing facility care would not be medically appropriate within 30 days after discharge from a hospital; and an individual shall be deemed not to have been discharged from a skilled nursing facility if, within 30 days after discharge therefrom, he is admitted to such facility or any other skilled nursing facility. Skilled Nursing Facility (j) The term ``skilled nursing facility'' has the meaning given such term in section 1819(a). Utilization Review (k) A utilization review plan of a hospital or skilled nursing facility shall be considered sufficient if it is applicable to services furnished by the institution to individuals entitled to insurance benefits under this title and if it provides-- (1) for the review, on a sample or other basis, of admissions to the institution, the duration of stays therein, and the professional services (including drugs and biologicals) furnished, (A) with respect to the medical necessity of the services, and (B) for the purpose of promoting the most efficient use of available health facilities and services; (2) for such review to be made by either (A) a staff committee of the institution composed of two or more physicians (of which at least two must be physicians described in subsection (r)(1) of this section), with or without participation of other professional personnel, or (B) a group outside the institution which is similarly composed and (i) which is established by the local medical society and some or all of the hospitals and skilled nursing facilities in the locality, or (ii) if (and for as long as) there has not been established such a group which serves such institution, which is established in such other manner as may be approved by the Secretary; (3) for such review, in each case of inpatient hospital services or extended care services furnished to such an individual during a continuous period of extended duration, as of such days of such period (which may differ for different classes of cases) as may be specified in regulations, with such review to be made as promptly as possible, after each day so specified, and in no event later than one week following such day; and (4) for prompt notification to the institution, the individual, and his attending physician of any finding (made after opportunity for consultation to such attending physician) by the physician members of such committee or group that any further stay in the institution is not medically necessary. The review committee must be composed as provided in clause (B) of paragraph (2) rather than as provided in clause (A) of such paragraph in the case of any hospital or skilled nursing facility where, because of the small size of the institution, or (in the case of a skilled nursing facility) because of lack of an organized medical staff, or for such other reason or reasons as may be included in regulations, it is impracticable for the institution to have a properly functioning staff committee for the purposes of this subsection. If the Secretary determines that the utilization review procedures established pursuant to title XIX are superior in their effectiveness to the procedures required under this section, he may, to the extent that he deems it appropriate, require for purposes of this title that the procedures established pursuant to title XIX be utilized instead of the procedures required by this section. Agreements for Transfer Between Skilled Nursing Facilities and Hospitals (l) A hospital and a skilled nursing facility shall be considered to have a transfer agreement in effect if, by reason of a written agreement between them or (in case the two institutions are under common control) by reason of a written undertaking by the person or body which controls them, there is reasonable assurance that-- (1) transfer of patients will be effected between the hospital and the skilled nursing facility whenever such transfer is medically appropriate as determined by the attending physician; and (2) there will be interchange of medical and other information necessary or useful in the care and treatment of individuals transferred between the institutions, or in determining whether such individuals can be adequately cared for otherwise than in either of such institutions. Any skilled nursing facility which does not have such an agreement in effect, but which is found by a State agency (of the State in which such facility is situated) with which an agreement under section 1864 is in effect (or, in the case of a State in which no such agency has an agreement under section 1864, by the Secretary) to have attempted in good faith to enter into such an agreement with a hospital sufficiently close to the facility to make feasible the transfer between them of patients and the information referred to in paragraph (2), shall be considered to have such an agreement in effect if and for so long as such agency (or the Secretary, as the case may be) finds that to do so is in the public interest and essential to assuring extended care services for persons in the community who are eligible for payments with respect to such services under this title. Home Health Services (m) The term ``home health services'' means the following items and services furnished to an individual, who is under the care of a physician, a nurse practitioner or a clinical nurse specialist (as those terms are defined in subsection (aa)(5)), or a physician assistant (as defined in subsection (aa)(5)), by a home health agency or by others under arrangements with them made by such agency, under a plan (for furnishing such items and services to such individual) established and periodically reviewed by a physician, a nurse practitioner, a clinical nurse specialist, or a physician assistant, which items and services are, except as provided in paragraph (7), provided on a visiting basis in a place of residence used as such individual's home-- (1) part-time or intermittent nursing care provided by or under the supervision of a registered professional nurse; (2) physical or occupational therapy or speech- language pathology services; (3) medical social services under the direction of a physician, a nurse practitioner, a clinical nurse specialist, or a physician assistant; (4) to the extent permitted in regulations, part-time or intermittent services of a home health aide who has successfully completed a training program approved by the Secretary; (5) medical supplies (including catheters, catheter supplies, ostomy bags, and supplies related to ostomy care, and a covered osteoporosis drug (as defined in subsection (kk)), but excluding other drugs and biologicals) and durable medical equipment and applicable disposable devices (as defined in section 1834(s)(2)) while under such a plan; (6) in the case of a home health agency which is affiliated or under common control with a hospital, medical services provided by an intern or resident-in- training of such hospital, under a teaching program of such hospital approved as provided in the last sentence of subsection (b); and (7) any of the foregoing items and services which are provided on an outpatient basis, under arrangements made by the home health agency, at a hospital or skilled nursing facility, or at a rehabilitation center which meets such standards as may be prescribed in regulations, and-- (A) the furnishing of which involves the use of equipment of such a nature that the items and services cannot readily be made available to the individual in such place of residence, or (B) which are furnished at such facility while he is there to receive any such item or service described in clause (A), but not including transportation of the individual in connection with any such item or service; excluding, however, any item or service if it would not be included under subsection (b) if furnished to an inpatient of a hospital and home infusion therapy (as defined in subsection (iii)(i)). For purposes of paragraphs (1) and (4), the term ``part-time or intermittent services'' means skilled nursing and home health aide services furnished any number of days per week as long as they are furnished (combined) less than 8 hours each day and 28 or fewer hours each week (or, subject to review on a case-by-case basis as to the need for care, less than 8 hours each day and 35 or fewer hours per week). For purposes of sections 1814(a)(2)(C) and 1835(a)(2)(A), ``intermittent'' means skilled nursing care that is either provided or needed on fewer than 7 days each week, or less than 8 hours of each day for periods of 21 days or less (with extensions in exceptional circumstances when the need for additional care is finite and predictable). Durable Medical Equipment (n) The term ``durable medical equipment'' includes iron lungs, oxygen tents, hospital beds, and wheelchairs (which may include a power-operated vehicle that may be appropriately used as a wheelchair, but only where the use of such a vehicle is determined to be necessary on the basis of the individual's medical and physical condition and the vehicle meets such safety requirements as the Secretary may prescribe) used in the patient's home (including an institution used as his home other than an institution that meets the requirements of subsection (e)(1) of this section or section 1819(a)(1)), whether furnished on a rental basis or purchased, and includes blood- testing strips and blood glucose monitors for individuals with diabetes without regard to whether the individual has Type I or Type II diabetes or to the individual's use of insulin (as determined under standards established by the Secretary in consultation with the appropriate organizations) and eye tracking and gaze interaction accessories for speech generating devices furnished to individuals with a demonstrated medical need for such accessories; except that such term does not include such equipment furnished by a supplier who has used, for the demonstration and use of specific equipment, an individual who has not met such minimum training standards as the Secretary may establish with respect to the demonstration and use of such specific equipment.

In addition, such term includes physical therapy services which meet the requirements of the first sentence of this subsection except that they are furnished to an individual as an inpatient of a hospital or extended care facility. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as requiring, with respect to outpatients who are not entitled to benefits under this title, a physical therapist to provide outpatient physical therapy services only to outpatients who are under the care of a physician or pursuant to a plan of care established by a physician. The Secretary may waive the requirement of a surety bond under paragraph (4)(A)(v) in the case of a clinic or agency that provides a comparable surety bond under State law.

No diagnostic tests performed in any laboratory, including a laboratory that is part of a rural health clinic, or a hospital (which, for purposes of this sentence, means an institution considered a hospital for purposes of section 1814(d)) shall be included within paragraph (3) unless such laboratory-- (16) if situated in any State in which State or applicable local law provides for licensing of establishments of this nature, (A) is licensed pursuant to such law, or (B) is approved, by the agency of such State or locality responsible for licensing establishments of this nature, as meeting the standards established for such licensing; and (17)(A) meets the certification requirements under section 353 of the Public Health Service Act; and (B) meets such other conditions relating to the health and safety of individuals with respect to whom such tests are performed as the Secretary may find necessary.

None of the items and services referred to in the preceding paragraphs (other than paragraphs (1) and (2)(A)) of this subsection which are furnished to a patient of an institution which meets the definition of a hospital for purposes of section 1814(d) shall be included unless such other conditions are met as the Secretary may find necessary relating to health and safety of individuals with respect to whom such items and services are furnished. Drugs and Biologicals (t)(1) The term ``drugs'' and the term ``biologicals'', except for purposes of subsection (m)(5) and paragraph (2), include only such drugs (including contrast agents) and biologicals, respectively, as are included (or approved for inclusion) in the United States Pharmacopoeia, the National Formulary, or the United States Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia, or in New Drugs or Accepted Dental Remedies (except for any drugs and biologicals unfavorably evaluated therein), or as are approved by the pharmacy and drug therapeutics committee (or equivalent committee) of the medical staff of the hospital furnishing such drugs and biologicals for use in such hospital. (2)(A) For purposes of paragraph (1), the term ``drugs'' also includes any drugs or biologicals used in an anticancer chemotherapeutic regimen for a medically accepted indication (as described in subparagraph (B)). (B) In subparagraph (A), the term ``medically accepted indication'', with respect to the use of a drug, includes any use which has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the drug, and includes another use of the drug if-- (i) the drug has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration; and (ii)(I) such use is supported by one or more citations which are included (or approved for inclusion) in one or more of the following compendia: the American Hospital Formulary Service-Drug Information, the American Medical Association Drug Evaluations, the United States Pharmacopoeia-Drug Information (or its successor publications), and other authoritative compendia as identified by the Secretary, unless the Secretary has determined that the use is not medically appropriate or the use is identified as not indicated in one or more such compendia, or (II) the carrier involved determines, based upon guidance provided by the Secretary to carriers for determining accepted uses of drugs, that such use is medically accepted based on supportive clinical evidence in peer reviewed medical literature appearing in publications which have been identified for purposes of this subclause by the Secretary. The Secretary may revise the list of compendia in clause (ii)(I) as is appropriate for identifying medically accepted indications for drugs. On and after January 1, 2010, no compendia may be included on the list of compendia under this subparagraph unless the compendia has a publicly transparent process for evaluating therapies and for identifying potential conflicts of interests. Provider of Services (u) The term ``provider of services'' means a hospital, critical access hospital, rural emergency hospital, skilled nursing facility, comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facility, home health agency, hospice program, or, for purposes of section 1814(g) and section 1835(e), a fund. Reasonable Cost (v)(1)(A) The reasonable cost of any services shall be the cost actually incurred, excluding therefrom any part of incurred cost found to be unnecessary in the efficient delivery of needed health services, and shall be determined in accordance with regulations establishing the method or methods to be used, and the items to be included, in determining such costs for various types or classes of institutions, agencies, and services; except that in any case to which paragraph (2) or (3) applies, the amount of the payment determined under such paragraph with respect to the services involved shall be considered the reasonable cost of such services. In prescribing the regulations referred to in the preceding sentence, the Secretary shall consider, among other things, the principles generally applied by national organizations or established prepayment organizations (which have developed such principles) in computing the amount of payment, to be made by persons other than the recipients of services, to providers of services on account of services furnished to such recipients by such providers. Such regulations may provide for determination of the costs of services on a per diem, per unit, per capita, or other basis, may provide for using different methods in different circumstances, may provide for the use of estimates of costs of particular items or services, may provide for the establishment of limits on the direct or indirect overall incurred costs or incurred costs of specific items or services or groups of items or services to be recognized as reasonable based on estimates of the costs necessary in the efficient delivery of needed health services to individuals covered by the insurance programs established under this title, and may provide for the use of charges or a percentage of charges where this method reasonably reflects the costs. Such regulations shall (i) take into account both direct and indirect costs of providers of services (excluding therefrom any such costs, including standby costs, which are determined in accordance with regulations to be unnecessary in the efficient delivery of services covered by the insurance programs established under this title) in order that, under the methods of determining costs, the necessary costs of efficiently delivering covered services to individuals covered by the insurance programs established by this title will not be borne by individuals not so covered, and the costs with respect to individuals not so covered will not be borne by such insurance programs, and (ii) provide for the making of suitable retroactive corrective adjustments where, for a provider of services for any fiscal period, the aggregate reimbursement produced by the methods of determining costs proves to be either inadequate or excessive. (B) In the case of extended care services, the regulations under subparagraph (A) shall not include provision for specific recognition of a return on equity capital. (C) Where a hospital has an arrangement with a medical school under which the faculty of such school provides services at such hospital, an amount not in excess of the reasonable cost of such services to the medical school shall be included in determining the reasonable cost to the hospital of furnishing services-- (i) for which payment may be made under part A, but only if-- (I) payment for such services as furnished under such arrangement would be made under part A to the hospital had such services been furnished by the hospital, and (II) such hospital pays to the medical school at least the reasonable cost of such services to the medical school, or (ii) for which payment may be made under part B, but only if such hospital pays to the medical school at least the reasonable cost of such services to the medical school. (D) Where (i) physicians furnish services which are either inpatient hospital services (including services in conjunction with the teaching programs of such hospital) by reason of paragraph (7) of subsection (b) or for which entitlement exists by reason of clause (II) of section 1832(a)(2)(B)(i), and (ii) such hospital (or medical school under arrangement with such hospital) incurs no actual cost in the furnishing of such services, the reasonable cost of such services shall (under regulations of the Secretary) be deemed to be the cost such hospital or medical school would have incurred had it paid a salary to such physicians rendering such services approximately equivalent to the average salary paid to all physicians employed by such hospital (or if such employment does not exist, or is minimal in such hospital, by similar hospitals in a geographic area of sufficient size to assure reasonable inclusion of sufficient physicians in development of such average salary). (E) Such regulations may, in the case of skilled nursing facilities in any State, provide for the use of rates, developed by the State in which such facilities are located, for the payment of the cost of skilled nursing facility services furnished under the State's plan approved under title XIX (and such rates may be increased by the Secretary on a class or size of institution or on a geographical basis by a percentage factor not in excess of 10 percent to take into account determinable items or services or other requirements under this title not otherwise included in the computation of such State rates), if the Secretary finds that such rates are reasonably related to (but not necessarily limited to) analyses undertaken by such State of costs of care in comparable facilities in such State. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, such regulations with respect to skilled nursing facilities shall take into account (in a manner consistent with subparagraph (A) and based on patient-days of services furnished) the costs (including the costs of services required to attain or maintain the highest practicable physical, mental, and psychosocial well-being of each resident eligible for benefits under this title) of such facilities complying with the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of section 1819 (including the costs of conducting nurse aide training and competency evaluation programs and competency evaluation programs). (F) Such regulations shall require each provider of services (other than a fund) to make reports to the Secretary of information described in section 1121(a) in accordance with the uniform reporting system (established under such section) for that type of provider. (G)(i) In any case in which a hospital provides inpatient services to an individual that would constitute post-hospital extended care services if provided by a skilled nursing facility and a quality improvement organization (or, in the absence of such a qualified organization, the Secretary or such agent as the Secretary may designate) determines that inpatient hospital services for the individual are not medically necessary but post-hospital extended care services for the individual are medically necessary and such extended care services are not otherwise available to the individual (as determined in accordance with criteria established by the Secretary) at the time of such determination, payment for such services provided to the individual shall continue to be made under this title at the payment rate described in clause (ii) during the period in which-- (I) such post-hospital extended care services for the individual are medically necessary and not otherwise available to the individual (as so determined), (II) inpatient hospital services for the individual are not medically necessary, and (III) the individual is entitled to have payment made for post-hospital extended care services under this title, except that if the Secretary determines that there is not an excess of hospital beds in such hospital and (subject to clause (iv)) there is not an excess of hospital beds in the area of such hospital, such payment shall be made (during such period) on the basis of the amount otherwise payable under part A with respect to inpatient hospital services. (ii)(I) Except as provided in subclause (II), the payment rate referred to in clause (i) is a rate equal to the estimated adjusted State-wide average rate per patient-day paid for services provided in skilled nursing facilities under the State plan approved under title XIX for the State in which such hospital is located, or, if the State in which the hospital is located does not have a State plan approved under title XIX, the estimated adjusted State-wide average allowable costs per patient-day for extended care services under this title in that State. (II) If a hospital has a unit which is a skilled nursing facility, the payment rate referred to in clause (i) for the hospital is a rate equal to the lesser of the rate described in subclause (I) or the allowable costs in effect under this title for extended care services provided to patients of such unit. (iii) Any day on which an individual receives inpatient services for which payment is made under this subparagraph shall, for purposes of this Act (other than this subparagraph), be deemed to be a day on which the individual received inpatient hospital services. (iv) In determining under clause (i), in the case of a public hospital, whether or not there is an excess of hospital beds in the area of such hospital, such determination shall be made on the basis of only the public hospitals (including the hospital) which are in the area of the hospital and which are under common ownership with that hospital. (H) In determining such reasonable cost with respect to home health agencies, the Secretary may not include-- (i) any costs incurred in connection with bonding or establishing an escrow account by any such agency as a result of the surety bond requirement described in subsection (o)(7) and the financial security requirement described in subsection (o)(8); (ii) in the case of home health agencies to which the surety bond requirement described in subsection (o)(7) and the financial security requirement described in subsection (o)(8) apply, any costs attributed to interest charged such an agency in connection with amounts borrowed by the agency to repay overpayments made under this title to the agency, except that such costs may be included in reasonable cost if the Secretary determines that the agency was acting in good faith in borrowing the amounts; (iii) in the case of contracts entered into by a home health agency after the date of the enactment of this subparagraph for the purpose of having services furnished for or on behalf of such agency, any cost incurred by such agency pursuant to any such contract which is entered into for a period exceeding five years; and (iv) in the case of contracts entered into by a home health agency before the date of the enactment of this subparagraph for the purpose of having services furnished for or on behalf of such agency, any cost incurred by such agency pursuant to any such contract, which determines the amount payable by the home health agency on the basis of a percentage of the agency's reimbursement or claim for reimbursement for services furnished by the agency, to the extent that such cost exceeds the reasonable value of the services furnished on behalf of such agency. (I) In determining such reasonable cost, the Secretary may not include any costs incurred by a provider with respect to any services furnished in connection with matters for which payment may be made under this title and furnished pursuant to a contract between the provider and any of its subcontractors which is entered into after the date of the enactment of this subparagraph and the value or cost of which is $10,000 or more over a twelve-month period unless the contract contains a clause to the effect that-- (i) until the expiration of four years after the furnishing of such services pursuant to such contract, the subcontractor shall make available, upon written request by the Secretary, or upon request by the Comptroller General, or any of their duly authorized representatives, the contract, and books, documents and records of such subcontractor that are necessary to certify the nature and extent of such costs, and (ii) if the subcontractor carries out any of the duties of the contract through a subcontract, with a value or cost of $10,000 or more over a twelve-month period, with a related organization, such subcontract shall contain a clause to the effect that until the expiration of four years after the furnishing of such services pursuant to such subcontract, the related organization shall make available, upon written request by the Secretary, or upon request by the Comptroller General, or any of their duly authorized representatives, the subcontract, and books, documents and records of such organization that are necessary to verify the nature and extent of such costs. The Secretary shall prescribe in regulation criteria and procedures which the Secretary shall use in obtaining access to books, documents, and records under clauses required in contracts and subcontracts under this subparagraph. (J) Such regulations may not provide for any inpatient routine salary cost differential as a reimbursable cost for hospitals and skilled nursing facilities. (K)(i) The Secretary shall issue regulations that provide, to the extent feasible, for the establishment of limitations on the amount of any costs or charges that shall be considered reasonable with respect to services provided on an outpatient basis by hospitals (other than bona fide emergency services as defined in clause (ii)) or clinics (other than rural health clinics), which are reimbursed on a cost basis or on the basis of cost related charges, and by physicians utilizing such outpatient facilities. Such limitations shall be reasonably related to the charges in the same area for similar services provided in physicians' offices. Such regulations shall provide for exceptions to such limitations in cases where similar services are not generally available in physicians' offices in the area to individuals entitled to benefits under this title. (ii) For purposes of clause (i), the term ``bona fide emergency services'' means services provided in a hospital emergency room after the sudden onset of a medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) such that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in-- (I) placing the patient's health in serious jeopardy; (II) serious impairment to bodily functions; or (III) serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part. (L)(i) The Secretary, in determining the amount of the payments that may be made under this title with respect to services furnished by home health agencies, may not recognize as reasonable (in the efficient delivery of such services) costs for the provision of such services by an agency to the extent these costs exceed (on the aggregate for the agency) for cost reporting periods beginning on or after-- (I) July 1, 1985, and before July 1, 1986, 120 percent of the mean of the labor-related and nonlabor per visit costs for freestanding home health agencies, (II) July 1, 1986, and before July 1, 1987, 115 percent of such mean, (III) July 1, 1987, and before October 1, 1997, 112 percent of such mean, (IV) October 1, 1997, and before October 1, 1998, 105 percent of the median of the labor-related and nonlabor per visit costs for freestanding home health agencies, or (V) October 1, 1998, 106 percent of such median. (ii) Effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 1986, such limitations shall be applied on an aggregate basis for the agency, rather than on a discipline specific basis. The Secretary may provide for such exemptions and exceptions to such limitation as he deems appropriate. (iii) Not later than July 1, 1991, and annually thereafter (but not for cost reporting periods beginning on or after July 1, 1994, and before July 1, 1996, or on or after July 1, 1997, and before October 1, 1997), the Secretary shall establish limits under this subparagraph for cost reporting periods beginning on or after such date by utilizing the area wage index applicable under section 1886(d)(3)(E) and determined using the survey of the most recent available wages and wage- related costs of hospitals located in the geographic area in which the home health service is furnished (determined without regard to whether such hospitals have been reclassified to a new geographic area pursuant to section 1886(d)(8)(B), a decision of the Medicare Geographic Classification Review Board under section 1886(d)(10), or a decision of the Secretary). (iv) In establishing limits under this subparagraph for cost reporting periods beginning after September 30, 1997, the Secretary shall not take into account any changes in the home health market basket, as determined by the Secretary, with respect to cost reporting periods which began on or after July 1, 1994, and before July 1, 1996. (v) For services furnished by home health agencies for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1997, subject to clause (viii)(I), the Secretary shall provide for an interim system of limits. Payment shall not exceed the costs determined under the preceding provisions of this subparagraph or, if lower, the product of-- (I) an agency-specific per beneficiary annual limitation calculated based 75 percent on 98 percent of the reasonable costs (including nonroutine medical supplies) for the agency's 12-month cost reporting period ending during fiscal year 1994, and based 25 percent on 98 percent of the standardized regional average of such costs for the agency's census division, as applied to such agency, for cost reporting periods ending during fiscal year 1994, such costs updated by the home health market basket index; and (II) the agency's unduplicated census count of patients (entitled to benefits under this title) for the cost reporting period subject to the limitation. (vi) For services furnished by home health agencies for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1997, the following rules apply: (I) For new providers and those providers without a 12-month cost reporting period ending in fiscal year 1994 subject to clauses (viii)(II) and (viii)(III), the per beneficiary limitation shall be equal to the median of these limits (or the Secretary's best estimates thereof) applied to other home health agencies as determined by the Secretary. A home health agency that has altered its corporate structure or name shall not be considered a new provider for this purpose. (II) For beneficiaries who use services furnished by more than one home health agency, the per beneficiary limitations shall be prorated among the agencies. (vii)(I) Not later than January 1, 1998, the Secretary shall establish per visit limits applicable for fiscal year 1998, and not later than April 1, 1998, the Secretary shall establish per beneficiary limits under clause (v)(I) for fiscal year 1998. (II) Not later than August 1 of each year (beginning in 1998) the Secretary shall establish the limits applicable under this subparagraph for services furnished during the fiscal year beginning October 1 of the year. (viii)(I) In the case of a provider with a 12-month cost reporting period ending in fiscal year 1994, if the limit imposed under clause (v) (determined without regard to this subclause) for a cost reporting period beginning during or after fiscal year 1999 is less than the median described in clause (vi)(I) (but determined as if any reference in clause (v) to ``98 percent'' were a reference to ``100 percent''), the limit otherwise imposed under clause (v) for such provider and period shall be increased by \\1/3\\ of such difference. (II) Subject to subclause (IV), for new providers and those providers without a 12-month cost reporting period ending in fiscal year 1994, but for which the first cost reporting period begins before fiscal year 1999, for cost reporting periods beginning during or after fiscal year 1999, the per beneficiary limitation described in clause (vi)(I) shall be equal to the median described in such clause (determined as if any reference in clause (v) to ``98 percent'' were a reference to ``100 percent''). (III) Subject to subclause (IV), in the case of a new provider for which the first cost reporting period begins during or after fiscal year 1999, the limitation applied under clause (vi)(I) (but only with respect to such provider) shall be equal to 75 percent of the median described in clause (vi)(I). (IV) In the case of a new provider or a provider without a 12-month cost reporting period ending in fiscal year 1994, subclause (II) shall apply, instead of subclause (III), to a home health agency which filed an application for home health agency provider status under this title before September 15, 1998, or which was approved as a branch of its parent agency before such date and becomes a subunit of the parent agency or a separate agency on or after such date. (V) Each of the amounts specified in subclauses (I) through (III) are such amounts as adjusted under clause (iii) to reflect variations in wages among different areas. (ix) Notwithstanding the per beneficiary limit under clause (viii), if the limit imposed under clause (v) (determined without regard to this clause) for a cost reporting period beginning during or after fiscal year 2000 is less than the median described in clause (vi)(I) (but determined as if any reference in clause (v) to ``98 percent'' were a reference to ``100 percent''), the limit otherwise imposed under clause (v) for such provider and period shall be increased by 2 percent. (x) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subparagraph, in updating any limit under this subparagraph by a home health market basket index for cost reporting periods beginning during each of fiscal years 2000, 2002, and 2003, the update otherwise provided shall be reduced by 1.1 percentage points. With respect to cost reporting periods beginning during fiscal year 2001, the update to any limit under this subparagraph shall be the home health market basket index. (M) Such regulations shall provide that costs respecting care provided by a provider of services, pursuant to an assurance under title VI or XVI of the Public Health Service Act that the provider will make available a reasonable volume of services to persons unable to pay therefor, shall not be allowable as reasonable costs. (N) In determining such reasonable costs, costs incurred for activities directly related to influencing employees respecting unionization may not be included. (O)(i) In establishing an appropriate allowance for depreciation and for interest on capital indebtedness with respect to an asset of a provider of services which has undergone a change of ownership, such regulations shall provide, except as provided in clause (iii), that the valuation of the asset after such change of ownership shall be the historical cost of the asset, as recognized under this title, less depreciation allowed, to the owner of record as of the date of enactment of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (or, in the case of an asset not in existence as of that date, the first owner of record of the asset after that date). (ii) Such regulations shall not recognize, as reasonable in the provision of health care services, costs (including legal fees, accounting and administrative costs, travel costs, and the costs of feasibility studies) attributable to the negotiation or settlement of the sale or purchase of any capital asset (by acquisition or merger) for which any payment has previously been made under this title. (iii) In the case of the transfer of a hospital from ownership by a State to ownership by a nonprofit corporation without monetary consideration, the basis for capital allowances to the new owner shall be the book value of the hospital to the State at the time of the transfer. (P) If such regulations provide for the payment for a return on equity capital (other than with respect to costs of inpatient hospital services), the rate of return to be recognized, for determining the reasonable cost of services furnished in a cost reporting period, shall be equal to the average of the rates of interest, for each of the months any part of which is included in the period, on obligations issued for purchase by the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. (Q) Except as otherwise explicitly authorized, the Secretary is not authorized to limit the rate of increase on allowable costs of approved medical educational activities.

(ii) A provider described in this clause is a provider of services not described in subparagraph (T) or (V), a supplier, or any other type of entity that receives payment for bad debts under the authority under subparagraph (A). (2)(A) If the bed and board furnished as part of inpatient hospital services (including inpatient tuberculosis hospital services and inpatient psychiatric hospital services) or post- hospital extended care services is in accommodations more expensive than semi-private accommodations, the amount taken into account for purposes of payment under this title with respect to such services may not exceed the amount that would be taken into account with respect to such services if furnished in such semi-private accommodations unless the more expensive accommodations were required for medical reasons. (B) Where a provider of services which has an agreement in effect under this title furnishes to an individual items or services which are in excess of or more expensive than the items or services with respect to which payment may be made under part A or part B, as the case may be, the Secretary shall take into account for purposes of payment to such provider of services only the items or services with respect to which such payment may be made. (3) If the bed and board furnished as part of inpatient hospital services (including inpatient tuberculosis hospital services and inpatient psychiatric hospital services) or post- hospital extended care services is in accommodations other than, but not more expensive than, semi-private accommodations and the use of such other accommodations rather than semi- private accommodations was neither at the request of the patient nor for a reason which the Secretary determines is consistent with the purposes of this title, the amount of the payment with respect to such bed and board under part A shall be the amount otherwise payable under this title for such bed and board furnished in semi-private accommodations minus the difference between the charge customarily made by the hospital or skilled nursing facility for bed and board in semi-private accommodations and the charge customarily made by it for bed and board in the accommodations furnished. (4) If a provider of services furnishes items or services to an individual which are in excess of or more expensive than the items or services determined to be necessary in the efficient delivery of needed health services and charges are imposed for such more expensive items or services under the authority granted in section 1866(a)(2)(B)(ii), the amount of payment with respect to such items or services otherwise due such provider in any fiscal period shall be reduced to the extent that such payment plus such charges exceed the cost actually incurred for such items or services in the fiscal period in which such charges are imposed. (5)(A) Where physical therapy services, occupational therapy services, speech therapy services, or other therapy services or services of other health-related personnel (other than physicians) are furnished under an arrangement with a provider of services or other organization, specified in the first sentence of subsection (p) (including through the operation of subsection (g)) the amount included in any payment to such provider or other organization under this title as the reasonable cost of such services (as furnished under such arrangements) shall not exceed an amount equal to the salary which would reasonably have been paid for such services (together with any additional costs that would have been incurred by the provider or other organization) to the person performing them if they had been performed in an employment relationship with such provider or other organization (rather than under such arrangement) plus the cost of such other expenses (including a reasonable allowance for traveltime and other reasonable types of expense related to any differences in acceptable methods of organization for the provision of such therapy) incurred by such person, as the Secretary may in regulations determine to be appropriate. (B) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (A), if a provider of services or other organization specified in the first sentence of section 1861(p) requires the services of a therapist on a limited part-time basis, or only to perform intermittent services, the Secretary may make payment on the basis of a reasonable rate per unit of service, even though such rate is greater per unit of time than salary related amounts, where he finds that such greater payment is, in the aggregate, less than the amount that would have been paid if such organization had employed a therapist on a full- or part- time salary basis. (6) For purposes of this subsection, the term ``semi-private accommodations'' means two-bed, three-bed, or four-bed accommodations. (7)(A) For limitation on Federal participation for capital expenditures which are out of conformity with a comprehensive plan of a State or areawide planning agency, see section 1122.

Consistent with the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, in the House of Representatives such amounts do not count against the Committee's allocation. In addition, the amounts in this report do not include $1,085 million in discretionary budget authority and $561 million in associated outlays provided for the purposes specified in the 21st Century Cures Act (Public Law 114-255). Pursuant to title I of that Act, such funding does not count for the purposes of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 or the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. In addition, consistent with the funding recommended in the bill for program integrity initiatives, in accordance with the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and subsections (h), (i), and (j) of section 1 of H. Res. 1151 (117th Congress), and after the bill is reported to the House, the chair of the Committee on the Budget will provide a revised section 302(a) allocation reflecting an additional $2,345 million in discretionary budget authority and $,1892 million in associated outlays for those recommended amounts. That new allocation will eliminate the technical difference prior to floor consideration.

MINORITY VIEWS We appreciate the efforts of the Majority in producing a Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies (Labor-HHS) Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2023 that funds priorities of Members on both sides of the aisle. We were pleased the Committee adopted an amendment proposed by a Republican Member that maintains enforcement of Title 42, an important public health policy used at our Nation's borders, until the Administration provides a plan for its safe removal. We were also pleased the Majority included language proposed by Republicans, which ensures taxpayer money cannot be used to purchase crack pipes for consuming illegal substances and ensures taxpayer money will not go to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, or any other laboratory located in a country determined by the Secretary of State to be a foreign adversary, including China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran. These common sense funding restrictions improved this bill, and we are hopeful they will be retained in the final package. Despite the many good programs supported in the bill, Republicans are unanimous in our opposition to this measure. It is simply too extreme and out of step with the American people. First, the bill provides a hefty 14 percent, nearly $30 billion, increase in funding over current levels. The price tag alone is unrealistic, revealing radical left-wing spending priorities and a total disregard for fiscal responsibility. While American families are experiencing the highest inflation rates and consumer prices seen in four decades, the Majority has chosen to exacerbate these problems by dumping millions of dollars into new, unauthorized social programs. Another reason we oppose this radical measure is the Majority's removal of the Hyde Amendment, which protects life and prevents federal taxpayer-funded abortions. Since it was first enacted in 1976, it is estimated this provision has saved more than two million lives while protecting the conscience rights of the great majority of Americans who are opposed to publicly funded abortions for religious, moral, or fiscal reasons. Republicans offered an amendment in Committee to reinstate this important protection for all Americans. The amendment was cosponsored by every Republican on the Committee, and this language must be reinstated to complete work on a final spending bill. The amendment also sought to continue longstanding protections for healthcare workers who refuse to participate directly in abortions against their own moral beliefs and consciences. Disappointingly, the Majority rejected an amendment to reinstate the Hyde/Weldon language in Committee. Beyond these extreme positions, the bill includes many other troubling policies and provisions. Amendments were offered by Republican Members to: stop new regulations proposed by the Biden Administration that will make it difficult for charter schools to operate; strike language that limits apprenticeship programs to only those run by labor unions; prevent the Biden Administration from authorizing en-masse cancellation of student loan debt that will only exacerbate our economic problems; prohibit the development, administration, or enforcement of new rules that mandate COVID-19 vaccination; and prohibit the Administration from declaring a public health emergency under the guise of imposing restrictions on second amendment rights. Unfortunately, each of these amendments were defeated by the Majority in Committee. Long-standing language should be retained and poison pills must be removed to achieve a final bipartisan spending deal. We urge the Majority to abandon their pursuit of radical, extremist views and move back toward the bipartisan compromise they know is necessary to fund the government. We are hopeful that in the weeks ahead, we will be able to address both the policy and funding issues, including reinstatement of the bipartisan Hyde/Weldon language. Without this, these spending bills will not become law. Our goal should be to avoid a long-term continuing resolution and build on the good progress we have made in the past by working together.
