Healing practices, such as those that include herbal knowledge and the customs associated with locating, preparing, and administering plant medicine, are one of the first practices learned by initiates. Midewiwin narratives and songs also encompass those associated with healing, including locating and respectfully harvesting plant medicine. Song and narrative are integral parts of the ceremonies performed by the Midewiwin. These songs are accompanied by the playing of the water drum, which is central to Midewiwin ceremonies. Dances are also often performed during the various Midewiwin ceremonies. Initiation Ceremony The songs and stories are also part of the initiatory process, in which candidates spend a year learning the songs, narratives, and practices of the Midewiwin before being initiated into the medicine society. The teaching of these songs and stories draws from the use of birch bark scrolls, which represent the teaching pictorially. In their training process, they are also taught about the properties and significance of various ritual items used in Midewiwin practice, such as the water drum, the rattle, the medicine bundle, and the megis shell. The birch bark scrolls, made from bark like that depicted here, are passed down through generations. | | The initiation ceremony is open to the public and lasts several days. It traditionally includes the initiate holding a feast for the Midewiwin and bringing gifts such as tobacco as offerings and symbols of their dedication to the path. The initiate is also expected to participate in a sweat lodge, followed by a procession to the Midewigaan (the Midewiwin Lodge), where they are shown around. After this procession to and around the Midewigaan, the initiate is said to be \"shot\" by his acquired midewayaan, the medicine bundle, traditionally consisting of an otter's pelt and filled with various sacred items, including the megis shell. After this, a feast was held, and then stories about the origin of the Midewiwin were told, and the newly initiated Mide sang his own song. Other Ceremonies The initiation ceremony is one of the most well-documented by anthropologists. However, there are many other ceremonies performed by the Midewiwin that are integral to Anishinaabe cultural practice and community life. Some of these include the naming ceremony. This is when one of the Mide, who has been asked to choose the name of a newborn, presents this name to the community. It's said that this naming ceremony introduces the child to the Spirit World, whereas prior to being named in this way, the child wouldn't be identifiable to the Spirits. During the ceremony, tobacco is burned, and four women and four men are asked to be sponsors for the child, therefore agreeing to be part of their lives by guiding them. Other ceremonies performed by the Midewiwin are marriage and funerary rituals. They are also responsible for seasonal ceremonies, which bring the whole community together for feasts and customs associated with each season. Additionally, the initiation of new members and the spring ceremony coincide. As the facilitators of spiritual and healing rituals, the Midewiwin hold various ceremonies, such as those of the sweat lodges. The sweat lodge acts as a purification ritual and is a sacred practice. The lodge is constructed so that there are four doorways corresponding to the four directions, but only the western doorway can be used by the facilitator and participants; the rest are reserved for spirits. Other healing rituals vary according to the requirements of the patient. However, these also include dances and songs, which are accompanied by the preparation and administration of herbal medicines. These healing rituals are not to be confused with the shaking tipi rituals performed by jisaakii (\"tipi-shakers\"). These are said to be administered to those amidst psychological crises and are performed by the jisaakii. While it's possible that a jisaakii might also be initiated into the Midewiwin, it's rare for a person to be both a Mide and a jisaakii. Midewiwin Lodge The structure of the Midewiwin Lodge is deeply important. Each of its features has a significance, and the arrangement of ceremonial objects as well as the people within it is carefully planned. Like other features of the medicine society, the construction and internal features of the lodge have been passed down through generations. Built in a long corridor, the arrangement of the lodge is from east to west, with a doorway on either end. This is to represent the trajectory of the sun. The lodge itself is typically constructed of a frame of maple saplings, with the upper portion left open to the sky. The sides of the lodge are covered with other plants, such as balsam and spruce. This depiction of the lodge comes from an older ethnographic source. The lodge typically has a rounded structure different from that seen here. | | Water is placed inside the lodge next to the doorway. Also found inside the lodge are a fire pit and a water drum. The megis shell may also be placed next to the doorway of the lodge. The various clans represented within the Anishinaabe have different positions within the Midewiwin lodge, for example, with some acting as guards. As the center of spiritual and social development as well as a source of healing, the Midewiwin Lodge is where the Anishinaabe people gather to develop their wisdom and understanding of their place in creation. Each of its elements represents different ties to the natural world, from the water and the water drum to the structure of the lodge itself. The Midewiwin Lodge is where these people strengthen their understanding of their place in the natural world and their history and traditional knowledge. Structure of the Midewiwin There are various stages in the development of traditional knowledge within the medicine society. These are often referred to as the different degrees within the Midewiwin. Depending on the tribe or on the particular Midewiwin, there are either four or eight different degrees of the Mide. Becoming an initiate is the first degree, and this is the stage at which one learns about the traditional songs and narratives as well as various herbal healing practices. As a member advances through the different degrees, they are required to perform new initiation rituals and acquire ever more spiritual and healing knowledge. The exact character of each of the different degrees is not clear, but those who have attained the higher degrees are considered to have reached higher states of spiritual knowledge and wisdom. When members are initiated into a higher degree within the Midewiwin, they receive a new medicine bag. The skin used to make the bag represents their new station, with the otter typically associated with the first station and the bear paw associated with the second, for example. Lesson Summary The Midewiwin is a sacred and traditional medicine society of various Algonquian-speaking indigenous tribes associated with the Great Lakes region. The Midewiwin is responsible for maintaining many significant social, spiritual, and healing practices of the tribe. Practitioners of this traditional knowledge, called Mide, are keepers of both healing knowledge and spiritual wisdom associated with the tribe's long history and relationship with the natural world. Many of the teachings and stories associated with the Midewiwin are said to have originated with Nanabozho, a cultural hero who is deeply embedded in the mythological history of these indigenous tribes. The Mide are responsible for passing on this knowledge and facilitating important cultural rituals, such as naming ceremonies, marriages, and funerals. The Midewiwin ceremonies take place in the Midewigaan, the open-top lodge of the Midewiwin constructed out of maple saplings and in a line from east to west. "}
