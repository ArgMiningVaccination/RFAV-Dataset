Integrative oncology is a patient-centered, evidence-based field of comprehensive cancer care that utilizes integrative therapies such as mind-body practices, acupuncture, massage, music therapy, nutrition, and exercise in collaboration with conventional cancer treatments. Patient interest and utilization has been growing over the past two decades. Clinical research has shown the benefits of these approaches to improving symptom management and quality of life, and is now being incorporated into national guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO). The availability of these services at cancer centers is growing, although the structure and implementation of integrative oncology remains highly variable. This article discusses the benefits of integrative oncology and provides an overview of the current state of integrative oncology programs nationwide. Current challenges and opportunities for cancer centers to provide integrative services is reviewed in the areas of programmatic structure, clinical service, education, and research.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-06-09", "cleaned_text": "Opportunities [https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm12123946](https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm12123946) [Integrating Clinical and Translational By 2040, new cases and death totals are expected to reach approximately 28 million and 16 million, respectively [ [2](#B2-jcm-12-03946)]. Cancer treatment alone costs the world approximately USD 1.2 trillion dollars annually. According to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH), \"if a non-mainstream approach is used together with conventional medicine, it's considered complimentary\", while \"if a non-mainstream approach is used in place of conventional medicine, it's considered alternative\" [ [3](#B3-jcm-12-03946)]. Therefore, integrative medicine is practiced in combination with conventional cancer care, not as an \"alternative\". Thus, these types of therapies are commonly termed integrative, complementary, and alternative medicine (ICAM) and have become increasingly popular in Western medicine. The Academic Consortium for Integrative Medicine and Health describes this approach as one that \"reaffirms the importance of the relationship between practitioner and patient, focuses on the whole person, is informed by evidence, and makes use of all appropriate therapeutic and lifestyle approaches, healthcare professionals and disciplines to achieve optimal health and healing\". The NCCIH divides ICAM modalities into three main categories: nutrition, psychological, and physical. Nutrition approaches focus on food as medicine and encompass special diets, dietary patterns, and natural products (i.e., dietary supplements such as vitamins, minerals, herbs, and botanicals). Psychological aspects include mindfulness and spirituality, while physical modalities include massage and spinal manipulation, and increasingly popular is the combination of psychological and physical approaches known as mind and body practices, including acupuncture, massage therapy, mindfulness, meditation, music therapy, and yoga (see [Figure 1](#jcm-12-03946-f001)from NCCIH) [ [3](#B3-jcm-12-03946)]. [4](#B4-jcm-12-03946)]. In practice, integrative medicine is a multidisciplinary approach to treating patients with efforts to combine the benefits of integrative and conventional modalities that have been shown to be safe and effective. These types of therapies are provided by a different group of professional caregivers, with different educational backgrounds, credentials, and regulatory oversight that varies by therapy, geography, and culture. [5](#B5-jcm-12-03946)]. Dietary supplements and yoga appeared to be the most popular modalities in 2017, with 57.6% and 14.2% of adults reporting their usage, respectively [ [6](#B6-jcm-12-03946), [7](#B7-jcm-12-03946)]. People use integrative medicine for a wide array of diseases and conditions. According to surveys, a majority of patients use integrative medicine most commonly for back pain or back problems, head or chest colds, neck pain or neck problems, joint pain or stiffness, and anxiety or depression [ [8](#B8-jcm-12-03946)]. As more patients are using integrative medicine, so are practitioners. According to a national survey of medical oncologists, one third reported using ICAM and nearly two thirds had recommended some form of ICAM to patients [ [9](#B9-jcm-12-03946)]. [10](#B10-jcm-12-03946)]. More specifically, approximately one third of cancer patients reported using ICAM in the last 12 months in 2019, with herbal supplements being the most commonly used modality. Of the cancer patients using ICAM, 29.3% did not disclose their ICAM use to their physicians [ [11](#B11-jcm-12-03946)]. This high use of herbal supplements, in combination with lack of disclosure to their healthcare providers, is worrisome not only because dietary supplements are not thoroughly regulated, and thus may have quality and safety issues, but also because many have drug interactions and the potential for negative outcomes. Therefore, it is important for physicians to discuss ICAM with their patients to ensure they are using ICAM in safe and effective ways. This also requires educating physicians on the various ICAM modalities, such as their safety, efficacy, and effects on the body and on other conventional treatments. 2. Benefits of Integrative Oncology [12](#B12-jcm-12-03946)]. As a result, integrative therapies are now being incorporated in national guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and the American Society for Clinical Oncology [ [13](#B13-jcm-12-03946), [14](#B14-jcm-12-03946), [15](#B15-jcm-12-03946)]. [16](#B16-jcm-12-03946)]. In this comprehensive report, it is mentioned that \"cancer care today often provides state-of-the-science biomedical treatment but fails to address the psychological and social (psychosocial) problems associated with the illness. These problems\u2014including... anxiety, depression or other emotional problems\u2014cause additional suffering, weaken adherence to prescribed treatments, and threaten patients' return to health\". Extensive research has documented that mind-body interventions appear to address many of the issues mentioned in the IOM report. [17](#B17-jcm-12-03946), [18](#B18-jcm-12-03946)], and a variety of other techniques have also been studied such as yoga meditation and Tibetan meditation. The MBSR training is generally a 2.5 h session each week for 8 weeks, along with an 8 h retreat. A clinical trial of 229 women found that MSBR significantly improved total mood, quality of life, and well-being compared to the control group, in women who had undergone breast cancer treatment [ [19](#B19-jcm-12-03946)]. Another randomized controlled trial examining breast cancer survivors found mindfulness awareness practices to significantly reduce stress, pro-inflammatory gene expression, inflammatory signaling, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and vasomotor symptoms, though these effects, aside from cancer-related distress, did not persist at a 3 month follow-up [ [20](#B20-jcm-12-03946)]. Six other studies found that meditation can also significantly decrease anxiety, fatigue, and depression in cancer patients [ [21](#B21-jcm-12-03946), [22](#B22-jcm-12-03946), [23](#B23-jcm-12-03946), [24](#B24-jcm-12-03946), [25](#B25-jcm-12-03946), [26](#B26-jcm-12-03946)], as well as lead to stress reduction and improve overall quality of life [ [21](#B21-jcm-12-03946), [27](#B27-jcm-12-03946)]. Anderson et al. demonstrated a survival advantage among breast cancer patients randomized to a psychological intervention with more than 10 years of follow-up [ [28](#B28-jcm-12-03946)]. Although the exact mechanism behind this effect remains unclear, the authors have proposed several theories. Psychological therapies such as Cognitive Emotional Behavior Therapy (CEBT), Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), and supportive-expressive therapy aim to alleviate anxiety and depression commonly associated with cancer treatments. These negative emotional states are believed to suppress the immune and neuroendocrine systems, which may impact survival [ [29](#B29-jcm-12-03946)]. Patients are taught problem-solving skills, cognitive flexibility, and relaxation techniques to better cope with stressful situations. However, a recent meta-analysis of psychosocial interventions showed only minimal short-term improvements in survival, with individually delivered interventions failing to show any survival benefits [ [30](#B30-jcm-12-03946)]. ASCO/SIO guidelines recommend meditation to reduce anxiety (Grade A), treat mood disturbance and depressive symptoms (Grade A), and improve quality of life (Grade A) [ [31](#B31-jcm-12-03946)]. [32](#B32-jcm-12-03946)]. Another review of thirteen randomized controlled trials found yoga to improve cancer patients' mental health, quality of life, and treatment-related side effects, while decreasing stress, anxiety, and depression [ [33](#B33-jcm-12-03946)], which supports a review by Greenlee et al. that also found an improvement in quality of life and decrease in distress, anxiety, and depression in cancer patients that practiced yoga [ [21](#B21-jcm-12-03946)]. Similarly, Cramer et al.'s meta-analysis of 23 randomized controlled trials found that yoga can improve quality of life and decrease fatigue and sleep disturbances in the short-term, but did not affect depression or anxiety [ [34](#B34-jcm-12-03946)]. ASCO/SIO guidelines recommend yoga to reduce anxiety (Grade B), improve mood disturbance and depressive symptoms (Grade B), and improve quality of life (Grade B). They also state that yoga can be considered for post-treatment fatigue (Grade C) and that gentle yoga can be considered to improve sleep (Grade C) [ [31](#B31-jcm-12-03946)]. [35](#B35-jcm-12-03946)]. Another large randomized clinical trial by Shen et al. focused on 104 women with high-risk breast cancer and found electroacupuncture to significantly decrease the number of emesis episodes compared to minimal needling or antiemetic pharmacology after 5 days, but these differences disappated by day 9 [ [36](#B36-jcm-12-03946)]. Additionally, four reviews found that acupuncture reduces cancer-related pain [ [37](#B37-jcm-12-03946), [38](#B38-jcm-12-03946), [39](#B39-jcm-12-03946), [40](#B40-jcm-12-03946)], while two other reviews found not enough statistically significant evidence to draw this conclusion [ [41](#B41-jcm-12-03946), [42](#B42-jcm-12-03946)], and a review by Paley et al. found that acupuncture's effect on pain management varied by cancer type [ [43](#B43-jcm-12-03946)]. A meta-analysis by Tao et al. found that acupuncture can also increase quality of life and reduce symptoms such as pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and gastrointestinal discomfort [ [39](#B39-jcm-12-03946)], while two reviews found decreases in fatigue, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, and leukopenia [ [21](#B21-jcm-12-03946), [42](#B42-jcm-12-03946)]. The recent SIO-ASCO joint guidelines on integrative therapies for cancer pain found evidence to support the use of acupuncture aromatase inhibitor-related joint pain, general cancer pain and musculoskeletal pain [ [15](#B15-jcm-12-03946)]. [44](#B44-jcm-12-03946)]. Meanwhile, other studies have shown that massage therapy can decrease pain, fatigue, anxiety, nausea, and depression from 42.9% to 59.9% in cancer patients, though the effects are relatively short-term [ [21](#B21-jcm-12-03946), [45](#B45-jcm-12-03946), [46](#B46-jcm-12-03946), [47](#B47-jcm-12-03946), [48](#B48-jcm-12-03946)]. Massage was recommended by the SIO-ASCO joint guidelines to help reduce pain during palliative and hospice care [ [15](#B15-jcm-12-03946)]. [49](#B49-jcm-12-03946), [50](#B50-jcm-12-03946)]. The American Institute for Cancer Research and the World Cancer Research Fund have created a combined report for guidelines regarding nutrition and physical activity to prevent cancer. The American Cancer Society, American College of Sport Medicine, and ASCO have published guidelines for those with cancer [ [51](#B51-jcm-12-03946), [52](#B52-jcm-12-03946), [53](#B53-jcm-12-03946)]. These guidelines generally emphasize regular exercise, a plant-based Mediterranean style diet, limiting risk factor such as alcohol, and maintaining a healthy body weight. Adherence to these guidelines has been associated with improved survival, such as in colon cancer, and ongoing clinical trials are evaluating this in a more prospective manner [ [54](#B54-jcm-12-03946)]. Integrative oncology programs should incorporate these guidelines for cancer prevention and survivorship for patients. [55](#B55-jcm-12-03946), [56](#B56-jcm-12-03946)]. Quality control issues are a major concern with natural products and herbal supplements because of the potential for product substitutions or fillers, contamination, and inaccurate labeling [ [57](#B57-jcm-12-03946)]. Moreover, some treatments used by patients may not be covered by Medicare or insurance plans, leading to financial constraints for patients and their families. Additionally, patients may suffer from psychological distress due to unrealistic expectations regarding these treatments, especially when used as an alternative to standard of care. 3. Current State of Integrative Oncology [58](#B58-jcm-12-03946)]. From 2009 to 2016, comprehensive cancer centers were offering more services, including herb/supplement consultation (89-96%), meditation (89%), acupuncture (89%), yoga (87%), massage music (82%), and physician integrative medicine consultation (60%) [ [59](#B59-jcm-12-03946)]. Unfortunately, the exact details of how these services are provided is lacking and thus much of this information is garnered by the authors first-hand understanding through colleagues and attending conferences. Based on our experience, how these services are provided varies significantly at different clinical centers. At large academic cancer centers, the integrative medicine programs are often housed within the department of medicine or family medicine, such as at the University of Arizona and University of Wisconsin. These programs may or may not have strong connections to the cancer center. Additionally, with this model, integrative medicine services are often not found within the same clinical space as the cancer center and thus patients receive them at a different location, which may be a distance away. Many patients seek integrative services through community practices that generally operate separately from the main medical center. Therefore, patients receive clinical care at more than one system and most commonly, these medical systems are not connected and thus have limited communication. 4. Challenges and Opportunities for Integrative Oncology [14](#B14-jcm-12-03946), [15](#B15-jcm-12-03946)]. Additional practice guidelines are currently under development by SIO to facilitate the incorporation of integrative therapies in an evidence-based approach. [60](#B60-jcm-12-03946), [61](#B61-jcm-12-03946)]. Developing a financially feasible integrative oncology program that expands patient access is challenging, but necessary. Insurance will typically cover integrative oncology visits with an MD or NP. Still, visits with other integrative care providers, such as naturopaths and acupuncturists, often incur high out-of-pocket costs. Additionally, racial disparities and lower socioeconomic patients are often under-represented in integrative oncology programs due to financial constraints, time away from work, transportation, and lack of childcare. Ideally, programs should offer a sliding scale fee structure that allows patients of limited financial resources to still be able to receive integrative therapies as medically indicated. [58](#B58-jcm-12-03946)]. Despite more integrative oncology programs have become available in cancer centers around the nation, access to such programs is still limited to major medical centers. Even when a cancer program has an established integrative oncology program, access may be further limited due to time constraints and challenges with the coordination of care with multiple appointment requirements and geographic barriers. Adopting telemedicine in integrative oncology may therefore help reduce some of these challenges. According to one study at University of Texas MD Anderson, looking at this paradigm shift during the pandemic, telehealth integrative oncology consultations were provided to 509 new patients from 21 April 2020 to 21 October 2020 compared to 842 new patients in person during the same period in 2019 [ [62](#B62-jcm-12-03946)]. In this study, it was concluded that delivering integrative oncology consultations using telehealth is feasible and meets patient's needs. These patients reported lower symptom burden and more concerns about lifestyle, herbs, and supplements. Additional studies have also shown the ability of telehealth to effectively deliver diet and exercise interventions for patients with cancer [ [63](#B63-jcm-12-03946), [64](#B64-jcm-12-03946), [65](#B65-jcm-12-03946), [66](#B66-jcm-12-03946)]. We believe that use of the telehealth platform to provide integrative oncology consultations is beneficial if in-person consultation is not feasible to counsel patients on healthy lifestyle and address any questions regarding natural products or other integrative modalities. [67](#B67-jcm-12-03946)]. GMV aims to present integrative oncology information to groups of individuals, not to serve as a support group, except for informal patient interactions. Patients are divided into one of three appropriate series: patients on active treatment or maintenance treatment of their specific cancer (tumor-specific), patients finished with treatment and in remission (tumor agnostic), and any cancer patient with metastatic disease on treatment (tumor agnostic). Each series consists of three meetings: session 1 covers nutrition and cancer, session 2 covers cannabis and other supplements, and session 3 covers acupuncture and stress reduction therapies. All three meetings last 2 h, including didactic content presented by the physician, time for patient questions, and individual consultations in a nearby room. Groups include up to eight patients, and each is allowed to bring one guest. [60](#B60-jcm-12-03946)]. Therefore, the success of any integrative oncology program relies on the ability to inform patients and clinicians about the potential benefits of these approaches. A strategy for clinicians is to provide experiential opportunities for them to receive clinical services such as acupuncture or meditation. The services could be provided as part of a routine meeting such as a department/division meeting or even an in-service meeting for nurses. Another important aspect of training is the development of specialists in integrative oncology, including medical oncology, radiation oncology, and surgical oncology as well as integrative therapists specializing in cancer-acupuncture, massage, and mediation. Given the growing demand by patients, and the lack of clinicians to staff this demand, it is essential that comprehensive cancer centers consider this part of the long-term mission. Along with the SIO, only four academic institutions provide formal integrative oncology training for healthcare providers: MD Anderson, Memorial Sloan-Kettering, University of Arizona, and the University of Michigan [ [12](#B12-jcm-12-03946)]. [68](#B68-jcm-12-03946)]. If infrastructure and funding allows, integrative oncology programs should be providing patients the opportunity to participate in clinical trials to, in turn, help produce more critical data to understand how to best use these approaches to improve patient care. 5.
