Yep, he went there. Yesterday, Newsom signed into law AB 2098\u2014the state bill that allows for the criminalization of doctors for spreading so-called \"misinformation\". Before the bill was signed, our Dr. Paul Marik added \u2014 loudly \u2014 to the chorus of voices that were calling on Governor Newsom to axe the bill. Said Dr. Marik: \"Think about that a second: a doctor who advises a patient on a course of action different than a COVID vaccine could find themselves out of work. Meanwhile, [the CEO of Pfizer], recipient of four separate vaccines and his company's Paxlovid antiviral treatment, announced he had tested positive for the illness again \u2014 for the second time in two months.\" Read\u2014and most importantly SHARE\u2014 [Dr. Marik's compelling essay.](https://flccc.substack.com/p/marik-newsoms-california-is-on-the?r=nxypy&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=email) It's too late for California, but it's not too late to advocate immediately for medical sanity in other states that may feel emboldened by the passage of this bill\u2014one that will have a chilling effect on the health and well-being of every patient in California.

ATTENTION MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS: CMEs are now available for the conference! Credits will be available through our partner MNI - Great Lakes ECHO. A link to register for the credits will be available at the conference. DATES: October 14-16, 2022 COST: - Conference Fee: $395/per person (includes all presentations, continental breakfast and boxed lunches on Saturday 10/15 and Sunday 10/16) - Friday Evening VIP Networking Dinner: $125/per person (featuring Keynote Address by FLCCC co-founders Dr. Pierre Kory and Dr. Paul Marik) The FLCCC Alliance's [inaugural conference](https://covid19criticalcare.com/conference) will convene the top experts in the field of pathology, patient evaluation, and treatment of spike-induced diseases. Lectures will focus on the pathogenesis of spike-induced diseases, diagnosing both long COVID and post-vaccine syndromes and the latest, most effective approaches to treatment. The conference will gather some of the nation's foremost COVID experts and healthcare providers to learn, share and network \u2014 and most importantly to drive greater attention and awareness of the increasing number of patients afflicted with post-COVID and post-vaccine chronic conditions, many of whom are not getting treatment today. In a [stunning new report](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2796427?guestAccessKey=1c13d17c-1c25-4828-b261-9f321e5126a1&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social_jamapeds&utm_term=7701881843&utm_campaign=article_alert&linkId=183092079), the Journal of the American Medical Association is urging mothers to avoid breastfeeding after receiving a COVID vaccination. That is because a new study shows that trace amounts of mRNA have now been identified in breast milk. In a [new video post](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuiL9FBW8fI), our Dr. Mobeen Syed (Dr. Been) explains the highly troubling significance of this finding. \"This is the first time ever that a study is showing the travel of packaged mRNA all the way to a secretion system and become part of the secretion,\" said Dr. Been. \"If there are trace amounts of mRNA in the milk, then surely there is a greater amount in the cell. And, surely a greater amount in the circulation.\" Dr. Been's video is a MUST WATCH \u2014particularly for all parents of infants. If you will read only one news story today, this just has to be the one. In his story, author Justus R. Hope. M.D. writes about \"two forces of nature\"\u2014Dr. Tess Lawrie and Dr. Pierre Kory \u2014 both of whom he says \"represent the best in modern physician ethics.\" Dr. Hope has been inspired over and over again by their example. \"As a citizen of the world, a parent, and a physician, I try to listen to everything Kory or Lawrie write or say because, in a corrupt world devoid of honest news sources, I know of a few that I can always count on that will lead me in the correct direction. The world's citizens should read the [Substack]news [columns]of these leading physicians during a time when the mainstream is often misleading them.\" [READ](https://www.thedesertreview.com/opinion/columnists/pierre-kory-meets-tess-lawrie---and-the-world-awakens/article_f01d2d6a-3ea5-11ed-8362-53163de28ee9.html) Dr. Hope's essay. It is at once poetic, stirring...and, of course, hopeful. IMPORTANT: Dr. Lawrie's most recent [Substack post](https://drtesslawrie.substack.com/p/what-our-press-conference-with-dr?utm_source=post-email-title&isFreemail=true&utm_medium=email) is about Dr Aseem Malhotra \u2014 a highly respected consultant cardiologist who actively promoted Covid-19 vaccination \u2014 until the sudden and tragic death of his father from suspected vaccine-induced cardiac arrest led him to uncover the truth about these toxic injections. Dr. Malhotra has now published [a paper](https://insulinresistance.org/index.php/jir/article/view/71/224) on his findings in Journal of Insulin Resistance. Also \"The Digger\" (aka Phil Harper) has written a [powerful Substack on Dr. Malhotra. On this Dr. Pierre Kory and Scott Marsland, FNP discussed where we are today with COVID-19, and answered many of your questions. We also met Ron Coleman, a trucker from Washington, D.C. who took part in the Defeat the Mandates coast-to-coast convoy earlier this year. He's now WALKING across the U.S. to bring an end to the State of Emergency concerning COVID-19. You can follow his incredible journey [HERE](https://www.greywolfwalk.com/). \"Since January 1, in the laboratory I'm seeing a 20 times increase of endometrial cancers over what I see on an annual basis,\" reported Dr. Ryan Cole. Dr. Cole \u2014 who will be a speaker at the FLCCC's upcoming inaugural [education conference ](https://covid19criticalcare.com/conference)\u2014 said the vaccines seem to be causing serious autoimmune issues, in a way he described as a \"reverse HIV\" response. According to Cole, in patients with HIV, there is a massive suppression of \"helper T-cells\" which causes immune system functions to plummet \u2014 leaving the patient more susceptible to a variety of illnesses. Similarly, Cole describes that, \"post-vaccine, what we are seeing is a drop in killer T-cells, in CD8 cells. And what do CD8 cells do? They keep all other viruses in check.\" Read the entire story [HERE.](https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/idaho-doctor-reports-a-20-times-increase-of-cancer-in-vaccinated-patients/) In this week's [Long (COVID) Story Short](https://odysee.com/@FrontlineCovid19CriticalCareAlliance:c/How-To-Impart-Superpowers-to-Your-Cells-Via-Heat-Shock-Proteins:1) with Dr. Been, viewers will learn how to impart superpowers to their cells via Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs.) (HSPs are specific proteins that are made when cells are briefly exposed to temperatures above their normal growth temperature.) In this lecture, Dr. Been reviews the fundamentals of HSPs. The goal is to encourage all of us to become partners with our cells in staying healthy. Eric had a terrible time with COVID-19 in December 2020, but he was determined not to go to the hospital. When he contracted COVID again, his mother offered him some ivermectin. What an incredible difference between his "}
