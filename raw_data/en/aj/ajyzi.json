Methods: A prospective, randomized, controlled, blind clinical study was conducted at a private acupuncture clinic in Sweden. 90 otherwise healthy 2-8 weeks old infants, born after gestational week 36, fulfilling the criteria for infantile colic and not medicated with dicyclomine, were included. 81 infants went through a structured program consisting of six visits to the clinic, twice weekly. Infants randomized to receive acupuncture were given minimal,standardized acupuncture for two seconds in LI4. Frequency and size of stooling, as well as duration of, andintervals between, feeding sessions were reported by parents in a diary. Parental assessment of sleep andcomments on stooling and side effects were collected in a questionnaire. Results: At baseline when the mean age was five weeks, infants in both groups were fed a median of eight times/ day, 148 min/day, with considerable variations. No differences were found between groups in the frequency and duration of feeding during the intervention weeks. Furthermore there were no significant differences between thegroups regarding the frequency of stooling, neither at baseline, at which point the infants of both groups hadbowel movements 4.2 times/day, nor during the intervention weeks. There was an expected decrease in frequencyof stooling in both groups, reaching 2.1 (p = 0,001) in the acupuncture group and 3.1 (p < 0,001) in the controlgroup. The groups differed regarding large bowel movements which decreased linearly in the control group (p =0,011) but not in the acupuncture group (p = 0,787). More parents in the acupuncture group than in the controlgroup (28% and 15% respectively, p = 0.006) experienced the infant 's sleep to be \"better \"or \"much better. \"No other significant differences were found. However, parents described a normalized stooling and experienced animprovement in colic in their infants more frequently in the acupuncture group than in the control group. Conclusions: Infants with colic in the present study had a higher frequency of stooling than reported internationally in healthy infants. Minimal acupuncture had no major effect on feeding, stooling and sleep, although a minor effect of minimal acupuncture on stooling and sleep cannot be ruled out. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.govID NCT00860301 Introduction Infantile colic, with a prevalence of approximately 10% of infants[1], is often related to gastrointestinal factorsby the parents[2] although the aetiology is unclear[3]. Few studies describe feeding frequency and bowel habitsduring the first months in healthy infants[4-10], even fewer describe this in infants with colic[11,12]. Possibleeffect of acupuncture on feeding, stooling and sleepingpatterns in infants suffering from colic has not been investigated previously.

We have not been able to findany scientific data as to how often infants are actuallyfed. Age is the factor that influences stooling frequencymost. Healthy infants have bowel movements approxi- mately four times/day during their first 1-2 weeks [5-7]. At the age of one month infants are registered to have2.2 stoolings/day [7], approx imately three study six stoolings/day [11]. Follow-ing the first weeks there is a radical decrease in stoolingfrequency till the age of two months when stooling fre-quency was reported to be one per day [11], 1.8 [7,10]and 2.2 [9] times/day. At three months the mean fre- quency had decreased to one per day [11], 1.25/day[13] and approximately 1.7/day [7,10]. Breast feeding hasbeen reported to increase the frequency of stooling[11,14,15]. Two trials measured the difference betweenthe bowel movements of colicky and non-colickyinfants: one reported that infants with symptoms ofcolic during the first two months had less frequentbowel movements [11], the other that there was no dif- ference[12]. Parents of infants with colic correlated crying to sto- mach aches and a disturbed gut function [2,16]. In a quali- tative study they remarked that their infants had bowelmovements more than ten times/day or hardly at all andthat the stools were green, explosive and foul-smelling [2]. Colicky symptoms have been linked to feeding problems and disturbed sleep [17]. In t wo randomized controlled studies minimal acupuncture in LI4 in infants with colicresulted in a reduction of fussing and crying [18,19]. Possi-ble explanations could be a reduction of pain as shown inadults [20], a beneficial effect on other visceral symptomssuch as nausea which has been reduced by acupuncture inadults [21,22] and in children [23], an altered gastric moti-lity [24] or changed gastric emptying as shown in adultpatients with motility disorders [25]. Furthermore acu- puncture affected constipation in children [26] even though gastric motility in healthy adult humans was notaltered [27]. Finally a sedative effect of acupuncture couldexplain the reduction of colic as it has been demonstratedto promote sleep in adults [28]. The aim of this study was to describe the feeding and stooling patterns of infants with colic. A second aimwas to evaluate the influence of minimal acupuncture. Methods Design The study was performed at a private acupuncture clinicin Sweden comparing acupuncture with no acupuncturein a prospective, clinical, blinded, randomized, controlledtrial (RCT). The primary o utcome of the RCT was the frequency of fussing and crying of the infants, describedin a separate article [19]. The secondary outcomes werethe feeding, stooling and sleeping patterns of the infantsas presented in the present article. The study wasapproved by the Regional Ethical Review Board (Dnr583/2005). Participants Parents of otherwise healthy 2-8 week old infants, bornafter gestational week 36, never medicated with dicyclo-mine and searching help for excessive crying were invitedto participate. After giving written informed consent theparents of 210 infants reported the crying and fussing oftheir infants in a diary for at least three days to assesswhether or not the infants fulfilled the modified Wessel- criteria for colic: \"crying/fussing for at least three hours a day, occurring three days or more in the same week \"[1]. In the diary the parents also reported the feeding and stooling habits of their infants. During the registration per-iod exclusion of cow 's milk from the infant 'sd i e tw a s recommended if this had not been tried previously. Ofthese 210 infants 120 were not included as they cried lessthan the stipulated hours. Some of them may have improved as they were no longer exposed to cow 'sm i l k protein. The 90 infants fulfilling the criteria for crying were randomized and 81 completed all three interventionweeks (Figure 1). Randomisation and intervention Infants went through a structured program consisting ofsix visits to an acupuncture clinic, twice weekly. (Two infants in the acupuncture group went to the clinic only five times as the parents considered the colic to becured. They were included as the parents continued toregister in the diary.) At each visit the parents met anurse who asked standardized questions and gave stan-dardized support and advice. At every visit the infantwas carried to a treatment room and left alone for fiveminutes with a certified acupuncturist who was also a registered nurse and well qualified in the care of chil- dren. She administered minimal, standardized acupunc-ture to the infants allocated to receive acupuncture. This was performed unilaterally (left and right handswere used alternately for each child), for two seconds atan approximate depth of tw o millimeters in the point LI4 of the first dorsal interosseal muscle of the hand,i n n e r v a t e db yt h eu l n a rn e r v eb ys e n s o r ya n da u t o - nomic, mainly sympathetic, fibres. An acupuncture nee- dle, 0.20 \u00d7 13 mm, was used (Vinco Micro Clean).Infants in the control group were treated similarlyexcept for the needle insertion. Blinding The nurse who met the parents was blinded to the rando-mization. The acupuncturist performed the randomizationLandgren et al .BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2011, 11:93 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6882/11/93Page 2 of 9and never met the parents. Parents were informed that acupuncture does not necessarily cause the infant to cryand that the very thin needle usually would not causebleeding or a visible mark on the skin. Outcome and assessments The parents made notes every 5-minute when applicable,for 24-hours of their infants 'crying, feeding and stooling in a diary modified from Barr et al [29] and Canivet [30].Reports were made for at least three days during theb a s e l i n ew e e ka n dd a i l yd u r i n gt h et h r e ei n t e r v e n t i o nweeks. Parents marked large bowel movements with \"B\" and small bowel movements, \"a stain of feces in the nappy, \"with \"b.\"Parents also reported when, and for how long, the infant was eating. At inclusion parentswere asked if the appetite of the infant was \"bad, \"\"good \" or \"gluttonous. \"From the second to the sixth visit par- ents completed a questionnaire modified from Reinthalet al [18] in which they were asked \"Has the stooling of your infant changed, yes or no? \"Parents could even describe the situation in their own words, responding to the questions \"If so, how? \"and \"Have you detected any symptom that you think can be related to the acupunc- ture treatment? If so what? \"I nt h es a m eq u e s t i o n n a i r e parents could describe the present sleep of their infant ina five-point scale as much worse, worse, as before, betteror much better. At the last visit parents answered thequestion \"Do you think your baby 's colic is much worse, worse, the same, a little bit better or much better than three weeks ago? \" Randomization (n= 90) Started the structured program with six visits to the clinic, without acupuncture (n=40) Started the structured program with six visits to the clinic, including acupuncture (n=46) Not meeting the criterion for infantile colic (n=120) Excluded (n=3): had not met the inclusion criterion.

If 50% of the infants would go into spontaneousremission without treatment and 75% with acupuncture,40 patients per group were needed in order to have 90%chance of detecting a significant difference in remissionrate at a two-sided 5% level. The statistical softwareSPSSversion 17 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) was used for calculations. As the Kolmogo rov-Smirnov test showed non-normal distribution for core variables, the Mann-Whitney U test was used to analyze differences betweengroups at each time point. Changes within the groupsover baseline and the three intervention weeks wereanalyzed with Friedman test. P-values < 0.05 were con-sidered statistically significant. Answers concerning changed stooling and possible side effects were summarised and analyzed with content ana-lysis at a manifest level mean ing that the visible content in the text was coded [31]. Similar remarks were groupedtogether into one code, codes with similar content weregrouped into categories and the amount of remarks wasregistered. The coding was d o n eb yt h ef i r s ta u t h o ra n d subsequently checked by the third author to ensure inter-coder reliability [31]. Results and discussion There were no significant differences between groups,neither regarding the background characteristics of theinfants (Table 1), nor in feeding and stooling patterns,during the baseline registration week (Table 2). Feeding During baseline and the three intervention weeks infantsin both groups were fed approximately eight times/daywith a variation between 5.3 and 14.2 times/day (Table 2),placing this group in the upper level of the previouslyreported norm of 6-8 times/day [4]. At inclusion the appe-tite of the infant was described as \"gluttonous \"by 56% of the parents, as \"good \"by 42% and as \"bad\" by 2% with no difference between the groups. This correlates well to the thesis that infants with colic may be comforted with food and thus be fed more often than healthy infants [2].Furthermore infants who are breastfed, and fed with shortintervals consume less of the high-fat hindmilk and moreof the low-fat milk which has a more rapid stomach transittime which, in turn, may result in short intervals betweenmeals [4] and increase feeding problems [17]. T h ed u r a t i o no ff e e d i n gi nt h ep r e s e n ts t u d yw a s approximately 148 minutes/ day, with considerable var- iations (min 49, max 458). There were no statisticaldifferences between groups i n frequency or duration of meals.Stooling At baseline when the infants in the present study had amean age of five weeks they had bowel movements 4.1times/day (acupuncture group) and 4.3 times/day (controlgroup). These frequencies are higher than the 2.2 - 3times/day reported in the majority of previous prospectivestudies in healthy infants at the age of one month [6-10]and contra dictionary to the findings of Tunc et al.w h o reported less frequent stooling in colicky infants compared to non-colicky infants [11]. However, as different feeding habits and living conditions may affect stooling, a compar-ison between trials performed in different countries shouldbe validated in local studies. Many different influences arepossible. For example, the frequency of breastfeeding andthe consumption of antibiotics which may increase stool-ing frequency [4] could well vary in the countries in whichdata have been collected (Sweden, Australia, Germany, Thailand, Turkey, UK and the USA). Frequency of stooling varied widely between infants in the present study, from the mean of 0,1 to the mean of 12,4 times/day (Table 2) as it has been observed in other studies[5-11]. There were no significant differences betweengroups in the mean frequency of stooling (Table 2) andthere was a decline in both groups during the interventionweeks (p = 0,001 in the acupuncture group and p < 0,001 in the control group). This decrease was expected as pre- vious prospective studies report a decrease in stooling fre-quency between the first month (2.2 - 6 stoolings/day) andthe second month (1 - 2.2 stoolings/day) [7,9-11]. In thepresent study, the frequency in the third intervention week,mean age eight weeks, was 2.1 times/day in the acupunc-ture group and 3.1 in the control group. Thus the fre-quency in the control group remained higher than average whereas infants in the acupuncture group reached a frequency reported in earlier studies of healthy infants. Pos-sibly this could be the result of a normalized gastrointest-inal function in the acupuncture group. The mean value of large bowel movements decreased linearly in the control group (p = 0,011) but not in theacupuncture group (p = 0,787). Changed stooling patterns and possible side effects In the acupuncture group parents commented on changesin stooling habits of their infants 56 times as compared to25 times in the control group. Comments on changes inthe stooling frequency and possible side effects consisted ofa total of 271 remarks (168 from the acupuncture group,103 from the control group). The amount of remarksreported from each group, codes and categories are pre- sented in Table 3. Close to twice as many parents in the control group remarked that the infants 'stools were \"more watery \"(22 to 12). In contrast almost three times as many parents in the acupuncture group (16 to 6) remarked thatLandgren et al .BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2011, 11:93 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6882/11/93Page 4 of 9Table 1 Baseline demographic data Background characteristics Infants starting the intervention (N = 86) Infants completing 3 weeks (N = 81) Acupuncture group (n = 46) Control group (n = 40) Acupuncture group (n = 43) Control group (n = 38) Firstborn, n (%) 22 (48) 22 (55) 21 (48) 21 (55) Gender, female, n (%) 22 (48) 19 (48) 21 (50) 19 (50) Gestational age, weeks.

Parents in the acupuncture group gave 16 comments coded into \"Can defecate/break wind easier/without help \"compared to none in the control group. Comments on stooling, and the fact that the mean value of large bowel movementsdecreased linearly in the control group but not in the acu-puncture group, could indicate that the minimal acupunc-ture used in this trial actually affected the bowelmovements, supporting reports from other trials on auto-nomic effects of acupuncture on the gastrointestinal system [24,25]. Sleeping and progression of colic Sleep was rated as \"better \"or \"much better \"(see Table 4) more frequently in the acupuncture group than in the control group. During the second week parents in theacupuncture group reported \"better \"or \"much better \"26 times (constituting 30% of the answers) compared to six times in the control group (8% of the answers). During the study period significantly more parents in the acu-puncture group (28% compared to 15% in the controlgroup, p = 0.006) evaluated the infant 'ss l e e pa s\" better \" or \"much better. \"More parents in the acupuncturegroup experienced an improvement in colic during thestudy time at the last visit (Table 4). No definite statistical conclusions can be made on inde- pendent variables like the comments of the parents above. However, the parents perception of normalized stooling, better sleep and improvement of the colic are in line withthe results reported earlier: the infants in the acupuncturegroup cried and fussed less and the mean value for cryingwas below the limit for colic after the first interventionweek [19]. The infants in the acupuncture group reachednormal levels for their age of the stooling frequency in thethird intervention week (Table 2), ie < 2.2 stoolings/day, [7,9-11]. The largest reduction of both crying and stooling frequency was measured after the first acupuncture treat-ment. However, the differences in feeding and stooling pat-terns between the groups are not significant in the majorityof the variables and the present study cannot support asimple correlation between reduction of crying and animproved regulation of thes e. The effect of acupuncture may as well be of a different origin such as spasmolytic or sedative. Strengths and limitations One strength of the present study is that quantitative and qualitative methods were combined to detect evenTable 3 Changes in stooling pattern and possible side effects of intervention as described by the parents in a questionnaire from the second till the sixth visit at the clinic Categories Codes Number of remarks in the acupuncture groupNumber of remarks in thecontrol group Changed stooling Less frequent 30 17 More frequent 26 8 More watery 12 22 More firm 16 6 Changed colour 22 15 Changed odour 7 10 Normalized, \"less hassle and conkout with the stomach \"22 8 Can defecate and/or break wind easier/without assistance16 0 Other gastro-intestinalchangesCan belch easier 1 0 Increased salivation 0 1 More vomiting 3 4 Rumbling in the stomach 2 4 Other symptoms More crying/less crying 3/1 3/1 More restless after the visit 3 0 Wants to eat more often 1 0 Increased skin symptoms 2 1 Slept a lot 1 3 The categories, codes and frequency of remarks on a certain topic in each group are shown in this table.

Furthermore, fre- quency and size of bowel movements were reported meticulously in the diaries kept by all parents during the three week study period. Another strength is thatparents of all of the infants had been recommended totry a five-day period of not exposing the infant to cow 's milk protein during baseline. Infants improving fromthis were not included in the study reducing thereby thenumber of infants with an allergy to cow 'sm i l kp r o t e i n to a minimum. Limitations are the lack of precise measurement of the stools in milligrams, and the fact that the infant 'ss l e e p was described by multiple choise alternatives but notmeasured in minutes in the diary. Furthermore, parentswere not asked to evaluate the infant 's sleep during the baseline period. Special feeding habits and living condi-tions, possibly affecting stooling, were not registered. Theparents' experiences are important but subjective and should be interpreted with care. In this study only one, unilateral, acupuncture point, minimally stimulated, was investigated. As different pointsand stimulation techniques have been demonstrated tohave different effects on gastrointestinal symptoms [33-36]the results of the present study cannot be generalised to asituation in which other points or to stronger stimulationare used. Power calculation was done on the variable crying, reported in an earlier article [19] and not on variables asstooling or feeding which might have resulted in anothernumber of participating infants. Another limitation isthat no correlation analyses was done to see if the indivi-dual crying and stooling patterns were correlated in eachchild, and if the experienc e of normalized stooling or general improvement according to the parent was corre- lated to reduced crying in the infant. Conclusion This article reports, for the first time, the feeding and stooling patterns of Swedish infants with colic. Feedingand stooling habits are important topics for many newparents. A description of these patterns can be a valuabletool in everyday clinical practice. Infants with colic in thepresent study had a higher frequency of stooling than reported internationally in healthy infants. Minimal acupuncture in the point LI4 twice a week for 3 weeks only showed a minor difference in the frequency of stooling between the groups. The parents in the acupunc-ture group more frequently commented on a changed andnormalized stooling in their infants, and more frequentlyreported improvement of sleep and colic. As the correla-tion between relief of colic symptoms and frequency in feeding and stooling is weak there may be other explana- tions for the effect on crying induced by acupuncture.Further studies are requested to clarify the mechanism ofacupuncture in colic.
