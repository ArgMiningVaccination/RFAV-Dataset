The precision required for these properties is achieved while also preserving evolvability - the capacity to adapt in response to /uniFB02uctuating selection pressures in the environment. What is the basic design of proteins that supports all of these properties? Going beyond direct physical analysis, statistical analysis of genome sequences have, in recent years, provided a powerful and general approach to this problem. Using di/uniFB00erent methodologies, this approach has revealed both direct structural contacts as well as collective functional modes within protein structures. In this talk, I will present approaches for probing the physical mechanisms implied by the evolution-based models and present ideas for how such mechanisms may be constrained by and originate from the dynamics of the evolutionary process. This work represents a step towards a theory for the physics of proteins that is consistent with evolution. /one.pnum/two.pnumCells integrate mechanical and chemical inputs at the cell membrane by building active emulsions Satyajit Mayor PS National Centre for Biological Science, TIFR, Bangalore, India The surface of a eukaryotic cell interfaces with the external milieu constantly, decoding signals in the form of chemical and mechanical inputs. These cues are interpreted primarily by membrane receptors which are embedded in a plasma membrane templated by an active cortical actin meshwork. One such membrane receptor, the integrin receptor receive chemical inputs in the form of the extracellular matrix, and mechanical signals from the external mileu. These activate Rho A-dependent signalling cascades generating actomyosin stresses in the cell and activating mechanotransducers such as Vinculin. The activation of these two pathways result in the creation of a localized mesoscale liquid ordered (lo) domains consisting of nanoclusters of GPI-anchored proteins and lipids, resembling active emulsions . These membrane domains encode information about the nature of the substrate, regulating crucial aspects of integrin receptor function, including cell spreading, migration, and mechanical sti/uniFB00ness of the matrix. The active actin-membrane composite membrane therefore behaves as a mechano-responsive medium, serving to integrate chemical and physical cues presented at the cell surface. Self-Assembly of the Tau Protein: Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation and Fibrilliza- tion Joan-Emma Shea PS Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry University of California, Santa Barbara Tau is an intrinsically disordered protein that plays in an important role in stabilizing microtubules. Under pathological conditions, this protein can also self-assemble into /uniFB01brillar structures, a process that has been associated with a class of neurodegenerative diseases known as Tauopathies. Interest- ingly, this protein is also capable of assembling into liquid droplets through a process of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). We present computational studies complemented by experiments that investigate the conditions and mechanisms by which LLPS or /uniFB01brillization occur, and we discuss possible physiological roles for droplet formation. /one.pnum/three.pnumCryo-EM illuminates new biology of orphan receptors Appu Kumar Singh MS Department of Biological Sciences and Bioengineering, IIT Kanpur Among the large family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are many orphans, so called because their signaling reactions remain poorly understood. Among these is GPR/one.pnum/five.pnum/eight.pnum which is highly expressed in the nervous system and implicated in processes from cognition to memory to mood. However, the structural organization and signaling mechanisms of GPR/one.pnum/five.pnum/eight.pnum are largely unknown. We used single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine the structures of human GPR/one.pnum/five.pnum/eight.pnum alone and bound to an RGS signaling complex. GPR/one.pnum/five.pnum/eight.pnum has an unusual dimerization mode stabilized by a pair of phospholipids and the presence of an extracellular Cache domain, an unusual ligand-binding domain in GPCRs. The extensive set interaction at the dimeric interface locks GPR/one.pnum/five.pnum/eight.pnum in a conformation that likely prevents G protein activation. RGS binds to the homodimer at a site that substantially overlaps the surface that binds G proteins, again preventing canonical G protein signaling. The binding of a ligand to the extracellular domain may regulate signaling through the RGS complex. I will talk about how our structural and functional study on orphan GPR/one.pnum/five.pnum/eight.pnum provides insights into the unusual biology of orphan receptors and the formation of GPCR-RGS complexes, where instead of heterotrimeric G-proteins or arrestins, RGS is coupled to GPR/one.pnum/five.pnum/eight.pnum to bring a paradigm shift in signaling pathways. Insights into mechanisms of GABA uptake and transport inhibition by antiepilep- tic drugs Aravind Penmatsa MS Molecular Biophysics Unit, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore -aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a biochemical derivative of glutamate that serves as a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the nervous system. GABA release activates postsynaptic GABAA and GABAB receptors and is transported back into neurons and glial cells through the activity of the GABA transporters (GATs). Altered GABA levels in the synapse tend to be one of the factors leading to seizures and epilepsies. GABA levels in the synapse can be restored by blocking GABA reuptake from neural synapses. My talk will focus on our recent work on the structural aspects of GABA uptake inhibition by antiepileptic drugs that target transport through both competitive and allosteric mechanisms. I will further highlight the mechanism of GABA recognition and its movement into cells using high-resolution cryoEM structure of GAT/one.pnum /one.pnum/four.pnumStructure probing of native using Mass Spectrometry and Molecular Modelling Aditi Borkar MS Faculty of Medicine Health Sciences, University of Nottingham Problem statement : RNAs and their protein complexes (RNPs) are one of the most challenging sys- tems to study as single molecules. They are laborious to synthesise; they constantly change shape, structure and binding partners in solution; and they are di/uniFB03cult to image via conventional structural biology techniques. Thus, our knowledge about RNP structure, dynamics and correlated function is limited, particularly in comparison to proteins. This has signi/uniFB01cantly hampered the development of therapeutic approaches that target RNPs for control of infectious and non-communicable diseases. Solution : To address this bottleneck, we have been involved in challenge-driven method devel- opment for characterising structure and dynamics of native RNP complexes. One such method employed in our lab is /three.pnumD-OrbiSIMS. This is a /uniFB01rst in class solid state Mass Spectrometry tech- nique that combines high speed of Orbitrap analyser with high spatial resolution of secondary ion MS (SIMS) at pico-molar sensitivity. Using /three.pnumD-OrbiSIMS and novel data analysis pipelines for molecular modelling, we have demonstrated, for the /uniFB01rst time, the utility of the technique for characterising structures of native biomolecular complexes. We have benchmarked the method for Cas/nine.pnum-guideRNA complex and have been using it to characterise key RNP complexes mediating host-pathogen interactions in HIV. Mechanistic analysis of membrane /uniFB01ssion and discovery of novel /uniFB01ssion pro- teins Thomas Pucadyil MS IISER Pune The lipid bilayer is highly resilient to rupture and explains why it was selected over the course of evolution to serve a barrier function. Yet /uniFB01ssion, or the splitting of a membrane compartment, is a central theme in biology that manifests during cell division, organelle biogenesis and vesicular transport. Fission involves the local application of forces to bend and constrict a tubular membrane intermediate. Using a facile assay system of supported membrane nanotubes that can be tuned for size and lipid composition, we have analyzed /uniFB01ssion mechanisms of candidate proteins and discovered novel proteins that catalyze /uniFB01ssion. My talk will describe recent developments in our e/uniFB00orts at understanding the pathway to /uniFB01ssion and expanding the repertoire of /uniFB01ssion proteins. /one.pnum/five.pnumSpeci/uniFB01city and of Protein-Lipid Prakash CSIR-National Chemical Laboratory Pune The molecular mechanisms underlying protein-lipid interactions are emerging and multi-scale simulations have been critical in identifying the speci/uniFB01city and energetics of these interactions. In this talk, we will highlight a few examples of charged lipid interactions with membrane bound proteins. In particular, we focus on the phopshoinisitol lipids (PIP lipids) and its interactions with the actin binding protein, co/uniFB01lin. We show that coarse-grain simulations are able to reproduce co/uniFB01lin- PIP/two.pnum interactions and that in a complex membrane, the maximal interactions with phosphoinositide (PIP) lipids, both PIP/two.pnum and PIP/three.pnum lipids. A good match was observed between the residues predicted to interact and previous experimental studies. The clustering of PIP lipids around the membrane bound protein leads to an overall lipid demixing and gives rise to persistent membrane curvature. Further, through a series of control simulations, we observe that both electrostatics and geometry are critical for speci/uniFB01city of lipid binding. Our current study is a step towards understanding the physico-chemical basis of protein-PIP lipid interactions. Maiti MS Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai, India Chemical signalling is essential to information processing in the brain. The key events of this process in the mammalian brain is the exocytotic release of signalling molecules by one cell and its binding to a receptor molecule on the recipient cell, which then transduces the chemical message. Here we ask: if we take the receptors away, can there still be signalling? Using Optical spectroscopy, solid state NMR and AFM force spectroscopy, we show that the lipid bilayer responds to some signalling molecules, such as serotonin, and changes its order and mechanical properties. These changes can in principle modulate the processes which are membrane -mediated, such as exo- and endocytosis. It can also in principle a/uniFB00ect the functioning of non- receptor molecules in the membrane. Using confocal and multiphoton microscopy, we also show that these e/uniFB00ects occur in real cells. In fact nature appears to have optimized the emmbrane compositions of di/uniFB00erent organelles to tune them for neurotransmitter interactions. In summary, the lipid bilayer membrane can itself be a receptor for many signalling molecules. Potentially, our /uniFB01ndings pave the way for a major new class of membrane-active but receptor-silent pharmacological agents which can a/uniFB00ect biological function.

The extensively interconnected membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) may act as a common conduit for such communication because many di/uniFB00erent organelles can exchange lipids and proteins with the ER at ER-organelle membrane contact sites (MCS). A fundamental physical constraint, however, appears to have been overlooked in the extensive literature related to MCS. Most organelles are too large to di/uniFB00use around freely inside the cell. How, then, can they /uniFB01nd their cognate MCS at distant locations on the ER membrane? We therefore hypothesized that Motor proteins carrying an organelle could get switched from Transporter to Tether when the organelle reaches a speci/uniFB01c MCS. Such a switch would allow organelles to sample the intracellular space with intermittent \"pit-stops\" at MCS, where they can exchange proteins/lipids with the ER for onward communication. I will discuss some experimental evidence to support this hypothesis. Tension bu/uniFB00ering mechanisms in axons Pramod Pullarkat MS Raman Research Institute, Bangalore Axons are long tubular extensions of neuronal cells. These extensions are generated and maintained by a composite network of highly dynamic biopolymer /uniFB01laments enclosed within a membranous tube. Owing to the dynamic, non-equilibrium nature of its structure, axons exhibit unique mechan- ical properties which are important for their development and function. This include non-linear viscoelastic responses, active contractility, stretch induced growth response, and tension bu/uniFB00ering responses to protect axons against mechanical stress. We will discuss the origins of some of these responses and how the properties of the biopolymer matrix in/uniFB02uence axonal stability. /one.pnum/seven.pnumPhysics-inspired data-driven Vishu Guttal MS IISc Bangalore Self-propelled particle models of collective motion (e.g. Vicsek et al /one.pnum/nine.pnum/nine.pnum/five.pnum PRL) have inspired innumerable studies in both physics and biology of collective motion. However, this large body of theoretical and empirical studies have overlooked the intrinsic noise that arises in any /uniFB01nite collective. In this talk, I will present our recent work involving analytical theory, experiments, and data-derived discovery of stochastic di/uniFB00erential equations. We show that intrinsic-noise can promote order in animal collectives. Further, we argue that data-driven discovery of models to be a promising avenue for both analysis of data as well as theory. Understanding how conformational transitions can modulate the folding of pro- teins Shachi Gosavi MS NCBS Bangalore In order to function, many proteins bind ligands and change shape. This conformational transition is what usually allows the protein to transmit a signal or perform catalysis or in some cases stop further activity. The energy landscapes of proteins which perform such conformational dynamics need to not only (/one.pnum) enable protein folding to the correct ligand-binding capable initial structure but to also then (/two.pnum) enable the change of shape to a speci/uniFB01c /uniFB01nal structure. Molecular dynamics simulations of dual structure-based models, models that encode both the initial and /uniFB01nal structures of the protein, can be used to describe such conformational transitions. I will discuss the models, conformational transitions and folding of two structurally and functionally di/uniFB00erent proteins adenylate kinase (AKE) and cytolysin A (clyA). These model proteins help us understand how conformational transitions may modulate the folding landscapes of proteins. /one.pnum/eight.pnumProbing protein stability and gene function using saturation mutagenesis Raghavan Varadarajan MS Molecular Biophysics Unit, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore Protein stability is conventionally measured with individual puri/uniFB01ed proteins; this is both laborious and slow. We show that by using ligand binding as a readout for structural integrity, and coupling this to FACS and deep mutational scanning, it is possible to make high throughput stability esti- mates, and identify both stabilized and destabilized mutants. Isolation of stabilizing mutations is enhanced by introducing one or more destabilizing mutations at buried positions into a saturation mutagenesis library, and screening for suppressors. Suppressors located distal from the destabiliz- ing mutation are typically able to suppress multiple destabilizing mutations and are thus global suppressors. Thermodynamic stabilisation is neither necessary nor su/uniFB03cient for suppressor action. Instead, in diverse systems, we observe that individual global suppressors of buried -site mutants greatly enhance protein foldability, primarily through an increase in refolding rate parameters measured in vitro. In contrast, suppressors of exposed-site mutations, exert their e/uniFB00ects through a decrease in unfolding rates. Synonymous mutations that do not change amino-acid identity are typically thought to be near neutral. Using the ccdAB operon as a test case, we show that many synonymous mutations can signi/uniFB01cantly perturb gene activity through a variety of mechanisms that includes changes in translation initiation, elongation, termination and folding. These diverse stud- ies, highlight the myriad insights obtainable from saturation mutagenesis coupled to phenotypic readouts and initiation factor /four.pnumB mRNA entry site on the small ribosomal subunit Tanweer Hussain MS Department of Developmental Biology and Genetics, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore During the initial steps of protein synthesis, mRNA is recruited to the small ribosomal subunit and the start codon in the mRNA template is recognized. In prokaryotes, the base pairing of the Shine- Dalgarno sequence in mRNA with the anti-Shine-Dalgarno sequence present in the /one.pnum/six.pnumS rRNA helps in mRNA recruitment and places the start codon at the P-site. However, in the case of eukaryotes, there is a specialized group of factors called the eukaryotic initiation factor /four.pnum (eIF/four.pnum) factors that help in mRNA recruitment to the /four.pnum/zero.pnumS. The eIF/four.pnum factors include the mRNA /five.pnum cap recognizing factor eIF/four.pnumE, the mRNA secondary structure resolving ATP-dependent RNA helicase and the sca/uniFB00olding protein eIF/four.pnumG. eIF/four.pnumB, another eIF/four.pnum factor, was earlier thought to participate only as the eIF/four.pnumA-helicase activity-stimulating protein. However, besides increasing the helicase activity of eIF/four.pnumA, eIF/four.pnumB plays an important role in mRNA recruitment. In yeast, eIF/four.pnumB binds directly to the /four.pnum/zero.pnumS head and helps in mRNA recruitment. Using cryo-electron microscopy, we show that yeast eIF/four.pnumB binds to the /four.pnum/zero.pnumS ribosomal subunit at the mRNA entry channel. In this talk, I will discuss the yeast eIF/four.pnumB-bound ribosomal complex and how it provides insight into possible events during mRNA recruitment. /one.pnum/nine.pnumDay /two.pnum: Tuesday, /two.pnum/eight.pnum March, /two.pnum/zero.pnum/two.pnum/three.pnum G.N. Ramachandran Lecture: Protein Design using Deep Learning David Baker PS Institute of Protein Science Proteins mediate the critical processes of life and beautifully solve the challenges faced during the evolution of modern organisms. Our goal is to design a new generation of proteins that address current-day problems not faced during evolution. In contrast to traditional protein engineering e/uniFB00orts, which have focused on modifying naturally occurring proteins, we design new proteins from scratch to optimally solve the problem at hand. We now use two approaches. First, guided by An/uniFB01nsen's principle that proteins fold to their global free energy minimum, we use the physically based Rosetta method to compute sequences for which the desired target structure has the lowest energy. Second, we use deep learning methods to design sequences predicted to fold to the desired structures. In both cases, following the computation of amino acid sequences predicted to fold into proteins with new structures and functions, we produce synthetic genes encoding these sequences, and characterize them experimentally. In this talk, I will describe recent advances in protein design using both approaches. Micro/uniFB02uidic Island Biogeography - Jam and Conquer Oskar Hallatschek PS UC Berkeley Microbes often colonize spatially-constrained habitats, such as pores in the skin or crypts in the colon. The resulting micro-communities can be very stable and contribute to the long-term function of our microbiomes. Due to a lack of spatio-temporal observations, it is however unclear how these communities and their ecological functions arise. Using micro/uniFB02uidic devices to systematically vary ecological correlation lengths, we uncover sharp transitions between di/uniFB00erent colonization states with di/uniFB00erent evolutionary properties. Our results show that density-dependent passive di/uniFB00usion can drive reproducing populations to a jamming threshold, which entails supreme resilience against invaders at the cost of a total loss of mixing and intra-species competition. These results elucidate how cell proliferation can drive unique non-equilibrium phase transitions (di/uniFB00erent from MIPS). The emerging sensitivity to scale, foreshadowed in the /uniFB01eld of island biogeography, underscores the need to control for scale in microbial eco-evolutionary experiments. /two.pnum/zero.pnumRNA-RBP condensates sense cellular RNA and bu/uniFB00er immune response Shovamayee Maharana MS Department of Microbiology and Cell Biology, Indian Institute of Science Cells carry out many biochemical reactions simultaneously in the crowded milieu of cytoplasm to sustain life. Compartmentalization in form of large membrane-bound organelles and smaller, dynamic nucleic acid-protein condensates, helps in organizing these multicomponent biochemical reactions in cells. The condensate formation is driven by phase separation of low complexity domain- containing nuclear RBPs like FUS, EWSR/one.pnum, TAF/one.pnum/five.pnum, TDP/four.pnum/three.pnum and to form nuclear condensates like paraspeckle and splicing speckles. We had previously shown that cellular concentration of RNA can control condensate formation and the physical properties of the condensates, speci/uniFB01cally high RNA/RBP concentration inhibited condensate formation, intermediate concentration favored liquid- like phase separation and the condensates formed at very low RNA/RBP ratio led to the formation of solid-like condensates or aggregates. I will present our recent work in Type I interferonopathy disease, Aicardi Gouti\u00e8res Syndrome (AGS) where the nucleic acid metabolism is implicated, showed that AGS with SAMHD/one.pnum mutations has altered RNA metabolism with an accumulation of ssRNA. The accumulation of RNA leads to global impairment of di/uniFB00erent cellular condensates and release of immunogenic self RNA which is stored in nuclear condensates- splicing speckles and cytoplasmic condensate- stress granules leading to in/uniFB02ammation. Taken together our work suggests that condensates can bu/uniFB00er immune response by sequestering self-immunogenic RNA. Phase separation of condensates is very susceptible to changes in cellular metabolism and microenvironment, hence we hypothesise that condensates can be the sensors for these changes and can lead to in/uniFB02ammation. /two.pnum/one.pnumDynamic Atomic Force Microscope for Viscoelasticity of Single Folded Domains of Proteins Shivprasad Patil MS IISER Pune The advent of the atomic force microscope, along with optical tweezers, ushered in a new /uniFB01eld of single molecule force spectroscopy, wherein the response of a single protein or a macromolecule to external mechanical perturbations is measured. Controlled forces ranging from pN to nN are applied to measure unfolding force distribution of a single protein domain. In a clamp type experiment, the folded protein is subjected to a constant force to measure the unfolding time distribution. Simultaneously, there were e/uniFB00orts to measure elastic and viscous response of a single domain by applying sinusoidal forces and measuring resulting deformations produced in a bid to quantify its viscoelasticity. The deformation's phase lag with respect to the applied force provides the elastic and viscous response of the protein, akin to oscillatory rheology. Despite numerous technical advances in AFM, an artefact-free measurement of a folded protein's viscoelasticity largely remains a challenge. In this talk, I review e/uniFB00orts to measure viscoelasticity of proteins using dynamic AFM, identifying pitfalls that make these measurements elusive. Finally, I discuss our new promising method, which reported viscoelasticity of a folded protein and reasons, that enabled such a measurement for the /uniFB01rst time[/one.pnum]. Patil, Direct and Simultaneous Measurement of the Sti/uniFB00ness and Internal Friction of a Single Folded Pro- tein, The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters, /two.pnum/zero.pnum/two.pnum/two.pnum MS Weizmann Institute Allostery is a pervasive principle to regulate protein function. Here, we show that DNA also transmits allosteric signals over long distances to boost the binding cooperativity of transcription factors. Phenotype switching in Bacillus subtilis requires an all-or-none promoter binding of multiple ComK proteins. Here, we use single-molecule FRET to demonstrate that ComK-binding at one promoter site increases a/uniFB03nity at a distant site. Cryo-EM structures of the complex between ComK and its promoter demonstrate that this coupling is due to mechanical forces that alter DNA curvature. Modi/uniFB01cations of the spacer between sites tune cooperativity and show how to control allostery, which paves new ways to design the dynamic properties of genetic circuits. /two.pnum/two.pnumUnderstanding the enhancer code in regulation of transcription Dimple Notani MS NCBS, Bangalore Expression of genes is controlled by DNA sequences that are distal from the promoters known as enhancers. They regulate target genes by establishing looping with the promoter. There are thousands of enhancers in mammalians genomes and they act in a cell-type speci/uniFB01c manner. Although discovered over forty years ago, how enhancers regulate their promoters remains poorly understood. Further, the enhancers that drive cyclic signaling response, are reversibly dynamic as opposed to developmental enhancers, adding another layer of complexity to this conundrum. Using genomic techniques that quantify the alterations in TF binding, nascent transcription, three- dimensional architecture during the course of estrogen signaling, our work has revealed that chromatin state under basal signaling is the key to signaling response. Certain regions in the genome are bound by estrogen receptor (ER) even before the exposure to ligand. These regions act as a seed to give rise to ER bound enhancer clusters and ER condensates to drive the signaling response. Further, these and other enhancer clusters do not function as sum-of-all but they rely on complex hierarchies that cannot be predicted in silico. I will discuss how enhancers and condensates regulate the genome organization and how promiscuous transcription and mutations in these enhancers leads to diseases and cancer. /two.pnum/three.pnumSingle-Molecule Analysis of DNA Base-Stacking Energetics Using Patterned DNA Nanostructures Mahipal Ganji MS IISc, Bangalore DNA double helix structure is stabilized by the base-pairing and the base-stacking interactions. Base-stacking interactions originating from hydrophobic interactions between the nucleobases predominantly contribute to the duplex stability. A comprehensive understanding of dinucleotide base-stacking energetics is lacking owing to the unavailability of sensitive techniques that can measure these weak interactions. Earlier studies attempting to address this question only managed to estimate the base-stacking interactions in either bulk sample or in a bundle of DNA helices, however, disentangling base-stacking interactions on individual DNA strand was enigmatic. By combining multiplexed DNA-PAINT imaging with designer DNA nanostructures, we experimentally measure the free energy of dinucleotide base-stacking at the single-molecule level. Multiplexed imaging enabled us to extract binding kinetics of an imager strand with and without additional dinucleotide stacking interactions in a single imaging experiment, abolishing any e/uniFB00ects of experi- mental variations. The DNA-PAINT data showed that a single additional dinucleotide base-stacking results in as much as /two.pnum/five.pnum/zero.pnum-fold stabilization for the DNA duplex nanostructure. We found that the dinucleotide base-stacking the application of base-stacking energetics in designing DNA-PAINT probes for multiplexed super-resolution imaging. Our results will aid in designing functional DNA nanostructures, DNA and RNA aptamers, and facilitate better predictions of the local DNA structure. /two.pnum/four.pnumPredicting coarse-grained chromatin polymer properties from nucleosome-level contact data Ranjith Padinhateeri MS Department of Biosciences and Bioengineering, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai Making coarse-grained chromatin models is essential to interpret experimental data and to simulate and predict chromatin organization/dynamics. It is common to model chromatin as a bead spring chain, with each bead representing lengths /one.pnumkb, /one.pnum/zero.pnumkb, or /one.pnum/zero.pnum/zero.pnumkb of the genome. However, we do not know the physical dimensions (radius) of these beads and the properties (stretching elasticity, bending elasticity, etc.) of the chain. To bridge this gap, we simulated a large ensemble of chromatin con/uniFB01gurations at near-nucleosome (/two.pnum/zero.pnum/zero.pnumbp) resolution, consistent with recently published Micro-C data. We then systematically coarsegrained the con/uniFB01gurations and predicted quantities essential for chromatin polymer representation. We predict the size (physical dimension) of chromatin beads for a range of scales from /one.pnumkb to /one.pnum/zero.pnum/zero.pnums of kb and compute various polymer properties such as stretching elasticity, bending /uniFB02uctuations, and intrinsic angle among polymer beads. Unlike the prevalent notion, we show that coarse-grained chromatin polymer beads should be considered as soft particles that can overlap, and we propose an overlap parameter. We show that accounting for such overlap is necessary to predict /three.pnumD distances from simulations accurately. Our results also show how chromatin polymer properties vary along the genome depending on the local chromatin state Simons Lecture: Recreational Biology - Topological Puzzles in cell biology Manu Prakash PS Stanford University, Woods Institute for the Environment Recreational mathematics involves mathematical puzzles and games, often appealing to children and untrained adults, inspiring their further study of the subject. Can a similar analogy be drawn in biology? Without making any claims of usefulness, we will explore a wide range of topological puzzles in cellular physiology: Can single cells be toroidal in nature? Can cytoskeletal geometry encode complex behavior in free living protists? Do cells get stuck in topological traps? Finally, we will re/uniFB02ect on role of curiosity as an engine for discovery in life sciences. /two.pnum/five.pnumActive mechanics of epithelial monolayers Mandar Inamdar MS Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay Epithelial tissue is formed of a monolayer of polygon-like cells that are connected to each other via cell-cell junctions. These monolayers exhibit some of the most fascinating mechanical behavior that is observed in active matter. In epithelial tissues, interaction between cellular biochemistry, signalling, and cytoskeletal machinery leads to the generation of active forcing. This cell-level mechanochemistry can produce long-range spatio-temporal patterns of cellular strains and junc- tional remodeling within the tissue. In many cases, just a few key ingredients of cell-level dynamics are su/uniFB03cient in dictating the broad nature of kinematic and stress patterns in epithelial tissues. In this context, I will present some of our work on modeling collective cell migration and morphogen- esis in epithelial monolayers. Unravelling the mechanobiology of cell competition during cancer initiation Tamal Das MS Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Hyderabad Cell competition is a collective process of sensing and eliminating 'un/uniFB01t' cells by the normal cells, towards maintaining tissue /uniFB01tness, form, and function. In our body, it underlies a fundamental anti-tumour activity called the epithelial defence against cancer (EDAC). EDAC involves non-cell autonomous removal of the transformed cells. Those cells, if allowed to persist, would otherwise initiate cancer. In spite of its physiological signi/uniFB01cance, the mechanisms underlying EDAC remain largely elusive. In our group, we are trying to unravel how cellular forces and tissue mechanics regulate EDAC. To this end, we /uniFB01rst found that the mechanical sti/uniFB00ness of the extracellular matrix is a critical parameter in EDAC and matrix sti/uniFB00ening attenuates the defence against activated HRAS-transformed cells. Next, we discovered that before the transformed cells extruded out, they experienced compressive stress. Interestingly, we found that it is not the proliferative di/uniFB00erential but a mechanical di/uniFB00erential that generates this compressive stress and drives the competition between normal and transformed cells. Finally, we are elucidating the role of nuclear mechanics in this process. Taken together, our discoveries have disrupted the conventional landscape of cancer research by enforcing a mechanobiological view of cancer initiation. /two.pnum/six.pnumEnhanced mixing and inversion /uniFB02ow Sharma MS IISc, Bangalore Extreme con/uniFB01nement of microorganisms between rigid boundaries often arises in their habitat, yet measurements of swimming mechanics in this regime are absent. We show that strongly con/uniFB01ning the microalga Chlamydomonas between two parallel plates not only inhibits its motility through contact friction with the walls but also leads, for purely mechanical reasons, to inversion of the surrounding vortex /uniFB02ows. Our experimental data naturally leads to a simpli/uniFB01ed theoretical description of /uniFB02ow /uniFB01elds based on a quasi-/two.pnumD Brinkman approximation to the Stokes equation rather than the usual method of images. We /uniFB01nd that the vortex /uniFB02ow inversion provides advantage of enhanced /uniFB02uid mixing despite higher friction. Overall, our results o/uniFB00er a comprehensive framework for analyzing the collective /uniFB02ows of strongly con/uniFB01ned swimmers. How transcriptions factors associate in /three.pnumD chromatin Rahul Siddharthan MS The Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai Transcription factors (TFs) regulate genes combinatorially. The logic of their cooperative or compet- itive action has been studied in detail across model organisms but mainly in the context of linear, contiguous genomic sequence such as promoters. However, sequentially distant regions of DNA are brought into spatial proximity by the /three.pnumD conformation of the genome, enabling distal gene regulation by enhancers. The study of such /three.pnumD TF-TF interaction is nascent. Here we examine in detail, across multiple cell lines, such cooperation or competition among TFs both in sequential and spatial proximity (using chromatin conformation capture assays) on one hand, and based on both in vivo binding as well as TF binding motifs on the other. We ascertain signi/uniFB01cantly co-occurring (\"attractive\") or avoiding (\"repulsive\") TF pairs using robust randomized models that retain the essential characteristics of the experimental data. TFs organize into two groups, with intra-group attraction and inter-group repulsion. This is true for both sequential and spatial proximity, for both in vivo binding and motifs. The two TF groups di/uniFB00er signi/uniFB01cantly in their genomic and net- work properties, as well in their function\u2014while one group regulates housekeeping function, the other potentially regulates lineage-speci/uniFB01c functions. Our results suggest a complex pattern of spatial cooperativity of TFs that has evolved along with the genome to support housekeeping and lineage-speci/uniFB01c functions. /two.pnum/seven.pnumInferring principles of cell fate control from correlated cancer cell lineages Shaon Chakrabarti MS NCBS, Bangalore Rapid technological advances are now allowing measurements of various biological parameters at the single cell level. While such univariate distributions provide interesting insights into cell-to-cell variability and heterogeneity in cell states, much less explored and understood are the implications of correlations amongst single cells. Particularly in cellular populations that are growing and dividing, there is increasing realization that lineage correlations can provide key biological insights that cannot be gleaned simply from single-cell distributions alone. In this talk, I will demonstrate how lineage correlations in cell-fate after drug treatment allow inference of underlying cell-fate control mechanisms in cancer cells. Utilizing an experimental setup where both single cell kinetics as well as population dynamics are recorded for the same cells, I will show how the ubiquitous exponential growth model (and generalizations such as age-structured models), fail to predict population growth rates of drug-treated cancer cells from single cell measurements. In essence, the widely used birth and death rates play very little role in establishing the population dynamics of drug treated cells. I will argue that the key to resolving this paradox lies in accounting for cell-fate correlations, which indicate that fate decisions occur well before addition of the drug, suggesting a Darwinian rather than Lamarckian origin of cell fate. Finally, I will argue how our results are consistent with recent experiments where a lack of reduction in barcode diversity was interpreted as indicative of drug-induced cell fate decisions. Building the cell from unreliable parts: coordinating stochastic organelle biogen- esis with USA Perhaps the de/uniFB01ning feature of the eukaryotic cell is its organization into membrane-bound com- partments known as organelles. While the processes underlying the biogenesis of individual organelles are often well-known, the precision with which individual cells exert quantitative control over individual organelle properties, such as number and size, and coordinate these properties at systems-scale across the cell's many di/uniFB00erent types of organelles remain frontier problems in cell biology and biophysics. Using a combination of theory and quantitative /uniFB02uorescence imaging, I will describe our recent e/uniFB00orts to show that cells exhibit substantial limits to the precision with which they can control organelle numbers and sizes, but despite this appear to collectively organize systems-level organelle biogenesis into speci/uniFB01c \"modes\" that balance the need for cell growth to be both robust yet responsive to the environment. /two.pnum/eight.pnumDay /three.pnum: Wednesday, /two.pnum/nine.pnum March, /two.pnum/zero.pnum/two.pnum/three.pnum Mechano-Genomics of Cell-State ETH Zurich Paul Scherrer Institute, Switzerland Extracellular mechano-chemical signals regulate gene expression programs and cell-state transi- tions, although the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. In this talk, I will /uniFB01rst highlight the tight coupling between cell geometry/mechanics, /three.pnumD chromosome organization, and gene expression. I will then discuss how sustained mechanical signals, through cell-geometric con/uniFB01nement, can induce cell-state transitions and provide avenues to rejuvenate aging cells. Furthermore, I will show that spatio-temporal alterations in chromatin organization, identi/uniFB01ed using /uniFB02uorescence imaging combined with machine learning, can serve as robust biomarkers for cell-state transitions in tissue microenvironments. Collectively, our results may have important applications in regenerative medicine and early disease diagnostics Fluidity and rheological response in con/uniFB02uent epithelial tissues Dapeng Max Bi PS Department of Physics Northeastern University Biological processes, from morphogenesis to tumor invasion, spontaneously generate shear stresses inside living tissue. The mechanisms that govern the transmission of mechanical forces in epithelia and the collective response of the tissue to bulk shear deformations remain, however, poorly understood. Using a minimal cell-based computational model, we investigate the constitutive relation of con/uniFB02uent tissues under simple shear deformation. We show that an initially undeformed /uniFB02uidlike tissue acquires /uniFB01nite rigidity above a critical applied strain. This is akin to the shear-driven rigidity observed in other soft matter systems. Interestingly, shear-driven rigidity can be understood by a critical scaling analysis in the vicinity of the second order critical point that governs the liquid- solid transition of the undeformed system. We further show that a solid like tissue responds linearly only to small strains and but then switches to a nonlinear response at larger stains, with substantial sti/uniFB00ening. Finally, we propose a mean-/uniFB01eld formulation for cells under shear that o/uniFB00ers a simple physical explanation of shear-driven rigidity and nonlinear response in a tissue. /two.pnum/nine.pnumBiophysical basis of left-right symmetry breaking in vertebrates Hiroshi Hamada PS RIKEN Center for Biosystems Dynamics Research Our body looks left-right (L-R) symmetric from outside, but visceral organs are L-R asymmetric in terms of their shape, position and size. L-R asymmetry of the body is established early during development. In many of vertebrates including mammals, breaking of L-R symmetry takes place at the region of the embryo called the left-right organizer (the node in the mouse embryo) and involves uni-directional /uniFB02uid /uniFB02ow generated by motile cilia at the left-right organizer. The /uniFB02uid /uniFB02ow is sensed by another type of cilia, immotile cilia located at the periphery of the node. When immotile cilia sense the /uniFB02ow, Ca/two.pnum+enters the cell, and the target (Dand/five.pnum mRNA) via Bicc/one.pnum Ccr/four.pnum complex. The Bicc/one.pnum recognizes the speci/uniFB01c sequence of the /three.pnum'-untranslated region of Dand/five.pnum mRNA, recruit Ccr/four.pnum and induces degradation of the mRNA. This /uniFB02ow-stimulated Dand/five.pnum mRNA degradation occurs only on the left side, generating the /uniFB01rst molecular asymmetry in the embryo. It remains to be seen how the Bicc/one.pnum-Ccr/four.pnum complex is activated by Ca/two.pnum+. A long-standing question in the /uniFB01eld has been what precisely immotile cilia at the node sense: do they sense a chemical molecule transported by the /uniFB02ow, mechanical force generated by the /uniFB02ow or something else? We have addressed this issue by employing biophysical methods such as optical tweezers, and have obtained the results suggesting that mechanical stimuli to immotile cilia induces of immotile cilia on the both sides in response to the /uniFB02ow and anisotrophic localization of channel protein Pkd/two.pnum the leftward /uniFB02ow activates immotile cilia on the left side but not those on the right side. Alpha-amylase and Lipid Membrane Interaction Tripta Bhatia MS IISER Mohali We prepared giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) of cell size to study their interactions with peptides, proteins. Amylase is an important amylolytic enzyme that participates in the hydrolysis of starch, the most common carbohydrate in nature. We experimentally investigate the interaction of alpha- amylase with the lipid membrane and show that, below a threshold concentration of enzyme, the rigidity of the membrane is enhanced. The mechanical properties of GUVs are experimentally quanti/uniFB01ed by vesicle /uniFB02uctuation analysis (VFA). The VFA technique can be used to extract infor- mation about the physics of the membrane contour /uniFB02uctuations of giant vesicles visible under optical microscopy. Our data estimate a quantitative coupling between membrane asymmetry and /uniFB02exibility. /three.pnum/zero.pnumProbing protein degradation by ATP-dependent force spectroscopy Hema Chandra Kotamarthi MS Department of Chemistry Indian Institute of Technology, Madras Protein degradation is an essential cellular process that maintains protein homeostasis and is car- ried out by ATP-dependent proteasomes and proteases. These act as mechano-enzymes, unfolding and translocating substrate proteins mechanically that are to be degraded in an energy-dependent manner during cycles of ATP hydrolysis. Optical tweezers-based singlemolecule assays, in addition to providing information on motor properties such as translocation velocities and stepping kinetics, also revealed previously hidden mechanisms during unfolding and translocation. Double-ring protease ClpAP with ATPase been probed using these assays to understand the functioning and coordination of individual rings. Our single-molecule experiments have dissected the e/uniFB00ect of the non-hydrolyzing D/one.pnum module on the unfolding and translocation of substrates ClpAP . Although the D/one.pnum module hydrolyses only /one.pnum/zero.pnum percent of total ATP turned over by ClpAP , abolishing this hydrolysis reduced the unfolding rate of a model substrate /one.pnum/zero.pnum-fold and the average translocation velocity by /six.pnum/zero.pnum percent. These single-molecule results suggest that defects in ATPhydrolysis in the D/one.pnum ring cause loss of coordination between the two rings resulting in the mis/uniFB01ring of the D/two.pnum motor domain and provide new insight into the functional importance of the ClpA D/one.pnum ATPase module and the role of coordination between each ClpA AAA+ ring. Our current research involves probing the in/uniFB02uence of the substrates and ligands on unfold- ing, hexameric ATPase, Mpa of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis proteasomal complex. A tale of Tau: Associations and Phase Separation Markus Zweckstetter MS MPI, G\u00f6ttingen Cells contain multiple compartments dedicated to the regulation and control of biochemical reac- tions. Cellular compartments that are not surrounded by membranes can rapidly form and dissolve in response to changes in the cellular environment. The physicochemical processes that underlie the formation of non-membrane-bound compartments in vivo are connected to liquid-liquid phase separation of proteins and nucleic acids in vitro. Recent evidence suggests that the protein tau, which plays an important role in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders, phase separates in solution, forms tau phases with microtubules, and associates with phase-separated RNA-binding protein granules in cells. In my presentation I will review the experimental evidence that supports the ability of tau to phase separate and form biomolecular condensates. I will further discuss my lab's e/uniFB00orts to target tau phase separation and the spreading of tau aggregates in the brain using small molecules. /three.pnum/one.pnumActive Patterns in Cell Polarity and Cell Division Vijay Krishnamurthy MS ICTS Bangalore Mechanical forces in cells and tissues arise primarily from the nonequilibrium ATP-consuming activity of the cytoskeleton. At larger scales of description, hydrodynamic /uniFB02ows resulting from these active stresses lead to the emergence of spatiotemporal patterns. We will /uniFB01rst show that such hydrodynamical /uniFB02ows trigger the establishment of anteroposterior polarity in C. elegans zygotes -a guided self-organization pattern. Next, we will demonstrate that these active stresses drive the geometrodynamics of cell and tissue shapes. In particular, we will discuss our ongoing work to model ingression asymmetries during cytokinesis within this framework. Polygenic adaptation dynamics in a large, /uniFB01nite population Kavita Jain MS JNCASR Bangalore Although many phenotypic traits are determined by a large number of genetic variants, how a polygenic trait adapts in response to a change in the environment is not completely understood. I will describe our recent results on the adaptation dynamics of a large but /uniFB01nite population evolving under stabilizing selection. It is known that in an in/uniFB01nitely large population, selective sweeps at a major locus are prevented and adaptation proceeds exclusively via subtle changes in the allele frequency; in contrast, we /uniFB01nd that the chance of sweeps is substantially enhanced in a /uniFB01nite population and therefore polygenic adaptation can occur via small to moderate changes in the allele frequencies at many loci as well as large shifts in the allele frequencies at a few loci. /three.pnum/two.pnumStructural determinants of relaxation dynamics in a class of ligation-cleavage chemical reaction networks Sandeep Krishna MS NCBS Bangalore Understanding the relationship between the structure of chemical reaction networks and their reaction dynamics is crucial for understanding the functioning of living organisms. While some network-structural features are known to relate to the steady-state characteristics of chemical reaction networks, mathematical frameworks describing the links between out-of-steady-state dynamics and network structure are still underdeveloped. Here, we examine the relaxation dy- namics, after large perturbations, of a class of minimal chemical reaction networks consisting of the ligation and cleavage reactions of simple polymers. These networks satisfy mass-conservation and other key properties of general chemical reaction networks. We /uniFB01nd three types of relaxation dynamics: exponential, power-law, and plateau. We show that three features computed from a submatrix of the network's stoichiometric matrix are su/uniFB03cient to predict the type of the dynamics, namely, (i) the rank, determining the existence of a steady-state; (ii) the left null-space, being related to conserved quantities in the dynamics; and (iii) the stoichiometric cone, dictating the range of achievable chemical concentrations. We further show that these three quantities also predict the type of relaxation dynamics of combinations of our minimal networks, larger networks with many redundant pathways, and a real example of a metabolic network. Active particles in soft con/uniFB01nement Bibhu Ranjan Sarangi MS IIT Palakkad The motion of a passive Brownian particle is a manifestation of equilibrium thermal /uniFB02uctuations. On the other hand, active particles which are self-propelled are capable of taking energy from the environment and converting it into directed motion. The active particles moving in an homoge- neous environment without physical con/uniFB01nements have been investigated both theoretically and experimentally. However the e/uniFB00ect of con/uniFB01nement on active particle dynamics is an emerging area of research due to its relevance to biological systems. We have investigated the e/uniFB00ect of soft boundaries on the Brownian dynamics of active particles. In this talk we will discuss some of our recent results obtained from con/uniFB01ned natural active particles. /three.pnum/three.pnumLesson from smart slime: How active /uniFB02ow networks process information for complex behaviour Karen Alim MS TU Munich Propagating, storing and processing information is key to take smart decisions - for organisms as well as for autonomous devices. In search for the minimal units that allow for complex behaviour the slime mould Physarum polycephalum stands out by solving complex optimization problems despite its simple make-up. Physarum's body is an interlaced network of /uniFB02uid-/uniFB01lled tubes lacking any nervous system, in fact being a single gigantic cell. Yet, Physarum /uniFB01nds the shortest path through a maze. We unravel that Physarum's complex behaviour emerges from the physics of active /uniFB02ows shu/uniFB04ing through its tubular networks. Flows transport information, information that is stored in the architecture of the network. Thus, tubular adaptation drives processing of information into complex behaviour. Taking inspiration from the mechanisms in Physarum we outline how to embed complex behaviour in active micro/uniFB02uidic devices and how to program human vasculature. The Unreasonable E/uniFB00ectiveness of Reaction-Di/uniFB00usion in Vertebrate Skin Colour Patterning Michel Milinkovitch PS Laboratory of Arti/uniFB01cial Natural Evolution (LANE), Dept. of Genetics Evolution, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Geneva, Switzerland First, I will show that scale-by-scale ontogenic colour change dynamics has evolved independently in multiple species of lizards. Second, I will show that deterministic reaction-di/uniFB00usion (RD) can quantitatively predict, not only the bulk statistical properties of adult patterns, but also, more surprisingly, a large proportion of the scale-by-scale patterns of individual animals. Third, I will discuss how we identify and quantify the sources of the residual error of individual scale-by-scale patterns. Finally, I will show that RD models predict, in ocellated lizards, unsuspected subtle colour sub-clustering that correlates with the colours of the scales' neighbours. Hyperspectral imaging and histological analyses indicate that colour sub-clustering is present in real lizards, con/uniFB01rming the numerical model non-trivial prediction.
