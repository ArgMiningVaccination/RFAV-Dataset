About Our Drug Formulary Our drug formulary is considered a closed formulary, which means that medications on the list are usually covered under the prescription drug Rider. However , drugs on our formulary may not be automatically covered under your prescription drug Rider depending on which plan you've selected. Even though nonformulary drugs are generally not covered und er your prescription drug Rider, your Kaiser Permanente physician can sometimes request a nonformulary drug for you, specifically when formulary alternatives have failed or use of nonformulary drug is Medically N ecessary, provided the drug is not ex cluded under the prescription drug Rider. Kaiser Permanente pharmacies may substitute a chemical or generic equivalent for a brand - name/specialty drug unless this is prohibited by your Kaiser Permanente physician. If you want a brand - name/specialty drug for which there is a generic equivalent, or if you request a non -formulary drug, you will be charged Member Rates for these selections, since they are not covered under your prescription drug Rider. If your K aiser Permanente physician deems a higher priced drug to be M edically Necessary when a less expensive drug is available, you pay the usual drug Cost Share . If you request the higher priced drug and it has not been deemed M edically Necessary, you will be charged Member Rates. Note: If your prescription allows refills, there are limits to how early you can receive a refill. We will refill your prescription when you have used at least 75 percent of the quantity, unless otherwise directed by Kaiser Permanente.

If its dec ision was provided orally, then the IRO must send its decision in writing within 48 hours of the oral notice. If a majority of the clinical reviewers recommend that the service or treatment should be covered, then the IRO must reverse Kaiser Permanente's a dverse decision. If a majority of the reviewers recommend that 2023 Kaiser Permanente Hawaii's Guide - KPIF 85 Chapter 8: Dispute Resolution the service or treatment should not be covered, then the IRO will make a decision to uphold Kaiser Permanente's adverse decision. If the reviewers are evenly split as to whether the service or treatment should be covered, then the IRO must obtain the opinion of another clinical reviewer. The processing timeframes are not extended if the IRO needs to obtain the opinion of an additional reviewer. For non -expedited requests involving an experimenta l or investigational service or treatment that are determined eligible for external review, the commissioner has three business days after the eligibility decision was made to assign the case to an IRO approved by the Insurance Division and provide Kaiser Permanente with the name of the IRO. We must submit to the IRO within five business days of our receipt of the name of the IRO all the documents and information that we considered during our internal review of your request. You or your authorized represent ative may submit additional written information to the IRO within five business days of your receipt of the Insurance Division's notice that your case was assigned to an IRO. The IRO must select one or more clinical reviewers within three business days aft er it was assigned to perform the external review. Each reviewer must provide its opinion to the IRO in writing within 20 days of the date the IRO was assigned to perform the review. The IRO must then provide its written decision to you, your authorized re presentative, and Kaiser Permanente within 20 days after the opinions were received. The IRO must decide to reverse or uphold Kaiser Permanente's adverse decision in the same manner discussed earlier based on a majority of the clinical reviewers' recommend ations. Procedures Applicable to All Requests for External Review The IRO's decision is binding on you and Kaiser Permanente except for any additional remedies that may be available to you or Kaiser Permanente under applicable federal or state law. You or your authorized representative may not file a subsequent request for external review involving the same adverse decision for which you already received an external decision. When filing any request for external review, you must include a copy of Kaiser Per manente's final ABD with your request, unless you are seeking simultaneous expedited external review, or we have substantially failed to comply with our internal appeals procedures. You or your authorized representative will also be required to authorize t he release of your medical records that need to be reviewed for the external appeal, as well as provide written disclosure that permits the commissioner to perform a conflict of interest evaluation as part of the selection process for an appropriate IRO. Y ou can find forms that meet each requirement on our website at kp.org or by calling Member Services at the phone number listed in the back of this guide. Lastly, a $15 filing fee must be included with the external appeal request. The filing fee will be refunded if Kaiser Permanente's adverse determination is reversed through the external review or the commissioner waives the fee because it poses an undue hardship on you. Your request will be considered incomplete and the external review delayed if you do no t submit all the required information with the request. When you submit a request for external review, the commissioner will inform Kaiser Permanente about your request. We will be responsible for notifying the commissioner and you or your authorized repre sentative in writing whether the request is complete and eligible for external review. If we believe 2023 Kaiser Permanente Hawaii's Guide - KPIF 86 Chapter 8: Dispute Resolution your request is not eligible for external review, you may file an appeal with the commissioner. Our notice of ineligibility will include information on req uesting this appeal. You must exhaust Kaiser Permanente's internal claims and appeals process before you may request external review, except when external review is permitted to occur simultaneously for requests that qualify for expedited review, or we have failed to comply with applicable claims and appeals requirements under federal or state law. You may have certain additional rights if you remain dissatisfied after you have exhausted our internal claims and appeals procedures and external review. If you are enrolled through a plan that is subject to ERISA, you may file a civil action under section 502(a) of ERISA. To understand these rights, you should check with your benefits office or contact the Employee Benefits Security Administration (part of the U.S. Department of Labor) at 1-866-444-3272 . Alternatively, if your plan is not subject to ERISA (for example, most state or local government plans and church plans or all individual plans), you may have a right to request review in state court. Different procedures apply to the following plans: Kaiser Permanente Senior Advantage, Kaiser Permanente QUEST Integration, and the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. Members on these plans should consult their respective Evidence of Coverage, hand book, or brochure for a description of the independent external review procedures that apply to them.

Refusal to accept treatment Certain Members may, for personal reasons, refuse to accept procedures or treatment recommended by Physicians. Physicians may regard such refusal as incompatible with the continuance of a satisfactory physician- patient relationship and as obstructing the provision of proper medical care. Physicians use their best efforts to render all necessary and appropriate professional services in a manner compatible with a Member's wishes, ins ofar as this can be done consistently with the Physician's judgment regarding proper medical practice. If a Member refuses to follow a recommended treatment or procedure for a condition, and the Physician believes that no professionally acceptable alternative exists, the Member will be so advised. If the Member still refuses to follow the recommended treatment or procedure, then neither Medical Group, Hospitals, Health Plan nor any Physician has any further responsibility to provide any alternative treatm ent or procedure sought by Member for that condition.
