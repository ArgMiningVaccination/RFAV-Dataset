Legislative findings and declarations relating to Western Climate 23 Initiative, Inc. 24 SEC. ___. Section 12894.5 of the Government Code is amended to read: 25 12894.5. (a) The Legislature finds and declares both of the following: 26 (1) California's participation in the Western Climate Initiative, Incorporated, 27 requires that its sole purpose be to provide operational and technical support to 28 California in its implementation of Division 25.5 (commencing with Section 38500) 29 of the Health and Safety Code and to provide support to the greenhouse gas 30 emissions reduction programs of other jurisdictions. Given its limited scope of 31 activities, the Western Climate Initiative, Incorporated, does not have the authority 32 to create policy with respect to any existing or future program or regulation 33 undertaken pursuant to Division 25.5 (commencing with Section 38500) of the 34 Health and Safety Code. 35 (2) The state recognizes the ongoing efforts of the Western Climate Initiative, 36 Incorporated, have resulted in policies that are consistent with the Bagley-Keene 37 Open Meeting Act (Article 9 (commencing with Section 11120) of Chapter 1 of Part 38 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code) and the California Public 39 Records Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 6250) of Division 7 Division 40 10 (commencing with Section 7920.000) of Title 1 of the Government Code) 1), as 41 well as bylaws that meet the requirements of this section. 42 STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 14, 2019 - 226 - (b) The California membership of the Board of Directors of the Western Climate 1 Initiative, Incorporated, as established pursuant to Section 12894, shall participate 2 on the board so long as the Western Climate Initiative, Incorporated, maintains 3 policies and bylaws according to all of the following: 4 (1) An open meetings policy that is and remains consistent with the general 5 policies of the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act (Article 9 (commencing with 6 Section 11120) of Chapter 1 of Part 1) and affords the public the greatest possible 7 access consistent with the other duties of the Western Climate Initiative, 8 Incorporated. 9 (2) A records availability policy that is and remains consistent with the general 10 policies of the California Public Records Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with 11 Section 6250) of Division 7 Division 10 (commencing with Section 7920.000) of 12 Title 1) and affords the public access to corporate records consistent with the 13 operating needs and other duties of the Western Climate Initiative, Incorporated, 14 and all applicable legal privileges. 15 (3) Bylaws that limit the activities of the Western Climate Initiative, Incorporated, 16 to the technical and operational support of the greenhouse gas emissions reduction 17 programs of California and other jurisdictions. These bylaws shall not allow the 18 Western Climate Initiative, Incorporated, to have policymaking authority with 19 respect to these programs. 20 (c) The State Air Resources Board shall provide notice to the Joint Legislative 21 Budget Committee for all procurements over one hundred fifty thousand dollars 22 ($150,000) proposed by the Western Climate Initiative, Incorporated, that are 23 expected to result in a contract no later than 30 days prior to the execution of those 24 contracts. 25 (d) Commencing January 1, 2014, the State Air Resources Board shall include 26 information on all proposed expenditures and allocations of moneys to the Western 27 Climate Initiative, Incorporated, in the Governor's Budget. 28 Comment. Section 12894.5 is amended to reflect nonsubstantive recodification of the California 29 Public Records Act. See California Public Records Act Clean-Up, __ Cal. L.

Section 15570.42 of the Government Code is amended to read: 35 15570.42. Pursuant to Section 6253 Article 1 (commencing with Section 36 7922.630) of Chapter 2 of Part 3 of Division 10 of Title 1, the department shall 37 adopt regulations to establish procedures and guidelines to access public records. 38 These regulations shall facilitate maximum public accessibility to the department's 39 public records. These regulations shall specifically identify and describe the types 40 of public records pertaining to the tax and the fee programs administered by the 41 department. 42 STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 14, 2019 - 227 - Comment. Section 15570.42 is amended to reflect nonsubstantive recodification of the 1 California Public Records Act (\"CPRA\"). See California Public Records Act Clean-Up, __ Cal. L. 2 Revision Comm'n Reports __ (2019). 3 The amendment also corrects a cross-reference to \"Section 6253.\" When Section 15570.42 was 4 enacted in 2017, it was apparently modeled on Section 15652. It closely tracked the language of 5 that section, including the cross-reference to \"Section 6253.\" Compare 2017 Cal. Stat. ch. 16, 5 6 with 1998 Cal. Stat. ch. \u00a7 2. However, Section 15652's cross-reference to \"Section 6253\" 7 was obsolete because former Section 6253 was amended and renumbered as Section 6253.4 in 1998 8 (see 1998 Cal. Stat. ch. 620, \u00a7 4; see also Section 15652 Comment). Pursuant to the CPRA 9 Recodification Act of 2020, Section 6253.4 has in turn been repealed and recodified as Article 1 of 10 Chapter 2 of Part 3 of Division 10 of Title 1 (Sections 7922.630-7922.640). That article is now the 11 proper cross-reference to include in Sections 15652 and 15570.42; it contains the CPRA material 12 on adoption of regulations. 13 \u00a7 15650 (amended). \"Public record\" 14 SEC. ___.

Section 15650 is amended to reflect nonsubstantive recodification of the California 18 Public Records Act. See California Public Records Act Clean-Up, __ Cal. L. Revision Comm'n 19 Reports __ (2019). 20 The amendment also corrects a cross-reference to subdivision (d) of former Section 6252, which 21 became obsolete when subdivision (d) was relabeled as subdivision (e). Compare 1998 Cal. Stat. 22 ch. 1049, \u00a7 2 (original version of Section 15650, which cross-refers to \"any public record as defined 23 in subdivision (d) of Section 6252\") with 1994 Cal.

These regulations shall specifically identify and describe the types of public 36 records pertaining to the tax and the fee programs maintained by the board. 37 Comment. Section 15652 is amended to reflect nonsubstantive recodification of the California 38 Public Records Act (\"CPRA\"). See California Public Records Act Clean-Up, __ Cal. L. Revision 39 Comm'n Reports __ (2019). 40 The amendment also corrects a cross-reference to \"Section 6253.\" When Section 15652 was 41 added to the codes by 1998 Cal. Stat. ch. 1049, \u00a7 2, the CPRA material on adoption of regulations 42 was located in former Section 6253 (see Gov. Reorg. Plan No. 1 of 1991, \u00a7 70). Shortly afterwards, 43 former Section 6253 was amended and renumbered as Section 6253.4 (see 1998 Cal. Stat. ch. 620, 44 \u00a7 4, which became operative on Jan. 1, 1999).

This is explicitly recognized in amendments to tribal-3 state gaming compacts ratified by the Legislature, which provide for the 4 securitization of annual payments to be received from the tribes by the state or by 5 an agency, trust, fund, or entity specified by the state. 6 (2) In order to review the records of any Indian tribe relative to this securitization, 7 the compacts require the execution of nondisclosure agreements. 8 (3) State entities statutorily charged with participating in the bond sale cannot 9 perform those duties in the absence of that agreement, and the Legislature hereby 10 acknowledges and agrees that documents containing tribal information are not 11 public records, shall not be discussed in an open meeting, and that state officials 12 privy to that information may execute nondisclosure agreements. 13 (b) Nothing in Chapter 3.5 of Division 7 of Title 1 (commencing with Section 14 6250) Division 10 (commencing with Section 7920.000) of Title 1 or any other 15 provision of law shall permit the disclosure of any records of an Indian tribe received 16 by the state, or by an agency, trust fund, or entity specified by the state, in connection 17 with the sale of any portions of the designated tribal-state gaming compact assets or 18 the issuance of bonds, or any summaries or analyses thereof. The transmission of 19 the records, or the information contained in those records in an alternative form, to 20 the state or the special purpose trust shall not constitute a waiver of exemption from 21 disclosure, and the records and information once transmitted to the state or special 22 purpose trust shall be subject to this same exemption from disclosure. 23 (c) The state and the special purpose trust are authorized to enter into 24 nondisclosure agreements with Indian tribes agreeing not to disclose the materials 25 described in subdivision (b). 26 (d) The nondisclosure agreements may include provisions limiting the 27 representatives of the state and the special purpose trust authorized to review or 28 receive records of the Indian tribe to those individuals directly working on the sale 29 of portions of the designated compact assets or the issuance of the bonds. 30 (e) Nothing in Article 9 (commencing with Section 11120) of Chapter 1 of Part 1 31 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code shall be construed to prevent the 32 bank from conducting a closed session to consider any records or information of an 33 Indian tribe or any summaries or analyses thereof received by the state in connection 34 with the sale of any portion of the compact assets or the issuance of bonds. 35 Comment. Section 63048.63 is amended to reflect nonsubstantive recodification of the 36 California Public Records Act. See California Public Records Act Clean-Up, __ Cal. L. Revision 37 Comm'n Reports __ (2019). 38 \u00a7 65913.4 (amended). Streamlined, ministerial approval process for development 39 application 40 SEC. ___. Section 65913.4 of the Government Code is amended to read: 41 STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 14, 2019 - 258 - 65913.4. (a) A development proponent may submit an application for a 1 development that is subject to the streamlined, ministerial approval process 2 provided by subdivision (b) and is not subject to a conditional use permit if the 3 development satisfies all of the following objective planning standards: 4 (1) The development is a multifamily housing development that contains two or 5 more residential units. 6 (2) The development is located on a site that satisfies all of the following: 7 (A) A site that is a legal parcel or parcels located in a city if, and only if, the city 8 boundaries include some portion of either an urbanized area or urban cluster, as 9 designated by the United States Census Bureau, or, for unincorporated areas, a legal 10 parcel or parcels wholly within the boundaries of an urbanized area or urban cluster, 11 as designated by the United States Census Bureau. 12 (B) A site in which at least 75 percent of the perimeter of the site adjoins parcels 13 that are developed with urban uses. For the purposes of this section, parcels that are 14 only separated by a street or highway shall be considered to be adjoined. 15 (C) A site that is zoned for residential use or residential mixed-use development, 16 or has a general plan designation that allows residential use or a mix of residential 17 and nonresidential uses, with at least two-thirds of the square footage of the 18 development designated for residential use. Additional density, floor area, and units, 19 and any other concession, incentive, or waiver of development standards granted 20 pursuant to the Density Bonus Law in Section 65915 shall be included in the square 21 footage calculation. The square footage of the development shall not include 22 underground space, such as basements or underground parking garages. 23 (3)(A) The development proponent has committed to record, prior to the issuance 24 of the first building permit, a land use restriction or covenant providing that any 25 lower or moderate income housing units required pursuant to subparagraph (B) of 26 paragraph (4) shall remain available at affordable housing costs or rent to persons 27 and families of lower or moderate income for no less than the following periods of 28 time: 29 (i) Fifty-five years for units that are rented. 30 (ii) Forty-five years for units that are owned. 31 (B) The city or county shall require the recording of covenants or restrictions 32 implementing this paragraph for each parcel or unit of real property included in the 33 development. 34 (4) The development satisfies subparagraphs (A) and (B) below: 35 (A) Is located in a locality that the department has determined is subject to this 36 subparagraph on the basis that the number of units that have been issued building 37 permits, as shown on the most recent production report received by the department, 38 is less than the locality's share of the regional housing needs, by income category, 39 for that reporting period. A locality shall remain eligible under this subparagraph 40 until the department's determination for the next reporting period. 41 (B) The development is subject to a requirement mandating a minimum 42 percentage of below market rate housing based on one of the following: 43 STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 14, 2019 - 259 - (i) The locality did not submit its latest production report to the department by the 1 time period required by Section 65400, or that production report reflects that there 2 were fewer units of above moderate-income housing issued building permits than 3 were required for the regional housing needs assessment cycle for that reporting 4 period. In addition, if the project contains more than 10 units of housing, the project 5 does either of the following: 6 (I) The project dedicates a minimum of 10 percent of the total number of units to 7 housing affordable to households making at or below 80 percent of the area median 8 income. However, if the locality has adopted a local ordinance that requires that 9 greater than 10 percent of the units be dedicated to housing affordable to households 10 making below 80 percent of the area median income, that local ordinance applies. 11 (II)(ia) If the project is located within the San Francisco Bay area, the project, in 12 lieu of complying with subclause (I), dedicates 20 percent of the total number of 13 units to housing affordable to households making below 120 percent of the area 14 median income with the average income of the units at or below 100 percent of the 15 area median income. However, a local ordinance adopted by the locality applies if 16 it requires greater than 20 percent of the units be dedicated to housing affordable to 17 households making at or below 120 percent of the area median income, or requires 18 that any of the units be dedicated at a level deeper than 120 percent. In order to 19 comply with this subclause, the rent or sale price charged for units that are dedicated 20 to housing affordable to households between 80 percent and 120 percent of the area 21 median income shall not exceed 30 percent of the gross income of the household. 22 (ib) For purposes of this subclause, \"San Francisco Bay area\" means the entire 23 area within the territorial boundaries of the Counties of Alameda, Contra Costa, 24 Marin, Napa, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano, and Sonoma, and the City and County 25 of San Francisco. 26 (ii) The locality's latest production report reflects that there were fewer units of 27 housing issued building permits affordable to either very low income or low-income 28 households by income category than were required for the regional housing needs 29 assessment cycle for that reporting period, and the project seeking approval 30 dedicates 50 percent of the total number of units to housing affordable to households 31 making at or below 80 percent of the area median income. However, if the locality 32 has adopted a local ordinance that requires that greater than 50 percent of the units 33 be dedicated to housing affordable to households making at or below 80 percent of 34 the area median income, that local ordinance applies. 35 (iii) The locality did not submit its latest production report to the department by 36 the time period required by Section 65400, or if the production report reflects that 37 there were fewer units of housing affordable to both income levels described in 38 clauses (i) and (ii) that were issued building permits than were required for the 39 regional housing needs assessment cycle for that reporting period, the project 40 seeking approval may choose between utilizing clause (i) or (ii). 41 (C)(i) A development proponent that uses a unit of affordable housing to satisfy 42 the requirements of subparagraph (B) may also satisfy any other local or state 43 STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 14, 2019 - 260 - requirement for affordable housing, including local ordinances or the Density Bonus 1 Law in Section 65915, provided that the development proponent complies with the 2 applicable requirements in the state or local law. 3 (ii) A development proponent that uses a unit of affordable housing to satisfy any 4 other state or local affordability requirement may also satisfy the requirements of 5 subparagraph (B), provided that the development proponent complies with 6 applicable requirements of subparagraph (B). 7 (iii) A development proponent may satisfy the affordability requirements of 8 subparagraph (B) with a unit that is restricted to households with incomes lower 9 than the applicable income limits required in subparagraph (B). 10 (5) The development, excluding any additional density or any other concessions, 11 incentives, or waivers of development standards granted pursuant to the Density 12 Bonus Law in Section 65915, is consistent with objective zoning standards, 13 objective subdivision standards, and objective design review standards in effect at 14 the time that the development is submitted to the local government pursuant to this 15 section. For purposes of this paragraph, \"objective zoning standards,\" \"objective 16 subdivision standards,\" and \"objective design review standards\" mean standards 17 that involve no personal or subjective judgment by a public official and are 18 uniformly verifiable by reference to an external and uniform benchmark or criterion 19 available and knowable by both the development applicant or proponent and the 20 public official before submittal. These standards may be embodied in alternative 21 objective land use specifications adopted by a city or county, and may include, but 22 are not limited to, housing overlay zones, specific plans, inclusionary zoning 23 ordinances, and density bonus ordinances, subject to the following: 24 (A) A development shall be deemed consistent with the objective zoning 25 standards related to housing density, as applicable, if the density proposed is 26 compliant with the maximum density allowed within that land use designation, 27 notwithstanding any specified maximum unit allocation that may result in fewer 28 units of housing being permitted. 29 (B) In the event that objective zoning, general plan, subdivision, or design review 30 standards are mutually inconsistent, a development shall be deemed consistent with 31 the objective zoning and subdivision standards pursuant to this subdivision if the 32 development is consistent with the standards set forth in the general plan. 33 (C) The amendments to this subdivision made by the act adding this subparagraph 34 do not constitute a change in, but are declaratory of, existing law. 35 (6) The development is not located on a site that is any of the following: 36 (A) A coastal zone, as defined in Division 20 (commencing with Section 30000) 37 of the Public Resources Code. 38 (B) Either prime farmland or farmland of statewide importance, as defined 39 pursuant to United States Department of Agriculture land inventory and monitoring 40 criteria, as modified for California, and designated on the maps prepared by the 41 Farmland Mapping and Monitoring Program of the Department of Conservation, or 42 STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 14, 2019 - 261 - land zoned or designated for agricultural protection or preservation by a local ballot 1 measure that was approved by the voters of that jurisdiction. 2 (C) Wetlands, as defined in the United States Fish and Wildlife Service Manual, 3 Part 660 FW 2 (June 21, 1993). 4 (D) Within a very high fire hazard severity zone, as determined by the Department 5 of Forestry and Fire Protection pursuant to Section 51178, or within a high or very 6 high fire hazard severity zone as indicated on maps adopted by the Department of 7 Forestry and Fire Protection pursuant to Section 4202 of the Public Resources Code. 8 This subparagraph does not apply to sites excluded from the specified hazard zones 9 by a local agency, pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 51179, or sites that have 10 adopted fire hazard mitigation measures pursuant to existing building standards or 11 state fire mitigation measures applicable to the development. 12 (E) A hazardous waste site that is listed pursuant to Section 65962.5 or a 13 hazardous waste site designated by the Department of Toxic Substances Control 14 pursuant to Section 25356 of the Health and Safety Code, unless the State 15 Department of Public Health, State Water Resources Control Board, or Department 16 of Toxic Substances Control has cleared the site for residential use or residential 17 mixed uses. 18 (F) Within a delineated earthquake fault zone as determined by the State 19 Geologist in any official maps published by the State Geologist, unless the 20 development complies with applicable seismic protection building code standards 21 adopted by the California Building Standards Commission under the California 22 Building Standards Law (Part 2.5 (commencing with Section 18901) of Division 13 23 of the Health and Safety Code), and by any local building department under Chapter 24 12.2 (commencing with Section 8875) of Division 1 of Title 2. 25 (G) Within a special flood hazard area subject to inundation by the 1 percent 26 annual chance flood (100-year flood) as determined by the Federal Emergency 27 Management Agency in any official maps published by the Federal Emergency 28 Management Agency. If a development proponent is able to satisfy all applicable 29 federal qualifying criteria in order to provide that the site satisfies this subparagraph 30 and is otherwise eligible for streamlined approval under this section, a local 31 government shall not deny the application on the basis that the development 32 proponent did not comply with any additional permit requirement, standard, or 33 action adopted by that local government that is applicable to that site. A 34 development may be located on a site described in this subparagraph if either of the 35 following are met: 36 (i) The site has been subject to a Letter of Map Revision prepared by the Federal 37 Emergency Management Agency and issued to the local jurisdiction. 38 (ii) The site meets Federal Emergency Management Agency requirements 39 necessary to meet minimum flood plain management criteria of the National Flood 40 Insurance Program pursuant to Part 59 (commencing with Section 59.1) and Part 60 41 (commencing with Section 60.1) of Subchapter B of Chapter I of Title 44 of the 42 Code of Federal Regulations. 43 STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 14, 2019 - 262 - (H) Within a regulatory floodway as determined by the Federal Emergency 1 Management Agency in any official maps published by the Federal Emergency 2 Management Agency, unless the development has received a no-rise certification in 3 accordance with Section 60.3(d)(3) of Title 44 of the Code of Federal Regulations. 4 If a development proponent is able to satisfy all applicable federal qualifying criteria 5 in order to provide that the site satisfies this subparagraph and is otherwise eligible 6 for streamlined approval under this section, a local government shall not deny the 7 application on the basis that the development proponent did not comply with any 8 additional permit requirement, standard, or action adopted by that local government 9 that is applicable to that site. 10 (I) Lands identified for conservation in an adopted natural community 11 conservation plan pursuant to the Natural Community Conservation Planning Act 12 (Chapter 10 (commencing with Section 2800) of Division 3 of the Fish and Game 13 Code), habitat conservation plan pursuant to the federal Endangered Species Act of 14 1973 (16 U.S.C. Sec. 1531 et seq.), or other adopted natural resource protection 15 plan. 16 (J) Habitat for protected species identified as candidate, sensitive, or species of 17 special status by state or federal agencies, fully protected species, or species 18 protected by the federal Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. Sec. 1531 et 19 seq.), the California Endangered Species Act (Chapter 1.5 (commencing with 20 Section 2050) of Division 3 of the Fish and Game Code), or the Native Plant 21 Protection Act (Chapter 10 (commencing with Section 1900) of Division 2 of the 22 Fish and Game Code). 23 (K) Lands under conservation easement. 24 (7) The development is not located on a site where any of the following apply: 25 (A) The development would require the demolition of the following types of 26 housing: 27 (i) Housing that is subject to a recorded covenant, ordinance, or law that restricts 28 rents to levels affordable to persons and families of moderate, low, or very low 29 income. 30 (ii) Housing that is subject to any form of rent or price control through a public 31 entity's valid exercise of its police power. 32 (iii) Housing that has been occupied by tenants within the past 10 years. 33 (B) The site was previously used for housing that was occupied by tenants that 34 was demolished within 10 years before the development proponent submits an 35 application under this section. 36 (C) The development would require the demolition of a historic structure that was 37 placed on a national, state, or local historic register. 38 (D) The property contains housing units that are occupied by tenants, and units at 39 the property are, or were, subsequently offered for sale to the general public by the 40 subdivider or subsequent owner of the property. 41 (8) The development proponent has done both of the following, as applicable: 42 (A) Certified to the locality that either of the following is true, as applicable: 43 STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 14, 2019 - 263 - (i) The entirety of the development is a public work for purposes of Chapter 1 1 (commencing with Section 1720) of Part 7 of Division 2 of the Labor Code. 2 (ii) If the development is not in its entirety a public work, that all construction 3 workers employed in the execution of the development will be paid at least the 4 general prevailing rate of per diem wages for the type of work and geographic area, 5 as determined by the Director of Industrial Relations pursuant to Sections 1773 and 6 1773.9 of the Labor Code, except that apprentices registered in programs approved 7 by the Chief of the Division of Apprenticeship Standards may be paid at least the 8 applicable apprentice prevailing rate. If the development is subject to this 9 subparagraph, then for those portions of the development that are not a public work 10 all of the following shall apply: 11 (I) The development proponent shall ensure that the prevailing wage requirement 12 is included in all contracts for the performance of the work. 13 (II) All contractors and subcontractors shall pay to all construction workers 14 employed in the execution of the work at least the general prevailing rate of per 15 diem wages, except that apprentices registered in programs approved by the Chief 16 of the Division of Apprenticeship Standards may be paid at least the applicable 17 apprentice prevailing rate. 18 (III) Except as provided in subclause (V), all contractors and subcontractors shall 19 maintain and verify payroll records pursuant to Section 1776 of the Labor Code and 20 make those records available for inspection and copying as provided therein. 21 (IV) Except as provided in subclause (V), the obligation of the contractors and 22 subcontractors to pay prevailing wages may be enforced by the Labor 23 Commissioner through the issuance of a civil wage and penalty assessment pursuant 24 to Section 1741 of the Labor Code, which may be reviewed pursuant to Section 25 1742 of the Labor Code, within 18 months after the completion of the development, 26 by an underpaid worker through an administrative complaint or civil action, or by a 27 joint labor-management committee through a civil action under Section 1771.2 of 28 the Labor Code. If a civil wage and penalty assessment is issued, the contractor, 29 subcontractor, and surety on a bond or bonds issued to secure the payment of wages 30 covered by the assessment shall be liable for liquidated damages pursuant to Section 31 1742.1 of the Labor Code. 32 (V) Subclauses (III) and (IV) shall not apply if all contractors and subcontractors 33 performing work on the development are subject to a project labor agreement that 34 requires the payment of prevailing wages to all construction workers employed in 35 the execution of the development and provides for enforcement of that obligation 36 through an arbitration procedure.

The 43 STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 14, 2019 - 264 - requirement to pay at least the general prevailing rate of per diem wages does not 1 preclude use of an alternative workweek schedule adopted pursuant to Section 511 2 or 514 of the Labor Code. 3 (B)(i) For developments for which any of the following conditions apply, certified 4 that a skilled and trained workforce shall be used to complete the development if 5 the application is approved: 6 (I) On and after January 1, 2018, until December 31, 2021, the development 7 consists of 75 or more units with a residential component that is not 100 percent 8 subsidized affordable housing and will be located within a jurisdiction located in a 9 coastal or bay county with a population of 225,000 or more. 10 (II) On and after January 1, 2022, until December 31, 2025, the development 11 consists of 50 or more units with a residential component that is not 100 percent 12 subsidized affordable housing and will be located within a jurisdiction located in a 13 coastal or bay county with a population of 225,000 or more. 14 (III) On and after January 1, 2018, until December 31, 2019, the development 15 consists of 75 or more units with a residential component that is not 100 percent 16 subsidized affordable housing and will be located within a jurisdiction with a 17 population of fewer than 550,000 and that is not located in a coastal or bay county. 18 (IV) On and after January 1, 2020, until December 31, 2021, the development 19 consists of more than 50 units with a residential component that is not 100 percent 20 subsidized affordable housing and will be located within a jurisdiction with a 21 population of fewer than 550,000 and that is not located in a coastal or bay county. 22 (V) On and after January 1, 2022, until December 31, 2025, the development 23 consists of more than 25 units with a residential component that is not 100 percent 24 subsidized affordable housing and will be located within a jurisdiction with a 25 population of fewer than 550,000 and that is not located in a coastal or bay county. 26 (ii) For purposes of this section, \"skilled and trained workforce\" has the same 27 meaning as provided in Chapter 2.9 (commencing with Section 2600) of Part 1 of 28 Division 2 of the Public Contract Code. 29 (iii) If the development proponent has certified that a skilled and trained 30 workforce will be used to complete the development and the application is 31 approved, the following shall apply: 32 (I) The applicant shall require in all contracts for the performance of work that 33 every contractor and subcontractor at every tier will individually use a skilled and 34 trained workforce to complete the development. 35 (II) Every contractor and subcontractor shall use a skilled and trained workforce 36 to complete the development. 37 (III) Except as provided in subclause (IV), the applicant shall provide to the 38 locality, on a monthly basis while the development or contract is being performed, 39 a report demonstrating compliance with Chapter 2.9 (commencing with Section 40 2600) of Part 1 of Division 2 of the Public Contract Code. A monthly report 41 provided to the locality pursuant to this subclause shall be a public record under the 42 California Public Records Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 6250) of 43 STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 14, 2019 - 265 - Division 7 Division 10 (commencing with Section 7920.000 of Title 1) and shall be 1 open to public inspection. An applicant that fails to provide a monthly report 2 demonstrating compliance with Chapter 2.9 (commencing with Section 2600) of 3 Part 1 of Division 2 of the Public Contract Code shall be subject to a civil penalty 4 of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) per month for each month for which the report has 5 not been provided. Any contractor or subcontractor that fails to use a skilled and 6 trained workforce shall be subject to a civil penalty of two hundred dollars ($200) 7 per day for each worker employed in contravention of the skilled and trained 8 workforce requirement. Penalties may be assessed by the Labor Commissioner 9 within 18 months of completion of the development using the same procedures for 10 issuance of civil wage and penalty assessments pursuant to Section 1741 of the 11 Labor Code, and may be reviewed pursuant to the same procedures in Section 1742 12 of the Labor Code. Penalties shall be paid to the State Public Works Enforcement 13 Fund. 14 (IV) Subclause (III) shall not apply if all contractors and subcontractors 15 performing work on the development are subject to a project labor agreement that 16 requires compliance with the skilled and trained workforce requirement and 17 provides for enforcement of that obligation through an arbitration procedure.

Section 65913.4 is amended to reflect nonsubstantive recodification of the California 3 Public Records Act. See California Public Records Act Clean-Up, __ Cal. L. Revision Comm'n 4 Reports __ (2019). 5 Note. Government Code Section 65913.4 was amended by Assembly Bill 101 (Committee on 6 Budget), 2019 Cal. Stat. ch. 159, \u00a7 8. That was a bill relating to the budget, so it became effective 7 immediately. Afterwards, the section (as amended by AB 101) was amended twice more, by 8 Assembly Bill 1485 (Wicks) and Senate Bill 235 (Dodd). Those bills were coordinated so as not to 9 conflict and SB 235 was chaptered last, so its version of Section 65913.4 (2019 Cal. Stat. ch. 844, 10 \u00a7 5.3) will take effect. See Gov't Code \u00a7 9605. The Commission used that version in preparing the 11 conforming revision proposed above. 12 \u00a7 66024 (amended). Judicial action or proceeding contending that development fee is special 13 tax 14 SEC. ___. Section 66024 of the Government Code is amended to read: 15 66024. (a) In any judicial action or proceeding to validate, attack, review, set 16 aside, void, or annul any ordinance or resolution providing for the imposition of a 17 development fee by any city, county, or district in which there is at issue whether 18 the development fee is a special tax within the meaning of Section 50076, the city, 19 county, or district has the burden of producing evidence to establish that the 20 development fee does not exceed the cost of the service, facility, or regulatory 21 activity for which it is imposed. 22 (b) No party may initiate any action or proceeding pursuant to subdivision (a) 23 unless both of the following requirements are met: 24 (1) The development fee was directly imposed on the party as a condition of 25 project approval. 26 (2) At least 30 days prior to initiating the action or proceeding, the party requests 27 the city, county, or district to provide a copy of the documents which that establish 28 that the development fee does not exceed the cost of the service, facility, or 29 regulatory activity for which it is imposed. In accordance with Section 6257 30 subdivision (a) of Section 7922.530, the city, county, or district may charge a fee 31 for copying the documents requested pursuant to this paragraph. 32 (c) For purposes of this section, costs shall be determined in accordance with 33 fundamental fairness and consistency of method as to the allocation of costs, 34 expenses, revenues, and other items included in the calculation. 35 Comment. Section 66024 is amended to reflect nonsubstantive recodification of the California 36 Public Records Act. See California Public Records Act Clean-Up, __ Cal. L. Revision Comm'n 37 Reports __ (2019). 38 The amendment also corrects a cross-reference to \"Section 6257.\" That cross-reference became 39 obsolete when former Section 6257 (1981 Cal. Stat. ch. 968, \u00a7 3.5) was repealed by 1998 Cal. Stat. 40 ch. 620, \u00a7 10. At that time, the substance of former Section 6257 was relocated to newly-added 41 Section 6253 (see 1998 Cal. Stat. ch. 620, \u00a7 5). Pursuant to the CPRA Recodification Act of 2020, 42 Section 6253 has in turn been repealed and recodified; the fee-related material from former Section 43 6257 is now located in Section 7922.530(a). 44 The section is also amended to make a grammatical correction. 45 STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 14, 2019 - 271 - \u00a7 66201 (amended).

Transfer of governance of Alameda Health System 39 SEC. ___. Section 101850 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read: 40 101850. The Legislature finds and declares the following: 41 STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 14, 2019 - 352 - (a)(1) Due to the challenges facing the Alameda Health System arising from 1 changes in the public and private health industries, the Alameda County Board of 2 Supervisors has determined that a transfer of governance of the Alameda Health 3 System to an independent governing body, a hospital authority, is needed to improve 4 the efficiency, effectiveness, and economy of the community health services 5 provided at the medical center. The board of supervisors has further determined that 6 the creation of an independent hospital authority strictly and exclusively dedicated 7 to the management, administration, and control of the medical center, in a manner 8 consistent with the county's obligations under Section 17000 of the Welfare and 9 Institutions Code, is the best way to fulfill its commitment to the medically indigent, 10 special needs, and general populations of Alameda County. To accomplish this, it 11 is necessary that the board of supervisors be given authority to create a hospital 12 authority. Because there is no general law under which this authority could be 13 formed, the adoption of a special act and the formation of a special authority is 14 required. 15 (2) The following definitions apply for purposes of this section: 16 (A) \"The county\" means the County of Alameda. 17 (B) \"Governing board\" means the governing body of the hospital authority. 18 (C) \"Hospital authority\" means the separate public agency established by the 19 Board of Supervisors of Alameda County to manage, administer, and control the 20 Alameda Health System. 21 (D) \"Medical center\" means the Alameda Health System, which was formerly 22 known as the Alameda County Medical Center. 23 (b) The board of supervisors of the county may, by ordinance, establish a hospital 24 authority separate and apart from the county for the purpose of effecting a transfer 25 of the management, administration, and control of the medical center in accordance 26 with Section 14000.2 of the Welfare and Institutions Code. A hospital authority 27 established pursuant to this chapter shall be strictly and exclusively dedicated to the 28 management, administration, and control of the medical center within parameters 29 set forth in this chapter, and in the ordinance, bylaws, and contracts adopted by the 30 board of supervisors that shall not be in conflict with this chapter, Section 1442.5 of 31 this code, or Section 17000 of the Welfare and Institutions Code. 32 (c) A hospital authority established pursuant to this chapter shall be governed by 33 a board that is appointed, both initially and continually, by the Board of Supervisors 34 of the County of Alameda. This hospital authority governing board shall reflect both 35 the expertise necessary to maximize the quality and scope of care at the medical 36 center in a fiscally responsible manner and the diverse interest that the medical 37 center serves. The enabling ordinance shall specify the membership of the hospital 38 authority governing board, the qualifications for individual members, the manner of 39 appointment, selection, or removal of governing board members, their terms of 40 office, and all other matters that the board of supervisors deems necessary or 41 convenient for the conduct of the hospital authority's activities. 42 STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 14, 2019 - 353 - (d) The mission of the hospital authority shall be the management, administration, 1 and other control, as determined by the board of supervisors, of the group of public 2 hospitals, clinics, and programs that comprise the medical center, in a manner that 3 ensures appropriate, quality, and cost-effective medical care as required of counties 4 by Section 17000 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, and, to the extent feasible, 5 other populations, including special populations in the County of Alameda. 6 (e) The board of supervisors shall adopt bylaws for the medical center that set 7 forth those matters related to the operation of the medical center by the hospital 8 authority that the board of supervisors deems necessary and appropriate. The bylaws 9 shall become operative upon approval by a majority vote of the board of supervisors. 10 Changes or amendments to the bylaws shall be by majority vote of the board of 11 supervisors. 12 (f) The hospital authority created and appointed pursuant to this section is a duly 13 constituted governing body within the meaning of Section 1250 of this code and 14 Section 70035 of Title 22 of the California Code of Regulations as currently written 15 or subsequently amended. 16 (g) Unless otherwise provided by the board of supervisors by way of resolution, 17 the hospital authority may, or the board of supervisors may on behalf of the hospital 18 authority, apply as a public agency for one or more licenses for the provision of 19 health care pursuant to statutes and regulations governing licensing as currently 20 written or subsequently amended. 21 (h) In the event of a change of license ownership, the governing body of the 22 hospital authority shall comply with the obligations of governing bodies of general 23 acute care hospitals generally, as set forth in Section 70701 of Title 22 of the 24 California Code of Regulations, as currently written or subsequently amended, as 25 well as the terms and conditions of the license. The hospital authority is the 26 responsible party with respect to compliance with these obligations, terms, and 27 conditions. 28 (i)(1) A transfer by the county to the hospital authority of the administration, 29 management, and control of the medical center, whether or not the transfer includes 30 the surrendering by the county of the existing general acute care hospital license and 31 corresponding application for a change of ownership of the license, does not affect 32 the eligibility of the county, or in the case of a change of license ownership, the 33 hospital authority, to do any of the following: 34 (A) Participate in, and receive allocations pursuant to, the California Healthcare 35 for the Indigents Program (CHIP). 36 (B) Receive appropriations from the Medi-Cal Inpatient Payment Adjustment 37 Fund without relieving the county of its obligation to make intergovernmental 38 transfer payments related to the Medi-Cal Inpatient Payment Adjustment Fund 39 pursuant to Section 14163 of the Welfare and Institutions Code. 40 (C) Receive Medi-Cal capital supplements pursuant to Section 14085.5 of the 41 Welfare and Institutions Code. 42 STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 14, 2019 - 354 - (D) Receive any other funds that would otherwise be available to a county 1 hospital. 2 (2) A transfer described in paragraph (1) does not otherwise disqualify the county, 3 or in the case of a change in license ownership, the hospital authority, from 4 participating in any of the following: 5 (A) Other funding sources either specific to county hospitals or county 6 ambulatory care clinics or for which there are special provisions specific to county 7 hospitals or to county ambulatory care clinics. 8 (B) Funding programs in which the county, on behalf of the medical center and 9 the Alameda County Health Care Services Agency, had participated prior to the 10 creation of the hospital authority, or would otherwise be qualified to participate in 11 had the hospital authority not been created, and administration, management, and 12 control not been transferred by the county to the hospital authority, pursuant to this 13 chapter. 14 (j) A hospital authority created pursuant to this chapter shall be a legal entity 15 separate and apart from the county and shall file the statement required by Section 16 53051 of the Government Code.

A lease agreement or other 23 agreement between the county and the hospital authority shall provide that county 24 premises shall not be sublet without the approval of the board of supervisors. 25 (p) The statutory authority of a board of supervisors to prescribe rules that 26 authorize a county hospital to integrate its services with those of other hospitals into 27 a system of community service that offers free choice of hospitals to those requiring 28 hospital care, as set forth in Section 14000.2 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, 29 shall apply to the hospital authority upon a transfer of maintenance, operation, and 30 management or ownership of the medical center by the county to the hospital 31 authority. 32 (q) The hospital authority may acquire and possess real or personal property and 33 may dispose of real or personal property other than that owned by the county, as 34 may be necessary for the performance of its functions. The hospital authority may 35 sue or be sued, to employ personnel, and to contract for services required to meet 36 its obligations. Before January 1, 2024, the hospital authority shall not enter into a 37 contract with any other person or entity, including, but not limited to, a subsidiary 38 or other entity established by the authority, to replace services being provided by 39 physicians and surgeons who are employed by the hospital authority and in a 40 recognized collective bargaining unit, with services provided by that other person 41 or entity without clear and convincing evidence that the needed medical care can 42 only be delivered cost effectively by that other person or entity. Prior to entering 43 STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 14, 2019 - 356 - into a contract for any of those services, the authority shall negotiate with the 1 representative of the recognized collective bargaining unit of its physician and 2 surgeon employees over the decision to privatize and, if unable to resolve any 3 dispute through negotiations, shall submit the matter to final binding arbitration. 4 (r) An agreement between the county and the hospital authority shall provide that 5 all existing services provided by the medical center shall continue to be provided to 6 the county through the medical center subject to the policy of the county and 7 consistent with the county's obligations under Section 17000 of the Welfare and 8 Institutions Code. 9 (s) A hospital authority to which the maintenance, operation, and management or 10 ownership of the medical center is transferred shall be a \"district\" within the 11 meaning set forth in the County Employees Retirement Law of 1937 (Chapter 3 12 (commencing with Section 31450) of Part 3 of Division 4 of Title 3 of the 13 Government Code).

390 - (1) The ICOC shall establish standards that require that all grants and loan awards 1 be subject to intellectual property agreements that balance the opportunity of the 2 State of California to benefit from the patents, royalties, and licenses that result from 3 basic research, therapy development, and clinical trials with the need to ensure that 4 essential medical research is not unreasonably hindered by the intellectual property 5 agreements. All revenues received through the intellectual property agreements 6 established pursuant to this subdivision shall be deposited into the General Fund. 7 (2) These standards shall include, at a minimum, a requirement that CIRM 8 grantees, other than loan recipients and facilities grant recipients, share a fraction of 9 the revenue they receive from licensing or self-commercializing an invention or 10 technology that arises from research funded by CIRM, as set forth below. All 11 revenues received pursuant to this paragraph or regulations adopted to implement 12 this paragraph shall be deposited in the General Fund for use consistent with Section 13 202(c)(7) of Title 35 of the United States Code, if applicable. 14 (A)(i) A grantee that licenses an invention or technology that arises from research 15 funded by CIRM shall pay 25 percent of the revenues it receives in excess of five 16 hundred thousand dollars ($500,000), in the aggregate, to the General Fund. The 17 threshold amount of five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) shall be adjusted 18 annually by a multiple of a fraction, the denominator of which is the Consumer Price 19 Index, All Urban Consumers, All Items (San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose; 1982-20 84=100) as prepared by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States 21 Department of Labor and published for the month of October 2009, and the 22 numerator of which is that index published for the month in which the grantee 23 accepts the grant. 24 (ii) If funding sources other than CIRM directly contributed to the development 25 of the invention or technology, then the return to the General Fund shall be 26 calculated as follows: The amount of CIRM funding for the invention or technology 27 shall be divided by the total of funding provided by all sources, and that fraction 28 shall be multiplied by 25. That numeral is the percentage due to the General Fund. 29 (B)(i) A grantee that self-commercializes a product that results from an invention 30 or technology that arises from research funded by CIRM shall pay an amount to the 31 General Fund equal to three times the total amount of the CIRM grant or grants 32 received by the grantee in support of the research that contributed to the creation of 33 the product. The rate of payback of the royalty shall be at a rate of 3 percent of the 34 annual net revenue received by the grantee from the product. 35 (ii) In addition to the payment required by clause (i), the first time that net 36 commercial revenues earned by the grantee from the product exceed two hundred 37 fifty million dollars ($250,000,000) in a calendar year, the grantee shall make a one-38 time payment to the General Fund equal to three times the total amount of the grant 39 or grants awarded by CIRM to the grantee in support of the research that contributed 40 to the creation of the product. 41 (iii) In addition to the payments required by clauses (i) and (ii), the first time that 42 net commercial revenues earned by the grantee from the product exceed five 43 STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 14, 2019 - 391 - hundred million dollars ($500,000,000) in a calendar year, the grantee shall make 1 an additional one-time payment to the General Fund equal to three times the total 2 amount of the grant or grants awarded by CIRM to the grantee in support of the 3 research that contributed to the creation of the product. 4 (iv) In addition to the payments required by clauses (i), (ii), and (iii), the first time 5 that net commercial revenues earned by the grantee from the product equal or 6 exceed five hundred million dollars ($500,000,000) in a calendar year, the grantee 7 shall pay the General Fund 1 percent annually of net commercial revenue in excess 8 of five hundred million dollars ($500,000,000) for the life of any patent covering 9 the invention or technology, if the grantee patented its invention or technology and 10 received a CIRM grant or grants amounting to more than five million dollars 11 ($5,000,000) in support of the research that contributed to the creation of the 12 product. 13 (3) The ICOC shall have the authority to adopt regulations to implement this 14 subdivision. The ICOC shall also have the authority to modify the formulas 15 specified in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (2) through regulations if the 16 ICOC determines pursuant to paragraph (1) that a modification is required either in 17 order to ensure that essential medical research, including, but not limited to, therapy 18 development and the broad delivery of therapies to patients, is not unreasonably 19 hindered, or to ensure that the State of California has an opportunity to benefit from 20 the patents, royalties, and licenses that result from basic research, therapy 21 development, and clinical trials. The ICOC shall notify the appropriate fiscal and 22 policy committees of the Legislature 10 calendar days before exercising its authority 23 to vote on the modification of the formulas specified in subparagraphs (A) and (B) 24 of paragraph (2). 25 (k) Preference for California Suppliers 26 The ICOC shall establish standards to ensure that grantees purchase goods and 27 services from California suppliers to the extent reasonably possible, in a good faith 28 effort to achieve a goal of more than 50 percent of such purchases from California 29 suppliers. 30 Comment.

General acute care hospital building that poses potential risk of 1 collapse or significant loss of life 2 SEC. ___. Section 130060 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read: 3 130060. (a)(1) After January 1, 2008, a general acute care hospital building that 4 is determined to be a potential risk of collapse or pose significant loss of life shall 5 only be used for nonacute care hospital purposes, unless an extension of this 6 deadline has been granted and either of the following occurs before the end of the 7 extension: 8 (A) A replacement building has been constructed and a certificate of occupancy 9 has been granted by the office for the replacement building. 10 (B) A retrofit has been performed on the building and a construction final has 11 been obtained by the office. 12 (2) An extension of the deadline may be granted by the office upon a 13 demonstration by the owner that compliance will result in a loss of health care 14 capacity that may not be provided by other general acute care hospitals within a 15 reasonable proximity. In its request for an extension of the deadline, a hospital shall 16 state why the hospital is unable to comply with the January 1, 2008, deadline 17 requirement. 18 (3) Prior to granting an extension of the January 1, 2008, deadline pursuant to this 19 section, the office shall do all of the following: 20 (A) Provide public notice of a hospital's request for an extension of the deadline. 21 The notice, at a minimum, shall be posted on the office's Internet Web site internet 22 website, and shall include the facility's name and identification number, the status 23 of the request, and the beginning and ending dates of the comment period, and shall 24 advise the public of the opportunity to submit public comments pursuant to 25 subparagraph (C).

The basic services in the building 25 shall be relocated into an SPC-5 and NPC-4 or NPC-5 building by January 1, 2013. 26 (5) SPC-1 buildings, other than the building identified in paragraph (3) or (4), in 27 the contiguous grouping of hospital buildings shall also be exempt from the 28 requirement in subdivision (a) until January 1, 2013. However, on or before January 29 1, 2013, at a minimum, each of these buildings shall be retrofitted to an SPC-2 and 30 NPC-3 building, or no longer be used for general acute care hospital inpatient 31 services. 32 (c) On or before March 1, 2001, the office shall establish a schedule of interim 33 work progress deadlines that hospitals shall be required to meet to be eligible for 34 the extension specified in subdivision (b). To receive this extension, the hospital 35 building or buildings shall meet the year 2002 nonstructural requirements. 36 (d) A hospital building that is eligible for an extension pursuant to this section 37 shall meet the January 1, 2030, nonstructural and structural deadline requirements 38 if the building is to be used for general acute care inpatient services after January 1, 39 2030. 40 (e) Upon compliance with subdivision (b), the hospital shall be issued a written 41 notice of compliance by the office.

The commissioner 21 shall receive prior notice from a certified reinsurer that proposes participation by 22 the certified reinsurer in a solvent scheme of arrangement. 23 (K) Any other information deemed relevant by the commissioner. 24 (2) Based on the analysis conducted under subparagraph (E) of paragraph (1) of a 25 certified reinsurer's reputation for prompt payment of claims, the commissioner 26 may make appropriate adjustments in the security the certified reinsurer is required 27 to post to protect its liabilities to United States ceding insurers, provided that the 28 commissioner shall, at a minimum, increase the security the certified reinsurer is 29 required to post by one rating level under regulations promulgated by the 30 commissioner, if the commissioner finds either of the following: 31 (A) More than 15 percent of the certified reinsurer's ceding insurance clients have 32 overdue reinsurance recoverables on paid losses of 90 days or more that are not in 33 dispute and that exceed one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) for each ceding 34 insurer. 35 (B) The aggregate amount of reinsurance recoverables on paid losses that are not 36 in dispute and that are overdue by 90 days or more exceeds fifty million dollars 37 ($50,000,000). 38 (3) The assuming insurer shall submit a properly executed Form CR-1, as 39 published on the department's internet website, as evidence of its submission to the 40 jurisdiction of this state, appointment of the commissioner as an agent for service of 41 process in this state, and agreement to provide security for 100 percent of the 42 assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded by United States 43 STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 14, 2019 - 422 - ceding insurers if it resists enforcement of a final United States judgment. The 1 commissioner shall not certify an assuming insurer that is domiciled in a jurisdiction 2 that the commissioner has determined does not adequately and promptly enforce 3 final United States judgments or arbitration awards. 4 (4)(A) In the case of a downgrade by a rating agency or other disqualifying 5 circumstance, the commissioner shall, upon written notice, assign a new rating to 6 the certified reinsurer in accordance with the requirements of this subdivision. 7 (B) The commissioner shall have the authority to suspend, revoke, or otherwise 8 modify a certified reinsurer's certification at any time if the certified reinsurer fails 9 to meet its obligations or security requirements under this section, or if other 10 financial or operating results of the certified reinsurer, or documented significant 11 delays in payment by the certified reinsurer, lead the commissioner to reconsider 12 the certified reinsurer's ability or willingness to meet its contractual obligations. 13 (C) If the rating of a certified reinsurer is upgraded by the commissioner, the 14 certified reinsurer may meet the security requirements applicable to its new rating 15 on a prospective basis, but the commissioner shall require the certified reinsurer to 16 post security under the previously applicable security requirements as to all 17 contracts in force on or before the effective date of the upgraded rating. If the rating 18 of a certified reinsurer is downgraded by the commissioner, the commissioner shall 19 require the certified reinsurer to meet the security requirements applicable to its new 20 rating for all business it has assumed as a certified reinsurer. 21 (D) Upon revocation of the certification of a certified reinsurer by the 22 commissioner, the assuming insurer shall be required to post security in accordance 23 with Section 922.5 in order for the ceding insurer to continue to take credit for 24 reinsurance ceded to the assuming insurer. If funds continue to be held in trust in 25 accordance with subdivision (d) of Section 922.4, the commissioner may allow 26 additional credit equal to the ceding insurer's pro rata share of those funds, 27 discounted to reflect the risk of uncollectibility and anticipated expenses of trust 28 administration. Notwithstanding the change of a certified reinsurer's rating or 29 revocation of its certification, a domestic insurer that has ceded reinsurance to that 30 certified reinsurer shall not be denied credit for reinsurance for a period of three 31 months for all reinsurance ceded to that certified reinsurer, unless the reinsurance is 32 found by the commissioner to be at high risk of uncollectibility. 33 (i) A certified reinsurer shall secure obligations assumed from United States 34 ceding insurers under this subdivision at a level consistent with its rating. The 35 amount of security required in order for full credit to be allowed shall correspond 36 with the following requirements: 37 Ratings security required 38 Secure - 1: 0 percent 39 Secure - 2: 10 percent 40 Secure - 3: 20 percent 41 Secure - 4: 50 percent 42 Secure - 5: 75 percent 43 STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 14, 2019 - 423 - Vulnerable - 6: 100 percent 1 (1) In order for a domestic ceding insurer to qualify for full financial statement 2 credit for reinsurance ceded to a certified reinsurer, the certified reinsurer shall 3 maintain security in a form acceptable to the commissioner and consistent with 4 Section 922.5, or in a multibeneficiary trust in accordance with subdivision (d) of 5 Section 922.4, except as otherwise provided in this subdivision. In order for a 6 domestic insurer to qualify for full financial statement credit, reinsurance contracts 7 entered into or renewed under this section shall include a proper funding clause that 8 requires the certified reinsurer to provide and maintain security in an amount 9 sufficient to avoid the imposition of a financial statement penalty on the ceding 10 insurer under this section for reinsurance ceded to the certified reinsurer. 11 (2) If a certified reinsurer maintains a trust to fully secure its obligations subject 12 to subdivision (d) of Section 922.4, and chooses to secure its obligations incurred 13 as a certified reinsurer in the form of a multibeneficiary trust, the certified reinsurer 14 shall maintain separate trust accounts for its obligations incurred under reinsurance 15 agreements issued or renewed as a certified reinsurer with reduced security as 16 permitted by this subdivision or comparable laws of other United States jurisdictions 17 and for its obligations subject to subdivision (d) of Section 922.4. It shall be a 18 condition to the grant of certification under this section that the certified reinsurer 19 shall have bound itself, by the language of the trust and agreement with the 20 commissioner with principal regulatory oversight of each of those trust accounts, to 21 fund, upon termination of any of those trust accounts, out of the remaining surplus 22 of those trusts any deficiency of any other of those trust accounts. 23 (3) The minimum trusteed surplus requirements provided in subdivision (d) of 24 Section 922.4 are not applicable with respect to a multibeneficiary trust maintained 25 by a certified reinsurer for the purpose of securing obligations incurred under this 26 subdivision, except that the trust shall maintain a minimum trusteed surplus of ten 27 million dollars ($10,000,000). 28 (4) With respect to obligations incurred by a certified reinsurer under this 29 subdivision, if the security is insufficient, the commissioner shall reduce the 30 allowable credit by an amount proportionate to the deficiency, and have the 31 discretion to impose further reductions in allowable credit upon finding that there is 32 a material risk that the certified reinsurer's obligations will not be paid in full when 33 due. 34 (5) For purposes of this subdivision, a certified reinsurer whose certification has 35 been terminated for any reason shall be treated as a certified reinsurer required to 36 secure 100 percent of its obligations. 37 (A) As used in this subdivision, the term \"terminated\" means revocation, 38 suspension, voluntary surrender, and inactive status. 39 (B) If the commissioner continues to assign a higher rating as permitted by other 40 provisions of this section, this requirement shall not apply to a certified reinsurer in 41 inactive status or to a reinsurer whose certification has been suspended. 42 STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 14, 2019 - 424 - (6) The commissioner shall require the certified reinsurer to post 100-percent 1 security in accordance with Section 922.5, for the benefit of the ceding insurer or 2 its estate, upon the entry of an order of rehabilitation, liquidation, or conservation 3 against the ceding insurer. 4 (7) Affiliated reinsurance transactions shall receive the same opportunity for 5 reduced security requirements as all other reinsurance transactions. 6 (8) In order to facilitate the prompt payment of claims, a certified reinsurer shall 7 not be required to post security for catastrophe recoverables for a period of one year 8 from the date of the first instance of a liability reserve entry by the ceding company 9 as a result of a loss from a catastrophic occurrence that is likely to result in 10 significant insured losses, as recognized by the commissioner. The one-year deferral 11 period is contingent upon the certified reinsurer continuing to pay claims in a timely 12 manner, as determined by the commissioner, in writing. Reinsurance recoverables 13 for only the following lines of business as reported on the NAIC annual financial 14 statement related specifically to the catastrophic occurrence shall be included in the 15 deferral: 16 (A) Line 1: Fire. 17 (B) Line 2: Allied lines. 18 (C) Line 3: Farmowners' multiple peril. 19 (D) Line 4: Homeowners' multiple peril. 20 (E) Line 5: Commercial multiple peril. 21 (F) Line 9: Inland marine. 22 (G) Line 12: Earthquake. 23 (H) Line 21: Auto physical damage. 24 (9) Credit for reinsurance under this section shall apply only to reinsurance 25 contracts entered into or renewed on or after the effective date of the certification of 26 the assuming insurer. A reinsurance contract entered into before the effective date 27 of the certification of the assuming insurer that is subsequently amended by mutual 28 agreement of the parties to the reinsurance contract after the effective date of the 29 certification of the assuming insurer, or a new reinsurance contract, covering a risk 30 for which collateral was provided previously, shall only be subject to this section 31 with respect to losses incurred and reserves reported from and after the effective 32 date of the amendment or new contract. 33 (10) This section shall not be construed to prohibit the parties to a reinsurance 34 agreement from agreeing to provisions establishing security requirements that 35 exceed the minimum security requirements established for certified reinsurers under 36 this section. 37 (j) A certified reinsurer that ceases to assume new business in this state may 38 request to maintain its certification in inactive status in order to continue to qualify 39 for a reduction in security for its in-force business. An inactive certified reinsurer 40 shall continue to comply with all applicable requirements of this section, and the 41 commissioner shall assign a rating that takes into account, if relevant, the reasons 42 why the reinsurer is not assuming new business. 43 STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 14, 2019 - 425 - (k) Notwithstanding this section, credit for reinsurance or deduction from liability 1 by a domestic ceding insurer for cessions to a certified reinsurer may be disallowed 2 upon a finding by the commissioner that the application of the literal provisions of 3 this section does not accomplish its intent, or either the financial condition of the 4 reinsurer or the collateral or other security provided by the reinsurer does not, in 5 substance, satisfy the credit for reinsurance requirements in Section 922.4. 6 Comment.

Stat. ch. 647, \u00a7 16 2. The newly-amended version was used in preparing the conforming revision proposed above. 17 Labor Code Section 138.7 was also amended by Assembly Bill 991 (Gallagher), 2019 Cal.

In that case, the 8 agency must show by clear and convincing evidence that the interest in preventing 9 prejudice to the active and ongoing criminal investigation or proceeding outweighs 10 the public interest in prompt disclosure of records about use of serious force by 11 peace officers and custodial officers. The agency shall release all information 12 subject to disclosure that does not cause substantial prejudice, including any 13 documents that have otherwise become available. 14 (iv) In an action to compel disclosure brought pursuant to Section 6258 Sections 15 7923.000 and 7923.005 of the Government Code, an agency may justify delay by 16 filing an application to seal the basis for withholding, in accordance with Rule 2.550 17 of the California Rules of Court, or any successor rule thereto, if disclosure of the 18 written basis itself would impact a privilege or compromise a pending investigation. 19 (B) If criminal charges are filed related to the incident in which force was used, 20 the agency may delay the disclosure of records or information until a verdict on 21 those charges is returned at trial or, if a plea of guilty or no contest is entered, the 22 time to withdraw the plea pursuant to Section 1018. 23 (C) During an administrative investigation into an incident described in 24 subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1), the agency may delay the disclosure of records 25 or information until the investigating agency determines whether the use of force 26 violated a law or agency policy, but no longer than 180 days after the date of the 27 employing agency's discovery of the use of force, or allegation of use of force, by 28 a person authorized to initiate an investigation, or 30 days after the close of any 29 criminal investigation related to the peace officer or custodial officer's use of force, 30 whichever is later. 31 (8) A record of a civilian complaint, or the investigations, findings, or dispositions 32 of that complaint, shall not be released pursuant to this section if the complaint is 33 frivolous, as defined in Section 128.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure, or if the 34 complaint is unfounded. 35 (c) Notwithstanding subdivisions (a) and (b), a department or agency shall release 36 to the complaining party a copy of his or her the party's own statements at the time 37 the complaint is filed. 38 (d) Notwithstanding subdivisions (a) and (b), a department or agency that 39 employs peace or custodial officers may disseminate data regarding the number, 40 type, or disposition of complaints (sustained, not sustained, exonerated, or 41 unfounded) made against its officers if that information is in a form which that does 42 not identify the individuals involved. 43 STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 14, 2019 - 518 - (e) Notwithstanding subdivisions (a) and (b), a department or agency that employs 1 peace or custodial officers may release factual information concerning a disciplinary 2 investigation if the officer who is the subject of the disciplinary investigation, or the 3 officer's agent or representative, publicly makes a statement he or she the officer, 4 agent, or representative knows to be false concerning the investigation or the 5 imposition of disciplinary action.

(a)(1) An owner of a state jurisdictional dam, except an owner of a dam 21 classified by the department pursuant to Section 6160 as a low hazard dam, shall 22 submit electronically to the department an inundation map that shows the area that 23 would be subject to flooding under various failure scenarios unique to the dam and 24 the critical appurtenant structures of the dam. 25 (2) Before approval of an inundation map, the department shall review the map 26 and may require the owner to make changes that the department deems necessary. 27 (3) Upon approval of the inundation map or maps by the department, the owner 28 of the dam shall develop and submit electronically to the department and the Office 29 of Emergency Services an emergency action plan that is based upon the approved 30 inundation map or maps. 31 (4) If an owner of a dam has an existing emergency action plan as of March 1, 32 2017, the department shall review any inundation map or maps contained in the 33 plan. If the department determines the inundation map or maps are sufficient, as 34 described in subparagraphs (A) or (B), the owner of the dam shall submit the 35 emergency action plan associated with the inundation map or maps to the Office of 36 Emergency Services to review the emergency action plan as follows: 37 (A) If an emergency action plan existing as of March 1, 2017, contains an 38 inundation map for the dam and all critical appurtenant structures, if critical 39 appurtenant structures exist, and the department determines that the inundation map 40 or maps for the dam and all existing critical appurtenant structures are sufficient, 41 the owner of the dam shall submit the complete emergency action plan reflecting all 42 STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 14, 2019 - 648 - critical appurtenant structures to the Office of Emergency Services for review within 1 30 days of department approval. 2 (B)(i) If an emergency action plan existing as of March 1, 2017, contains an 3 inundation map for the dam but not for all critical appurtenant structures, if critical 4 appurtenant structures exist, the department shall review a map included in the 5 existing emergency action plan for sufficiency. If the department approves the map, 6 the owner of the dam shall submit the existing emergency action plan associated 7 with the approved map to the Office of Emergency Services. The owner of the dam 8 shall continue to prepare inundation maps with due diligence for any remaining 9 critical appurtenant structures and submit the map or maps to the department for 10 review and approval. The Office of Emergency Services may defer review and 11 approval of the new or updated emergency action plan until the Office of Emergency 12 Services has received inundation maps approved by the department for the dam and 13 all critical appurtenant structures. If the Office of Emergency Services approves an 14 emergency action plan when the owner of the dam is continuing to prepare 15 inundation maps with due diligence pursuant to this subparagraph, an owner of a 16 dam may use that emergency action plan that existed as of March 1, 2017, on an 17 interim basis, pending approval of a new or updated emergency action plan that 18 includes maps for the dam and all critical appurtenant structures. 19 (ii) For the purposes of this subparagraph, \"due diligence\" means that the owner 20 of a dam is progressing toward completion of the inundation map or maps for all 21 critical appurtenant structures according to a reasonable schedule proposed by the 22 owner of the dam and approved by the department. When evaluating the time 23 schedule proposed by the owner of the dam, the department may consider, among 24 other relevant factors, the hazard classification of the dam, the number of critical 25 appurtenant structure inundation maps that are outstanding, and the complexity of 26 the failure scenarios. The owner of a dam shall submit a proposed time schedule to 27 the department no later than 60 days after the effective date of the act that added this 28 subparagraph. Failure to submit a proposed time schedule to the department or to 29 comply with a time schedule approved by the department may result in the 30 imposition of penalties, restrictions, or liens pursuant to Chapter 8 (commencing 31 with Section 6425). After the department approves maps for the critical appurtenant 32 structures, the dam owner shall submit a new or updated emergency action plan 33 including the approved maps to the Office of Emergency Services within 60 days. 34 (b)(1) The Office of Emergency Services shall review and approve an emergency 35 action plan no later than 60 days after receipt of the plan from the dam owner 36 pursuant to Section 8589.5 of the Government Code. To the extent possible, the 37 Office of Emergency Services shall give priority to a dam with the highest hazard 38 classification as determined by the department pursuant to Section 6160. 39 (2) If the Office of Emergency Services determines a proposed emergency action 40 plan does not meet the requirements of Section 8589.5 of the Government Code, the 41 Office of Emergency Services shall inform the owner of the dam and require the 42 owner of the dam to amend and resubmit the emergency action plan for approval. 43 STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 14, 2019 - 649 - The Office of Emergency Services shall review and, if the emergency action plan 1 meets the requirements of Section 8589.5 of the Government Code, approve a 2 resubmitted emergency action plan within 30 days of receipt from the owner of the 3 dam. 4 (3) Upon approval by the Office of Emergency Services of an emergency action 5 plan, the Office of Emergency Services shall notify the department and the owner 6 of the dam of the approval.

Section 827.9 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read: 25 827.9. (a) It is the intent of the Legislature to reaffirm its belief that records or 26 information gathered by law enforcement agencies relating to the taking of a minor 27 into custody, temporary custody, or detention (juvenile police records) should be 28 confidential. Confidentiality is necessary to protect those persons from being denied 29 various opportunities, to further the rehabilitative efforts of the juvenile justice 30 system, and to prevent the lifelong stigma that results from having a juvenile police 31 record. Although these records generally should remain confidential, the Legislature 32 recognizes that certain circumstances require the release of juvenile police records 33 to specified persons and entities. The purpose of this section is to clarify the persons 34 and entities entitled to receive a complete copy of a juvenile police record, to specify 35 the persons or entities entitled to receive copies of juvenile police records with 36 certain identifying information about other minors removed from the record, and to 37 provide procedures for others to request a copy of a juvenile police record.

Section 14105.8 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to 16 read: 17 14105.8. (a) The department may enter into contracts with manufacturers of 18 enteral nutrition products that can be used as a therapeutic regimen to prevent 19 serious disability or death in patients with medically diagnosed conditions that 20 preclude the full use of regular food, on a bid or nonbid basis. The department shall 21 maintain a list of those products for which contracts have been executed. For those 22 contracts that generate rebates, those rebates shall be managed through the 23 department's drug rebate accounting system. 24 (b)(1) To ensure that the health needs of Medi-Cal beneficiaries are met, the 25 department shall, when evaluating a decision to execute a contract, and when 26 evaluating enteral nutrition products for retention on, addition to, or deletion from, 27 the list of enteral nutrition products, consider all of the following criteria: 28 (A) The safety of the product. 29 (B) The effectiveness of the product. 30 (C) The essential need for the product. 31 (D) The potential for misuse of the product. 32 (E) The immediate or long-term cost effectiveness of the product. 33 (2) The deficiency of a product when measured by one of the criteria specified in 34 paragraph (1) may be sufficient to support a decision that the product should be 35 deleted from, should not be added to, or should not be retained on, the list of medical 36 supplies. However, the superiority of a product under one criterion may be sufficient 37 to warrant the addition or retention of the product, notwithstanding a deficiency in 38 another criterion. 39 (c) In order that Medi-Cal beneficiaries may have access to a comprehensive 40 range of enteral nutrition products pursuant to subdivision (a), the department shall 41 ensure that there is representation on the list of both general use and specialized use 42 STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 14, 2019 - 688 - enteral nutrition products. The department deems all products designed to meet the 1 normal needs of infants, and all products that are an incomplete source of nutrition, 2 including modular products, and all products intended for use in weight loss, are not 3 benefits of the Medi-Cal program. The department may deem an incomplete product 4 a benefit for patients with diagnoses, including, but not limited to, malabsorption 5 and inborn errors of metabolism, when the product either appropriately lacks only 6 an offending nutrient, or has been shown to not be investigational nor experimental 7 when used as part of a therapeutic regimen to prevent serious disability or death, or 8 when both conditions apply. 9 (d) In order to achieve maximum cost savings, the Legislature declares that an 10 expedited process for contracts under this section is necessary. Therefore, contracts 11 entered into on a nonbid basis shall be exempt from Chapter 2 (commencing with 12 Section 10290) of Part 2 of Division 2 of the Public Contract Code. 13 (e) Deletions made to the list of enteral nutrition products shall become effective 14 no sooner than 30 days after publication of the changes in provider bulletins. 15 (f) Changes made to the list of enteral nutrition products under this or any other 16 section are exempt from the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act 17 (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340), Chapter 4 (commencing with 18 Section 11370), and Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 11500) of Part 1 of 19 Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code), and shall not be subject to the review 20 and approval of the Office of Administrative Law. 21 (g) The department may provide beneficiaries continuing care for products 22 deleted from the list of enteral nutrition products. The department shall assess the 23 need for continuing care based on the criteria in subdivision (b) and the potential 24 impact on beneficiary access to appropriate therapy. To be eligible for continuing 25 care status under this subdivision, a beneficiary must be taking the enteral nutrition 26 product when the product is deleted. Additionally, the department shall have 27 received a claim for the enteral nutrition product with a date of service that is within 28 100 days prior to the date the product was deleted. A beneficiary shall remain 29 eligible for continuing care status provided that a claim is submitted for the enteral 30 nutrition product in question at least every 100 days and the date of service of the 31 claim is within 100 days of the date of service of the last claim submitted for the 32 same enteral nutrition product. 33 (h) The department shall provide individual notice to Medi-Cal beneficiaries at 34 least 60 calendar days prior to the effective date of the deletion of any enteral 35 nutrition product from the list of enteral nutrition products. The notice shall include 36 a description of the beneficiary's right to a fair hearing and shall encourage the 37 beneficiary to consult a physician to determine if an appropriate substitute enteral 38 nutrition product is available from Medi-Cal. 39 (i) Enteral nutrition products authorized pursuant to subdivision (a) shall be 40 available only through prior authorization.

Section 14129.2 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to 22 read: 23 14129.2. (a)(1) Commencing with the state fiscal quarter beginning on July 1, 24 2018, and continuing each state fiscal quarter thereafter for which this article is 25 implemented, there shall be imposed a quality assurance fee for each emergency 26 medical transport provided by each emergency medical transport provider subject 27 to the fee in accordance with this section. 28 (2) The director shall ensure that the quality assurance fee per emergency medical 29 transport imposed pursuant to this article is collected. 30 (b)(1) On or before June 15, 2018, and continuing each June 15 thereafter for 31 which this article is implemented, the director shall calculate the annual quality 32 assurance fee rate applicable to the following state fiscal year based on the most 33 recently collected data from emergency medical transport providers pursuant to 34 Section 14129.1. The director may correct any identified material or significant 35 errors in the data collected from emergency medical transport providers pursuant to 36 Section 14129.1 for the purposes of calculating the annual quality assurance fee rate. 37 The director's determination whether to exercise his or her the director's discretion 38 to correct any data pursuant to this paragraph shall not be subject to judicial review, 39 except that an emergency medical transport provider may bring a writ of mandate 40 under Section 1085 of the Code of Civil Procedure to rectify an abuse of discretion 41 by the director in correcting that emergency medical transport provider's data when 42 STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 14, 2019 - 710 - that correction results in a greater fee amount for that provider pursuant to this 1 section. 2 (A) For the state fiscal year beginning on July 1, 2018, the annual quality 3 assurance fee rate shall be calculated by multiplying the projected total annual gross 4 receipts for all emergency medical transport providers subject to the fee by 5.1 5 percent, which resulting product shall be divided by the projected total annual 6 emergency medical transports by all emergency medical transport providers subject 7 to the fee for the state fiscal year. 8 (B) For state fiscal years beginning July 1, 2019, and continuing each state fiscal 9 year thereafter, the annual quality assurance fee rate shall be calculated by a ratio, 10 the numerator of which shall be the sum of: (i) the product of the projected aggregate 11 fee schedule amount and the effective state medical assistance percentage and (ii) 12 the amount described in subparagraph (A) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (f) for the 13 state fiscal year, and the denominator of which shall be 90 percent of the projected 14 total annual emergency medical transports by all emergency medical transport 15 providers subject to the fee for the state fiscal year. 16 (2) On or before June 15, 2018, and continuing each June 15 thereafter for which 17 this article is implemented, the director shall publish the annual quality assurance 18 fee rate on its Internet Web site internet website. 19 (3) In no case shall the fees calculated pursuant to this subdivision and collected 20 pursuant to this article exceed the amounts allowable under federal law. If, on or 21 before June 15 of each year, the director makes a determination that the fees 22 collected pursuant to this subdivision exceed the amounts allowable under federal 23 law, the director may reduce the add-on increase to the fee-for-service payment 24 schedule described in Section 14129.3 only to the extent necessary to reflect the 25 amount of fees allowable under federal law in an applicable state fiscal year. 26 (4) If, during a state fiscal year for which this article is operative, the actual or 27 projected available fee amount exceeds or is less than the actual or projected 28 aggregate fee schedule amount by more than 1 percent, the director shall adjust the 29 annual quality assurance fee rate so that the available fee amount for the state fiscal 30 year will approximately equal the aggregate fee schedule amount for the state fiscal 31 year. The available fee amount for a state fiscal year shall be considered to equal 32 the aggregate fee schedule amount for the state fiscal year if the difference between 33 the available fee amount for the state fiscal year and the aggregate fee schedule 34 amount for the state fiscal year constitutes less than 1 percent of the aggregate fee 35 schedule amount for the state fiscal year. 36 (c)(1) Each emergency medical transport provider subject to the fee shall remit to 37 the department an amount equal to the annual quality assurance fee rate for the 38 2018-19 state fiscal year multiplied by the number of transports reported or that 39 should have been reported by the emergency medical transport provider pursuant to 40 subdivision (b) of Section 14129.1 in the quarter beginning on April 1, 2018, based 41 on a schedule established by the director. The schedule established by the director 42 STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 14, 2019 - 711 - for the fee payment described in this paragraph shall require remittance of the fee 1 payment according to the following guidelines: 2 (A) The director shall require an emergency medical transport provider that 3 rendered 35,000 or more Medi-Cal fee-for-service emergency medical transports 4 during the 2016-17 state fiscal year to remit the fee payment described in this 5 paragraph on or after July 1, 2018. 6 (B) The director shall require an emergency medical transport provider that 7 rendered fewer than 35,000 Medi-Cal fee-for-service emergency medical transports 8 during the 2016-17 state fiscal year to remit 50 percent or less of the fee payment 9 described in this paragraph on or after August 1, 2018. 10 (C) The director shall require an emergency medical transport provider that 11 rendered fewer than 35,000 Medi-Cal fee-for-service emergency medical transports 12 during the 2016-17 state fiscal year to remit any remaining fee payment amount 13 described in this paragraph on or after August 15, 2018. 14 (2) Commencing with the state fiscal quarter beginning on October 1, 2018, and 15 continuing each state fiscal quarter thereafter, on or before the first day of each state 16 fiscal quarter, each emergency medical transport provider subject to the fee shall 17 remit to the department an amount equal to the annual quality assurance fee rate for 18 the applicable state fiscal year multiplied by the number of transports reported or 19 that should have been reported by the emergency medical transport provider 20 pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 14129.1 in the immediately preceding quarter. 21 (d)(1) Interest shall be assessed on quality assurance fees not paid on the date due 22 at the greater of 10 percent per annum or the rate at which the department assesses 23 interest on Medi-Cal program overpayments pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 24 14171. Interest shall begin to accrue the day after the date the payment was due and 25 shall be deposited in the Medi-Cal Emergency Medical Transport Fund established 26 in subdivision (f). 27 (2) In the event that any fee payment is more than 60 days overdue, the department 28 may deduct the unpaid fee and interest owed from any Medi-Cal reimbursement 29 payments owed to the emergency medical transport provider until the full amount 30 of the fee, interest, and any penalties assessed under this article are recovered. Any 31 deduction made pursuant to this subdivision shall be made only after the department 32 gives the emergency medical transport provider written notification. Any deduction 33 made pursuant to this subdivision may be deducted over a period of time that takes 34 into account the financial condition of the emergency medical transport provider. 35 (3) In the event that any fee payment is more than 60 days overdue, a penalty 36 equal to the interest charge described in paragraph (1) shall be assessed and due for 37 each month for which the payment is not received after 60 days. Any funds resulting 38 from a penalty imposed pursuant to this paragraph shall be deposited into the Medi-39 Cal Emergency Medical Transport Fund created pursuant to subdivision (f). 40 (4) The director may waive a portion or all of either the interest or penalties, or 41 both, assessed under this article in the event the director determines, in his or her 42 the director's sole discretion, that the emergency medical transport provider has 43 STAFF DRAFT Recommendation November 14, 2019 - 712 - demonstrated that imposition of the full amount of the quality assurance fee 1 pursuant to the timelines applicable under this article has a high likelihood of 2 creating an undue financial hardship for the provider. Waiver of some or all of the 3 interest or penalties pursuant to this paragraph shall be conditioned on the 4 emergency medical transport provider's agreement to make fee payments on an 5 alternative schedule developed by the department. 6 (e) The department shall accept an emergency medical transport provider's 7 payment even if the payment is submitted in a rate year subsequent to the rate year 8 in which the fee was assessed. 9 (f)(1) The director shall deposit the quality assurance fees collected pursuant to 10 this section in the Medi-Cal Emergency Medical Transport Fund, which is hereby 11 created in the State Treasury and, notwithstanding Section 13340 of the Government 12 Code, is continuously appropriated without regard to fiscal years to the department 13 for the purposes specified in this article.
