Parasitic infections have become more common with international travel over the last few years. Unfortunately but not surprisingly, they can cause a variety of symptoms, such as fatigue, constipation, diarrhea, vomiting, heartburn, chills, stomach pain or loss of appetite. If you suspect having a parasitic infection, there is a natural way to treat it. It's called a parasite cleanse, and I strongly advise you do one as well as eat an anti-parasite diet for a period of time to heal yourself. What Are Parasites? Parasites are generally acquired from consuming contaminated food or water, but people with imbalanced gut flora, leaky gut syndrome or a weakened immune system may be more susceptible. A parasite is an organism that lives on or in a host and gets its food from or at the expense of its host. Yes, not pleasant. Worse, parasites can cause disease in humans. Some parasitic diseases are easily treated and some are not. So let's discuss how to kill off parasites. Now, I would estimate about 50 percent or more Americans carry parasites, and you may wonder where somebody get a parasite besides. One is pork, if you've ever eaten pork. Pork can carry parasites and worms, so if you eat pork consistently, there's a chance that you have a parasite. Also, as mentioned above, if you've ever been to another country like China, India, Africa, Mexico, even trips to places like Cancun, if you drank the water or if you eat some of their food, there's a great chance that you could have picked up a parasite. Specifically, if you came back and had dysentery or some problem with your stomach afterwards \u2014 such as something the CDC calls persistent travelers' diarrhea \u2014 it's very likely that you have a parasite. The Parasite Cleanse If any of the above is true, then you need to do a parasite cleanse. You've got to get rid of the parasites, so I want to give you some practical tips about what you need to do in terms of diet and supplements to actually kill off the worms and parasites in your system. 1. Parasite Cleanse Supplements When you are supplementing to kill parasites, there are natural anti-parasite compounds you want to use. For example, there's a product from my friend Dr. Gez Agolli in Atlanta. It's called Paracomplete, which is a parasite cleanse supplement. It has things it in like thyme leaf, something called beberine sulfate (that you can sometimes find it in coconut and can kill off parasites), oregano, grapefruit seed extract and uva ursi leaf, so there are certain herbs that kill off parasites. Now, to create your own parasite cleanse concoction, there are certain supplements for killing off parasites and that you can get in tincture form. These include black walnut, wormwood, olive leaf and garlic. Oftentimes, you can find a parasite cleanse with these ingredients at your local health food store, or get them individually. If not, here are the top supplements for a your very own parasite cleanse: #1 Black walnut (250 milligrams 3x daily) Has been used historically for the treatment of parasites. #2 Wormwood (200milligrams 3x daily) It's known Oil (500 milligrams has antibacterial and anti-parasitic effects. #4 Grapefruit seed extract (take as directed) Has anti-parasitic effects. #5 Clove Oil (500 mg 4x daily or 4 cups of tea) Clove oil kills off parasites and other invading organisms. I recommend you do about two weeks of a parasite cleanse, taking these supplements, then take a week off and jump back on for two more weeks. That protocol is as important as taking the supplements. 2. The Anti-Parasite Diet Now what's even more important is your diet. In order to kill parasites in your system and kill off the bad bacteria and the fungus that these parasites live off of, you've got to get rid of bad bacteria. To do that, you must go on a diet that is free of all sugar and all grains \u2014 pretty close to a Paleo diet. When you're going to do a parasite cleanse, I even recommend that you limit your fruit intake or eat no fruit whatsoever. So rather than a berry smoothie, you just drink a coconut smoothie with coconut milk, chia seeds and protein powder; for lunch, do a big salad; and for dinner, prepare organic meat and double the vegetables, staying completely away from any form of grains or sugar, including fruit. Now another thing I want to talk about is pumpkin seeds. Pumpkin seeds are the No. 1 food that kills off parasites. So one of the things I've personally done if I'm doing a parasite cleanse, I'll take pumpkin seeds and eat one cup a day \u2014 half a cup, I may throw in a smoothie in the morning and another half a cup in the afternoon, or you can make pumpkin seed butter, throwing this into something like a Vitamix blender along with pumpkin seed oil that they carry that at most health food stores. So pumpkin seeds and pumpkin seed oil, and I'll eat this throughout the day as well in order to kill off parasites.Here are some other top anti-parasite foods: * Garlic and onions - Both of these immune-boosting vegetables have anti-parasitic effects. * Herbs - Certain herbs, like oregano and ginger, can have antibacterial and antiparasitic effects. * Papaya juice - This potent juice can have anti-parasitic effects. * Coconut oil - Coconut oil has antibacterial and antimicrobial properties. * Probiotic rich foods - Consuming high probiotic foods like kefir, sauerkraut and yogurt can keep parasites in check and improve the health of the gut. And here are the foods you want to avoid: * Sugar - Feeds parasites and lowers immune functioning. * Processed foods - Foods that are highly processed do not support immune health. * Alcohol - Does not allow for proper immune system functioning. * Wheat - Many grains, especially those containing gluten, can break down into sugar quickly and cause intestinal inflammation. * Pork - Can be highly contaminated with parasites. 3. Do a few colonics I also recommend doing a few colonics, probably two to three colon cleanses, once a week for three weeks while doing your two-to-four week parasite cleanse. Final Thoughts If you take the supplements, get rid of the sugar from your diet, take the pumpkin seeds, and follow that protocol and do so strictly for a one-month period of time, then you should be able to cleanse yourself of parasites.
