For example, light and dark are considered opposites, but they're dependent on each other because darkness cannot exist without light. A shadow can't be created without light from the sun, therefore the two are connected and interdependent. According to Yin and Yang, opposites such as these are found throughout the natural world, including our bodies. When these opposites are balanced, the patient will be in good health. With Yin and Yang as a base, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) aims to restore a patient's balance and harmony. When a person is well-balanced, their vital life force (Qi, pronounced \"chee\") is able to freely flow through their bodies, neither blocked or depleted. Chinese herbal medicine is just one component of Traditional Chinese Medicine that aims to resolve Qi blockage or deficiency, through the use of herbs. Though the concept of Qi has never been scientifically-proven, studies have shown Chinese herbal medicines to be successful in treating a range of conditions1. Chinese herbal medicine has had a great influence on Eastern medicine, and recently became popular in the West. It still forms a major part of healthcare provision in China, and is provided in state hospitals alongside Western medicine. Traditional Chinese Medicine includes all oriental traditions that emerged from Southeast Asia, which originated in China. Practitioners might work within a Japanese, Vietnamese, Taiwanese, or Korean tradition. It is considered a complete medical system, capable of treating a wide range of conditions. The shortcomings of Western medicine are becoming more apparent, and people are starting to look for effective alternatives.1 Chinese herbal medicine is one such alternative, and is becoming more popular as an industry, with more and more traditional Western clinics and organisations look to add Chinese herbal medicine to their repertoire. This expansion is opening up fulfilling career opportunities for people interested in Chinese herbal medicine\u2014 Chinese herbal practitioners can make upwards of $75,000 per year, depending on their experience in the industry.2 To practice, they must also be registered through regulatory boards AHPRA (Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency) and CMBA (Chinese Medicine Board of Australia). Studying Chinese herbal medicine courses gives you the opportunity to incorporate a holistic approach to healing and helping people. It can be used to improve a range of ailments, including: To be qualified to practice Chinese herbal medicine, you will need to complete a Bachelor of Traditional Chinese Medicine.

Course Provider : Western Sydney University Campuses :NSW After you complete your Chinese medicine training courses and become qualified, you are likely to work in one of the following places: As a team member in an established clinic, you would gain the benefit of working with more experienced practitioners, perhaps in fields different or complementary to your own. You would also learn how to manage and run a clinic, as well as expand your skill set as a practicing herbalist. Many who graduate from Chinese medicine courses go on to open a private practice. As the owner and operator of a small business, you will be able to choose work hours and days, but will also be responsible for implementing marketing strategies, gaining malpractice and other insurance, and managing the day-to-day operations of the clinic. Once successful, you will have the opportunity to expand and hire more practitioners within the Chinese medicine industry. Similar to working within a clinic, working within hospitals or community health centres are great learning experiences. Working within the fast pace of a hospital will be a rewarding career, and provide opportunities for continual professional development. Those who graduate and gain a few years of experience can also go on to work in the education sector. These opportunities include a lecturer or professor for those studying the Bachelor of TCM or a private tutor. You could also complete further studies, or work within the academic field of Chinese herbal medicine. As Chinese herbal medicine is growing in popularity, more tonics and treatments are formulated to improve health. Whether you work for a private company or a state-funded organisation, these products need development, trials, and testing. Applying your knowledge to this area is a great use of your skills, and a rewarding career, particularly if you are interested in the chemical aspect of Chinese herbal medicine. As a product representative, you would be using both your knowledge of herbal medicine, as well as business tactics you learnt throughout your qualifications. This is a rewarding field to work in, especially if you have great interpersonal and communication skills. To become a qualified practitioner in Australia, you will need to complete: Course duration: 4 years full time, 8 years (max 10) parttime Study mode: Mixture of on campus learning, supervised clinical practice and external clinical practice. Entry requirements: Year 12 or equivalent Units of study: Please note: What was formerly an accepted qualification of an Advanced Diploma of Chinese Herbal Medicine is no longer offered or accepted by Australian standards of qualifications.
