At Whole Pet Wellness Veterinary Services, we're pleased to offer a number of these integrative treatment options. Acupuncture [Acupuncture](https://wholepetwellness.com/acupuncture/) operates under the theory that when the body's natural energy source becomes disrupted, pain and sickness can result. To counter this, acupuncture needles are inserted into specific points along the body to promote healing and reduce pain. Acupuncture can be used to treat anything from arthritis to respiratory problems and just about everything in between. It can also be used to strengthen the immune system and create better balance. Chiropractic Care Chiropractic care in pets is similar to what's practiced on human patients. A chiropractic adjustment can correct the musculoskeletal system when it has become misaligned. When even one vertebra is out of place, it can cause significant problems in the surrounding muscles and ligaments. Chiropractic care can alleviate pain, improve movement and enhance overall wellbeing. Chinese Herbal Medicine Chinese herbal medicine can be highly effective in treating chronic medical conditions and is often used to relieve pain, improve and restore proper organ function, and promote a stronger, healthier immune system. The ultimate goal of herbal therapy is to naturally return the body to a state of balance and [wellness](https://wholepetwellness.com/wellness-vaccinations/) without the risk of side effects that traditional pharmaceuticals can often present. Homeopathic Medicine Homeopathy is based on the theory that the same substances which cause illness in the body, when used properly, can also counteract those same symptoms. Homeopathic medicine uses natural ingredients to help fortify the body's ability to fight off illness and restore a sense of balance. It is especially useful in managing chronic health conditions to improve the patient's overall quality of life. The integrative medicine options at Whole Pet Wellness Veterinary Services are typically used in conjunction with our traditional Western medical services. They can also be used as standalone treatments in certain cases. Your pet's individual situation will be carefully considered when we are developing our treatment recommendation.
