Australia was the first country to implement a fully funded national HPV vaccination program for girls (aged 12 -13 years) via schools in 2007 using three doses of the quadrivalent HPV (4vHPV) vaccine, Gardasil\u00ae. There was also a community -based catch- up program for girls and women up to the age of 26 years that concluded in 2009. The program was extended in 2013 to include boys aged 12- 13 years (ongoing school -year based cohort along with girls), with catch -up for boys aged 14-15 years till end- 2014. The National HPV Vaccination Program Register (HPV Register) was establi shed in 2008 to capture the HPV vaccinations administered as part of the National HPV Vaccination Program. The 9-valent HPV (9vHPV) vaccine, Gardasil\u00ae9, replaced the 4vHPV vaccine in the National Immunisation Program (NIP) from February 2018. Gardasil\u00ae9 pr ovides protection against the four HPV types (6, 11, 16 and 18) in the 4vHPV vaccine and an additional five oncogenic HPV types (31, 33, 45, 52 and 58), which are the next most frequently detected in cervical cancers globally after HPV types 16 and 18. The bivalent HPV vaccine (2vHPV) has never been funded under the NIP. 9vHPV vaccine has been offered via school -based programs for children aged 12- 13 years in a 2-dose schedule, with the second dose given 6- 12 months after the first dose since 2018 in all states and territories, except New South Wales (NSW), which introduced the 2 -dose schedule in 2017. Catch- up vaccination is available under the NIP, mostly via primary healthcare settings, up to the age of 19 years. With the expansion of the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register to the whole- of-life Australian Immunisation Register (AIR), all HPV vaccination records held in the HPV Register were transferred into AIR in late 2018. All HPV vaccinations given through the school -based programs as well as dos es given by other immunisation providers are now reported directly to AIR. Aims To assess the overall uptake and impact of the N ational HPV V accination Program since the last evaluation in 2014 To identify any key knowledge gaps related to the impact/outc omes of the program To make recommendations regarding ongoing monitoring and program enhancements Methods Guided by a conceptual framework based on the logic model of program outcomes, we reviewed relevant published and unpublished data and interviewed k ey stakeholders to monitor and assess NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 14 of 262 outcomes/impact of the HPV vaccination program to date, particularly those observed since the previous evaluation, in terms of vaccination coverage, vaccine safety and disease burden. Literature review Literature sear ches were conducted in OVID Medline and OVID EMBASE databases for publications on HPV vaccine coverage, safety and disease impact for the period 1 January 2013 to 25 October 2019. The Australian- focussed Informit Health databases were also searched for bot h published and grey literature. Searches were limited to studies in humans, written in English and from Australia. All publications listed in the previous ev aluation report were excluded. Content experts were consulted and reference lists of key papers were reviewed, along with websites of key Australian organisations, to identify additional relevant literature. Stakeholder assessment A mixed methods approach was used to collect both qualitative and quantitative data from semi -structured interviews and an online survey. Purposive sampling was used to recruit a broad range of key stakeholders for interview. Stakeholders were approached directly or referred by ot her participants. Interviews were conducted from October 2019 to March 2020. An anonymous online survey was distributed to other stakeholders, predominantly immunisation providers, general practitioners (GPs), practice nurses, school -based nurse immunisers , Aboriginal health workers, sexual health physicians, cervical cancer screening managers) with a mix of open- and closed- ended questions using either Likert -type scales or check -box options. The survey was open for completion from November 2019 to Februar y 2020. Vaccination coverage AIR data, as at 29 February 2020, were obtained and vaccine encounters up to 31 December 2019 were analysed by gender, state/territory, remoteness/socioeconomic status of area of residence, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status. Eligible year -wide birth cohorts for female and male adolescents aged 12 to <20 years as at 31 December 2019 were used to assess cumulative HPV vaccination coverage (1, 2 or 3 doses), calculated using the number of individuals with a record of relevant HPV vaccine doses between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2019 as the numerator and the overall number of adolescents in the relevant AIR cohort as the denominator. We also assessed trends in HPV vaccination coverage (1, 2 or 3 doses) between 2016 and 2019 for females and males aged 15 years, calculated using the number of 15 -year-olds recorded on AIR to have received the relevant number of doses as numerator, and the total number of 15- year-olds in the relevant AIR cohort as denominator. Historical coverage data from the HPV Register was sourced from the VCS Foundation. AIR and HPV Register coverage estimates were compared by calculating coverage for female and male adolescents by year of age using the number with a record of HPV vaccination receiv ed by 30 June 2018 on each register as the numerator, and the relevant Australian Bureau of Statistics Estimated Resident Population (HPV Register) or AIR cohort population, as at 30 June 2017, as the denominator. NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 15 of 262 Vaccine safety Information on all adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) associated with HPV vaccines reported via passive surveillance to the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) from April 2007 to December 2017 and stored in its Adverse Events Management System database were obtained and analysed. We calculated age and sex -specific AEFI reporting rates. AusVaxSafety national enhanced active surveillance system data (obtained using two participant -based SMS -based survey surveillance tools, SmartVax and Vaxtracker installed at sentinel sites across Australia) were also analysed. Disease impact Impact of HPV vaccination on high- grade cervical abnormalities, cervical cancer, anogenital cancers, oropharyngeal cancers and genital warts was assessed using an ecologic al design and 'before and aft er' comparisons with analysis of incidence data from the Australian Cancer Database, 2002- 2016 and hospitalisation data from the National Hospital Morbidity Database, 2002- 2017. Results Stakeholder assessment Key stakeholder interviews (n=42) and online survey responses (n=1,513) provided valuable perspectives on the National HPV Vaccination Program. Key stakeholders who participated in the interviews included staff from the state/ territory health departments , Australian Government Department of Health, TGA, l ocal council s, Aboriginal Comm unity Controlled Health Services, remot e areas, sexual health physicians , cervical screening program managers , Seqirus and HPV researchers . The online survey participants inclu ded GPs, practice nurses, school -based nurse immunisers, Aboriginal health w orkers, sexual health physicians and cervical screening manager s. The change to a 2- dose schedule of 9vHPV vaccine was reported to have many benefits for jurisdictions, immunisation providers and the public. However, reduced opportunities for school -based catch -up vaccination, because of the 6- to 12 -month dosing interval leading to dose- 2 often being given late in the school year when absenteeism is higher, have led to perceptions that impact on coverage has not been as positive as anticipated. Major barriers to achieving higher coverage in the school -based vaccination program were reported to be absenteeism and the reliance on return of paper consent forms. Reported enablers to improving consent form return included: school immunisation teams having access to parent contact details and resources/capacity to conduct follow up of unreturned forms appropriate consent forms and information available for population subgroups with different languages and levels of literacy NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 16 of 262 education for students to increase their understanding of and encourage participation in the consent form process supportive school staff who engage with students and assist with ensuring consent form re turn. While almost all key stakeholders believed that electronic consent forms would assist with consent form return, only two of eight state/territories have been able to progress developing these to date. Catch -up vaccination remains essential, given th e challenge of school absenteeism. Stakeholders reported that school -based catch -up is more convenient for families and leads to measurable increases in HPV vaccination coverage, but is conducted inconsistently across school -based providers and not at all in some jurisdictions. Increased emphasis on and resources to improve capacity to provide school -based catch- up vaccination across the country was considered likely to be beneficial. Free council immunisation clinics, where available, were generally considered a more effective alternative method of catch -up vaccination than reliance on GPs. Various enablers of and challenges to HPV vaccination in culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were identified. P articipants outlined several initiatives currently in development or implemented in the last 5 years to increase HPV vaccination coverage in these populations and improve equity within the program. However, many stakeholders reported that identification of CALD and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people can be difficult, which means that assessing the effectiveness of these initiatives may also be challenging. Most key stakeholders perceived vaccine hesitancy to have had little negative impact on HPV vaccination coverage in Australia. However, stakeholders highlighted the potential for vaccine- hesitant views to spread rapidly on social media and the need to be vigilant and monitor public attitudes towards HPV vaccination. Almost all stakeholders beli eved that Australia could achieve the W orld Health Organization (WHO) cervical cancer elimination target of 90% course completion for females aged 15 years by 2030, but that an increase in effort, support for the program and development of additional strategies were required to achieve this. Stakeholders made many recommendations to increase HPV vaccination coverage , including: improv ing processes for consent form return increas ing education of adolescents and parents strengthening messaging for parents around the benefits of vaccination improv ing vaccination reporting by immunisation providers improv ing vaccination coverage in CALD and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people Some stakeholders also suggested that the potential to reduce the schedule to a single dose, currently being investigated, would assist Australia in achieving the WHO coverage target. The opportunity for enhanced integration between the national HPV vaccination program and the cervical screening program was also highlighted by many stakeholders, particularly given the transition to HPV -based cervical screening, which presents an opportunity to enhance cervical NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 17 of 262 cancer prevention in Australia. This enhanced integration would allow ascertainment of HPV vaccination status of women attending cervical cancer screening services. Limitations of the stakeholder interview approach include that opinions are likely based, to a variable degree, on data or research findings and/or practical experience. In addition, given variations within Austral ia in the HPV vaccination program delivery, national or jurisdictional perspectives may not accurately reflect processes and factors influencing the program in all regions . Vaccination coverage Trends in HPV vaccine coverage at 15 years of age show increase in dose 1 and dose 3 coverage from 2016 to 2018. In 2019, most adolescents in NSW, South Australia and Western Australia had transitioned to the 2 -dose schedule. Dose 2 coverage in 15 -year-olds declined in 2019 in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander female and male adolescents compared with that in 2018. 9vHPV vaccine doses in adolescents aged 15 to <20 years between 1 July 2017 and 31 December 2019 were predominantly administered in GP settings in all jurisdictions except the Northern Territory where community health services and Aboriginal health services provided the majority of HPV vaccines. Cumulative HPV vaccine coverage derived from AIR (based on age at 31 December 2019) is broadly consistent with historical data trends from previous coverage estimates derived from the HPV Register . For adolescents turning 15 years in 2019, the 2- dose coverage was 82.6% in females and 79.9% in males. Consistent with the previous HPV Register estimates, d ose 1 coverage is roughly equivalent for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and non- Indigenous adolescents, except in 13- 14-year-old Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander males who have 4- 5% lower coverage of dose 1 than their non- Indigenous peers. Comparison of coverage estimates from the HPV Register and AIR showed that the HPV Register estimates were universally higher than the AIR estimates for females aged 13- 18 years and males aged 13- 17 years. However, for 19 -year-old females and 18- 19-year-old males, AIR coverage estimates for each dose were higher. The differences in coverage estimates are due to the different denominators used for estimating coverage in the HPV Register and AIR. Vaccine safety For the 11 -year period 2007- 2017, the overall rate of adverse events reported following HPV vaccination from the national TGA AEMS database was 48.5 per 100,000 doses administered. Excluding an enhanced surveillance period (2013- 2014), it was 39.8 per 100,000 doses. Thes e reporting rates of adverse events following HPV vaccine administration in Australia were consistent with data from similar surveillance systems internationally and did not reveal any new or concerning safety issues over the 11- year period. During the per iod 1 February 2018 - 31 December 2019, AusVaxSafety sentinel active surveillance captured 73,627 HPV vaccination encounters in adolescents aged 11- 14 years. The majority of encounters (91.1%) were captured by the SmartVax tool at 269 national sentinel sit es. All Vaxtracker encounters were captured via the NSW school -based immunisation program. NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 18 of 262 Of the 73,627 adolescent HPV vaccination encounters captured in AusVaxSafety, 42,067 (57.1%) of caregivers participated by responding to the day 3- 5 post vaccination survey. Of these, 3,690 (8.8%) reported any AEFI and 235 (0.6%) reported seeking medical attention for an AEFI. The caregivers for 114 adolescents provided details about their child's reported medical attendance; of these, 106 (88.6%) presented to a GP and 13 (11.4%) to an emergency department. These national surveillance data provide evidence supporting the good safety profile of the HPV vaccine and that AEFI rates are low and consistent with data from reporting systems in other countries . Disease impact High-grade cervical abnormali ties The overall cervical high- grade abnormalities (HGA) incidence rate in cervical screening data decreased from the pre -vaccine period (2004- 2006) to the post -vaccine period (2007- 2016) in vaccine- eligible age groups by 48% and 20% in females aged <20 and 20- 24 years, respectively. In contrast, cervical HGA incidence rate increased by 13% in the non- vaccine- eligible cohort of females aged 30 years. There was a progressive decline in the proportion of cervical HGA that was diagnosed in individuals aged < 30 years from 53% in 2004- 2006 to 50% in 2007- 2012 and then to 41% in 2013 - June 2017. The overall age -standardised cervical HGA rate declined from 8.4 per 1,000 females screened in 2007 to 5.8 per 1,000 females screened in the first half of 2017. The hospitalisation rates for cervical HGA (as principal diagnosis) in non- Indigenous females aged <30 years decreased from pre- vaccine period (2002- 2007) to post -vaccine period (2008- 2017) by 69%, and 9% age <20, 20- 24 and 25- 29 years, resp ectively. In Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander females, cervical HGA hospitalisation rates declined over the same period in the age groups of <20 and 20- 24 years, by 58% and 14%, respectively . Cervical cancer Overall the cervical cancer incidence rate was not significantly different between the pre- vaccine period (2000- 2007) and post -vaccine period (2008- 2015), but the mortality rate was 12% lower in the post -vaccine period. The age- standardis ed mortality rate of cervical cancer decreased from 5.2 to 1.8 per 100,000 females between 1982 and 2019. The hospitalisation rate for cervical cancer (as principal diagnosis) in the post -vaccine period was lower than in the pre -vaccine period. The cervical cancer hospitalisation rate decreased in women aged 30 years (both Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and non- Indigenous), who were not vaccine- eligible, and in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander females aged 25- 29 years. These reductions in cerv ical cancer hospitalisations and mortality, without a similar decline in overall cervical cancer incidence, likely reflect earlier detection through the cervical screening program along with better treatments. Vaccination was not anticipated to have yet had an impact on cancer rates as at the time of this assessment . NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 19 of 262 Juvenile- onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis An impact of the National HPV Vaccination Program is the significant reduction i n juvenile- onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (JoRRP), a condition associated with vertical transmission of HPV infection before or during birth, particularly type 6 or 11. This decline is evidence of reduced mother -to-child HPV transmission around the time of birth. Estimated hospitalisation rates (noting there is no unique International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems [ICD] code for RRP) followed the expected pattern, with JoRRP predominantly affecting children aged <12 years and adult -onset RRP (AoRRP) adults aged 20 -30 years and 60 years . Anogenital warts There has been a remarkable decline in hospitalisations for anogenital warts in Australia. A decline of 74.4%, 54.1% and 22.1% from the pre- vaccine period (2002- 2007) to the post -vaccine period (2008- 2017) was observed in individuals aged 10 -19 years, 20 -29 years and 30- 39 years, respectively. This is consistent with evidence of decreases in the incidence o f anogenital lesions seen in outpatient settings, such as sexual health clinics . Strengths and limitations of data sources in the evaluation Data sources used in this evaluation of the National HPV Vaccination Program have inherent strengths and limitations in determining the impact of the program on the burden of disease. One of the strengths is the availability of national hospitalisation dat a for HPV -related cancers and genital warts coded using ICD -10-AM (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th edition, Australian modification) codes both before and after the program. However, there is considerable lag in hospitalisation data availability; data on immunisation status are not available; and genital warts admissions represent only a small proportion of the disease burden, as genital warts are mostly managed in general practice and sexual health cli nics, with hospitalisations representing only severe cases. Vaccine coverage estimates are likely to underestimate actual levels of coverage by a small but uncertain proportion because of under -reporting. Limitations of vaccine safety data from the sponta neous/passive surveillance system include differences in data quality, accuracy and timeliness of reports of AEFI between jurisdictions. However, enhanced active sentinel surveillance data complement the passive surveillance data and are more timely and complete. A specific surveillance plan that included analysis of linked data (from the various data sources above) would increase the ability to extend the impact evaluation presented here and generate new knowledge, for example around equity of the program and areas of unmet need. Conclusion HPV vaccine has been successfully incorporated into Australia's NIP, with relatively high coverage achieved since the implementation of the program. The change to a 2- dose schedule of 9vHPV vaccine has been well receiv ed by stakeholders, although challenges including reduced NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 20 of 262 opportunities for school -based catch- up vaccination and the 6- 12-month dosing interval leading to dose 2 being given late in the school year persist. Available data show the HPV vaccination program has substantially reduced the burden in vaccine- eligible age groups of cervical HGA in females and genital warts in both sexes, and has also led to substantial indirect disease reduction, particularly HGA, in other age groups. Reported HPV vaccine -related AEFI were predominantly mild and transient in nature and the vaccine has a safety record similar to that of other vaccines on the NIP. Continued monitoring of HPV vaccine coverage, AEFI and disease epidemiology is needed to ensure successes achieved to dat e are maintained and anticipated declines in cancer incidence realised. Using new approaches to both evaluate program impacts and increase vaccination coverage should allow further health benefits to be obtained. NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 21 of 262 Recommendations Consent forms Develop and use electronic consent forms in school -based immunisation programs, for all vaccines, including HPV vaccine. Consider development of a nationally standardised consent form with minimum core data fields. Consider strategies to increase consent form return, for example, combination of hard copy and electronic consent reminders. Information and education for parents and adolescents Consider a dedicated national website linked to the current Australian Gover nment Department of Health website for students and parents to obtain information online about HPV vaccination in an appealing and accessible way. Enhance information for parents and adolescents around the benefits of HPV vaccine, why it is given to both females and males and why in early adolescence. Include HPV education in school curriculum, collaborating with young people and teachers to develop appropriate educational materials. Enhance HPV education at school just before vaccination days, which could include showing HPV videos. Emphasise the importance of completing the HPV vaccine schedule. Continue to conduct media campaigns about the benefits of the HPV vaccine and its availability, including at general practice. Promote good news stories about vaccine impact, particularly in social media. Develop online education for students to access outside of school time to improve their self - efficacy, co -designed with parents and students and in addition to education in schools. Develop/improve HPV vaccinat ion resources in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages and for CALD people. Catch -up opportunities Consider expanded healthcare clinics in schools with training and funding of school nurses to vaccinate. Provide more catch -up opportunities at schools, for example, additional visits. Increase opportunities for school -based catch -up, or community outreach visits, for schools with high Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander student enrolment, where there are higher rates of absenteeism and students may not want to go to an Aboriginal Medical Service. Include HPV vaccination in the regular health program and pathways that adolescents in out - of-home care receive. NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 22 of 262 Increase community partnerships between schools and GPs to streamline catch- up vaccination. Consider targeted HPV catch- up vaccination outside of normal school hours at schools, and in general practice settings, in low coverage areas. Education of immunisation providers Provide information to immunisation providers (e.g. GPs and practice nurs es) on how to use AIR to generate overdue lists to recall adolescents due for HPV vaccination, particularly before they turn 15 years old. Provide ongoing information and guidance to immunisation providers about the importance and methods of reporting HPV vaccination to AIR. Campaign to increase GP awareness and encourage checking adolescents' HPV vaccination history. Educate immunisation providers on how to counsel HPV vaccine- hesitant parents/guardians (e.g. using Sharing Knowledge About Immunisation [ SKAI ] resources). Provide additional information to immunisation providers regarding the safety and efficacy of HPV vaccines . Data quality and reporting Consider training for data entry staff to improve HPV immunisation data quality and reporting to AIR. Consider financial incentives for GPs to record HPV vaccine doses in AIR. Link vaccination (all vaccines including HPV) reporting to AIR with accreditation of immunisation providers (e.g. GPs). Enhance provision of timely vaccination coverage rates by schools to allow school -based immunisation providers to identify gaps before the end of the school year . Research to inform interventions Conduct research into why coverage rates are low in certain areas, for example, using the WHO's Tailoring Immunization Programmes approach to understand barriers to vaccination and inform interventions to address them. Monitor scientific literature on 1 -dose HPV vaccine effectiveness to inform consideration of reducing the HPV vaccination schedule to one dose. Consider reg ular community surveys of attitudes towards HPV vaccination in Australia. Evaluate the effectiveness of strategies such as reminders to parents/carers from AIR to encourage completion of HPV vaccination courses. NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 23 of 262 Conduct analyses of de- identified data from large linked databases , for example, AIR, cervical screening database, hospitalisations and others to identify where gaps in program delivery and equity of impact can be addressed. Funding and support Increase funding to support delivery of HPV vaccinati ons in remote areas. Provide funded HPV vaccine for high- risk occupational groups who are not currently eligible, for example, migrant sex workers. Increase resources and funding for evaluation of the school -based program and research into factors affectin g coverage. Consider funding for HPV vaccination for high- risk groups who are recommended to receive the vaccine, as per the Australian Immunisation Handbook, but are not currently funded, notably men who have sex with men and immunocompromised individuals . Programmatic and policy issues Target marginalised students at higher risk of HPV infection and absenteeism in low coverage areas with tailored strategies. Implement measures to enhance uptake of HPV vaccination in special school students, for example, additional personnel to help or facilitate access to specialist immunisation services . Share initiatives/strategies used by local government areas/schools with high HPV vaccination coverage with lower coverage areas/schools. Ensure the program is well accepted by adolescents, for example, install privacy screens, vaccinate anxious students first. Enhance processes for schools to provide timely class lists with parent contact details to school -based immunisers, considering relevant privacy issues and any need for legislative changes. Promote HPV vaccination and cervical screening as a wellness program to improve reproductive health to remove the stigma around sexual health. Consider inclusion of HPV vaccine in immunisation requirements under 'No Jab No Pay' policy, with due consideration of assessment age and number of doses. Develop plan to assess and address areas where improved coverage and equity could be better achieved in order to meet the WHO target of 90% coverage by 2030. NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 24 of 262 Introduction Human papil lomavirus (HPV) is responsible for malignant and non- malignant lesions in both sexes, mostly affecting the anogenital region, but also other parts of the body notably the head and neck region.1 Some HPV types, including types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59 and 68, are designated as oncogenic types because they are causally associated with the development of cancer of the cervix as well as some anal, vaginal, vulval, penile, and head and neck cancers.2 Other HPV types, including types 6, 11, 40, 42, 43, 44, 54, 61, 70, 72, 81 and 89, are classified as 'low-risk' and are predominantly associated with non- malignant lesions, such as genital warts.3 Globally, each year, more than half a million women are diagnosed with cervical cancer.4-6 To eli minate cervical cancer as a public health problem (incidence rate <4 per 100,000), the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended the '90- 70-90' targets to be reached by 2030: 90% of girls fully vaccinated with the HPV vaccine by 15 years of age; 70% of women screened with a high-precision test at 35 and 45 years of age; and 90% of women identified with cervical disease receive treatment and care (90% of women with pre- cancer treated and 90% of women with invasive cancer managed).7 Australia is on trac k to eliminate cervical cancer as a public health problem by 2028.8 Australia has been a world leader in HPV vaccination and was the first country to implement a fully funded national HPV vaccination program for girls (aged 12- 13 years) via schools in 2007 using three doses of the quadrivalent HPV (4vHPV) vaccine, Gardasil\u00ae, which provides protection against four HPV types (6, 11, 16 and 18).9, 10 There was also a community -based catch -up program for women up to the age of 26 years that concluded in 2009. The HPV vaccination program for girls was extended in 2013 t o boys aged 12- 13 years, with catch- up for those aged 14-15 years old till end of 2014. 9,10 The 9 -valent HPV (9vHPV) vaccine, Gardasil\u00ae9 , replaced the 4vHPV vaccine the National Immunisation Program (NIP) from February 2018.11 Gardasil\u00ae9 provides protection against the four HPV types contained in the 4vHPV vaccine and an additional five oncogenic HPV types (31, 33, 45, 52 and 58), which are the next most frequently detected types in cervical cancers globally after types 16 and 18. Since 2018, 9vHPV vaccine is provided routinely via school -based programs for girls and boys at ages 12- 13 years in a 2 -dose schedule. The second dose is given 6- 12 months after the first dose.12 Catch -up is available under the NIP from primary care up to the age of 19 years. Evaluation of the National HPV Vaccination P rogram The National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance (NCIRS), under a funding agreement with the Australian Government Department of Health (Health), evaluated the nat ional 4vHPV vaccination program for the period 2007 to 2012/2013 and submitted a final report to Health in 2014. 9 This evaluation included a process evaluation and short - to medium -term outcome/impact evaluation (vaccine coverage, adverse events following immunisation [AEFI], cervical high -grade abnormalities [HGA] and anogenital warts). 9 The implementation process was viewed as successful overall by stakeholders.9 The recommendations included continued NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 25 of 262 monitoring and evaluation of vaccine coverage, AEFI and disease epidemiology to determine if program impacts are sustained or improved subsequently, particularly in light of the extension of the program to male adolescents in early 2013.9 For the present NCIRS -led evaluation undertaken during 2019- 2020, the f ocus was on evaluating the impact of the program, particularly on outcomes/impacts observed since the previous evaluation in terms of vaccination coverage, AEFI and disease burden. This evaluation is funded by Health. Guided by a conceptual framework based on the logic model 13 of program outcomes (refer to Figure 1), we reviewed relevant published and unpublished data and interviewed key stakeholders to monitor and assess outcomes/impact of the HPV vaccination program to date. HPV vaccination coverage moni toring is a core component of Australia's HPV surveillance plan, 14 and serves several important public health purposes. Immunisation providers need short -term estimates of coverage being achieved during delivery to assess whether coverage is improving or declining; to ensure that vaccine supplies are sufficient; and to identify areas that may benefit from further visits or intensive follow -up to improve coverage. For this, as close to real time data as possible are needed, including current numbers of eligi ble students, and usually local records are used. Coverage estimates over larger geographic areas (up to state and national levels) are best provided by a comprehensive vaccination registry. They are used to monitor trends over time, ensure that coverage achieved is adequate to control disease and are useful to inform research and evaluation of program impacts and delivery methods, including input into modelling studies. The evaluation of HPV vaccination coverage in this report is notable for two main reas ons. First, at the time of transition between registers in 2018, Australia implemented a 2- dose 9vHPV vaccine program. Before this, the program used a 3- dose 4vHPV vaccine program. From 2018 those aged 14 years at first dose were eligible for the 2- dose c ourse, with three doses still required for those aged 15 years at first dose or those with significant immunocompromise. No estimates of coverage achieved with 9vHPV vaccine or the 2 -dose course have yet been published. There is some complexity in the int erpretation of per -dose coverage over time, as New South Wales (NSW) initiated the 2- dose course early and age at vaccination determines eligibility for two rather than three doses. Also, not all children in a single school year level are the same age at v accination. Second, it is of interest to compare the historical estimates of coverage from the National HPV Vaccination Program Register ( the HPV Register ) with the same estimates calculated using the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR) data. AIR uses the Medicare population as the denominator, and a previous study found some minor differences in HPV vaccine coverage estimates when using Medicare versus ABS populations. 15 In addition, when data from the HPV Register were transferred into AIR, some data cleaning and merging using Medicare details occurred . As a result, dose rules may differ somewhat, meaning that numerator data may not be identical. Understanding any differences in historical coverage between the two methods is important for interpreting coverage and coverage trends into the future. The inclusion of HPV vaccines in AIR is expected to improve completeness of reporting of doses administered in general practice, which were incompletely notified to the HPV Register . Since 2017 all people aged up to 19 years are eligible for catch- up HPV vaccination through their primary care provider if they missed vaccination at school but no systematic assessment of the level of catch -up vaccination occurring in 15- 19-year olds has yet been made. NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 26 of 262 We have col lated all relevant information into a comprehensive report documenting the successes of what has been described as a world- leading program,10,16 and provided recommendations to further enhance the program. Aims The aims of this evaluation were to: assess the overall uptake and impact of the N ational HPV V accination Program since the last evaluation in 2014 identify any key gaps in knowledge make recommendations regarding ongoing monitoring and program enhancements . This evaluation included assessment of: vaccination coverage by age group, sex, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status, state/territory of residence, school versus primary care, timeliness of vaccination and trends in vaccine doses administered and coverage vaccine safety, including repor ts of adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) using both passive and active surveillance data vaccine impact on disease burden, including genital warts, recurrent respiratory papillomatosis, CIN 2, CIN 3, cervical cancer, anogenital cancers and other related cancers, with an alysis stratified by age group, sex and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status stakeholder perspectives on the impact of the HPV vaccination program, including any influences of the 2018 change to a 2 -dose vaccine schedule and perceptions of vaccine safety/vaccine hesitancy on coverage. A particular focus was on factors that could influence program outcomes/impacts, either positively or negatively, in the future. The objectives of this evaluation were to: provide evidence supporting the safety of HPV vaccines provide evidence of the impact of the program on genital warts and high- grade cervical abnormalities, and determine if any impact on cervical or other HPV -related cancers is evident in Australia to date identify any inequit ies in HPV vaccination coverage and disease impact within Australia and make recommendations to address these contribute to the global evidence supporting the use of HPV vaccination and cervical screening to progress towards elimination of cervical cancer as a public health problem.

NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 28 of 262 Ethical considerations Ethical approval for this study was granted by the Sydney Children's Hospitals Network Human Research Ethics Committee, protocol 2019/ETH12453 NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 29 of 262 Literature review Aims To conduct a comprehensive literature review (including grey literature) to assess: vaccination coverage vaccine safety vaccine impact on prevalence of HPV infection and on HPV -associated disease (genital warts, juvenile- onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis [JoRRP], pre- cancerous cervical lesions, cervical cancer, other anogenital cancers and related cancers). Methods The scope of this literature review includes publications in peer -reviewed journals and grey literature from Australia since the previous evaluation of the N ational HPV Vaccination Program.9 Literature searches were conducted in OVID Medline and OVID EMBASE databases for HPV vaccine coverag e, safety and disease impact for the period 1 January 2013 to 25 October 2019 (final search conducted on 25 October 2019). The searches used database thesaurus and text word terms. Thesaurus terms used in OVID Medline as well as terms specific to coverage, vaccine safety and disease burden. Text word terms included those that represent HPV vaccine (2- valent, 4 -valent or 9 -valent vaccine). The A ustralian- focussed Informit Health databases were also searched for both published and grey literature. The searches were limited to studies in humans, written in English and from 'Australia'. The search strategy was adapted to account for differences of s yntax and controlled vocabulary terms for subsequent searches. All citations in the previous evaluation report were excluded. Content experts were also consulted and reference lists of key papers and websites of selected peak Australian organisations were reviewed to identify additional relevant literature. Results Sexual health strategies and cancer control plans An updated plan for monitoring the impact of HPV vaccination in Australia was published by the Communicable Diseases Network Australia in 2013 following the introduction of the male HPV vaccination program.14 This plan, which included surveillance of HPV vaccine coverage and safety, HPV infections, non- cancer disease endpoints and cancer endpoints,14 informed the structure of this literature revi ew. Control of HPV -associated diseases and other sexually transmissible infections (STIs) in Australia is currently guided by the Fourth National STI Strategy 2018- 202217 and Fifth National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Blood Borne Viruses and STI Strategy 2018- 2022.18 Under the Third National STI Strategy 2014- 2017 the target for national adolescent HPV vaccination coverage was NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 30 of 262 70%, which was reached in both females and males in 2016.19 Under the Fourth National STI Strategy this coverage target was increased to 80%.17,18 Australia's current National Framework for Gynaecological Cancer Control also emphasises the role of the N ational HPV Vaccination Program in pri mary prevention of cervical cancer, highlighting both the higher risk of gynaecological cancer and lower HPV vaccination coverage in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander females.20 However, this national framework does not include any targets/goals for the National HPV V accination Program. Most states and territories also publish their own sexual health strategies that include HPV vaccination. Although there is no published sexual health strategy referring to HPV vaccination in Victoria or Tasmania, the Victorian Cancer Plan 2016- 202021 includes focus areas for HPV vaccination. Tasmania included reference to improving HPV vaccination coverage in their Cancer Framework and Strategic Cancer Plan 2010- 2013, 22 but this has not been publicly updated since then. South Australia has also published an Aboriginal Cancer Control Plan 2016- 2021,23 along with a state -wide STI strategy, that includes priorities and actions for improving HPV vaccination coverage in Aboriginal people. All other jurisdictions do not have current published cancer control plans that refer specifically to HPV vaccination. The targets/goals and actions or activities relevant to HPV vaccination that are included in the current national and jurisdictional sexual health strategies and cancer control plans are summarised in Table 1. Of note, many of th ese strategies and plans cover different time periods to the current Fourth National STI Strategy and several jurisdictional strategies are shortly due for update and do not yet reflect the updated 80% national HPV vaccination coverage target.

Aligning with the dat a in these annual reports, historical coverage data from the HPV Register have also been made available online by the Australian Government Department of Health following the transition of HPV vaccination reporting to AIR.33 The HPV Register data showed that coverage increased over time, varying by jurisdiction, and was higher in younger age groups than in older, and was the highest for dose 1, with coverage decreasing for doses 2 and 3. 34-41 Annual vaccination coverage estimates showed 3- dose HPV vaccinat ion coverage for females increased from 71.9% in 2012 to 80.2% in 2017 and for males from 62.4% in 2014 to 75.9% in 2017.34 In 2017, 3- dose coverage for females ranged from 74.6% in Tasmania (TAS) to 92.5% in the N orthern Territory (NT) and for males from 64.0% in TAS to 84.8% in the NT.34 National vaccine coverage for females aged 15 years reached 86%, 83%, 78% for dose 1, 2, 3, respectively, in 2015.42 Despite the increases in adolescent HPV vaccine coverage nationally over time, there is evidence of a di sparity in course completion between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and other Australians. Vaccine coverage for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adolescents aged 12 years in 2015 (data available for N ew South Wales [N SW], Queensland [QLD], NT a nd ACT only) highlighted that course completion was a challenge. 43 The coverage for HPV vaccine dose 1 was higher in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adolescents than in other Australian adolescents (87.3% -95.9% versus 87.0% -97.7% in females and 82.4% -94% versus 83.3- 96.3% in males). However, the coverage for dose 3 was lower in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adolescents than in other Australian adolescents across all jurisdictions, except for females in NSW. 43 The dose 3 coverage by jurisdictio n ranged from 66.5% -82.6% for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander females to 78.4% -87.7% for other females and from 61.2% -72.6% for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander males versus 73.7% -83.7% for other males.43 The 2017 immunisation coverage annual r eport included data on HPV vaccine course completion by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status nationally.34 The 2017 data showed that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adolescents were less likely to complete their HPV vaccine course.34 The proportion of adolescents aged 15 years in 2017 who received dose 1 and completed the 3-dose course was 91% and 90% for non -Indigenous females and males , respectively, but lower at 79% and 77% for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander females and males, respectively.34 Studies have assessed the effectiveness of a reduced dose schedule in young adolescents, as was implemented in Australia in 2018 concurrently with the change to 9vHPV vaccine.44 This change to 9vHPV vaccine will provide broader protection against additional HPV genotypes and is NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 35 of 262 predicted to enhance the expected declines in cervical and other HPV -related cancers in Australia. Recent literature45-49 also indicates potential effectiveness of a single- dose HPV vaccine strategy (non- inferiorit y of immune responses and disease reduction), which would assist in overcoming the barriers to course completion both in Australia and globally and reduce cost and resources required for vaccine program delivery. This evidence is under ongoing review by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization of the World Health Organization (WHO) . Results from ongoing randomised controlled trials of single dose vaccination are awaited. Single dose HPV vaccination is not currently recommended in Australia. Factors associated with HPV vaccine uptake We identified several studies that assessed factors associated with the uptake of HPV vaccination in Australia (refer to Table 2). We also identified additional studies that primarily assessed vaccine impact on HP V disease but also reported on demographic factors associated with HPV vaccination in Australian females. 50-54 Factors shown to be associated with higher likelihood of being vaccinated with HPV vaccine as an adolescent or a young woman included being born in Australia, 50-52,55 -58 younger age,50,51-53 current contraceptive use (hormonal50,55 or unspecified57), unmarried,55,58 speaking English at home,51,58 high knowledge of HPV and HPV vaccine,56 never having had a child,55 current consumer of alcohol,55 history of other STIs,55 private health insurance holder57 and completion of vaccinations due in childhood.57 Vaccinated women were more likely to reside in outer regional, remote or very remote areas,55 while unvaccinated women were more likely to reside in major cities.53,54 No significant difference was seen between vaccinated and unvaccinated females for age of sexual debut,50,57 the number of previous Pap smears or history of abnormal cytology55 or of undergoing a Pap smear in the preceding 2 years.57 For certain other factors such as lifetime number of sexual partners,50,55,57 socioeconomic status,50,52- 55 educational attainment50,55 and smoking status,50,57 the association with likelihood of HPV vaccination was uncertain in published studies. However, national HPV vaccination data show a small but consistent relationship between HPV vaccination and socioeconomic status. 59 Reasons identified for HPV vaccination courses not completed in females eligible for the catch -up program 2007- 2009 included not being aware of doses missed, forgetting to have all recommended doses, the vaccine no longer being free and pregnancy.58,60 The reasons for not receiving any HPV vaccine doses among eligible females included concerns about vaccine safety or side effects, 56,60 uncertainty of their eligibility,56 perception that HPV vaccination was not needed if in a monogamous relationship56 and needle phobia.57 Parents and students concerns about HPV vaccine safety and side effects have been identified as key barriers to vac cination in adolescents in international literature and two recent Australian studies.57,61 However, th ese concerns were less prevalent among Australian parents (15.4%) than among parents in the United States of America (US A; 60.5%) and the United Kingdom (UK; 36.4%).62 Other barriers to HPV vaccination in adolescents identified in Australian studies included student anxiety or needle phobia,57,61,63 low parental literacy or health literacy61 and parental perception of their daughter as low risk.57 The reas ons reported for non- completion of HPV vaccine NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 36 of 262 course included not being aware of the need for a third dose, availability of vaccine from general practitioners and adolescents not wanting further doses.64 Similarly reasons reported for failure to vaccinate adolescents in school -based programs included logistical barriers such as non -return of consent forms,57, 61 school absenteeism57,61 and difficulty contacting parents.61 Anxiety or distress were other reasons, with about a fifth of school students from specialist schools who had the vaccine described by school immunisation coordinators as 'very challenging', 'required extra support' or 'became distressed'.65 Coverage estimates of the first dose of HPV vaccine in 374 students from specialist school s in Victoria were 66% for females and 67% for males. These estimates were similar to those for school -based diphtheria- tetanus -pertussis (dTpa) v accine uptake in the same schools. 65 Vaccine uptake appears to be associated with parental knowledge. Although higher parental knowledge of HPV vaccine was associated overall with increased likelihood of their daughters' receipt of HPV vaccine, one study showed that parents in the US A, the UK and Australia who had either very high or very low HPV vaccine knowledge were less likely to have their daughters vaccinated.62 However, parents with high HPV vaccine knowledge scores expressed attitudes in favour of their daughter receiving the vaccine in future.62 One study found high levels of community acceptance for school -based immunisation programs (SBIP) in Australia, with 76% of 1,926 adults aged 18- 95 years surveyed by telephone in 2011 in South Australia (SA) indicating that schools were the best place for adolescent immunisation.63 Males, younger people and parents with high school children were significantly more likely to support SBIP.63 Convenience, public funding of the immunisation program and compliance were key reasons for willingness to participate (support having children vaccinated) in SBIP.63 On the other hand, a preference for family physician or council clinic, child immunisation anxiety, past history of adverse vaccine reaction and anti -vaccination beliefs were reasons for non -participation in SBIP.63 Of note, a study in Western Australia (WA) showed that the proportion of students that received HPV vaccine through SBIP declined as the school year progressed. Only 0.9% of consented HPV vaccines scheduled in term 1 were not delivered compared with 3.4% in term 2 and 11.5% in term 4.66 Strategies to impro ve HPV vaccination coverage in adolescents A recent mixed methods study in W A suggested some key enablers to improve school -based HPV vaccination uptake: educating parents and students on HPV vaccination, promoting and providing relevant information online, sending reminders to return consent forms and providing education about immunisation and HPV vaccination to students in class.61,67 This was explored in a randomised- controlled trial (RCT) of a complex educational intervention in 40 schools across S A and WA in 2012- 2014.68 In this RCT, educational materials provided around the time of consent form distribution and again when dose 1 was given resulted in significantly improved knowledge and understanding of HPV and HPV vaccination, leading to favourable at titudes towards vaccination.68 NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 37 of 262 Another intervention to improve school -based HPV vaccination tested in an RCT in 31 schools in Victoria (VIC) in 2016 was sending SMS reminders to parents who had already consented to HPV vaccination (3 doses of 4vHPV vaccine) for their children, ahead of the third school visit of the immunisation providers.69 The SMS reminders sent 2 working days before immunisation providers visited school were either 'self -regulatory' (a regular SMS reminder) or 'motivating' in tone. Vaccin ation rates for this school visit (for any dose of the vaccine) were significantly higher in the groups that received the self -regulatory (89.0%) and motivational (88.4%) SMS texts than in the group that received none (85.7%). The SMS reminder effectivenes s between the two intervention groups was maintained during catch- up vaccinations.69 Another study showed that letters (history statements) from the HPV Register to immunisation providers and individuals overdue for vaccination improved coverage.70 HPV vaccination coverage in men who have sex with men HPV vaccination uptake was assessed in a cohort of men who have sex with men (MSM) who were offered the vaccine at their first presentation to the Melbourne Sexual Health Centre (MSHC) in 2017, when a state -funded 4vHPV catch- up campaign was undertaken targeting MSM aged 26 years.71 The study excluded those who would have been age -eligible for HPV vaccination through the school -based program, of whom only 26.7% self -reported receiving the vaccine.71 Of the remaining cohort, 73.2% who were offered HPV vaccine at first presentation received it on that day. 71 The reasons stated by study participants for declining HPV vaccine were 'wanting time to think', 'being 15.1% of those who initially declined did receive the vaccine within 3 months.71 Factors significantly associated with receiving the vaccine in this cohort included age 20-26 years com pared with 16-19 years, a history of genital warts and >4 male partners in the last 12 months.71 Perceptions of HPV vaccination assessed using social media postings Two studies have used Twitter to assess perceptions around HPV vaccine in Australia.72, 73 In one study, tweets from Australia, the UK and Canada showed that the proportions that expressed HPV vaccine concerns were 19.3%, 22.6% and 14.9%, respectively. 72 The most common concern across all three countries was related to perceived barriers to vac cination, which included both logistic al and psychological barriers, such as perceived harms of the vaccine.72 This study also showed that Twitter users who expressed concerns disproportionately connected with Twitter users in other countries who also post ed similar tweets on HPV vaccines.72 The second study found an association between HPV -related tweets and HPV vaccine coverage in different regions in Australia.73 This study showed that a higher proportion of Twitter users in low HPV coverage regions had exposure to information critical of vaccination.73 NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 38 of 262 Table 2.

Canfell, K et al. 17 Vaccine , 2015 NSW Postal questionnaire sent to controls in Cervical Health Study following recent normal Pap smear 1,139 females who had been eligible for catch -up vaccination Factors significantly associated with having received 1 HPV vaccine dose were being never married, nulliparous, Australian- born, residing in outer regional, remote or very remote areas, having hi story of sexually transmitted infection, current hormonal contraception use and being a current alcohol drinker. Factors significantly associated with decreased likelihood of receiving HPV vaccine were decreasing socioeconomic status of place of residence and higher number of sexual partners. No significant associations were found between HPV vaccine uptake and educational attainment, number of previous Pap smears or abnormal cytology tests. Gunasekaran B, et al.18 Vaccine , 2015 VIC Recruitment for web- based questionnaire via Facebook advertising 278 females aged 16- 25 years Predictors of self -reported 3- dose coverage were being Australian- born and having high HPV and HPV vaccine knowledge. Predictors of high HPV vaccine knowledge were being Australian- born and having awareness of Chlamydia. The most common reasons for receiving HPV vaccine were protection against HPV infection and cervical cancer, because it was free, and 'join the fight against cervical cancer'. The most common reasons for not receiving HPV vaccine were uncertainty of eligibility, concern about a bad reaction and perceiving it was not needed as in a monogamous relationship. McGrath L, et al. 19 Sexually transmitted Infections , 2019 Melbourne Sexual Health Centre Retrospective chart review of HPV vaccine uptake among eligible MSM in 2017 2108 MSM aged 16-26 years 58.2% of all eligible MSM were offered HPV vaccine by clinicians at first consult, increasing from 25% in April 2017 to 79% in December 2017. 73.2% of those offered HPV vaccine received it on the same day. The most commonly documented reasons for declining HPV vaccine included wanting time to think, being unsure of immunisation records, travelling, time constraints and issues with needles. 15.1% of MSM who initially declined received the vaccine within 3 months. NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 40 of 262 Factors significantly associated with HPV vaccine uptake were age 20 -26 years compared to age 16- 19 years, history of genital warts and >4 male partners in last 12 months Overall coverage was 42.6% during first consult and 50.4% after 3 months follow -up. Nickel B, et al.20 Preventive Medicine Reports , 2017 Australia, UK, USA Online survey of female and male parents with daughters aged 9- 17 years Total=179 parents Australia n=53, UK n=59, USA n=67 Parents' HPV knowledge had the strongest association with daughter's vaccination status, followed by HPV vaccine specific knowledge. Parents with both low and high HPV and HPV vaccine specific knowledge scores were less likely to have vaccinated their daughters. Parents from the USA and male parents in all three countries were less likely to vaccinate their daughters. Australian parents were significantly less likely to worry a bout vaccine side effects (15.4%) compared to parents in the USA (60.5%) and UK (36.4%) Staples, et al.21 Sexual Health, 2016 Hunter New England Local Health District Postal survey sent to parents of adolescent females incompletely vaccinated in 2010 207 responses from parents or carers The most common reasons for non- completion of HPV vaccination were being unaware catch- up doses were available from GP, unaware of the need for a third dose and their daughter not wanting further doses. Tung IL, et al.22 PLoS One , 2016 VIC Supplementar y postal survey sent to participants in VACCINE study 23 417 females who had been eligible for catch -up vaccination HPV vaccination was signific antly associated with being Australian- born, having completed childhood vaccinations and parents being the main decision- makers for participants' HPV vaccination. Vaccinated women were significantly more likely to be non- smokers, have private health- insurance and use contraception. There was no significant difference between vaccinated and unvaccinated women for age at first sex, lifetime sexual partners or having had a pap smear in the last 2 years. The most common reasons for non- vaccination included pare ntal concern about vaccine safety, perception of daughter as low HPV risk, needle phobia and practical barriers e.g. absenteeism, lack of consent form. 61% of unvaccinated participants reported a GP recommendation would encourage them to receive HPV vaccine. NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 41 of 262 Vaccine safety Annual national vaccine safety reports for the years 2012- 2017 were within the time period of this review. The number of HPV vaccine- related adverse events notified to the Therapeutic Good Administration ( TGA) increased from 155 in 2012 75 to 786 in 2013.76 The large increase in 2013 was due to the extension of the HPV vaccination program to males and the introduction of enhanced school -based surveillance of adverse events of special interest. The total number of HPV vaccine- related adverse events reported annually declined in each subsequent year: 571 in 2014,77 374 in 2015,78 396 in 201679 and 299 in 2017.80 In 2015 the TGA published results of the enhanced surveillance that occurred in 2013 during the implementation of the male HPV vaccination program.81 This enhanced surveillance, undertaken in addition to the routine monitoring, focussed on anaphylaxis, generalised allergic reaction, loss of consciousness and emergency department presentation or hospitalisation. The enhanced surveillance did not identif y any particular safety signals. Overall the types and rates of AEFI reported were consistent with the information in the 4vHPV vaccine product information. 81 The rate of AEFI captured in enhanced surveillance was higher in females (122 per 100,000 for fe males aged 12- 13 years) than males , and among males it was higher in younger adolescents (101 per 100,000 for males aged 12- 13 years and 44 per 100,000 for males aged 14- 15 years).81 Syncope was the most common adverse event in all three groups (overall rate 37 per 100,000 vaccine doses) and accounted for 25.9% of the total number of AEFI reported. However , injury due to syncope was uncommon and only one case required hospital attendance. 81 There was one episode of anaphylaxis (rate of 0.12 per 100,000 vacc ine doses). The rate of generalised allergic reaction was 7.1 per 100,000 vaccine doses.81 Before the expansion of the HPV vaccination program to include males, background annual incidence rates of neurological and allergic events in adolescent boys in V IC, based on hospital emergency department and discharge data, were 252.9 and 175.2 per 100,000 person- years, respectively. 82 On the basis of the background rate of these events, it was estimated that there would be 2.4 cases of Guillain- Barre syndrome expected within 6 weeks of HPV vaccination in boys, and an expected 3.9 seizures and 0.3 cases of anaphylaxis and 6.5 of acute allergy within 1 day of vaccination.82 This highlights the possibility of coincidental events erroneously being attributed to vaccination and the need for thorough causality assessment. In VIC, SAEFVIC (Surveillance of Adverse Events Following Vaccination in the Community), an enhanced state- based passive surveillance system, is integrated with clinical services to monitor AEFI and has been operating since 2007. From 2007 to 2013, three cases (0.32 per 100,000 doses) of anaphylaxis following 4vHPV vaccine were reported to SAEFVIC.83 Two cases involved an urticarial skin reaction after dose 1 followed by anaphylaxis after dose 2, and no information was provided NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 42 of 262 about the third case.84 SAEFVIC became a founding member of AEFI -CAN (Adverse Events Following Immunisation: Clinical Assessment Network), a national network linking all state/territory vaccine safety clinics, in 2013. From January 2013 to June 2014, AEFI -CAN assessed 118 HPV vaccine- related AEFI reports.85 Most these AEFI occurred after HPV vaccine dose 1 (59%), followed by dose 2 (34%) and dose 3 (7%). All of these adverse events were following 4vHPV vaccine except for one that occurred after 2vHPV vaccine.85 The reported AEFI included rash (24%), allergy 85 Of these 114 vaccinees, 76 underwent clinical review and 31 (41%) received further doses of HPV vaccine after which three experienced a rash. 85 In a multi -centre trial in Australia that assessed the safety and immunogenicity of 4vHPV vaccine in immunocompromised children (n=59, mean age 12.3 years, range 5-18 years), local adverse events were more common than systemic adverse events and both declined in frequency following subsequent doses. 86 The proportion of vaccinee s who reported adverse events following doses 1, 2 and 3 , respectively , were 28.0%, 18.2% and 15.4% for local reactions and 15.8%, 12.7% and 5.8% for systemic reactions. 86 Although no clinically significant adverse events related to HPV vaccine were reported, disease flared in two trial participants (3.5%) a fter dose 1.86 HPV antibody titres after three doses were significantly higher than baseline titres and considered satisfactory in participants, but were lower, particularly in females, than in healthy controls in other studies. 86 Among 37 of the participants followed up for 5 years after vaccination, antibody titres remained well above those associated with natural infection, with no serious adverse events reported. 87 The effect of prior exercise on HPV vaccine- related adverse events such as pain, anxiety and fear was assessed in an RCT among 116 female and male students who received three doses of 4vHPV vaccine in a SBIP in Sydney. The intervention (exercise) group underwent 15 minutes of upper body exercise before vaccination and the control group receiv ed the vaccine as per usual procedures.88,89 In the control group, the number of students who reported pain and anxiety associated with HPV vaccination was significantly higher in females than in males. However , this difference was not seen in the intervention group, suggesting that exercise before vaccination reduced the negative experience for females more than for males.89 After vaccination, females in both control and exercise groups reported significantly more days of pain, tenderness, swelling and feeling ill than males in respective groups. However, among females those in the exercise group reported significantly fewer days of pain, tenderness, feeling ill and appetite loss than those in the control group. This suggests that exercise may mitigate the experience of minor adverse events following HPV vaccination in adolescent females. 88 AusVaxSafety began actively monitoring adverse events following HPV vaccination in adolescents in 2018 concurrent with the changeover from 4vHPV to 9vHPV on the NIP. AusVaxSafety surveillance data to date, from over 41,000 parent or carer NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 43 of 262 responses, show that in 91.2% of the cases the child did not experience any adverse events following 9vHPV vaccination.90 Among those who did report adverse events, the most common experi ences were injection site reactions (pain, swelling or redness), tiredness, headache and fever, all of which were self -limiting.90 Only 0.6% reported taking their child to a doctor or emergency department in the days after vaccination.90 There are two systematic reviews of HPV vaccine safety by Australian authors: the first in 2013 on 2vHPV and 4vHPV vaccines91 and the other in 2017 that included 9vHPV vaccine as well as safety in special populations.92 These comprehensive reviews covered relevant inter national evidence extensively and reinforced the excellent safety profile of all HPV vaccines. Vaccine impact on HPV -associated diseases HPV causes the third highest burden of all vaccine- preventable diseases in Australia, with the highest burden in people aged 15- 39 years and 77% of the burden attributed to mortality due to cervical cancer.93 The significant decline in HPV - associated disease burden from 48.2 Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) per 100,000 population in 2005 to 15.8 DALY per 100,000 population in 201593 likely reflects the combined impact of the cervical cancer screening program and the National HPV V accination Program. In Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, the decline in HPV -associated disease during the same time period was from 263 DALY per 100,000 population to 81 DALY per 100,000 population. Despite these gains, HPV still causes the largest burden of all vaccine- preventable diseases in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.93 Numerous studies show the significant declines in HPV prevalence and several specific HPV -associated disease outcomes in Australia following the introduction of the National HPV V accination Program.10 Table 3 summarises the studies that have been published since 2013 (i.e. excluding those refer enced in the previous evaluation report9). Because of a long lead time from HPV infection to the development of cancer, the true magnitude of the impact of vaccination against HPV, including various cancer outcomes, will become more clearly visible with ti me. Complementing the gains thus far, the transition from 4vHPV vaccine to 9vHPV vaccine in Australia in 2018 has been predicted to prevent a further 15% of cervical cancers and 11% of anal cancers. On the basis of genotype data from the USA, the 9vHPV va ccine could reduce HPV -associated vaginal, vulval and cancers by approximately a further 18%, 14% and 9%, respectively, in the USA. Overall the 9vHPV vaccine is expected to prevent almost 90% of cervical cancers and up to 96% of anal cancers in Aust ralia.10 NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 44 of 262 Vaccin e impact on prevalence of HPV infection HPV p revalence in females A study found there was a significant reduction in the prevalence of HPV genotypes covered by the 4vHPV vaccine in women aged 25 years attending MSHC with chlamydia infection in the first 3 years of the N ational HPV V accination Program.94 The reduction was the highest in Australian- born women aged 21 years, with no cases of HPV types 6/11 observed in this group from 2008- 2009 to the end of the study in mid- 2014.94 A significant reduction in 4vHPV genotypes was also observed in unvaccinated Australian- born women, indicating a herd protection effect.94 The prevalence of 4vHPV genotypes in 1,058 females aged 18- 24 years attending family planning clinics in Sydney, Perth and Melbourne for routine cervical screening in 2010- 2012 was significantly lower than tha t in females recruited in the same way in 2005- 2007 (pre- vaccine introduction) in both vaccinated females (prevalence ratio 0.07, 95% CI: 0.04- 0.14) and unvaccinated females (prevalence ratio 0.65, 95% CI: 0.43- 0.96), further supporting both direct and her d impacts of the vaccine.50 The adjusted vaccine effectiveness for 4vHPV .0001) for fully vaccinated women compared with unvaccinated women in the post -vaccine period against HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18, and 58% (95% CI : 26- 76; p=0. 003) against HPV types 31, 33 and 45.50 Similarly HPV prevalence was assessed in females attending family planning clinics in urban V IC and NSW for routine cervical screening in 2015 compared with that in the pre- vaccine period (2 005- 2007). 95 This study found a 92% decline in the prevalence of 4vHPV vaccine genotypes in females aged 18- 35 years (from 15.3% to 1.3%).95 In the subset of women aged 25- 35 years, in whom the verified uptake of 4vHPV vaccine was only 40%, prevalence decl ined from 11.8% to 1.1%.95 The prevalence of 4vHPV genotypes was also significantly lower in partially vaccinated and unvaccinated females in 2015 than in the pre -vaccine period, suggesting herd protection as well as the effectiveness of even partially com pleted vaccination courses.95 The Vaccine Against Cervical Cancer Impact and Effectiveness (VACCINE) study validated self -reported HPV vaccination status and assessed the prevalence of 4vHPV vaccine genotypes in Victorian females aged 18- 25 years recruited using Facebook from 2011 to 2015,52 with interim results available for 2011- 2013.51 At the study conclusion, from 737 self -collected vaginal swabs the prevalence of any HPV genotype high -risk genotypes 13.8% All 13 females positive for 4vHPV genotypes were either unvaccinated or fully vaccinated but after sexual debut.52 As a result of the transition to HPV -based screening in December 2017, the national cervical screening program provides a new tool to monitor HPV prevalence in NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 45 of 262 Australia.96 Before this transition, in 2005- 2008 the HPV prevalence in 2,620 females aged 18- 60 years participating in cervical screening was 26.4% for all high- risk HPV genotypes and 10.8% for genotypes HPV genotypes 16/18 in 3,729 women aged 30- 64 years was 23.5% in women with normal cervical cytology and 43.8% in women with confirmed cervical HGA .98 A retrospective cross -sectional review of 195,606 specimens submitted for HPV testing from 1 December 2017 to 31 May 2018 found that oncogenic HPV genotypes were detected in 8.1% of recommended scr eening age with positive oncogenic HPV screening test results also had a cytologic al abnormality.99 Also the proportion of HPV types 16/18 - positive with HGA - was 15.3% (95% CI: 14.2- 16.6); the proportion of samples positive HP V types was 6.3% (95% CI: 5.8- 6.8).99 Consistent with the above estimates, in 116,052 samples in V IC during the first 7 months of the renewed national cervical screening program the prevalence of any oncogenic HPV types was 9.3%, and for HPV The prevalence of non- HPV 16/18 oncogenic types in females peaked at age 25- 29 years and then declined rapidly across older age groups. The prevalence of HPV types 16/18 was highest in females aged 35- 44 years but low and stable across all ages.96 HPV prevalence in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander females A significant decline in HPV prevalence has also been demonstrated separately in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander females in the Vaccine Impact in the Population- Indigenous (VIP -I) study .100 The post -vaccine period sample in this study included 142 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander females aged 18- 26 years attending health services in Central Australia, North QLD and rural NSW for routine cervical screening in 2014- 2015.100 Compared w ith the pre- vaccine period cohort recruited at the same sites in 2007, prevalence of all HPV genotypes in 2014- 2015 declined from 58.1% to 36.2% of 4vHPV vaccine genotypes from 23.9% to 1.4% ( two cases of HPV type 16, no case of HPV types 6/11/18) .100 HPV prevalence in males Significant declines in HPV prevalence have also been demonstrated in Australian males, initially due to herd protection from the female- only program and later from direct protection following the extension of the program to i nclude males. In national serosurveillance studies, the seroprevalence of 4vHPV vaccine genotypes in males aged 15- 39 years in 2012- 2013 was substantially lower than that in 2005, indicating herd impact from the female program.101 However , in 2012- 2013 over 9% of males NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 46 of 262 were still seropositive for at least one 4vHPV vaccine genotype by age 20 years, suggesting a potential additional role of male vaccination in direct protection.101 The prevalence of penile infection with 4vHPV vaccine genotypes in sexually active heterosexual males aged 17- 19 years in Australia was relatively low even before the commencement of male HPV vaccination, likely due to herd protection from the female- only program. This prevalence, which was 2.6% in 152 males sampled in 2014- 2015, declined to 0.7% among 142 males sampled in 2016- 2017, suggesting incremental direct benefit from the male vaccination program. In the 2016 -2017 cohort, of whom 55.5% had received 1 dose of HPV vaccine, only one case of infection with a 4vHPV genotype was detected (HPV type 6 in an unvaccinated male). 102 There was a decline in 4vHPV genotype prevalence in urine and urethral samples from unvaccinated heterosexual men aged 25 years attending MSHC with chlamydia infection over the period 2004- 2015, suggesting ongoing herd protection impact of the female program.103 From 2004- 2005 to 2014- 2015, the prevalence of 4vHPV genotypes significantly declined from 22.4% to 5.7%, while non- vaccine genotypes significantly increased.103 In Australian- born males aged 21 years, the reduction in 4vHPV genotypes was particularly impressive, from 30.8% in 2004- 2005 to 0% in 2014- 2015 with no HPV type 16/18 detected after 2011- 2012.103 As a further indication of herd protection effects in males, penile swabs collected in 2014- 2016 from unvaccinated sexually active heterosexual males across Australia showed the prevalence of 4vHPV genotypes was significantly lower in males aged 16-25 years than in those aged 25- 35 years, whose female partners were less likely to have been vaccinat ed. 104 The prevalence of oncogenic non- vaccine HPV genotypes was not significantly different between the two groups.104 Unlike in heterosexual men, no statistically significant herd protection effect from the female HPV vaccination program has been docum ented in MSM. MSM aged 26 years who presented for the state -funded catch- up 4vHPV vaccine in Victoria in 2017 had a prevalence of high -risk anal HPV infection of 56.5%, 105 consistent with the knowledge that MSM are at higher risk of HPV infection and related diseases . In addition, 43.1% of these unvaccinated MSM had at least one anal 4vHPV genotype detected and 53.4% had at least one 9vHPV vaccine genotype detected.105 In an older MSM population in Sydney (aged 35 years, median 49 years), the baseline prevalence (in 2010) of anal HPV genotype 16 infection was 29.4%, and 64.7% of the cohort had at least one anal 9vHPV genotype detected by study end (2018). 106 Vaccine impact on cervical abnormalities A steady decline in cervical HGA in females aged <20 year s started soon after the National HPV V accination Program commenced.107 In females aged 20- 24 years, a notable decline began in 2011 which led to the peak age for detection of HGA shifting NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 47 of 262 from 20 -24 years to 25- 29 years.107 With vaccinated cohorts moving up into older age groups, declines in cervical HGA have also been seen since 2014 in women aged 25- 29 years and 30- 34 years.107 The overall rate of HGA in screened women of all ages has declined from >8 per 1,000 women screened in 2007 to 7.1 per 1,000 women screened in 2017, while the incidence of cervical cancer in Australia has been stable at around 7 new cases per 100,000 women of all ages since 2002. 107 The incidence of cervical cancer is expected to increase transiently following the introduction of HPV -based screening because of earlier detection of prevalent cases, as HPV testing is highly sensitive, but should significantly decline thereafter due to the combination of HPV vaccination and screening. Significant reduct ions in HGA108-111 and evidence of vaccine effectiveness against cervical abnormalities in women less likely to have been sexually active before vaccination 111 were also demonstrated in other literature published before the time period of this review. The impact of HPV vaccination was also seen in excisional treatments for cervical dysplasia, which were significantly lower in women aged <35 years across Australia in the post -vaccine period (2008- 2013) than in the pre - vaccine period (2004- 2007), while the rate remained unchanged in females aged 35 years.109 Cervical abnormalities in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander females National cervical screening program outcomes cannot be reported accurately by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status as that information was not captured on all pathology forms. Linkage of cervical screening and hospitalisation data enabled more complete identification of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander females. Linked data showed that among women screened in Queensland in 2010- 2011, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women had significantly higher prevalence of cytological low- and high- grade abnormalities and histologically confirmed HGA than non- Indigenous women. 112 The incidence of cervical cancer in Aboriginal and T orres Strait Islander women is more than double the rate in non- Indigenous women of the same age, with an age -standardised rate in 2011 -2015 of 22.3 per 100,000 (based on data from five jurisdictions).107 Other data linkage studies A key data linkage study (linking the HPV register and state and territory cervical cancer screening registers) showed that between 2007 and 2014 fully vaccinated women had a lower incidence of HGA (8.5 per 100,000) than unvaccinated women of the same age (13.2 per 100,000) rega rdless of jurisdiction and remoteness/socioeconomic status area- based indices.113 Those vaccinated before the age of 14 years had the lowest rate of HGA , followed by girls vaccinated at age 14-15 years and then age 16 years.113 The rate of HGA was 26.4 per 100,000 in females screened before the introduction of HPV vaccination, significantly higher NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 48 of 262 than in unvaccinated females screened in the post -vaccination period, indicating a herd protection effect.113 In this study cervical screening participation in 2013- 2014 was higher in vaccinated females than in unvaccinated (45.5% versus 33.1% for females aged 20- 24 years and 56.5% versus 44.3% for females aged 25- 29 years).113 Importantly, this finding of higher rates of cervical screening participation in vaccinated women was in contrast to earlier studies.114 This is likely due to markedly improved ascertainment of vaccination status among screened women as a result of updating of demographic details prior to data linkage.113 Results from a study using linked data across Victorian cervical cytology and national HPV vaccination registries support the greater benefits of HPV vaccination when administered before sexual debut. In this study of females who were eligible for HPV vaccination in 2007, and who had recor ds of cervical screening in 2007- 2011, there was significant effectiveness of HPV vaccine against high- or low -grade cervical abnormalities, even among partially vaccinated women, if all doses were received before the initial screening (which was used as a proxy for sexual debut). When the timing of vaccination in relation to initial screening was disregarded, there was significant effectiveness only for those fully vaccinated with 3 doses. 53 The effectiveness of less than three doses of HPV vaccine on cer vical abnormalities has been assessed using data linkage in Q LD. In females attending their first cervical screening in Q LD between 2007 and 2011, three doses were 46% effective against HGA and 34% against other abnormalities.115 The effectiveness of two or more doses was 21% against both high -grade and other cervical abnormalities. The effectiveness of a single dose was not statistically significant. The adjusted vaccine effectiveness of one or more doses was 26% (95% CI: 25) against other cervical abnormalities.115 Linkage of national cervical screening and HPV vaccination data for females who were aged 15 years when first eligible for vaccination during 2007 -2014 showed that receiving one , two or three HPV vaccine doses had similar effectiveness against histologically confirmed cervical HGA (adjusted hazard ratio for 1 dose 0.65 [0.52- 0.81], 2 doses 0.61 [0.52 -0.72] and 3 doses 0.59 [0.54- 0.65]). 54 Cervical cancer From 2007 to 2012, 101 cases of cervical cancer were diagnosed in females fully vaccinated with HPV vaccine in Australia. Among the se, 99 were in females who are likely to have been exposed to HPV before vaccination, based on their age, dates of vaccination and initial cervical screening. The rem aining two cases were cervical cancers not associated with HPV. 113 Declines in cervical cancer following HPV vaccination programs have not yet been demonstrated because of the long natural history of HPV -related cancers. NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 49 of 262 It is also important to assess the potential impact of the program on cervical cancers by monitoring the HPV genotypes found in cervical cancers. A large study that included 847 cervical cancers diagnosed from 2005 to 2015 in NSW, V IC and QLD found that they more frequently contained HPV types 16/18 than in overseas studies.116 Of the 847 cancers, 92.9% had HPV detected. Of the HPV -positive cancers, 607 of 787 (77.1%) contained HPV type 16 or 18, 125 (15.9%) contained HPV type 31/33/45/52 or 58, and 55 (7.0%) another HPV genotype.116 This hi gh preponderance of HPV type 16/18 could be due to the high levels of cervical screening in Australia, reducing the incidence of squamous cancers and resulting in a higher proportion of adenocarcinomas, in which types 18 and 16 more strongly predominate.116 Ongoing cancer genotyping is recommended to monitor the impact of the HPV vaccination program on cervical cancers. Several modelling studies have estimated potential time- frames until expected declines in cervical cancer are evident in Australia. It has been estimated that from 2017 to 2035 there will be a decline in the rate of cervical HGA by 40% (range 40- 44%) and invasive cervical cancer by 51% (range 42- 51%).117 Modelling further predicts that the incidence rate of invasive cervical cancer in Austr alia will decline to <4 new cases per 100,000 women by 2028 (range 2021- 2035), which would be considered the elimination of cervical cancer as a public health problem. 8 However , this study acknowledges that this model may not be directly applicable to all population subgroups, such as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and migrants, who may have lower HPV vaccination coverage and screening participation rates, and that it will therefore take longer to achieve cervical cancer elimination in such groups unless these disparities are addressed.8 Modelling has also predicted large declines in the incidence of cervical adenocarcinoma in Australia as a result of HPV vaccination combined with primary HPV screening, with 55- 81% decline estimated by 2040.118 This is particularly significant , given cervical cytology -based screening has resulted in a limited decline.119 Genital warts Genital Warts Surveillance Network The Genital Warts Surveillance Network comprises 54 sentinel sexual health clinic sites across Australia that have been used to assess the proportion of genital warts diagnoses in new patients over time. Data from the network show a steady decline from 2007 to 2017 in genital warts diagnoses in young Australian- born populations in both urban and non -urban areas.120-122 In the non -Indigenous population, the most recent surveillance data available, for 2017, showed a 96% decline in the proportion of attendees with a genital warts diagnosis in females aged <21 years since 2007 (from 11.0% to 0.5%) and an 87% decline in females aged 21- 30 years (from 10.7% NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 50 of 262 to 1.4%). These declines were seen early and quickly due to the relatively short incubation period from infection to warts becoming apparent. However, the proportion of females aged >30 years with geni tal warts has been fluctuating.122 There was also a concomitant decline in genital warts diagnoses in non- Indigenous heterosexual males of 88% (from 9.3% to 1.1%) those aged <21 years and 76% (16.6% to 3.9%) in those aged 21- 30 years.122 Among heterosex ual males aged >30 years, a downward trend since 2010 has led to a 53% decline in genital warts diagnoses.122 These declines were also seen in non- Indigenous MSM between 2007 and 2017 - a 72% decline in gay males (from 11.2% to 3.1%) and 51% decline in bis exual males (from 5.5% to 2.7%), but these declines are believed to reflect changes in the population attending the clinics over time, with more asymptomatic males attending in recent years and thus inflating the denominator.122 Large declines in genital w arts diagnoses in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people aged <30 years have also been reported.120-122 As of 2017, the declines in genital warts diagnoses in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander females were greater than in non -Indigenous females, with a 100% decrease from 2007 to 2017 in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander females aged <21 years (from 4.4% to 0%) and 21-29 years (from 5.1% to 0%), with no cases diagnosed in either age group from 2016.123 From 2007 to 2017, there were large declines in the proportion of heterosexual Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander males with genital warts among sexual health clinics attendees, with an 82% dec line in those aged <21 years (from 6.0% to 1.1%) and a 62% dec line in those aged 21- 29 years (from 10. 2% to 2.1%).123 From 2007 to 2015, there was a decline in the proportion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander MSM with a genital warts diagnos is, from 6.8% to 2.6%.121 Genital warts hospitalisations Genital warts hospitalisations, representing more sev ere cases, have also declined markedly since the HPV vaccination program commenced. The proportional declines in genital warts hospitalisation rates between 2006- 2007 and 2010- 2011 in females aged 12- 17 years, 18- 26 years and 27- 30 years 54.6), respectively. There was no significant change in genital warts hospitalisation rates in females aged >30 years. 124 There were also declines in genital warts hospitalisation rates in mal es over the same time period: (95% 0.8- 37.4) in those aged 27- 30 years. There was no significant change in males aged >30 years.124 The decline in genital warts hospitalisations in males aged 18 -26 years was statistically significant only for non- anal sites, which likely represents herd protection from the female HPV vaccination program.124 In Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander females aged 15- 24 years , there was an 86.7% (95% CI: 71.6- 79.9) decline in the genital warts hospitalisation rate in the same time period. This was greater than the 76.1% decline (95% CI: 76.0 -92.7) in NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 51 of 262 non-Indigenous females of the same age. However, sufficient data were not available to assess changes in genital w arts hospitalisation rates in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander males.124 Additional analyses showed that the declines in genital warts hospitalisation rates in females aged 10- 19 years and 20- 29 years observed between 2006- 2007 and 2010- 2011 were equi tably distributed across socio- economic groups, both within and outside major cities.125 Similarly, the declines in genital warts hospitalisation rates in males aged 20- 29 years that were limited to non- anal sites were also equitably distributed.125 Assessment of vaccine impact on genital warts using other data sources Consistent with the overall findings from the National Genital Warts Surveillance Network data, to which MSHC contributes data, there were significant declines in the proportion of new patients diagnosed with genital warts at MSHC. Among Australian- born females aged <21 years who attended MSHC, the proportion with genital warts declined from 18.4% in 2004- 2005 to 1.1% in 2013- 2014.126 In those aged 21- 32 years, who were vaccine- eligible but possibly sexually active before vaccination, there was a smaller but significant decline, from 12.4% to 2.5%.The proportion of genital warts diagnoses in new female patients aged >32 years, who were ineligible for HPV vaccination, increased from 4.0% to 8. 5% over this time period. 126 There is also evidence of a marked impact of HPV vaccination on genital warts incidence from GP encounter data. The management rates of genital warts in a nationally representative set of general practices that formed the Bettering Evaluation and Care of Health (BEACH) program decreased by 61% in vaccine- eligible females from pre -vaccine period (2002- 2006) to post -vaccine period (2008- 2012) (4.33 per 1,000 encounters to 1.67 per 1,000 encounters). No change was observed in older females.127 A mobile telephone survey in 2011 among randomly selected Australian females aged 18- 39 years also showed a 41% decrease in self -reported genital warts diagnoses in vaccine- eligible females and a 64% increase in vaccine- ineligible femal es compared with corresponding estimates from a similar survey in 2001.128 This survey also found that 63.3% of females reporting a genital warts diagnosis were treated by a GP, 15.2% in hospital and 12.7% at a sexual health clinic.128 As additional evidence of herd protection, the proportion of Australian- born heterosexual males presenting to MSHC and diagnosed with genital warts declined from 17.3% in 2004- 2005 to 7.6% in 2013- 2014. The largest declines were in those aged <21 years (from 11.3% to 2.8%) and 21- 32 years (from 19.1% to 5.9%), with lower decline (from 15.7% to 11.4%) in males aged >32 years.126 A lower but significant decline (from 7.8% to 5.2%) in genital warts diagnoses was also observed NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 52 of 262 in MSM over the duration of this study period, but this is also attributed to greater attendance by asymptomatic MSM.126 Another study from MSHC showed that the odds ratio of having penile warts in heterosexual males was significantly lower in males with an Australian- born female partner aged 32 years than in males with partners aged >32 years who had not been eligible for HPV vaccination (OR 0.52, 95% CI: 0.28- 0.99).129 Genital warts modelling studies Modelling has shown that the strong herd protection effects of female HPV vaccination and rapid reductions in genital warts were achieved in Australia. These sustained changes are attributable to the vaccination of multiple cohorts during the national time -limited catch -up HPV vaccination program in addition to the high coverage achieved in the routine vaccinat ion program.130 Modelling studies predict that the male HPV vaccination introduced in 2013 will have a substantial incremental impact on genital warts incidence, compared with female vaccination alone, and will result in near elimination of genital warts i n the Australian heterosexual population. 131 This model did not account for the MSM population though, or the impacts of immigration and travel on genital warts in Australia - factors that are acknowledged as potential barriers to actually achieving genital warts elimination.131 Vaccine impact on juvenile -onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis A new finding on the impact of the N ational HPV Vaccination Program in Australia since the previous evaluation is a significant reduction in juvenile- onset recur rent respiratory papillomatosis (JoRRP). JoRRP is a rare, but serious, medical condition with significant morbidity and mortality, resulting from vertical transmission of HPV infection before or during birth, particularly genotypes 6 or 11 which are the most common cause of genital warts. From 2000 to 2009, 30 cases of JoRRP were identified in NSW tertiary paediatric hospitals translating/extrapolating to a national prevalence of 0.81 per 100,000 children aged <15 years from 2000 to 2013.132 Active sentinel surveillance established by the Australian Paediatric Surveillance Unit to monitor JoRRP in Australia (via participating paediatric otorhinolaryngologists treating JoRRP in each state and territory) captured 15 new cases in children aged <15 years from 2011 to 2016. Of these, seven were genotyped and all were positive for HPV type 6 or 11. Over this period the annual count of cases declined with a statistically significant reduction in incidence from 0.16 per 100,000 in 2012 to 0.02 per 100,000 in 2016 (r efer to Table 3).133 This decline incidence suggests a reduction in mother -to-child HPV transmission as a result of a reduced prevalence of genital infection with HPV types 6 and 11 in young women, which, in turn, is a result of HPV NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 53 of 262 vaccination. This decline in JoRRP incidence was the first such documented decline following the implementation of a 4vHPV vaccination program.133 In 2017, there were only three notifications of JoRRP, one of which was a duplicate report.134 Both cases were classified as pr obable, with a case of non- laryngeal papillomatosis.134 There were no cases of JoRRP in 2018.134 NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 54 of 262 Table 3.

NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 57 of 262 Summary/discussion This literature review documents extensive surveillance and research in Australia on HPV vaccination and the impact of the National HPV Vaccination Program on HPV -associated disease burden. In terms of HPV vaccination coverage, the literature shows that while vaccine coverage nationally has increased over time, disparities still exist between females and males, between jurisdictions and for course completion in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adolescents compared with non- Indigenous adolescents. Although modelling predicts Australia is on track to eliminate genital warts in heterosexual individuals overall and cervical cancer, this does not necess arily extend to high- risk groups such as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and migrants. Addressing disparities in HPV vaccination coverage would help ensure the impact of the N ational HPV V accination Program in Australia is more equitable. Reflecting this need, the current national and jurisdictional STI strategies and cancer control plans incorporate goals to continue increasing HPV vaccination coverage, particularly in higher risk individuals. Several of these strategies highlight the need for improved access to HPV vaccine for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and other high -risk populations outside of the existing school -based vaccination setting, which should be a focus of initiatives to improve coverage. More generally, many of the barriers to HPV vaccination that were identified in the literature could likely be minimised through initiatives to increase education regarding HPV vaccine safety, dosing schedule and eligibility as well as improved processes to ensure return of cons ent forms and follow up of students who are absent during vaccination visits. Ongoing reminders/notifications from AIR to ensure that the second dose is received would also benefit significantly. The HPV vaccine safety literature demonstrates a decline and stabilisation in the reporting of adverse events with time and confirms the comprehensive vaccine safety surveillance undertaken in Australia. Evidence to date regarding 9vHPV vaccine safety in Australia is consistent with pre-licensure clinical trial dat a that showed an increase in injection site reactions, but an otherwise reassuring safety profile of the vaccine. Studies that assessed vaccine impact on HPV -related conditions suggest significant effectiveness of 4vHPV vaccination. The 2018 change to 9vHP V vaccine with a 2 -dose schedule requires further monitoring, including of genotype- specific infection and disease, to document the additional impact of the vaccine's extended coverage. While many published studies of genotype- specific HPV infection in Aus tralia were located in the review, there was a notable lack of studies that monitored HPV genotype- specific disease (e.g. cervical disease or cervical cancer). Such studies are now vital to monitor the component of disease burden that is vaccine- preventabl e and to clearly document the anticipated decline in cervical cancer. The literature also indicates potential effectiveness of a single- dose HPV vaccine strategy, which would assist in overcoming barriers to course completion and reduce the cost and resour ces required for vaccine program delivery. Further data and findings of randomised trials of single- dose vaccination are awaited. NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 58 of 262 WHO will seek endorsement of its current draft global strategy towards elimination of cervical cancer as a public health problem at the next World Health Assembly in 2020, with goals and targets to be confirmed for the period 2020- 2030 in the setting of challenges arising from the COVID -19 pandemic.135 The WHO approach to cervical cancer elimination is three- pronged : 90:70:90 - 90% coverage of HPV vaccination in girls by 15 years of age; 70% coverage of cervical screening; and 90% treatment of precancerous lesions and management of invasive cancer cases. The current national HPV vaccination target in Australia is 80% adolescent HPV vaccination coverage, in the context of a universal , rather than female- only, program . NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 59 of 262 Stakeholder assessment Aim The aim of stakeholder assessment was to assess stakeholder perspectives on the impact of the National HPV V accination Program, including factors that have positively or negatively influenced program outcomes and impacts to date, or that could do so in future. Methods Semi -structured interviews and online survey A mixed -methods approach was used to collect both qualitative and quantitative data from semi -structured interviews and an online survey. Key stakeholder interviews Purposive sampling was used to recruit a broad sample of key stakeholders from across Australia for interview. Stakeholders were approached directly or referred by other participants through respondent -driven sampling. A sampling matrix (Appendix 1) was used to ensure representativeness across stakeholder groups and jurisdictions. Interviews were conducted from October 2019 to March 2020. A structured interview questionnai re was developed by staff at NCIRS and finalised following review by and feedback from members of the Advisory Committee and the Cultural Advisory Committee. The topics explored in the interviews included vaccination coverage, vaccine safety, vaccination r eporting, cervical screening disease impact, strengths and challenges of the program and recommendations, with the questionnaires tailored to be relevant for each stakeholder group (refer to Appendix 2 for an example questionnaire used for state and territ ory immunisation program managers). The questionnaire was emailed to the stakeholders before their interview to allow them to collect relevant information and to prepare responses. Interviews were recorded with the consent of the participant s and professi onally transcribed. Draft interview transcripts were sent back to each participant for review and approval, with amendments incorporated into the final interview transcript for analysis. Stakeholder online survey An anonymous online survey was developed b y staff at NCIRS using SurveyMonkey\u00ae for distribution to other stakeholders, predominantly immunisation providers. The survey was finalised following review and feedback from members of the Advisory Committee and the Cultural Advisory Committee. The online survey (refer to Appendix 3) included questions on the same topics as the telephone interview questionnaire. NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 60 of 262 The survey questions were a mix of open- and closed- ended, with most closed- ended questions either Likert -type scale questions or check -box options. The survey contained 'skip logic' so that participants could skip sections not relevant to them. The survey was open for completion from November 2019 to February 2020. Different weblinks were used for distribution to different stakeholder groups to all ow tracking of response numbers. The survey was initially distributed in collaboration with Healthed, a national provider of education services for general practitioners (GPs), primary care nurses and other healthcare professionals. Healthed offered a random prize draw incentive of 5 x $100 David Jones gift vouchers for completion of the survey, with the option to supply a mobile phone number for the purpose of contacting the randomly chosen winners. The survey was emailed to the Healthed distribution list on 12 November 2019 and three reminder emails were sent by Healthed over the following 3 weeks. The online survey was distributed to school -based immunisation providers in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), New South Wales (NSW), the Northern Territ ory (NT), Queensland (QLD), South Australia (SA), Victoria (VIC) and Western Australia (WA) through either jurisdictional immunisation program managers or other suggested means, such as school program coordinators or local council representatives. The surv ey was not distributed in Tasmania ( TAS) as qualitative research was being undertaken there concurrently under the HPV Partnership Project. Following Aboriginal ethics approvals, the survey was distributed to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander healthcare providers in NT, SA and T AS. Analysis Interviews: We did thematic analysis of comments from stakeholder groups who participated in the interviews, and selected quotes to illustrate key findings. Online survey: We did descriptive analysis of response frequencies . Results Key stakeholder interviews Participants A total of 26 semi -structured interviews involving 42 participants (some interv iews had multiple participants) were completed. A summary of participants from each stakeholder group is outlined below and summarised in Table 4 .

Jurisdictional immunisation program managers and other relevant staff A total of 17 participants from state and territory health departments cont ributed to the interviews, including all jurisdictional immunisation program managers, except NT, which lacked someone in this role at the time. In several jurisdictions other staff also participated (see below). Jurisdictional representatives who participated in an interview included: ACT - Immunisation Program Manager NSW - Immunisation Program Manager, School -based Program Coordinator NT - Immunisation Public Health Nurse, Centre for Disease Control QLD - Immunisation Program Acting Manager, Clinical N urse Consultant SA - Nursing Director and Nurse Consultant, Immunisation Section TAS - Nurse Manager and Nurse Consultant, Communicable Disease Prevention Unit VIC - Immunisation Program Manager, Immunisation Nurses x 3, Operations Officer, Administration Officer (vaccine forecasting and ordering) WA - Immunisation Program Manager Local council immunisation staff Two immunisation staff members from separate Victorian local councils were interviewed. Remote area immunisation coordinators Two remote area immunisation coordinators were interviewed, one from QLD and one from NT. Sexual health physicians One sexual health physician from NSW was interviewed. Seqirus Three Seqirus staff members participated in an interview. Seqirus distributed the HPV vaccine on behalf of Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. (the manufacturer), a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc. NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 62 of 262 Jurisdictional cervical screening program managers One jurisdictional cervical screening manager was interviewed. HPV researchers Two HPV researchers were intervi ewed. Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services A total of six semi -structured interviews were conducted with seven participants working in services primarily for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people: five from S A, one from NT and one from TAS. Two were nurse immunisers, two were chief executive offcers of health services, two were immunisation coordinators and one was a program services manager. Table 4.

Change to a 2 -dose schedule of 9vHPV vaccine Stakeholders were asked their thought s on the benefits and challenges of the change from a 3-dose schedule of 4- valent HPV (4vHPV) vaccine to 2- dose schedule of 9- valent HPV (9vHPV) vaccine for adolescents aged <15 years. Their responses are summarised below. NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 63 of 262 Australian Government Department of Health The Immunisation Branch staff perceived the benefits of the change to a 2 -dose schedule of 9vHPV vaccine as being simpler to administer within one school year and one less dose to achieve course completion, with an expectation that this change would increase completion rates. Seqirus The Seqirus staff perceived the benefits of the change as broader spectrum of protection offered by the 9vHPV vaccine and increased course completion rates. They perceived challenges to be the potential for reduced uptake bec ause of the change in dose 2 timing and a lack of information for healthcare professionals and consumers about individual -level benefits of receiving 9vHPV vaccine in those who had already received the 4vHPV vaccine, compounded by a lack of government funding for dose 3 in those aged 15 -19 years, causing confusion regarding the scheduling of doses. Jurisdictional immunisation program managers and other relevant staff Jurisdictional immunisation program managers and other relevant staff reported that the change to a 2-dose schedule was well accepted and had operational benefits, including: school staff happier due to less interruptions and demand on their time easier to schedule school visits better accepted by adolescents and parents (particularly as less needles) reduced service delivery cost to state/territory governments reduced staffing requirements reduced vaccine storage and distribution requirements less data to collect. Two jurisdictions (WA, ACT) used the space in the school immunisation progr am created by removal of an HPV vaccine dose to provide the meningococcal ACWY (MenACWY) vaccine to year 10 students. NSW transitioned to a 2- dose schedule of 4vHPV in 2017, a year before other jurisdictions, on the basis of international evidence regarding the effectiveness of the 2 -dose schedule and to allow for implementation of the NSW state -funded MenACWY program. The perceived impact of the change to a 2 -dose schedule was mentioned by 4 out of 8 jurisdictional immunisation program managers and other r elevant staff. These perceived impacts included: course completion increased but less than expected (VIC) potentially increased coverage (TAS) dose 2 coverage now equal to previous dose 3 coverage (QLD, SA) NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 64 of 262 decreased course completion (WA) no perceived impact on coverage (ACT, NT) \"We've seen benefits of reduced visits required, less demand on school time and staffing resources. It reduces service delivery costs to the State and a challenge is the course completion remains an issue.\" \"We were very exci ted when we were moving from a three- dose to a two- dose. I thought intuitively that we would see a big increase in (uptake)........... But the sad reality is we just haven't seen an improvement in uptake.\" Two jurisdictions (SA, NSW) were also concerned about declining coverage in their school -based program before the change in schedule (dose 1 and dose 2 coverage for SA; dose 2 coverage only for NSW). Other reported challenges included a reduced opportunity for school catch -up due to less school visits (2 out of 6 jurisdictions that conduct school catch- up) and increased education and support required for providers during the transition period (4 out of 8). Confusion among providers during the transition was considered largely resolved by the time of interview, with Commonwealth resources and the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation advice considered helpful. It was also acknowledged that previous challenges of the school -based vaccination program remained despite the reduction to two doses. \"All the particulars around the school vaccination program really don't change ......children's absence etc., it doesn't change.\" All jurisdictions reported a dosing interval of 6- 7 months in their school -based HPV vaccination program, with doses usually given in term 1 and 3 or term 2 and 4 (term 1 and 4 in ACT), with dose 2 delivered variably from late August to December. Challenges specific to the 6- 12-month dosing interval included: difficulty fitting both doses into the school year increased absenteeism towards the end of the year reduced likelihood of missed doses at the end of the year being caught up end of year difficult for schools with study and exam periods forgetting catch- up after 6 months due to at least 6 months interval between dose 1 and dose 2. difficulty retaining a casual nursing workforce. NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 65 of 262 \"I think one of the challenges is that six month gap, fitting it into the school calendar has been a challenge for a number of providers.\" \"The second dose being given so late, like November, December, there is basically little time to do any catch -up doses that are missed.\" Other key stakeholders The local council staff and remote area immunisation coordinators reported similar benefits and challenges of the schedule change to those reported by jurisdic tional immunisation program managers. An additional challenge of the schedule change in remote Queensland was staff resignations due to reduced hours, with casual staff required to fill the gaps. One HPV researcher noted additional benefits of the change: reduced cost to Medicare through a reduction in GP visits required for catch -up vaccination and decrease in adolescent anxiety as fewer needles needed. (Adolescents are known to experience significant anticipatory anxiety about vaccination because of their developmental stage.) Another perceived benefit was that the broader spectrum of HPV genotypes covered by the 9vHPV vaccine would potentially have a greater impact on reducing high-risk HPV infections and cervical cancer. A sexual health physician and a HPV researcher reported a benefit of the change to 9vHPV vaccine was the use of leftover 4vHPV vaccine in time -limited catch -up campaigns conducted in several jurisdictions (V IC, SA, WA and NSW) for men who have sex with men ( MSM) who had never received the vaccine at school. Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services Six stakeholders agreed that the change from three to two doses had been beneficial: fewer needles resulting in greater acceptance. One stakeholder explained that it has not been easier, but logistics are simpler. \"Yeah, so I feel it's been better, particularly kids of that age, they struggle with having vaccinations. Like a lot of them don't really understand why they've got to have them done. They just say it hurts too much. I've had ki ds say to me even, \"I'd rather get cancer than have it done,\" because they just don't really have the full concept of what's going on. \" Another nurse immuniser said it would be even better if there was only one needle: \"If you say it's just two, 'okay', and even better, if you could say it's just one that would be even better.\" However, the respondents had differing opinions on whether vaccination coverage had increased in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. \"No. Personally, no. I mean, it migh t in the long run, but we're still doing catch ups....\" NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 66 of 262 \"I think, more so, the females will uptake it very well, but it's the boys. That's still relatively new and as with contraception and stuff like that, the boys seem to think it's the girls' responsibili ty, so it's about - the girls.\" School -based HPV vaccination programs Australian Government Department of Health Factors reported by the Australian Government Department of Health staff that are positively impacting the school -based HPV vaccination program included collaboration between the Department of Health and states and territories and the use of evidence- based resources and vaccination delivery through schools. Factors negat ively impacting school -based HPV vaccination programs included consent form return issues, absenteeism (particularly in areas with a higher Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population or of lower socioeconomic status) and some parents choosing not to consent specifically for the HPV vaccine. Jurisdictional immunisation program managers and other relevant staff Factors reported by jurisdictional immunisation program managers and other relevant staff to be positively impacting their school -based HPV vaccination programs included: schools that are supportive and well engaged good relationships between schools and immunisation teams supportive school staff, for example, health- promoting school nurses (specific to NT), Aboriginal Liaison Officers following up unreturned consent forms increased education for students, for example, using Commonwealth resources Consent form return and absenteeism were the issues most commonly perceived to be negatively influencing school -based program coverage, with consent form return mentioned as a perceived negative factor in six jurisdictions (QLD, WA, TAS, ACT, VIC and NSW). Strategies to increase consent form return were variable between providers and within jurisdictions, but include active follow up of unreturned form s through phone calls, emails, letters or SMS ; posting consent forms home; and sending a 'second- chance' consent pack home. In NSW, lack of access to parent contact details until consent is returned leads to inability to follow up unreturned forms. Several jurisdictions had authorised verbal and/or faxed consent on vaccination day for students with unreturned consent forms, but this was considered time -consuming and not ideal. Projects to develop electronic consent forms are underway in two jurisdictions ( NSW, VIC), while five other jurisdictional immunisation program managers (QLD, TAS, SA, ACT, WA) also expressed interest in this as a strategy to improve consent form return. NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 67 of 262 Absenteeism, particularly later in the school year, was perceived to be negativel y influencing school -based coverage in six jurisdictions (QLD, WA, SA, NT, NSW, VIC). Other negative factors perceived by jurisdictional immunisation program managers included: complacency by parents and students (belief that not at risk/don't need vaccine) language barriers health literacy preference to go to GP parents not consenting if child does not want the vaccine student anxiety and refusal scheduling difficulties, for example, class being away on scheduled vaccination day The use of third party imm unisation providers subcontracted by some local councils to deliver school -based vaccination programs was also perceived to be negatively influencing school -based coverage in two jurisdictions (SA, VIC). \"What our experience has been is over the last few years the councils that have been doing this have disinvested in terms of their interest and their infrastructure and their management of the program. And so the performance of these providers has fallen.\" In one jurisdiction (VIC), financial pressure and budget cuts within local councils were also perceived to be negatively influencing school -based coverage, largely through reduced resources for follow up of consent forms and absent students. Of note, T AS, WA and NSW are currently participating in a HPV Pa rtnership Grant funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council . This project, being undertaken in collaboration with The Kirby Institute and other research partners, is aimed at assessing factors impacting school HPV immunisation coverage and evaluating strategies to improve coverage. Other key stakeholders One local council perceived factors that would positively influence school -based coverage included actively following up all unreturned consent forms ; vaccinating anxious students first ; and implementing a state -endorsed Mature Minor policy to allow students living independently to consent with school principal endorsement. Posting consent forms home had also been trialled but was unsuccessful due to postal delays. F actors reported by local c ouncil staff to be negatively influencing school -based coverage were consistent with those reported by other stakeholders, particularly absenteeism and scheduling difficulties with schools, with a perception that some schools do not value the immunisation program. The remote area immunisation coordinators reported factors positively influencing school -based vaccination coverage similar to those raised by jurisdictional immunisation program managers. Negative factors reported that are unique to remote areas included the highly mobile population and events such as wet season, cyclones, floods and fires that can force vaccination days to be NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 68 of 262 rescheduled. The limitations of electronic consent and digital technology in remote areas were also highlighted, with an emphasis on the need for trials before implementing this and support for providers with limited technological skills. One HPV researcher perceived that increased education for students at school before vaccination, plus strategies to mitigate anxiety (e.g. putting up privacy screens and ensuring appropriate clothing is worn) can positively influence coverage. It was also highlighted that adolescents have a right to health information under the United Nations Charter on the Rights of the Child in Adolescence. \"If they've been taught about it and they know it's a good thing to have, and the teachers can tell them to get the consent form back, and so, they're much more likely to play a positive role if they have the appropriate education. Because otherwise they' re just fearful and they have no idea of the benefits.\" Factors the HPV researcher perceived to be negatively influencing school -based coverage were consistent with those reported by other stakeholders : absenteeism, consent form return issues and parental concerns, largely around side effects but also the risks and benefits of vaccination, particularly among parents of boys. \"The parents really don't know that this vaccine prevents genital warts. That just doesn't seem to be on their radar at all. It's all about cancer... there's not much more information beyond cervical cancer that's on the parents' mind, whether or not it's on the factsheet.\" Challenges reported by other stakeholders relating to the school -based immunisation program for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people Several challenges relating to the overall school -based immunisation program for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were raised: transient and mobile populations higher levels of absence on the day of vaccination at school lower level of return of consent forms time consuming to update immunisation records on the register change from three to two doses confusing for general practice catch -up vaccine supply and storage issues parents of boys having concerns \"Look, we also have challenges with vaccine supply cold chains, between cyclones, distances, and very remote locations, we're almost set up for failure.\" \"And I guess the other challenge was the parents of boys who said how come all of a sudden you want the boys to have it when it was just for the girls to start with. So just to get rid of that stigma around it's only a girl vaccine as being one of the other challenges that I've had.\" NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 69 of 262 Catch -up HPV vaccination Australian Government Department of Health The Immunisation Branch staff perceived the community catch -up program to be beneficial as it offered extended opportunity for catch -up up to the age of 19 years; however, they thought there is insufficient awareness about this option among parents and student s. Jurisdictional immunisation program managers and other relevant staff All jurisdictions , except SA, ACT , conduct school -based catch- up vaccination, which was reported to increase HPV vaccination coverage by 3- 4% in WA and 8- 10% in NSW. Limited school -based catch -up vaccination was available in WA in 2019 as the program was being administered in two simultaneous cohorts following a change in the first year of high school (Year 7 students were moved from primary to high school in 2015, in line with other s tates and territories in Australia). The general method of delivery of school -based catch- up vaccination reported by jurisdictional immunisation program managers and other relevant staff is summarised in Table 5 . Table 5. Comparison of school -based catch- up across jurisdictions Jurisdiction Method of school -based catch -up HPV vaccination ACT No school -based catch up Reminder letter send at end of year referring students with missed doses to their GP Trial of school -catch up only for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students commencing in 2020 NSW From 2020 school catch- up will be available for both dose 1 and 2 in year 8 if consent was received in year 7 (previously had to have received dose 1 in year 7) NT Variable between providers QLD Variable between providers SA No school -based catch up Students with missed doses followed up by phone call or letter and offered an opportunity to have the vaccine e.g. council immunisation clinic TAS Variable between local councils Unlikely to offer school catch- up the following year VIC Variable between local councils WA Variable between providers Generally try to do catch- up in term 1 the following year Community -based catch- up vaccination was perceived by jurisdictional immunisation program managers and other relevant staff as necessary, both as a safety net for adolescents who miss doses at school and because some parents or adolescents prefer that vaccines be given at a general practice. NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 70 of 262 A com monly perceived barrier to community -based catch -up vaccination was cost if a general practice didn't bulk bill, reported as a particular challenge in ACT and regional NT, but also occurring sometimes at general practice discretion elsewhere. Another perceived barrier to community -based catch -up was the general practice not having the vaccine in stock, particularly in ACT where HPV vaccine must be specifically ordered for each individual. Free council immunisation clinics, some held after hours, were a com monly perceived enabler to community catch -up vaccination, but are not available in all areas. Other key stakeholders One local council staff member reported that they offered school -based catch- up at the next school visit later in the year. However, they checked the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR) record first and followed up with parents of adolescents thought to be overdue to confirm consent and avoid over -vaccinating, as this had occurred previously. The council had stopped offering catch -up vaccination at school in the following year ( Year 8) to avoid over -vaccination and because of logistical challenges. \"It just makes the session messy. We're waiting for teachers to go and get one or two children. It just increases pressure on the session... and then there are issues about do they walk back to class by themselves after the 15 minutes?\" Local council immunisation staff reported easier accessibility of free council immunisation sessions to be an enabler for community -based catch -up vaccination, with information regarding catch- up opportunities sent to parents via an SMS or a letter. It was also reported that catch- up doses are best received soon after the missed school dose to reduce the likelihood of families forgetting and to ensure any subsequent dose required can be received at school as scheduled. Community -based catch -up vaccination was considered adequate in remote Q LD, where it is conducted by a mixture of Queensland Health staff, GPs, Aboriginal Medical Service (AMS) staff and the Royal Flying Doctor Service. In some areas of Cape Tribulation, staff members travel to remote communities once or twice a year in school holidays to follow up adolescents aged 12- 19 years due for vaccination. Community -based catch- up vaccination was also considered adequate for non- Indigenous adolescents in remote NT, enabled by free community health clinics and all remote clinics keeping the vaccine in stock. One HPV researcher perceived that enhancing opportunities for school -based catch- up vaccination would l ikely be more cost -effective than relying on community -based catch- up vaccination, although the latter is still necessary in certain situations and for population groups with particularly high rates of absenteeism. \"Definitely the option for that parent of a child, adolescent who is needle phobic or wants to have a one -on-one with a doctor to.... address their concerns about safety, but I otherwise question whether it is a cost -effective way of catching up. I really think that going back into the school is a much better way of catching up.\" NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 71 of 262 Seqirus Seqirus staff reported that they support the provision of catch -up vaccination at GPs by supplying various promotional materials, including booklets, posters and pamphlets, in several languages. Seqirus also repor ted an increase in demand for HPV vaccines by Chinese university students studying in Australia and so it has developed resources in Chinese for university health clinics to use with these patients. The HPV disease awareness website (www.hpv.com.au) led by Seqirus is also available in Chinese. Seqirus has been supporting education, primarily of GPs, regarding the potential individual benefits of HPV vaccination in females aged up to 45 years. HPV vaccination in population subgroups In interviews with key stakeholders , the perceived enablers ('what is working well') and challenges of HPV vaccination in several population subgroups, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) people, people of low soci oeconomic status (SES), people living in remote locations and any other specifically identified population subgroups, were identified. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people Australian Government Department of Health The Australian Government Depart ment of Health staff viewed the school -based method of program delivery as an enabler of HPV vaccination in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, compared to the primary care setting, albeit challenged by higher school absenteeism in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. Another enabler was ensuring the program is culturally sensitive, which the staff contributed to by supporting development of a specific brochure and an animation for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander audiences. Jurisdictional immunisation program managers and other relevant staff Jurisdictional immunisation program managers and other relevant staff reported providing HPV vaccination to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people was particularly challenging in WA, ACT and metropolitan SA. Of the eight jurisdictional immunisation program managers and other relevant staff, five felt they could comment on factors influencing HPV vaccination coverage in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in their jurisdiction and identified the following enablers: good Aboriginal Health Services in remote regions close relationships between healthcare staff, families and students partnerships between health services, community organisations and community elders actively follow ing up students without signed consent forms Aboriginal Liaison Officers at schools NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 72 of 262 Aboriginal Immunisation Health Workers targeting Aboriginal students for vaccinations little or no vaccine hesitancy differentiating messages about the variety of needl es Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children may receive, for example, vaccinations versus penicillin simplification of the consent form for remote communities. All these five program managers identified high rates of absenteeism as a particular challenge, with other challenges including : transient/mobile population leading to students transferring schools more frequently lack of close relationship between healthcare staff, families and students in metropolitan areas difficult follow up due to changed mobile numbers and changed addresses separation of women's and men's health issues in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture, with a need to promote vaccination in a culturally appropriate way unlikely to seek catch -up vaccination in the community if missed at school literacy in remote regions language barriers and wordy English consent forms varying levels of support from communities. Accurate identification of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adolescent s was believed to be adequate in some jurisdictions (e.g. in ACT) but inadequate in others. Other key stakeholders Specific enablers of HPV vaccination reported for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in remote areas included engaging with the community, consistency of staff delivering the program, doing catch -up in school holidays and recording of vaccinations provided to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the Communicare system (electronic health and practice management system for use in community health) to allow providers at AMS facilities easy access to information and prevent over -vaccination. Particular challenges in remote areas included staff turnover, older male adolescents not accessing health services after leaving school and high population mobility. One HPV researcher perceived that a range of strategies are required to improve health equity in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, particularly increasing opportunities for catch- up vaccination, such as at school or through community outreach, as many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adolescents are unwilling to go to an AMS due to confidentiality concerns. Although the jurisdictional cervical screening manager interviewed did not direct ly work in immunisation, they suggested potential enablers for improving vaccination coverage in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people could be adapted from strategies used in cervical screening. These include engaging Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in research, plus formal national training networks to provide workshops for providers and opportunities to share information and ideas about what works in difference places. NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 73 of 262 Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services When asked if their area of service conducts a HPV vaccination catch -up program, two Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services (ACCHS) staff said no, two said yes to some extent, depending on the availability of 'fly in fly out GP service', and three did not comment. These catch - up programs were not continuous and were reliant on availability of staff, resources and time. The ACCHS staff identified main enablers to be 'No Jab, No Pay', despite HPV vaccine not being included in the requirements, and the expansion of the AIR to 'whole of life', facilitating the catch- up of children when they came for health checks, attend sexual or female health services. Another enabler identified was parental recommendation or encouragement. \"Well they're kids, and if they've missed it, they're going to say, \"Woohoo. I've got out of that,\" so unless the parents go, \"No, you're not getting out of that. You need to go to the doctor and have it done. I'm making the appointment,\" then they're not going to get done, are they?\" A key barrier identified was mobile populations having insufficient health education and knowledge about immunisation. The key strength identified was having Aboriginal health workers and local community members work for their ACCHS, as they could translat e where required (e.g. where English not the first language) and help ensure cultural appropriateness . In addition, in some places they provided incentives, such as giving colourful T -shirts to those coming for health checks, including screening for STIs. During health checks, missed vaccines could be provided. Some organisations also use computer -based recall systems. \"And, we're always working with c ommunity to try and make sure that education and health promotion activities are done with them. So, here we have broken down a lot of the cultural barriers; everyone feels comfortable to access and they know how we operate.\" \"We have some people come do wn from the traditional lands here and they don't understand English at all. So, it can be complicated. But usually, if they come in, they bring a local family member in with them and they become their interpreter. Or there's generally another health worker in the building that is related or has come from the same area and they become the interpreter.\" Stakeholders also reported that there were transport/bus services for people to come for vaccinations, including HPV and bush mobile vaccination teams. \"We h ave bush mobile teams that go out to remote areas. We have buses that go to each clinic.. ....... which is free to pick up clients or clients can come in their car, their own vehicle, their own transport.\" Knowing the community was identified as an important aspect of delivering vaccination programs. \"Well, probably one of the socioeconomically most disadvantaged people are the Aboriginal people, in our area. But what's working well is that our team here has been together for a NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 74 of 262 long time and so the community f eel [sic] very safe with us and that's a big advantage with rapport. ......They know me and they know they can ring me at any time.\" The key challenge identified by s takeholders was having fly -in fly-out staff or frequent changeover of staff , as it takes time for communities to feel they can trust newcomers. In addition, the addresses and phone numbers of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people change frequently. Also, in tight -knit communities, messages propagate quickly so if one teenager says vaccination hurts, many others may refuse. \"One of the other biggest problem is they might be homeless, so the address they gave you this week, or the phone number they gave you this week, may not be their contact details next week. That can be a real issue in follo wing up people. That's the beauty of having Aboriginal health workers working with you, because they know the community and they know where people are or who to ask where people are.\" Culturally and linguistically diverse populations Australian Government Department of Health The Immunisation Branch use translated resources to support HPV vaccination for CALD populations, including a brochure in 10 languages and social media animations in 4 languages. Jurisdictional immunisation program managers and other r elevant staff Jurisdictional immunisation program managers considered CALD populations to be generally accepting of vaccinations and compliant with recommendations. However, difficulties in identifying these populations and assessing any inequities in HPV vaccination coverage were recognised as challenges. Two jurisdictions have developed their own translated resources for school immunisation teams to use (NSW - 26 languages, WA - 15 languages). Other jurisdictions rely on translated resources from other si tes, the Commonwealth or interpreter services. Lack of free access to interpreter services for school immunisation teams was a particular challenge identified in SA. Specialist refugee immunisation clinics were identified as particularly valuable for prov iding HPV vaccinations to the CALD population. A project is currently also underway using PAIVng (Providing Access to Immunisation for Vulnerable Groups) software to support vaccination delivery in Victorian refugee asylum seekers and another project is underway in Q LD in collaboration with TAFE to develop immunisation information resources for people of non- English -speaking background and integrate immunisation as a topic in English language classes. A particular challenge in CALD populations identified in NSW was in regards to students at Intensive English Centre schools who are eligible to receive up to seven different vaccines at school and often have very complex vaccination histories, and there is limited access to their vaccination records which are o ften not in English. NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 75 of 262 Other key stakeholders The local council immunisation staff reported using translated resources when needed and the challenge of interpreting international immunisation records. In remote areas, disadvantaged CALD populations (e.g. r efugees) were considered particularly supportive of vaccination but challenged by a lack of support services (resources and interpreter services) in their languages. In remote NT, CALD populations were considered generally well educated and had no issues w ith the language. Religious beliefs of these populations about the association of the vaccine with sex were a potential barrier, although most provided consent. One HPV researcher reported finding that enablers to HPV vaccination in CALD populations includ e their trust in the Australian Government, working with communities to develop appropriate resources in relevant languages/dialects and provision of information face to face where possible. Barriers to HPV vaccination in CALD populations have been limited use of available translated resources, conservative beliefs among parents/families and anti -vaccination views derived from social media. People of lower socioeconomic status Jurisdictional immunisation program managers and other relevant staff Enablers o f HPV vaccination in adolescents from a low SES background identified by jurisdictional immunisation program managers and other relevant staff included supportive and engaged providers that follow up in relation to unreturned consent forms and students req uiring catch -up, free council immunisation clinics and GPs who bulk -bill low SES clients. A project using PAIVng software to support catch- up vaccination in homeless youth in metropolitan Victoria is also currently underway. Challenges of HPV vaccination in this group included consent form return, the often chaotic lives of students from low SES background leading to vaccination not being a priority, unstable home environments, poor parental literacy and difficulty contacting parents. This was also noted t o be a difficult group to identify and assess inequities in HPV vaccination coverage. Other key stakeholders One local council immunisation staff member reported enablers of HPV vaccination in adolescents from a low SES background to be extra support provi ded by staff to get consent forms signed, a Mature Minor policy allowing students to consent and opportunistic HPV vaccination when council staff conducted home visits for overdue infant vaccinations. A challenge is that transient students were not being f ollowed up, particularly if they moved outside the council's area. Similar themes were also reported by remote area immunisation coordinators, with the main enabler perceived to be school staff engaging with students and parents to facilitate consent form return. Perceived challenges of vaccination in low SES populations in remote areas included parental literacy, vaccination not being a high priority and adolescents with non- permanent addresses. NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 76 of 262 One HPV researcher perceived that the school -based program works well for providing HPV vaccination to adolescents of low SES background but would be enhanced by prioritising additional opportunities for school catch- up in disadvantaged areas, instead of requiring a GP visit. People living in remote locations Jurisdictional immunisation program managers and other relevant staff Jurisdictional immunisation program managers and other relevant staff identified the following enablers of HPV vaccination in people living in remote areas : close relationships with healthcare staff (e.g. remote area nurses that seek out overdue students in the community) ; daily vaccination recall lists ; and provision of vaccination by the Royal Flying Doctor Service. Barriers and challenges include vaccination not being a priority for parents (priority given to acute or emergency presentations) ; capacity (services often have a single provider) ; absenteeism at school ; gaining consent for students at boarding schools ; the logistics of vaccine delivery to remote areas ; and access to GPs or AMSs fo r catch -up vaccination, which may be located far away. Other key stakeholders The two remote area immunisation coordinators interviewed perceived that HPV vaccination was working well in their regions (NT and Q LD). They reported enablers to be: smaller com munities allowing efficient follow up and highly skilled remote area nurses who can vaccinate and have regular training so are kept up -to-date on HPV -related information. Challenges reported include inclement weather, staff turnover, staffing shortages and Sorry Business making remote communities inaccessible for ill -defined periods of time. Other population subgroups HPV vaccination c overage in students at special schools was reported by several stakeholders to be of concern, with one jurisdiction reporting coverage in students in these schools 10- 20% lower than for students in other schools. Despite parents being keen for vaccination and good consent form return rate, challenge in safely vaccinating these children in the school environment was identified as the major barrier. School staff can assist by providing background information and helping with physically stronger students, which may require additional personnel on vaccination day. It was also reported that special school students are sometimes vaccinated during medical or surgical procedures requiring sedation. Other diverse population groups reported by stakeholders to be at risk of missing out on HPV vaccination included home schooled children and marginalised groups, who are also at increased risk of HPV infection and include adolescents who are homeless, in out -of-home care, have dropped out of school or identify as lesbi an, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) . One HPV researcher also identified older MSM (aged up to 45 years) as an additional population group who would benefit from a national HPV vaccination program. NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 77 of 262 \"We know that MSM are at a high risk of getting anal HPV and also anal cancer. So it's beneficial to have a national program like the UK is doing... ......So I think it would be good if Australia can consider expanding the national program to include MSM for older cohorts. \" Initiatives to increase HPV vacci nation coverage Key stakeholders were asked to identify initiatives implemented by their workplace or jurisdiction in the last 5 years (since the previous evaluation) to increase HPV vaccination coverage. A summary of these initiatives, as well as initiati ves currently in development, is shown in Table 6 . NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 78 of 262 Table 6. Jurisdictional or stakeholder group initiatives to increase HPV vaccination coverage since 2014 Stakeholder or jurisdiction Initiatives Australian Government Department of Health (Immunisation Branch) Communication campaign to provide evidence-based information regarding vaccine benefits, importance, safety and efficacy, and to increase uptake in adolescents eligible for school -based vaccination and young adults eligible for catch-up vaccination.

Correspondence received at the department and a very active presence of this group of parents on social media, including comments on activities that the department has conducted, reinforce this view. This activity has remained at a consistent level since the program started and does not appear to have changed following the transition to 9vHPV vaccine in 2018. However, attitudes on social media towards HPV vaccination are largely positive. \"We do get a lot of negative comments on our social media platforms abou t this vaccine and other vaccines as well, but we do - it's certainly a much more positive conversation. So, the number of likes on our posts completely outweigh the negative comments. And actually, most of the comments that we get on our social media platform are the negative comments and we think that that's purely because people who are supportive of vaccination tend not to comment and just like posts.\" NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 81 of 262 Seqirus Seqirus staff reported that they receive occasional enquiries from people expressing hesitanc y towards HPV vaccine or vaccines in general due to safety, philosophical or religious reasons, and perceive that social media can influence people's attitudes towards HPV vaccination either positively or negatively. Seqirus has limited capacity to use s ocial media for vaccine promotion due to industry regulations, but highlighted the positive work of the Australian Government Department of Health in targeting adolescents and parents on social media. Therapeutic Goods Administration The TGA reported that it does not receive more inquiries from external stakeholders regarding HPV vaccine safety than it did for other vaccines. Jurisdictional immunisation program managers and other relevant staff Jurisdictional immunisation program managers generally perceived HPV vaccine hesitancy to be present in a small proportion of the population, but did not consider it a major issue and had minimal impact on HPV vaccination coverage. Several managers believed that vaccine hesitancy is a more prominent issue in relation to childhood vaccination in Australia. This view was based on relatively few concerns expressed by parents and infrequent phone calls regarding HPV vaccine hesitancy to immunisation help lines. \"We don't have a major issue in our jurisdiction.\" \"Most people are compliant, however, there will always be a small percentage... we try and address any concerns or demyth, debrief around any myths about the HPV vaccine and things like that. But we don't get a lot.\" Measurable hesitancy specific to HPV vaccine is d emonstrated by a discrepancy in coverage between HPV and dTpa vaccines, given in the same school visit, varying from 2- 3% lower for HPV vaccine in WA and SA to up to 10% lower in some parts of Q LD. \"There's still small amounts of parents and guardians who object and who have demonstrated on the card that they do not wish their child to be immunised. So, they might consent to the child being immunised with dTpa, but on the same consent form they won't consent to HPV.\" A variety of perceived reasons for HPV vaccine hesitancy were provided by jurisdictional immunisation program managers, including the association of the vaccine with sexual activity, philosophical objection and religious objection. Of note, not all jurisdictions have a 'no' option on consent forms, meaning that it cannot be determined what proportion of forms are not returned due to objection. NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 82 of 262 Steiner schools, and some religious schools, do not allow the vaccination program to occur in their school, and stakeholders expressed uncertainty about w hether the vaccination information they provided was passed on to parents. Vaccine hesitancy was reported as more common in certain geographic al areas, where people with anti -vaccination beliefs had written directly to schools to dissuade participation in the school -based vaccination program. It was reported that the schools targeted in this way remained supportive and continued to participate in the program. The influence of social media on HPV vaccination coverage was reported to be both positive and negative. Some jurisdictions use social media to promote vaccination campaigns, which was perceived to have a positive influence. Conversely, negative social media messaging about vaccination was perceived to potentially spread very quickly and have a powerful effect on both adolescents and parents, with several jurisdictional immunisation program managers commenting on the need for awareness: \"I think we have to be constantly reviewing what the messages are that are out there. It doesn't mean that we respond to every single message but it is a powerful influencer and we do have to be aware of that.\" One jurisdiction (Q LD) was concerned that negative messaging on social media regularly impacts consent for HPV vaccination, but other jurisdictions were less concerned about any negative influence of social media. They reported that occasional circulation of discredited studies and anecdotes leads to queries to immunisation teams but generally gains little traction. \"The vast majority of cases generally self -corre ct where somebody comes on with an anti-vaccination sentiment or what have you. The majority of people really sort of overwhelm; the sensible perspective generally tends to overrule and drown out anybody who comes on and says well HPV causes sexual promisc uity or what have you.\" Other key stakeholders One local council staff member reported a large increase in high school vaccinations following the 'No Jab No Pay' policy, despite HPV vaccine not being included, and perceived that indifference, ignorance and non-return of consent forms were more significantly impacting HPV vaccination coverage than vaccine hesitancy. The other local council staff member also did not perceive vaccine hesitancy to be impacting HPV vaccine coverage in their area. Social media was again perceived to have both positive and negative influences by these staff members, through promotion of the vaccination program and prompting return of consent forms, but also exposure to anti-vaccination views. The sexual health physician interviewed perceived that vaccine hesitancy in Australia is common to all vaccines and driven overwhelmingly by safety concerns. However, one HPV researcher perceived although there were some safety concerns, vaccine hesitancy was not a significant issue for HPV vac cination, and trust in the vaccine was enhanced by its delivery in the school -based vaccination program. NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 83 of 262 Social media was also perceived by one HPV researcher to negatively influence attitudes towards HPV vaccination in a small part of the population but not having a great impact. One HPV researcher commented that Australia could consider conducting regular societal surveys of vaccine acceptance, as are conducted in the United Kingdom, to monitor for any increase in the negative influence of social media. \"I think it does play a role.... people can get the information very easily from the internet and there is actually lots of different information which may influence the attitudes or also the perception of the HPV vaccination.\" It was also reported that soci al media have been used positively in the promotion of HPV vaccine knowledge and availability of catch- up vaccination to MSM, with an emphasis on HPV -related cancers occurring in this group. Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services Four of six ACCHS stakeholders reported that social media (mainly Facebook) plays a role in spreading negative messages regarding HPV vaccination in their area. One stakeholder said that Facebook could also be used to promote vaccination. A nurse immuniser reported that negative messages were often spread via social media. \"The anti -vaxxers are always going to troll any vaccination advertisement or information that comes onto any of the social media. That goes without saying.\" Vaccine safety Australian Government Department of Health The Immunisation Branch staff reported no concerns from any stakeholders specifically about the safety of 9vHPV vaccine and also highlighted the role of AusVaxSafety in monitoring the implementation of 9vHPV vaccine. Therapeutic Goods Administ ration The TGA reported that 9vHPV vaccine undergoes enhanced monitoring as a drug of special interest and that since 2018 there have been an average of 215 adverse events following immunisation ( AEFI ) reports per year related to this vaccine, compared wit h an average of 335 per year for 4vHPV vaccine for the period 2006- 2019 (noting fewer doses of 9vHPV vaccine are administered because of the 2- dose schedule). The top 10 most frequently reported adverse events to date are almost identical for both 4vHPV and 9vHPV vaccines, with the three most frequently reported being syncope, headache and nausea for 4HPV vaccine and injection site reaction, headache and syncope for 9vHPV vaccine. NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 84 of 262 Jurisdictional immunisation program managers and other relevant staff No concerns were reported by jurisdictional immunisation program managers about HPV vaccine safety, with no change in frequency or type of adverse events observed following the transition from 4vHPV vaccine to 9vHPV vaccine. Other key stakeholders One HPV researcher commented that the increase in injection site reactions seen in clinical trials with 9vHPV vaccine requires monitoring, as this could affect adolescents because of their anxiety about vaccination and potentially lead to students refusing or not turni ng up for the second dose. Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services ACCHS stakeholders reported no major change in the type and frequency of adverse events following HPV vaccination. Vaccination reporting Australian Government Department of Health The Immunisation Branch staff perceived the transition of HPV vaccination reporting from the HPV Register to AIR to be beneficial as AIR was a whole- of-life register and a single location for all immunisation records. \"The AIR is a source of truth, one st op place, immunisation history statements will all have - will have everyone's full immunisation history including HPV.\" Challenges of the transition included differences in the method of calculation and reporting of coverage rates, and the need for ongoin g efforts to raise awareness among providers of the importance of HPV vaccination reporting. Several challenges associated with the transition of existing records from the HPV Register to AIR were reported, including: more records without Medicare numbers than known Medicare- ineligible population, suggesting some records of Medicare- eligible individuals could not be matched incorrect provider numbers, for example, illegible writing on paper consent forms no consistent method of recording schools (now Austr alian Curriculum Assessment and Reporting Authority Schools List) changes in names and addresses over time. These challenges prevented automatic matching and required developing new matching systems in the software or laborious manual matching of individual records. Overall, approximately 60,000 individual HPV vaccination records were manually matched but 30,000 could not be matched. As state and territory immunisation databases are integrated into NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 85 of 262 AIR, more records are expected to be matched. Records can also be matched if an individual notifies to Services Australia that a vaccine has been administered, leading to a planned promotion for people to check their vaccination records. \"Some work that we've been doing this year, and that we will continue to do over the next couple of years, is work on AIR data quality and asking people to check their immunisation history statement, asking them to check whether or not it's up to date, if it's not visit your vaccination provider, get the vaccination provider to update the AIR.\" The Immunisation Branch staff also reported that vaccination records entered into AIR that end up in a 'Pending file' and are not visible on a person's record are largely due to providers entering incorrect information, most frequent ly incorrect dose numbers. Systems have been developed to identify 'Pending records' that may impact payment of federal government family benefits (although this is not relevant to HPV vaccine) but there is a need to continue improving the quality of the data. \"We've been doing quite a bit of work with providers to teach them how to use their systems. We've been working with the software developers to improve how data comes into the AIR, to improve the data quality of the AIR and give the right level of acc ess to AIR data to the right people. So that's our aim.\" A significant future change that will improve the quality of AIR data is the requirement for all software developers that have vaccination providers as customers to include AIR functionality in their software and keep it updated. The Immunisation Branch is also exploring ways to improve bulk uploading of school -based vaccinations and systems to improve reporting of vaccinations given in hospitals. Both of these measures should assist with improving v accination reporting and accuracy of coverage estimates. Jurisdictional immunisation program managers and other relevant staff Jurisdictional immunisation program managers were very supportive of the transition of HPV vaccination reporting from the HPV Re gister to AIR, and reported that immunisation providers were also happy with the change. Perceived benefits of reporting to AIR included: simpler system to use for providers single place for all vaccinations to assist people accessing vaccination records uploading to AIR is often built into practice software and so GP reporting of HPV vaccinations may improve. The managers also reported several concerns arising from the transition, most common of which (reported by six out of eight ) was concern about missi ng data. This was usually flagged when a member of the public or a provider noticed a record was incomplete and led to concerns about falsely low jurisdictional coverage rates. NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 86 of 262 Another major concern reported was a decrease in the quality of data reports i nitially available from AIR compared with the HPV Register, particularly the inability to extract reports by school. Some were extracting reports by date of birth and others by postcode, both of which had potential to be incomplete if students were in the wrong year level for their age or not listed at the correct address on their Medicare record. \"The biggest loss for us is the information by schools. Our database was set up by schools, so we could look at denominators - we had a lot of information by school which we no longer have.\" The biggest barrier jurisdictional immunisation program managers perceived to HPV vaccination reporting was failure of immunisation providers to update practice software to allow automatic uploading to AIR, but this was thought to be improving with time. Other perceived barriers included providers not recognising the importance of reporting and reporting not being a priority for providers, particularly because of high staff turnover in some areas and lack of incentives for repor ting adolescent vaccinations, unlike childhood vaccinations. Other key stakeholders The local council immunisation staff interviewed perceived similar benefits of the transition to those highlighted by other stakeholders. One of the challenges identified by these immunisation staff was not all doses given by GPs are reported to AIR, as found when following up adolescents with incomplete courses recorded on AIR. This can lead to a risk of over -vaccination. These staff also reported that they needed to rely on council software to upload vaccination records rather than being able to upload directly to AIR, which delayed reporting. Remote area immunisation coordinators reported particular challenges of the transition to AIR, including AIR regularly dropping in and out during the day (requiring users to log in again) due to AIR data security settings, delays due to the need for manual uploading and limited access to computers in small communities. Despite these challenges, both remote area immunisation coordinator s believed the completeness of HPV vaccination reporting to AIR in their areas was very high. \"The thing with timeliness is if you've got a lot of schools you won't get that data on quickly. It's actually going to take a month or a couple of months before you actually get that data entry in. The appropriate staff to do the data entry and...... an electronic system in a school would work really well. You know, do it straight there in school. But again, that would slow the whole process down of the vaccinations. But that would be utopia.\" Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services Five of six ACCHS stakeholders said migration of HPV vaccination data to AIR has made the task of reporting easier, reduced delay and facilitated access to records of HPV vaccinat ions given in GP surgeries. NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 87 of 262 \"I think the fact that we now have access to the records of the immunisations being given, without having to go to another agency, or having AIR available to us now, it makes it very easy to check up who's had their vaccines.\" All ACCHS stakeholders however noted that reporting of data to AIR was incomplete in their practices/services. Cervical screening Australian Government Department of Health The Immunisation Branch staff felt the change to HPV -based cervical screening could improve HPV vaccine uptake through the change in language used, which may lead to more people associating HPV vaccination and cervical screening. Representatives from the Cervical Screening Section noted the literature showing higher cervical screening participation in vaccinated women than unvaccinated, but pointed out that these were older females who received catch -up vaccination and so were likely to be more aware of health prevention activities. They noted that there is no evidence yet of either reduction or increase in screening participation by females vaccinated in the school -based program. The Cervical Screening Section staff were also aware of anecdotal reports of females believing screening is not needed following HPV vaccination. An ongoing focus of all communication resources to both healthcare providers and consumers has been the need to screen irrespective of vaccination status. These national resources are av ailable in a large range of languages, including Braille, and translator/interpreter services are also available. Many states and territories also develop their own resources and the Cervical Screening Section is looking at promoting a move to a more consi stent national approach. In regards to any influence of the change to HPV -based cervical screening on HPV vaccination uptake, the Cervical Screening Section staff perceived that possibly more people may be able to make the link between HPV vaccination and cervical screening, although this may depend on the language used. The Cervical Screening Section staff also perceived that it might be helpful to raise awareness of screening as a preventative health measure in young people through communication at the ti me of HPV vaccination, who could then increase awareness of cervical screening in their mothers. \"We're thinking more around increasing awareness of preventative health, that screening is a preventative health measure. So you don't want people to be fixa ted with screening from the age of 12, but having an awareness of it and having an opportunity to talk to their parents about it as well and to ensure that they're - because I think we had some issues with older women who stopped screening because they've had children, they don't see screening as necessarily being a priority anymore. Nothing to do with vaccination, but it's another opportunity to target a group that is potentially able to influence others.\" NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 88 of 262 Jurisdictional immunisation program managers and other relevant staff Most jurisdictional immunisation program managers provided little or no comment on cervical screening as this was not their area of expertise. Of those who did, it was generally perceived that the public did not usually associate HPV v accination and cervical screening, as there was generally a long interval between vaccination and commencement of screening. Of the three managers who commented about any potential impact of the change to HPV -based cervical screening on HPV vaccination upt ake, two thought there would likely be no impact and one thought that there may be a positive impact, but in the longer term. Jurisdictional cervical screening manager The jurisdictional cervical screening manager interviewed reported that while females can frequently recall they had been vaccinated, they often do not have a good understanding about the HPV vaccine or the connection between vaccination and screening, and that there is still a misconception among some females that screening is not required a fter receiving the vaccine. The importance of the HPV vaccination and cervical screening programs working collaboratively to provide a clear message that vaccination on its own does not protect against all types of cervical cancer was also emphasised, par ticularly in higher risk populations. \"You know, the media saying elimination of cervical cancer in Australia, we're going to be the first country and all this stuff, it is only as good as the paper you write it on if we don't bring our First Nations people into this. And they are the ones not screening. And they are also the ones with lower rates of vaccinations. So we have a real agenda ahead of us to make sure that both of these messages get really strongly articulated for that group, and our CALD populations.\" The jurisdictional cervical screening manager also perceived a potential benefit of increasing awareness about screening among adolescents at the time of HPV vaccination was that they could influence their mothers to undergo screening. Other key stakeholders Similar to other stakeholders, the sexual health physician interviewed also perceived that many people did not link HPV vaccination and cervical screening because of the extended interval between vaccination and screening. Disease impact Austr alian Government Department of Health The Immunisation Branch staff reported that their promotional materials for the HPV vaccination program include information on the impact of the vaccine on disease burden, but this information is not included in the consent form process and for students being vaccinated. This is based on NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 89 of 262 research showing that disease impact was not considered an important message by parents for consent. The Cervical Screening Section staff highlighted the evidence of reductions in cerv ical HGA in Australia since the National HPV V accination Program began, and an expectation that this will also extend to cervical cancer. Other key stakeholders The sexual health physician interviewed reported that the incidence of genital warts started declining within 3 months of the N ational HPV V accination Program commencing, and continues to trend down. However, genital warts are still common in the older MSM population never eligible for vaccination. It was also reported that there has been no change in cervical HGA in unvaccinated migrant women who attended sexual health clinics for cervical screening and that the relative proportion of HPV infections in migrants is expected to increase in coming years as prevalence in the overall population decreases . Related to this, one HPV researcher also highlighted the significant declines seen in genital warts in Australia in both females and males but raised the potential challenge of sexual mixing between the Australian population likely to have been vaccinated at school and people from other countries who come to Australia, who are less likely to be vaccinated. WHO cervical cancer elimination target All key stakeholders were asked whether they believed Australia could achieve the HPV vaccine- related WHO global scale- up target for the elimination of cervical cancer as a public health problem. This target is to achieve 90% of females fully vaccinated by 15 years of age by 2030. Australian Government Department of Health The Immunisation Branch staff believed that Australia can achieve this target and that we are already achieving higher coverage than many other countries. \"Certainly they're targets that we'd be looking to work towards and to be able to do that, and [we] are probably in a much better position than other countries to be able to do that, given the delivery mechanisms and the resources and materials that I guess are put behind the program.\" The Cervical Screening Section staff highlighted inclusion of cervical screening targets in the WHO targets for cervical cancer elimination and believed that Australia is close to achieving these. \"I think we're closer than we think we are. You look at 90- 70-90 and think that's hard but actually Australia is probably pretty close.\" NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 90 of 262 Jurisdictional immunisation program managers and other relevant staff Seven out of eight jurisdictional immunisation managers believed that the WHO elimination target is achievable in Australia. While all of them acknowledged that this target is aspirational and challenging, they hi ghlighted the fact that 90% coverage was already being reached in some cohorts, particularly for dose 1, exemplified the perceived achievability of the target. All jurisdictional immunisation program managers also emphasised the need for increased support and strategies for the program, particularly around the delivery of dose 2, to be able to achieve the target. Other key stakeholders Both local council immunisation staff interviewed also perceived this coverage target to be achievable, with electronic consent and improved consent form return considered as prerequisites to achieving this. Both remote area immunisation coordinators believed that improved accessibility to vaccine was required for Australia to achieve the target, with vaccine hesitancy and so cial media considered a barrier. \"I know they rely on GPs too much down South...... some kids even go for their childhood needles to the GP. So, I think having Community Health Centres that are free and health- promoting school nurses is a lot more effective.\" The sexual health physician believed that the coverage target is achievable for dose 1 but potentially not for dose 2 because of attrition, while one HPV researcher was not sure if Australia could achieve this target. The other HPV researcher believed thi s target is achievable with improved consent form return, increased school -based catch- up and increased understanding of the school -based program. Increased resources and funding would be required to study and evaluate the school -based program, but this was perceived to have potential for Australia to become a world leader in school -based vaccination programs and model how to achieve a successful school -based program for other countries as well as supporting the introduction of other vaccines through school -based programs in future. \"We could do better, but we need to - I think we're at the point where we need to understand why. I mean, we've sort of gotten to this point where we can't seem to get any higher, so we just need to have a better understanding of what are the weaknesses, and do some testing of different strategies for addressing those weaknesses.\" \"Because a school is like a mini community or a mini society and we really fully haven't worked it out, and we could be a leader for the rest of the wo rld because a lot of countries don't have school -based vaccination, and they might be concerned that it may not be acceptable or they don't know how to do it and we could actually - if we're able to do a bit of research, we could sort of model... how you mak e a school -based vaccination program very successful.\" NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 91 of 262 Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services Four of five ACCHS stakeholders who answered this question said the 90% vaccination target in girls by age 15 years is achievable. Factors influencing pr ogram outcomes and impacts Key stakeholders were asked which factors influenced the HPV vaccination program outcomes and impacts most positively and negatively. The responses are summarised by stakeholder group in Table 7 . Table 7.

Table 8. Key stakeholder recommendations Stakeholder group Recommendations Department of Health Continued efforts to increase education Electronic consent forms by states and territories Seqirus Provide information for GPs and practice nurses about how to use t he AIR to recall adolescents due for vaccination before turning 15 years, to prevent the need for 3 dose, and before turning 19 years to remain eligible for funded catch- up Increased education for immunisation providers on how to counsel parents hesitant about HPV vaccine Increased information for providers and the public regarding the safety and efficacy of HPV vaccines and the impact on disease burden achieved to date NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 94 of 262 Increased promotion to GPs of importance of HPV vaccin ation reporting to the AIR Education for GPs regarding potential benefits of HPV vaccination in females to 45 and males to 26 years Emphasise the benefits of vaccination in males Consider inclusion in 'no jab no pay' policy Include HPV education in school curriculum Increased collaboration to maximise educational efforts for healthcare professionals and consumers Harmonised national approach to missed doses Consider financial incentives for GPs to record doses to the AIR as exists for childhood immunisations Link vaccination reporting with accreditation Jurisdictional immunisation program managers Electronic consent forms Don't use 'sex' in promotional messages, more that the vaccine is for cancer prevention Include immunisation in school curriculums Provide more catch- up opportunities at schools Incorporate information on disease impacts into education and the consent process for parents Develop new resources and initiatives for vulnerable or hard to reach populations to improve equity Stronger messaging for parents and adolescents around the benefits of the vaccine, why it's given to females and males and why given in early adolescence Ongoing communication to providers about the importance of HPV vaccination reporting Research into why coverage rates low in certain areas Reduce the HPV vaccination schedule to 1 dose Consider reducing minimum dosing interval to 5 months Consider including HPV vaccine in 'no jab no pay' Increased sharing of initiatives to improve coverage Increased funding to support delivery in remote areas Improved resources in Indigenous languages Increased political will to develop strategies for improved vaccination coverage in adolescents and adults, not just children Improved quality of AIR data AIR reports available by school and school year Raise profile of the program with the Department of Education, to support schools in delivering the program Media campaigns about benefits and availability at GP Campaign to increase GP awareness and encourage checking adolescents' vaccination histories NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 95 of 262 Consent forms for parents with low literacy Local Council Immunisation staff More encouragement for schools to provide timely class lists with parent contact details Timely vaccination coverage rates available for council per school, to identify gaps before end of school year Electronic consent forms Ability to download consent forms on social media and return to council or school via email Remote area immunisation coordinators Promote whole of life immunisation in general Education for parents, nurses and midwives about the ramifications of cervical cancer treatment AIR reports available by school per region Working with the languages of CALD people Providing the vaccine outside of normal hours Emphasise importance of finishing course post dose 1 Appropriate staff for data entry for vaccination reporting to reduce incorrect data input (may not be provid ers) Sexual health physician Target minority population groups who may not currently be eligible e.g. migrant sex workers Monitor the scientific literature about one dose Continual promotion of the good news stories in coming decades about vaccine impact particularly social media Opt-out system for parents to only indicate if they did not want their child vaccinated Jurisdictional cervical screening manager Improved research and engagement with priority populations Promote HPV vaccination and cervical screening as a wellness program to improve reproductive health, to remove the stigma around sexual health HPV researchers Increased education around HPV vaccination, transmission and risk amongst males National program for HPV vaccination in older MSM Ensure the program is well accepted by adolescents e.g. privacy screens, appropriate clothing, vaccinate anxious students first Provide education at school just before getting the vaccine to improve student's understanding Work with young people and teachers to develop educational materials that align with school curriculum. Ensure parents well informed about the benefits of vaccination, including for boys e.g. prevention of genital warts and HPV -related cancers, not cervical cancer Develop online education f or students to access outside of school time to improve their self -efficacy, co- designed with parents and students and in addition to education in schools NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 96 of 262 Increase opportunities for school catch -up e.g. additional visits to schools, expansion of healthcare clinics in schools, train school nurses to vaccinate Increase opportunities for catch- up at schools with high Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander student enrolment, where there are high rates of absenteeism and students may not want to go to an AMS e.g. increased school -based catch up or community outreach visits Target marginalised students at high risk of HPV infection and absenteeism with tailored strategies Include vaccination in the regular health program and pathways that adolescents in out -of-home care receive Increase coverage in special school students who may have behavioural issues - may need to go back to the school more often or have more personnel to help Community partnerships between schools and GPs to streamline catch- up (not just sending a letter home) Coverage targets for the jurisdictions and health districts to promote partnerships with schools Look at why we don't get all consent forms back and use strategies to increase consent form return e.g. combination of hard copy and electronic consent, reminders, sending the consent pack home again If electronic consent was developed could include a site for students and parents to obtain information online in a more appealing and accessible way and triage information based on parental views Look at what regions in Australia with high coverage do to achieve this e.g. local government areas or schools Consider regular societal surveys of attitudes towards vaccination in Australia Increased resources and funding for evaluation of the school -based program and factors affecting coverage Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services More education around HPV vaccination. Media campaign may need to be done afresh to deliver the same message to male and female populations since confusion following boys being included. Online survey A total of 1,513 responses were obtained from the online survey. Not all respondents answered all questions and hence, denominators presented vary across questions. The majority of respondents were females (87.2%). Forty -five per cent of respondents were 55 years and older. Fi gure 2 shows the age groups of the respondents. The highest proportion of respondents were from N SW (31.5%), followed by V IC (26.6%) (refer to Figure 3). The majority of respondents worked in major cities (60.2%) followed by regional (33.8%) and remote areas (6.0%) (refer to Figure 4 ). There were respondents from all stakeholder groups, with just over half (51.4% [778/1,513]) of the respondents being GPs, 13.9% practice nurses and 11% (166/1,513) school -based nurse immunisers (refer to Table 9). Many respondents selected the 'other' option, NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 97 of 262 including local government immunisation team leaders and nurses, maternal and child health nurses, remote area nurses, midwives, pharmacists and gynaecologists.

Of these, o nly one Aboriginal h ealth worker worked at an ACCHS. NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 99 of 262 Change to a 2 -dose schedule of 9vHPV vaccine More than 47% (535/1,128) of respondents thought there were advantages of implementing the 2-dose 9vHPV vaccination program. However, a few (2.2%, 25) respondents thought that the 2-dose schedule had decreased coverage. Perceived advantages largely related to the increased convenience of delivering two doses, better acceptance by schools and students (particularly those who are needle- phobic), increased compliance with the course and being able to promote greater protection against HPV types with the increased valency. \"I believe that the 2 dose course is much easier to plan and implement through the schools and also better on the students' fear of getting a needle. It provided less disruption to the running of the schools and break in thei r lesson plans. I know the teachers are happier about this\" (male school -based nurse immuniser, age group 45- 54 years). \"Health promotion about the increased valency helps to sell the program to parents\" (female clinical nurse specialist age group 55- 59 years). The majority of respondents (74.2% [837/1,128]) had experienced no issues with implementing the 9vHPV program, with 13.2% (149/1,128) reporting a few issues and 12.6% (142/1,128) responses being not applicable. Of the issues reported, the majority r elated to parental safety concerns, confusion about eligibility for 2 - or 3-dose courses and parents requesting revaccination. In addition, 55.9% (631/1128) of respondents reported an interval of 6- 7 months between the two doses of the vaccine in their school immunisation program or practice (refer to Figure 5 ). Figure 5: Proportion of respondents reporting interval between the 2 doses of vaccine in their practice/program (n=1,128) Although many respondents could not comment on any impact of the change to a 2 -dose schedule on HPV vaccination coverage for adolescents aged <15 years in their area, most who did comment perceived that dose 1 coverage was unchanged (40.5%, [457/1,128]) but dose 2 coverage had NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 100 of 262 increased (39.3% [443/1,128]), while very few believed coverage for either dose 1 or 2 had decreased (refer to Table 10). \"It is easier with 2 doses for students to complete the full course. However due to the 6 month gap, the 2nd visit pushes into a busy time in the school year and many students are away, so still require catch ups. But it is one dose to be caught up so overall easier for families to complete course\" (female school -based nurse immuniser, age group 35- 44 years) Table 10.

Students themselves also need to be informed as so many have no idea what they are having. In most cases, they are the ones responsible for taking the forms home and bringing them to school in time. ....... Empowering students through their science or PDHE teachers I feel could be very beneficial\" (female school -based nurse immuniser age group 55-59 years) Respondents were offered the opportunity to suggest strategies to improve school -based HPV vaccination coverage. The most commonly suggested strategies included: electronic consent forms increased education for parents. \"An option for electronic forms for those that prefer this but also an option for current consent cards for those that prefer this. Also all versions of consent cards should be available in other languages. The translated version should have English and other language on the same piece of paper so that there is no confusion for whoever is reading the form\" (female council nurse immuniser age group 55- 59 years) Comments provided (n = 849) regarding strategies to improve school -based HPV vaccination cove rage are summarised in the word cloud below, with comments in larger text most frequently mentioned. NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 102 of 262 Community -based catch -up vaccination There were mixed opinions from respondents about the adequacy of utilisation of community - based catch -up vaccination in their area, but it was generally perceived to be better for adolescents aged <15 years receiving 2 doses than those aged 15 years receiving 3 doses (refer to Table 12). Comments regarding the barriers to community catch- up vaccinat ion included: \"Patients not had vaccine due to parents' refusal and then when they realise importance are too old to get free vaccination\" (female GP age group 55- 59 years) \"The cost of the final dose in a catch up program is not covered by the scheme. If patients cannot afford it they may not be fully immunised\" (female GP, age group 45- 54 years) Table 12.

However, over a fifth were unsatisfied (22.0% [248/1,128]) and the rest did not answer (29.4% [332/1,128]). Respondents commented that information sharing and communication were key factors to improving the relationship between the school -based immunisers and primary care providers. HPV vaccination in population subgroups Five hundred and forty one respondents reported that their work involved HPV vaccination in schools or communities with significant representation of various population subgroups at risk of lower coverage: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people (46.4% [251/541]) CALD people (53.2% [288/541]) socioeconomically diverse population groups (21.3% [115/541]) . These other diverse population groups included refugees, special schools, boarding school children, Pacific Islander population, alternative schooling pathways, home school parents, young people in out of home care and the LGBTQ population. HPV vaccine hesitancy While 28.4% (310/1,090) of respondents had not encountered any instances of HPV vaccine hesitancy, 47.3% (515/1,090) had encountered refusal of HPV vaccination and 36.2% (395/1,090) had encountered delayed HPV vaccination. Regarding HPV 44.2% (351/795) rarely; (44/795) frequently ; and 1.3% (10/795) very frequently. The perceived importance of reasons encountered in relation to HPV vaccine hesitancy is shown in Table 13, with safety concerns most commonly perceived as very important (36.1% [279/773] of respondents).

Parents and students are not fully educated that this vaccine is most effective when given early prior to any sexual activity commencing\" (female bus iness support worker for immunisation service, age group 45- 54 years). Influence of social media Of 1,090 respondents who answered this question, 29.4 % (320) reported that social media has a positive impact or very positive impact on the uptake of HPV vac cination, with only 12.8% (140/1,090) respondents perceiving social media having a negative or very negative influence. Many respondents (37.2% [405/1,090]) did not know if social media played any role. Vaccine safety The majority of respondents perceived no change in frequency (72.3%) or type (70.6%) of AEFI with 9vHPV vaccine compared with 4vHPV vaccine (refer to Figures 6 and 7 ). 29 (2.7%) respondents perceived a decrease in the frequency of adverse events and only 8 (0.7%) respondents perceived an incr ease in these events. Several respondents commented that syncope was still relatively common with 9vHPV vaccine but more said the frequency is decreasing. No other significant adverse events of concern were reported in the comments.

It was an excellent move\" (female immunisation nurse, age group 35- 44 years) \"Most in the community did not know the HPV register existed or if they did, wouldn't know how to access it. Most people are very aware of the Australian Immunisation Register\" (female nurse immuniser, age group 45- 54 years) \"Easier to look up what they have had at school, previously we couldn't do that from medical centres. Therefore less phone calls to the school team to ask about records.\" (female school -based nurse immuniser, age group 45- 54 years) \"While I am happy that the HPV gets put onto AIR - how this occurs is much, much, much more labour intensive for nurses now. Before it was a large bulk import done by admin staff - now each child needs to be done individually and it takes at least 5 minutes per child to enter onto CHIS [CHIS stands for Community Health Information System] which transfers to AIR. I hate it!\" (female school -based nurse immuniser, age group 35- 44 years) Cervical screening Only those respondents who indicated that their work involved cervical screening were asked questions about cervical screening. Their level of agreement with statements pertaining to cervical screening and HPV vaccination is shown in Table 15. Responses to any influence of HPV vaccination on participation in c ervical screening were relatively varied, but almost half of NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 107 of 262 respondents (48.6% [341/702]) agreed and 9.3% (65/702) strongly agreed that females who have received HPV vaccine have adequate knowledge that they still require cervical screening.

Also, there is a long time interval between when they are immunised as a teenager and when they start screening at 25 years\" (female GP , age group 35- 44 years) \"Due to dislike of the cervical Pap smear process, some woman will use having had the HPV vaccine as an extra excuse in their mind to put off having Pap smears\" (female practice nurse, age 45- 54 years) \"Many patients have been surprised that I have recommended cervical screening test ( 'but I've been immunised' )\" (female GP, age group 35 -44 years) NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 108 of 262 \"The assumption by many who have received what is marketed as a ' cancer vaccine ' is that the vaccination protects them from cervical c ancer, so then why would they need to screen further for cancer\" (female GP, age group 55- 59 years) Respondents also had mixed perceptions about whether the change to HPV -based cervical screening could have any impact on HPV vaccination uptake in Australia (Yes - 28.4% [199/702], No - 37.8% [265/702], Don't Know - 33.9% [238/702]). Additional comments indicated that respondents largely believed that the change to HPV -based cervical screening could potentially increase HPV vaccination uptake through increas ed awareness about the link between HPV and cervical cancer. \"I have found more people interested in being vaccinated after they find out the new test is looking at HPV\" (female GP, age group 35- 44 years) \"I'm hopeful it will spark more conversation abou t HPV and its role in cervical cancer and therefore the role of vaccination in preventing it\" ( female GP, age group 35- 44 years) Disease burden Respondents who indicated that they saw patients with HPV -related conditions were asked questions on disease bu rden. Perceptions of decline in disease burden varied: 63.4% (433/683) of respondents perceived a decrease in genital warts in females; 60.8% (415/683) perceived a decrease in cervical HGA and 37.8% (258/683) perceived a decrease in genital warts in males (refer to Table 16).

The school -based program (91.2%); funded vaccine (87.9%); cancer prevention promotion (87.2%); community catch- up option (84.7%); gender -neutral program (78.8%) ; and reduction to a 2 -dose schedule (65.9%) were considered 'very important' by respondents.

The risk of inducing complacency regarding cervical screening by promoting the vaccine as preventing cervical cancer was also expressed by one respondent: \"Promoting a vaccine as cancer prevention when it doesn't fully do so (because of other carcinogenic strains not included in the vaccine) and likely to make many women complacent about ongoing cervical screening.\" (female GP aged 55- 59 years) Factors negat ively influencing the program Respondents' perceptions of the importance of factors negatively influencing coverage and impact of the National HPV V accination Program are shown in Table 18. The negative factors perceived as 'very important' were unreturned consent forms (47.3%); school absenteeism (46.8%); concerns about HPV vaccine safety (38.0%); concerns about promoting promiscuity or early sexual initiation (31.8%); lack of agreed national HPV vaccine coverage target (26.6%); cultural or religious barri ers (26.4%) ; and social stigma around HPV as an STI (24.6%).

Table 19.

I feel there should be more responsibility on the schools / teachers to assist with the return of consent forms. This totally relies on the school to decide if they want to assist us at the moment. Some schools are great, some are terrible. The ones that have no desire to chase up consent forms have no consequences, return rates are low, vaccination rates are low and it's almost impossible for us to chase up these students\" (female school -based nurse immuniser, age group 55- 59 years) \"90% very high - many girls at this age have needle phobias, parents not quite as vigilant about immunisation with teens as infants\" (fe male practice nurse, age group 45- 54 years) Achievements of the N ational HPV Vaccination Program The majority of respondents were satisfied or very satisfied with the achievements to date of the National HPV V accination Program relating to local and national coverage and disease impacts (refer to Table 20 ).

Successes were reported by 81 of 192 (42.2%) respondents and of these home visits were identified as a successful initiative reported by 16 (19.8%), with the rest recounting initiatives such as ensuring flexible arrangements NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 112 of 262 while engaging with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Overall, stakeholders perceived that the 2 -dose schedule has been better than the 3 -dose one, reported a favourable outcome of the HPV vaccination program in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and perceived that the program was actually better than in the mainstream population. \"As with anything, we generally get good results from all of these areas and if we don't it is not because of the type of 'group' they are classified in, it is because of the individual family. We also utilise Aboriginal Liaison Officers for those families who are very chaotic\" (female school -based nurse immuniser, age group 45- 54 years) \"Aboriginal people strongly support vaccination and we need to recognise and build on this strength\" (female GP, age group 45- 54 years) Building relationships with the Abor iginal and Torres Strait Islander people was reported to be a key factor leading to the success of the program. \"I work a lot with Indigenous populations and have found that it's all about building relationships with these populations.... I also work off overdue lists that for some reason the students have fallen through the cracks.... There is a lot of work chasing parents and students outside of the running of the program\" (male school -based nurse immuniser, age group 45- 54 years) Of the 192 respondents who provided a response to the question on challenges of HPV vaccination, 174 (90.6%) identified a challenge in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations. Returning the consent form was the most important challenge reported, by 40 of 174 (23%) respondents, followed by absenteeism (15.5% [27/174]), language barrier (10.9% [19/174]), lack of awareness (9.2% [16/174]), loss to follow up (4% [7/174]), frequent change of contact details (4% [7/174]) and fear factor, including needle phobia (2.3% [4/174]). A range of diverse reasons were reported by 31% (54/174) of respondents, including issues of weather, sorry business and the need for extensive follow -up work. \"It is always harder to get consent forms returned for these young people and when we do get consents returned, these are the students who are often absent on the immunisation day. It is often a challenge to follow these students up successfully.\" (female school -based nurse immuniser, age group 55- 59 years) Despite these challenges, 16 of 81 (19.8%) stakeholders reported improvement in immunisation coverage. \"Our Indigenous girls are in boarding school - it takes some time and effort to ensure consent forms are returned (the school nurse is responsible for this) but we have achieved close to 100%\" (fe male school -based nurse immuniser, age group 45- 54 years) \"Indigenous girls [sic] very accepting of vaccination.......Only one mother has said that vaccine causes many health problems and refused her daughter's vaccination.\" (female GP, age group 55- 59 years) NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 113 of 262 Summary/discussion The key stakeholder interviews and online survey provided many valuable perspectives on the National HPV V accination Program from stakeholders involved at all levels of the program, from immunisation providers to national government representatives. The findings provide valuable insights into what is currently working well and the perceived barriers to enhancing outcomes and impacts of the program in Australia, along with recommendations to overcome these barriers. The change to a 2- dose schedule of 9vHPV vaccine was well received and had many benefits for jurisdictions, providers and the public. However, the major challenges included reduced opportunities for school -based catch- up vaccinations and the 6- 12 months dosing interval leading to dose 2 given late in the school year when absenteeism is higher , which have led to a disappointing perceived impact of the change on coverage compared to what had been broadly anticipated. The major barriers to achieving higher coverage in the school -based vaccination program were largely identified as reliance on return of paper consent forms and absenteeism. Identified enablers to improve consent form return include school immunisation teams having access to parent contact details and resources to conduct follow up of unreturned forms; appropriate consent forms and information available for population subgroups with different languages and levels of literacy; increased education for students to increase understanding and encoura ge their participation in the consent form process; and supportive school staff who engage with students and assist with ensuring consent form return. While almost all key stakeholders believe that electronic consent forms would assist with consent form return, only two jurisdictions have been able to progress to developing this technology to date. Catch -up vaccination remains essential, given the challenge of school absenteeism. School -based catch -up is generally more convenient for families and leads to m easurable increases in HPV vaccination coverage, but is conducted by inconsistent methods across providers and not conducted at all in some jurisdictions. Increased resources to improve capacity to provide school -based catch -up vaccination across the count ry would likely be beneficial. Where available, free council immunisation clinics were generally considered a more effective alternative method of catch -up vaccination than reliance on visiting a GP. Various enablers of and challenges to HPV vaccination were identified in population subgroups at risk of lower coverage, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and CALD populations. Participants outlined many initiatives currently in development or those that were implemented across Australia in the last 5 years to increase HPV vaccination coverage in these population subgroups. This suggests concerted efforts are underway in Australia to increase the equity of the HPV vaccination program and its impacts across different population groups. A common them e among stakeholders was that the identification of people within these subgroups can be a challenge and hence, assessing the effectiveness of these initiatives is likely to be a challenge too. NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 114 of 262 Regarding vaccine safety, in keeping with strong evidence from the literature, key stakeholders reported no concerns about HPV vaccine safety. Continued education on the proven safety and efficacy of HPV vaccines and rationale for vaccination at a young age were thought to possibly assist with improving vaccine coverage among the relatively small group of parents known to be hesitant about HPV vaccine. Most key stakeholders perceive vaccine hesitancy to be having little negative impact on HPV vaccination coverage in Australia. However, the potential for vaccine- hesit ant views to spread rapidly on social media and need to maintain vigilance and monitor public attitudes towards HPV vaccination were highlighted. Almost all stakeholders believed that Australia could achieve the WHO cervical cancer elimination target of 9 0% course completion for females aged 15 years by 2030, but that increase in effort, support for the program and development of strategies were required to achieve this. Many recommendations were suggested by stakeholders to increase HPV vaccination covera ge, which largely relat ed to improved processes for consent form return, increased education, stronger messaging around the benefits of vaccination, improved vaccination reporting and quality of data reports available and strategies to improve vaccination coverage in key population subgroups. Some stakeholders also suggested reducing the schedule to a single dose, which would assist Australia in achieving the WHO coverage target. Emerging evidence indicates that a single dose schedule is effective; however , the evidence will require further monitoring to inform future decisions. The opportunity for enhanced collaboration between the N ational HPV V accination Program and the C ervical Screening Program was also highlighted by many stakeholders in the wake of t he transition to HPV -based cervical screening. This transition presents an opportunity for the relationship between the two programs to be improved to facilitate enhanced outcomes for both programs and a greater impact on cervical cancer prevention in Aust ralia. Limitations of the key stakeholder interview approach include that while some responses were based on the results of data or research findings known to the participant, many were anecdotal and the findings should be interpreted as such. In addition, given there is such a large degree of variation within Australia in the HPV vaccination program delivery, opinions provided from a national or jurisdictional perspective may not accurately reflect the processes and factors influencing the program in all r egions. NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 115 of 262 Vaccination coverage Aims To compare cumulative HPV vaccination coverage estimates in eligible birth cohorts calculated using the National HPV Vaccination Program Register ( the HPV Register) numerator data and the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Estimated Resident Population (ERP) denominator data with HPV vaccination coverage estimates calculated using the Australian Immunisation Register (AIR) data.

Methods AIR and the HPV Register The Australian Childhood Immunisation Register (ACIR) was established in 1996 by incorporating Medica re data on all children aged < 7 years.136 On 1 January 2016, the ACIR expanded to include all individuals aged up to 20 years, and then on 30 September 2016 expanded further to become the whole- of-life AIR. 137,138 All people registered with Medicare, Austr alia's universal healthcare system, are automatically added to AIR. Participation in AIR is 'opt -out' and so constitutes a nearly complete population register for Australian residents.136 Individuals not enrolled in Medicare can NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 116 of 262 also be added to AIR via a supplementary number. Since 2001, vaccinations given overseas may be recorded if a provider endorses their validity. Data are transferred to AIR when a recognised immunisation provider supplies details of an eligible vaccination. This could occur either vi a medical practice management software or through direct data entry on the AIR website or by submitting paper encounter or history forms. The HPV Register was established in 2008 by the VCS Foundation under contract with the Australian Government Departme nt of Health to capture HPV vaccination encounters administered as part of the National HPV Vaccination Program. With the expansion of the ACIR to AIR, all data held in the HPV Register were transferred to AIR in late 2018. All HPV vaccinations given throu gh school -based programs, as well as any HPV vaccinations given by other immunisation providers, are now reported directly to AIR. Historical estimates of HPV coverage - comparison between HPV Register and AIR estimates The last published vaccination coverage estimates from the HPV Register were for the cohort of adolescents aged 12- 19 years as at 30 June 2017.33 We compared cumulative HPV vaccination coverage estimates for each vaccine dose calculated using data from the HPV Register with coverage est imates calculated using AIR data. The HPV Register coverage estimates were calculated for female and male adolescents by year of age using the number of adolescents in each age group with a record on the HPV Register of a vaccine received by 30 June 2018 as the numerator and ABS ERP by Single Year of Age139 data as at 30 June 2017 as the denominator. These estimates were compared with AIR data coverage estimates calculated for female and male adolescents by year of age using the number of adolescents in eac h age group with an AIR record of a HPV vaccination received by 30 June 2018 as the numerator and the number of Medicare- registered adolescents in each age group as at 30 June 2017 as the denominator. Assessing current cumulative HPV vaccination coverage AIR data, as at 29 February 2020, was downloaded from the Services Australia Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) portal and vaccine encounters up to 31 December 2019 were included to assess current cumulative HPV vaccination coverage estimates. This allowed for a 2 -month lag period for late notification of HPV vaccinations to AIR. Eligible year -wide birth cohorts for female and male adolescents aged 12 to <20 years as at 31 December 2019 were used to assess cumulative HPV vaccination coverage. The proport ion of adolescents vaccinated was calculated using the number of adolescents in each cohort with a record of a HPV vaccine encounter between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2019 as the numerator and the number of Medicare- registered adolescents in each cohort as the denominator. Cumulative coverage was assessed separately for each dose of HPV vaccine by gender, state /territory of residence, remoteness of area of residence (see details of methods below), SES (see details of methods below) and Aboriginal and T orres Strait Islander status (see details of methods below). NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 117 of 262 Assessing trends in HPV vaccination coverage at 15 years The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends assessing coverage at 15 years of age for the purpose of international comparison over t ime. As HPV vaccination in Australia is delivered routinely in early high school, usually around the age of 12- 13 years, all adolescents have had the opportunity to complete the vaccination course by age 15 years. AIR data, as at 29 February 2020, with vac cine encounters up to 31 December 2019, were used to assess trends in HPV vaccination coverage between 2016 and 2019 for females and males aged 15 years. HPV vaccination coverage was calculated using the number of 15- year-olds recorded on AIR to have recei ved dose 1, dose 2 and/or dose 3 of the HPV vaccine as the numerator and the total number of Medicare- registered adolescents in the cohort of 15 years in the year of interest as the denominator. HPV vaccination coverage estimates at 15 years of age were calculated separately for doses 1, 2 and 3 by gender, state/territory of residence and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status. It is important to note that in 2019 the majority of adolescents in New South Wales (NSW, which introduced the 2 -dose schedul e in 2017), South Australia (SA) and Western Australia (WA) had transitioned to the 2 -dose schedule, which had been implemented in 2018, while the majority of adolescents in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) , Victoria (VIC) , Queensland (QLD) , Tasmania (TAS) and the Northern Territory (NT) were still on the 3- dose schedule. Assessing uptake of 9vHPV vaccine in adolescents aged <15 years Using AIR data as at 29 February 2020, the number of HPV vaccination encounters was determined for the 2018 and 2019 calendar years by gender and state/territory of residence for adolescents aged <15 years. The proportion of these HPV vaccines that were recorded as 9vHPV vaccine was then calculated. The age distribution of adolescents receiving the first dose of 9vHPV vaccine was calculated by gender and state/territory of residence. Of the adolescents aged <15 years with 9vHPV vaccine dose 1 recorded on AIR in 2018, the proportion who also received dose 2 by 31 December 2019 was calculated by gender, state/territory of r esidence, remoteness/ SES of area of residence and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status. The number of dose 1 and dose 2 9vHPV vaccinations recorded each month throughout 2018 and 2019 was also determined for those commencing the 2 -dose schedule in 2018 by gender and state/territory of residence, as was the interval (length of time) between dose 1 and dose 2. Vaccination encounters for 9vHPV dose 1 and dose 2 in 2018 and 2019 were also analysed by provider type in each state/territory for both female and male adolescents. Assessing uptake of HPV vaccine in adolescents aged 15 to <20 years Using AIR data as at 29 February 2020, the number of HPV vaccination encounters recorded on AIR as administered to adolescents aged 15 to <20 years between 1 July 2017 and 31 December 2018 was determined by gender and state/territory of residence for each immunisation provider type and for dose 1, dose 2 and dose 3 separately. NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 118 of 262 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people r epresent approximately 3.3% of the Australian population,140 and status on AIR is recorded as 'Indigenous', 'non- Indigenous' or 'unknown', as reported by the child's parent/carer to Medicare, the young person themselves to Medicare (if 14 years or older) or by the immunisation provider to AIR. The 0.4% of children whose Indigenous status was not specified were classified as non -Indigenous for the purposes of this analysis. When comparing the historical HPV Register data with the AIR data, it should be noted that although the HPV Register collected Indigenous status, this was not a mandatory field, as per the underlying legislation, and was collected directly from consent forms. Data improved markedly over time, but no national estimates were possible. 43,141 Remoteness of area of residence Area of residence Index of Australia (ARIA++).142 For analysis in this report, we combined the two 'Regional' categories ('Inner Regional' and 'Outer Regional') into one the two 'Remote' categories ('Remote' and 'Very Remote') into one category. The ARIA Accessibility/Remoteness category was assigned for each individual using their recorded postcode of residence on AIR. Socioeconomic status To assess vaccination coverage by SES, we used ABS Socio- Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) Index of Education and Occupation.143 The SEIFA index category in deciles (with decile one the most disadvantaged) was assigned for each individual using their recorded postcode of residence on AIR. Results Cumulative HPV vaccination coverage - comparison between HPV Register and AIR estimates Vaccination coverage estimates using the HPV Register data for all doses were universally higher than the AIR estimates for females aged 13- 18 years (range 0.3- 3.4%) and males aged 13- 17 years (range 0.8- 3.2%) ( refer to Tables 21 and 22 ). This is a consequence of the larger Medicare enrolment population denominator in each of these birth cohorts. For 19 -year-old females and 18- 19-year-old males, the Medicare enrolment population denominator is lower than the ABS ERP denominator, and the coverage estimates for each dose are higher using AIR data. In females and males aged 13 years, the higher number of doses in AIR than in the HPV Register may reflect the inclusion of doses given in general practice in 2017 and 2018 that were reported directly to AIR. The lower dose numbers recorded in AIR for 16- 19-year-old females and males could possibly relate to either a greater ability of AIR to de -duplicate notifications using Medicare numbers and NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 119 of 262 enrolment history in this age group or possibly to limitations in AIR's ability to match notifications held by the HPV Register in this age gr oup to Medicare enrolments (meaning the notification is excluded) as Medicare number was not a mandatory field in the HPV Register notifications.

NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 124 of 262 Current cumulative HPV vaccine coverage (based on age at 31 December 2019) Estimated current HPV vaccination coverage, based on AIR data, is shown in Table 23 and Figures 8-11. Coverage in females remains several percentage points higher than in males. Consistent with the HPV Register estimates,43 dose 1 coverage is roughly equivalent for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and non- Indigenous adolescents, except for 13- 14-year-old Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander males who have 4- 5% lower dose 1 coverage than their non- Indigenous peers. Also consistent with the HPV Register estimates, coverage for doses 2 and 3 (lower course completion) is lower in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adolescents. In 2018, the HPV vaccination program changed from a 3 -dose schedule to a 2 -dose schedule. Table 23 shows 2- dose coverage in the 15- year-old cohort, which was the first cohort to include adolescents vaccinated with two doses of 9vHPV vaccine, was 82.6% in females and 79.9% in males. Compared with the birth cohort 1 year older who received 3 doses, coverage of dose 2 in this younger cohort lies between dose 2 and dose 3 coverage of the older cohort (Figures 8 and 9 ). This is likely due to the advantage of needing only two doses somewhat offset by the longer interval between the doses.

Table 24 shows that there is < 10% variation in dose 1 coverage by age 15 years across the jurisdictions (female range 83.4% in Q LD to 89.0% in ACT; male range 81.0% in Q LD to 87.4% in NT). Greater variation (close to 10%) is seen for the final dose (female range 77.7% in T AS to 86.5% i n ACT; male range 75.5% in T AS to 84.1% in ACT). Much greater variation by jurisdiction was apparent for coverage in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adolescents (refer to Table 25). Table 26 suggests minimal difference in dose 1 coverage by remotenes s of area of residence but lower coverage for the final dose in remote areas. Similar findings are apparent for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adolescents by remoteness of area of residence (refer to Table 27 ). As shown in Table 28, there was little difference by SES of area of residence for dose 1 coverage in females at age 15 years (<2% variation) but a slightly larger difference in final dose coverage (5% difference between lowest and highest SES). Among males there was a larger gradient by SES at age 15 years for both dose 1 coverage (5% difference) and final dose coverage (almost 10%).

As noted previously, use of AIR denominator data results in lower coverage estimates than historic HPV Register data as seen for the 2016 and 2017 15- year-old cohorts. However, trends over time are si milar, with dose 1 coverage rising over time (which could be due to a real increase and/or incremental increases in each cohort's denominator per year since vaccination) and dose 3 coverage increasing through 2018. These changes over time apply to both Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adolescents. Dose 2 coverage in 2019 has declined in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander female and male adolescents relative to the previous year (2018). Tables 30 and 31 show that most 15- year-olds in the 2019 coho rt in NSW, SA and WA had already transitioned to the 2-dose schedule because of the earlier implementation of the 2 -dose schedule in NSW and the average age of school -based HPV vaccination in SA and WA (more students in this cohort in those states not vacc inated with dose 1 until 2018).

NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 146 of 262 Uptake of 9vHPV vaccine in adolescents aged <15 years In 2018 9vHPV vaccine replaced 4vHPV vaccine. Stocks of 4vHPV vaccine continued to be used to complete courses initiated with that vaccine and until replacement stock of 9vHPV vaccine was available. Some 4vHPV vaccine stocks were redirected to support immu nisation of men who have sex with men ( MSM) in some jurisdictions. Therefore in 2018 a mix of HPV vaccine types were in use. By 2019 all HPV vaccine supplies in Australia should have been of 9vHPV vaccine, with no further distribution of 4vHPV vaccine. Dat a reported in Table 32 may reflect actual HPV vaccine type administered or reporting error by providers more familiar with 4vHPV vaccine. Figures 1 4 and 15 indicate variation in the routine age for immunisation with HPV vaccine by jurisdiction, which depends on school programs and the routine school year level of administration as well as other access through primary care programs.

Course completion refers to receipt of the second dose of 9vHPV vaccine only among those adolescents who received dose 1 . It is the refore a different measure from population coverage and requires different interpretation. Tables 33 and 34 highlight that whil e the majority of vaccination courses are completed in the same calendar year/school year in which they are initiated, a considerable amount of vaccination occur s in the following year (7.2% increase in course completion for females and 7.7% for males nationally). Estimation of coverage or course completion restricted to that achieved within the same calendar year will under estimate population level uptake/coverage achieved. This also emphasi ses the rationale for measuring vaccination coverage at age 15 years , allowing time for follow- up public health activities, such as regist er reminders, to reach those who still need to co mplete the course. The largest increase in course completion by jurisdiction between the end of 2018 and 2019 for courses started in 2018 was in NT (20.3% for females and 19.0% for males). Course completion increased most in remote areas and increases were seen across all SES deciles. For Aboriginal and Torres Islander adolescents ( refer to Table 34 ), the extra year provided large increases in course completion (17.2% increase in females and 17.9% in males) , with particularly notable increases in NT and in remote areas. 12.810.218.5 VIC QLD SA Jurisdiction9-<12yrs 12-<13yrs 13-<14yrs i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 149 of 262 Table 33.

Source: Australian Immunisation Register, data as at 29 February 2020. Summary/discussion Current cumulative HPV vaccine coverage (based on age at 31 December 2019) is broadly consistent with historical data trends from previous coverage derived from the HPV Register. The 15-year-old cohort in 2019, the first cohort that included some adolescents vaccinated with two doses of 9vHPV vaccine, shows 2- dose coverage of 82.6% in females and 79.9% in males. Coverage remains several percentage points higher in females than in males. Consistent with the NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 163 of 262 HPV Register estimates,43 first dose coverage is roughly equivalent for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and non- Indigenous adolescents, except in 13- 14-year-old Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander males who have 4- 5% lower dose 1 coverage than their non -Indigenous peers. Also consistent with the HPV Register data, there is a lower coverage for second and third doses (lower course completion) for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adolescents. HPV vaccine coverage at 15 years of age increased over time to 2018, in both Aboriginal and Torres Strai t Islander and non- Indigenous adolescents. In 2019, dose 2 coverage declined in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander female and male adolescents relative to the previous year. Dose 2 and dose 3 coverage in 2019 shows that most adolescents in NSW, SA and W A had transitioned to the 2- dose schedule because of the earlier implementation of the 2 -dose schedule in NSW and the age of vaccination in SA and WA. Adolescents aged 15 to <20 years received their 9vHPV vaccine doses predominantly in general practice in all jurisdictions except NT where community health and Aboriginal Health Services provided the majority of HPV vaccines. The overall comparison between the HPV Register and AIR estimates shows that the HPV Register vaccination coverage estimates for all d oses are universally higher than the AIR estimates for females aged 13- 18 years and males aged 13- 17 years. However, for females aged 19 years and males aged 18- 19 years, the coverage estimates for each dose are higher using the AIR data. The last published cohort for coverage estimates from the HPV Register was for adolescents aged 12-19 years in 2017, with data as notified to mid- 2018. Notably by this time WA had ceased reporting to the HPV Register directly and the HPV Register was receiving large number s of notifications from AIR, many of which duplicated state -based notifications. Best efforts were made to identify and remove such duplicates but because of missing data or data quality issues, this was not always possible. The differences in ABS ERP and Medicare denominator estimates in Tables 21 and 22 are notable and require a wider discussion regarding the interpretation/differences in the population captured in either denominator. In each of the 13- and 14- year-old cohor ts in 2017, Medicare denominator data included over 10,000 more individuals than ERP data. This is in direct contrast to an earlier study assessing the impacts on HPV vaccine coverage of the two alternative denominators, which found that in 2007 there was only a minor difference of <250 individuals in these younger age groups and that it was older adolescents where there was the greatest discrepancy. 15 Estimation and monitoring of HPV vaccination coverage poses several challenges different from those for m onitoring coverage of childhood vaccines. Unlike vaccines given in early childhood, there is no necessity to give the HPV vaccine at an exact scheduled age and the recommended age for the routine delivery of HPV vaccine (in Australia 12- 13 years) reflects both the local median age of sexual debut (HPV vaccine effectiveness greatest if given before then) and the practicalities/method of administration in our setting (in the early high school vaccine program). In the school -based HPV vaccination programs, not all children are offered HPV vaccine at the same age, with children in one year level with a range of ages (typically the first or second year of high school) in each state usually offered vaccination per year. This makes measuring vaccination coverage by age or birth cohort at a state or national level problematic compared with that for NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 164 of 262 childhood age scheduled vaccines because not all children aged 12 or 13 would have been offered the vaccine or would have had the time required to be offered the second dose. Recognising this challenge, and the varying ages at which countries routinely administer HPV vaccines, WHO recommends vaccination coverage achieved in each birth cohort by age 15 as a metric that will allow comparison of coverage between countries and over time.144 However, this metric is too lagged to identify any drop in coverage or program issues in a timely way, making monitoring of coverage with the best available program data enumerating the targeted school -based cohort in each area important. Ac cording to the HPV Register coverage estimates, 3 -dose coverage in those aged 15 years has gradually improved over time in Australia and had reached 80% for females and 76% for males by 2017. Monitoring of HPV vaccination coverage in birth cohorts of adult women is likely to be of high interest in future, because cervical screening practices may become dependent on vaccination status once those vaccinated with 9vHPV vaccine reach 25 years of age (the age at which screening starts). When extracting data for such cohorts from AIR in future, it is to be expected that apparent coverage will have fallen markedly from that estimated originally at age 15 years in the same cohort because of the ongoing increase in the Medicare- eligible denominator population as a result of migration. NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 165 of 262 Vaccine safety Aims To evaluate vaccine safety issues relating to HPV vaccines. Therapeutic Goods Administration Adverse Events Management System data The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) Adverse Events Management System ( AEM S) is a spontaneous surveillance system for monitoring adverse events associated with the use of a medicine or vaccine. Vaccine adverse event reports received by the TGA are entered into AEMS.145 Information recorded in the database includes the adverse ev ent(s), the vaccine(s) involved and other relevant information provided by the reporter, such as relevant medical history, laboratory results and how the adverse event was treated.145 We analysed data on adverse events following 4vHPV vaccine doses admini stered between April 2007 and December 2017, reported by March 2018. AusVaxSafety AusVaxSafety is an enhanced active surveillance system for adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) coordinated by NCIRS and funded by the Australian Government Department of Health.146 AusVaxSafety monitors the safety of vaccines through sentinel active SMS -based surveillance.146 Vaccine recipients (or their caregivers) are sent an SMS in the days following vaccination and asked whether any adverse events were experienc ed. If an adverse event is reported, additional SMS are sent asking whether medical attention was sought for the adverse event and providing a link to an online survey for more details. Signal detection methods are employed to monitor for any safety signal s. AusVaxSafety data were reviewed and summarised from two surveillance systems, SmartVax (for the overall surveillance period 1 February 2018 - 31 December 2019) and Vaxtracker (for the period 15 October 2019 - 7 November 2019). Methods AEMS We focused on determining age- and sex -specific AEFI reporting rates, analysed the impact of enhanced surveillance and examined adverse events of special interest (AESI). NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 166 of 262 Study population and surveillance system characteristics Australia has a population of approximately 25 million, and over nine million doses of HPV vaccine were administered between 2007 and 2017, according to the National HPV Vaccination Program Register (HPV Register). The majority of doses were given through the school -based vaccination program (94% for males, 69% for females overall and 92% for females once early community catch -up programs ceased). Pharmaceutical companies (Australian sponsors) are required to report adverse events to the TGA within mandated timeframes. However, anyone c an voluntarily report a suspected adverse event to the TGA, including immunisation providers, consumers and parents. In most jurisdictions (comprising eight states and territories) that have responsibility for administering school -based vaccination program s, adverse event reporting is a statutory obligation for healthcare providers and predominantly occurs via state/ territory vaccine safety surveillance mechanisms.147 Reporters are requested to provide patient identifiers, including date of birth or age, details of the product involved and the suspected adverse event , including dates. The reporter is also able to provide contact details, if consent is provided, to enable communication to seek additional information, if required. Reports are coded by the TGA using the internationally recognised Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA\u00ae) standardised terms, including preferred terms, 148 and stored in the AEMS database. Australian sponsors are required to apply seriousness coding to ensure legislated requirements are met. Other reports are coded (typically on initial receipt) as 'serious' based on criteria similar to the World Health Organization (WHO) definition 149 and available information, where any of the following outcomes are documented: death; inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing significant disability; life -threatening; or congenital anomaly/birth defect. Any event that requires medical intervention to prevent one of these outcomes (a medically important event or reaction) may also be considered as serious. The TGA identifies and reviews medically important cases, which are flagged for review by the TGA clinical staff. Where a 'serious' adverse event report lacks information, TGA routinely requests follow -up information from the reporter with assistance from the relevant state or territory health department, including medical record information where required; however, this may not always be provided. Using the TGA AEMS database, we analysed advers e event following 4vHPV vaccine doses administered between 1 April 2007 and 31 December 2017 for females, and between 1 February 2013 and 31 December 2017 for males, and reported by March 2018 to allow for reporting lag. Reports following nonavalent (9vHPV ) or bivalent (2vHPV) HPV vaccines were excluded. 9vHPV vaccine was not available until 1 January 2018 after which it was added to the National Immunisation Program ( NIP), replacing 4vHPV vaccine. The bivalent vaccine was not supplied under the NIP and thus only administered to a small number of women within primary care over the study period. Where no vaccine type was specified, reports were included and presumed to be related to 4vHPV vaccine. Reports following vaccination during pregnancy were identified using methods described previously. 150 For reports that were missing vaccination date, the date of reaction onset was used (the median lag time between vaccination date and reaction onset date was 0 days in this cohort). Where the NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 167 of 262 reaction onset date was missing, the vaccination date was replaced with the date the report was received minus 15 days (the median lag time from vaccination to report in this cohort). Vaccination date was only used to determine annual rates and changes in rates over time. For description of individual AESI, additional free text data was used to review time between vaccination and reaction onset. Where multiple 4vHPV doses were recorded within one report, the date of latest vaccination was used. Descriptive analysis Adverse event reports were described for males and females by age group, reporter type, concomitant vaccination and seriousness code. We identified the top 10 most commonly reported MedDRA Preferred Terms by sex. Crude adverse event reporting rates per 100,000 doses administered were calculated across the entire program, with age- and sex -specific adverse event rates calculated for the NIP cohorts ( refer to Table 39). Rates for females and males in the primary target cohort were analysed separately during t he enhanced surveillance period. Doses administered by vaccine type, age, sex and time period were obtained from the National HPV Vaccination Program Register (HPV Register) . Table 39. NIP-funded age groups, vaccination program type and year of program delivery for 4vHPV vaccine in Australia, 2007 to 2017 Program delivery type NIP-funded a ge group Year of program delivery Primary Program Female 12 to 13- years 2007 to 2017 Male 2013 to 2017 Catch -up program Female 14 to 26- years 2007 to 2009 Male 14 to 15- years 2013 to 2014 Adverse events of s pecial interest Adverse events of special interest (AESI ) were determined by reviewing literature151-153 and from recent analyses of the United States (US) Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS).154 The following conditions were selected: (POTS), complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) and Guillain- Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS). To allow comparison with international data, MedDRA Preferred Terms were selected in VAERS analyses154 (refer to Appendix 8) with the exception of GBS, where the term 'chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy' (CIDP) was added (CIPD is considered a chronic form of GBS).155 These MedDRA terms were used as a sensitive search for potentially relevant cases, which were then further reviewed to determine whether cases met published criteria for the specific condition. De-identified cases were obtained, where available, from the TGA for all AESI except syncope. TGA case details included those obtained during investigation of the adverse event . Reports of NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 168 of 262 anaphylaxis had been classified according to Brighton Collaboration criteria by the TGA on the basis of available data.156 Signal detection methods were not applied in this retrospective analysis; this is undertaken continuously and prospectively by the TGA. AusVaxSafety Data collection Participant -reported adverse event data were obtained via two surveillance tools, SmartVax and Vaxtracker, installed at sentinel sites across Australia. As at February 2020, SmartVax was installed at over 325 GP, hospital, counc il, community clinic and Aboriginal Medical Service (AMS) sites, and several of the council sites using SmartVax also deliver school -based immunisations. Vaxtracker was used for HPV vaccine safety surveillance in school -based immunisation programs delivered by five public health units in NSW only. Both tools automatically send an SMS message to a vaccinated adolescent's caregiver that enquired about AEFI. For SmartVax users, this initial SMS (SMS1) state d: \"We would like to know if there were any reactions to the vax. Please reply with 'Y' for Yes, 'N' for No or 'STOP' to opt out.\" Caregivers who responded 'Y' to SMS1 received a second SMS message (SMS2) that asked, \"As a result of the vaccination reaction, did you visit a doctor, medical centre, after hou rs service, or hospital emergency dept [sic]?\" These caregivers also received an additional SMS message that contained a link to a short online survey where the caregiver could report specific solicited and unsolicited adverse events and details of medical attention sought. Caregivers of adolescents vaccinated at Vaxtracker sites received only one SMS that contained a link to an online survey. In this survey, caregivers were asked: \"Did [your child] experience any kind of reaction, illness or discomfort aft er the vaccination?\" If caregivers responded 'Yes', further questions appear ed that sought details about specific solicited adverse events and also whether medical attention was sought for the reaction. Participants could unsubscribe after enrolling/clicking on the survey link. De-identified, line- listed data containing demographic, vaccination and SMS/survey response information were obtained from both the SmartVax and Vaxtracker tools by the NCIRS for cleaning and analys is. Surveillance design and study population AusVaxSafety active HPV vaccine safety surveillance commenced on 1 February 2018. The HPV vaccine funded under the NIP from this time was the 9 -valent Gardasil brand, but residual 4- valent Gardasil was also avai lable for the third dose in catch- up programs. At this time, only SmartVax collected HPV vaccine safety data for AusVaxSafety. NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 169 of 262 Vaxtracker was implemented to collect HPV vaccine safety data for school -based immunisation programs in NSW in late 2019, and contributed data only for school term 4 (October -November) in 2019. HPV vaccine safety data were analysed for the overall surveillance period 1 February 2018 - 31 December 2019 for SmartVax, and 15 October 2019 - 7 November 2019 for Vaxtracker. Inclusion criteria were as follows: adolescent aged 11- 14 years adolescent received an HPV vaccine (including 2 -valent Cervarix, 4- valent Gardasil, 9 -valent Gardasil, or HPV with brand unspecified) at a sentinel SmartVax or Vaxtracker site (including schools whose vaccinations were delivered by SmartVax or Vaxtracker sites) caregiver responded within 7 days post vaccination to an SMS message and/or survey enquiring about their adolescent's adverse events following immunisation. Definitions A report of any AEFI was defined as responding 'Y' to SMS1 for SmartVax or 'Yes' to the survey question asking about any reactions for Vaxtracker. A participant was defined as an adolescent whose caregiver participated by responding 'Y' or 'N' to SMS1 for SmartVax, or 'Yes' or 'No' to the survey question asking about any reactions for Vaxtracker. A caregiver was considered to have participated if they responded to SMS1 or the Vaxtracker survey. Participants may have had multiple vaccination encounters during the surveillance period, and may not represent unique individuals. For SmartVax, note that not all caregivers who reported any adverse event responded to SMS2 and/or the online survey; these participants have been included in calculations involving SMS1, but excluded from calculations involving SMS2 and/or the survey. A report of medical attendance (MA) was defined as responding 'Y' to SMS2 for SmartVax, or indicating presentation to a general practice (GP) or an emergency department (ED) in the online survey question: \"A s a result of your reaction, did you visit, or were you visited by, any of the following: GP/medical centre, after hours/locum, ED?\" For Vaxtracker, an MA report was defined as responding to the medical attention question (\"Did you seek medical attention f or the reaction?\") in the online survey. Data analysis Data were cleaned and analysed using Stata version 14.2. Figures were prepared in Microsoft Excel 2010. Analyses performed included a descriptive analysis of participant demographic information (age, sex, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status and location), adverse events reported and MAs reported. Surveillance captured vaccination encounters from a wide range of settings where multiple vaccines were often given at the same visit (e.g. HPV and dTpa vaccines, which are scheduled NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 170 of 262 together in school -based immunisation programs). For SmartVax data, analyses were stratified according to whether adolescents received only HPV vaccine, only HPV and dTpa vaccines, or HPV and other vaccines (e.g. influenz a vaccine). Note that an encounter where an adolescent received HPV, dTpa and another vaccine (e.g. influenza vaccine) w as included in 'HPV and other vaccine(s)' group. Multiple HPV vaccine brands (Gardasil9, Gardasil and Cervarix) were available during the surveillance period and we assumed that vaccine brands were given as recorded. Data were not validated, and therefore, data entry errors (e.g. mis -recorded brands) were possible. Unsolicited AEFI reported via free text were manually reviewed and classifi ed to MedDRA\u00ae (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities) version 21.0 preferred terms using MedDRA Desktop Browser\u00a9 version beta 4.0.0.97. Statistical analyses Pearson's chi -square test was performed to compare the rates of any adverse event and MA by sex, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status, additional vaccine status and brand (SmartVax only), except in the case with cell counts <5, in which Fisher's exact test was performed. These analyses were performed using Stata version 14.2. A p -value o f less than 0.05 was considered significant Results Adverse Events Management System (AEMS) For 4vHPV vaccine doses given between 1 April 2007 and 31 December 2017, the TGA received 4,556 adverse event reports up to 31 March 2018. Five reports for males were excluded from the main analysis (three for males vaccinated before the 2013 NIP expansion and two for male infants whose mothers were vaccinated) . During the entire study period, 4,402 doses of 2vHPV vaccine were administered in Australia, with 18 adver se event reported; these reports were not further examined. Most reports were for the primary NIP -funded cohort (12 - to 13 -year-old males and females) and the most common reporters were the respective state and territory health departments, reflecting established pathways for reporting to the TGA (refer to Table 40). The most commonly reported MedDRA Preferred Terms were similar among males and females, with headache and syncope the most common (refer to Table 41). Table 40.

Most reports (92.2%) were not coded as serious in AEMS (refer to Table 40 ). Of the 354 repor ts that were coded as serious, all met at least one criterion of the WHO definition for a serious adverse event ; most (n = 224) were coded as serious due to the criterion 'caused or prolonged hospitali sation'. The proportion of reports coded as serious changed over the study period, with the NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 172 of 262 highest proportion for females in 2009 (13.9%) and 2017 (13.2%), and the lowest proportion during the enhanced surveillance period (3.9% for females and 2.7% for males) (data not shown). Adverse event reporting rates in target cohorts Between 1 April 2007 and 31 December 2017, almost 9.4 million doses of 4vHPV vaccine were recorded by the HPV Register in Australia, with an overall adverse event reporting rate of 48.5 per 100,000 doses administered across all age groups and 3.8 reports per 100,000 doses coded as serious. One hundred and two reports had either missing age, sex or both and were not included in age- and sex - specific AE rates. Vaccination date was missing in five per cent of cases (n = 243) and was substitut ed with reaction onset date for calculation of annual rates. The reporting rate among primary and catch- up NIP cohorts (refer to Table 39) was 39.8 per 100,000 doses, excluding the enhanced surveillance period (2013- 2014) when adverse event reporting rates were higher overall (72.3 per 100,000 doses). During the enhanced surveillance period, the rate was notably lower among older males (14 to 15 years) than in younger males and females (39.1 compared with 88.4 per 100 000 doses) (refer to Figure 20, Appendix 9). Following the conclusion of enhanced surveillance, reporting rates for females aged 12- 13 years were maintained at slightly higher levels than those before 2013. Figure 20: Rates of adverse events following 4vHPV vaccine given to females (2007 to 2017) and males (2013 to 2017), reported by year; before, during and after an enhanced surveillance period (2013 to 2014) 020406080100120140 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017Rate per 100 000 doses administered Year Females 12-13 Males 12-13 Females 14-17 Females 18-26 Males 14-15 NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 173 of 262 Pregnancy reports Thirteen of the 4,556 reports (including 3,221 reports for females and two for infant m ales) were identified as occurring during or following pregnancy. Four of the 13 reports identified spontaneous abortion and one was a report of preterm labor. There were four reports of vaccination in pregnancy that specified the adverse event as one of various infant congenital anomalies. Three of these reports involved individuals who did not yet know they were pregnant when they received the vaccine, and the fourth report did not contain enough narrative detail to determine this information. There was one report of eczema in an infant following administration of 4vHPV vaccine to the infant's mother during pregnancy. Other medical conditions were noted in data contained in these reports. No adverse outcomes were reported for the remaining pregnancy repor ts. Adverse events of special interest Of pre -defined AESI, syncope (as a composite measure defined by the Terms 'syncope', to Appendix 8]) was the most commonly reported (refer to Table 4 2). One death was reported with the cause stated as being cervical cancer years following HPV vaccination as an adult; the information provided in the report (which was based on a press article) was insufficient to determine causality.

Preferred terms that may relate to seizures ('seizure', assigned in a subset of reports coded with ' loss of consciousness' (n = 15) and a small proportion of reports coded as 'syncope' (n = 23). There were 14 reports coded with both 'syncope' and injury (including Preferred Terms 'concussion', 'contusion' and 'head injury') of which 13 were on the same day as vaccination. Over half of syncope cases (n = 453) were reported during the enhanced surveillance period. During the enhanced surveillance period, the rate of reported syncope in the primary target cohort (12- to 13 -year-old males and females) was 29. 6 per 100 ,000 doses administered, over four -fold higher than the rate during the remaining study period for this same age group (7.1 per 100,000 doses) and around three times higher than the rate in 14- to 15 -year-old males during enhanced surveillance (10.7 per 100, 000 doses) (refer to Figure 21 and Appendix 10). Rates decreased in 2014, following a peak in 2013 (from 47.1 to 13.9 per 100,000 doses in the primary target cohort).

Of the 24 cases that had reaction onset date and vaccination date documented, all occurred on the day of vaccination; six reported concomitant administration of another vaccine (DTPa, h epatitis B and/or influenza vaccines). The median age was 14 years; of the 28 cases where sex was reported, 26 were females. Over one third of the total cases of anaphylaxis (n = 11) were reported in 2007. Low annual numbers were reported following 2007 (one to four cases per year), including during the enhanced surveillance period. The rate over the entire program was 0.32 per 100,000 doses administered and 0.26 per 100,000 doses during the enhanced surveillance period (refer to Table 42 ). Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome Four cases were reported as Guillain -Barr\u00e9 syndrome ( GBS) and confirmed by a specialist during hospital admission; one GBS diagnosis was subsequently reclassified to chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) and one additional case of CIDP was reported. All four GBS cases (three femal es and one male; median age 13 years) were reported to have had undergone nerve conduction studies as part of the diagnostic workup. Two of the four cases were reported to have had evidence of an antecedent illness (viral infection, mycoplasma infection) and one reported concomitant vaccination with dTpa vaccine. Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and other postural dizziness Of 13 cases identified using the MedDRA Preferred Terms 'postural orthostatic or 'postural reflex impairment', most (n = 11) were in females. Six had been coded with the Preferred Term 'dizziness postural', of which five were self - limiting and occurred at the time of, or shortly after, vaccination; three had also received concomi tant vaccination (hepatitis B, DTPa and/or influenza vaccine). For the remaining seven cases coded with the MedDRA Preferred Term 'postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome', all were reported from 2015 and there was insufficient information on symptoms, heart rate, blood pressure, investigations and/or duration of illness to establish a diagnosis of POTS according to published criteria. 157 Three cases were reported as being treated for orthostatic intolerance; two cases were reported to have also been dia gnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Reaction onset dates were varied, but where documented, ranged from 6 months to over 1 year following vaccination. Autoimmune disease All 13 reports of autoimmune disease (AID) were in females; the median age at vaccination was 15 years. Three had documented pre- existing AID and reported escalation in symptoms following 4vHPV vaccination. Of the remaining new onset cases, conditions reported included arthritis, NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 176 of 262 systemic sclerosis (coded with the preferred term 'autoimmune disorder') and non -specific diagnoses. There was no pattern regarding time of onset following vaccination, which was r eported in seven cases and varied from 1 week to 3 months. Primary ovarian insufficiency Of 12 reports of primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) identified using the MedDRA Preferred disorder' and 'amenorrhea' (refer to Appendix 8), three were published previously in an Australian case series.158 Of the remaining cases, none had sufficient information to confirm a diagnosis and two had other generalised symptoms. Among the 12 cases, the median age at vaccination was 16 years; where documented, amenorrhea was reported to have occurred at variable times following vaccination. Complex regional pain syndrome All of the four reported cases of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) were in females with a median age of 14 years and occurred in the individual's vaccinated arm. Three of the cases were also identified in a case series from a jurisdictional surveillance system159 and were considered confirmed based on the clinical review. The remaining case was reported to have been diagnosed with CRPS by a pediatrician; there was a history of injury to the hand before vaccination. Venous thromboembolism The three cases of venous thromboembolism (VTE) were in females with a median age of 19 years; two were documented to be taking the oral contraceptive pill and confirmed to have thrombophilia. AusVaxSafety Overall results During the period 1 February 2018 - 31 December 2019, AusVaxSafety sentinel surveillance captured 73,627 HPV vaccination encounters in adolescents aged 11- 14 years using SmartVax and Vaxtracker. The majority of encounters (91.1%) were captured by the SmartVax tool, which included individuals vaccinated at 269 national sentinel sites. The Vaxtracker encounters were all in NSW and captured via the state's school -based i mmunisation program. Of the 73,627 vaccination encounters, the caregivers of 42,067 (57.1%) adolescents participated by responding to SmartVax's SMS1 or the Vaxtracker survey. Of these, 3,690 (8.8%) reported any adverse event and 235 (0.6%) reported seeking medical attention for an adverse event . The caregivers for 114 adolescents provided details about their child's reported medical attendance; of these, 106 (88.6%) presented to a GP and 13 (11.4%) to an ED. NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 177 of 262 SmartVax During the period 1 February 2018 - 31 December 2019, AusVaxSafety sentinel surveillance captured 67,155 SmartVax HPV vaccination encounters in adolescents aged 11- 14 years. Caregivers participated by responding to SMS1 following 39,359 (58.6%) of these vaccination encounters. Demographic summary - SmartVax the 39,359 adolescents, 27,884 (2.8%) were Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander. Information regarding sex and Indigenous status was not available for seven adolescents (0.02%) and 11,475 adolescents (29.2%), respectively. The median age of the adolescents was 12 years, with a range of 11- 14 years. Most adolescents (94%) were vaccinated in W A or QLD (refer to Table 43), which had 77 and 68 sentinel sites, respectively. A large proportion of vaccinations captured in these states and Victoria were delivered in schools. In other states (ACT, NSW, NT, SA and TAS), vaccinations were only captured outside the school setting (e.g. at general pr actices). Table 43.

The 4vHPV vaccine brand was received most often in the beginning of the surveillance period (refer to Figure 23) in catch -up programs at general practices (refer to Figure 2 4). Few adolescents (n = 3) received the 2vHPV vaccine, and for 254 adolescents the HPV vaccine type was not specified (refer to Table 44). Table 44.

Other vaccines In addition to HPV vaccine, 17,599 adolescents (44.7%) received another vaccine or vaccines. Of these, the majority received one additional vaccine (n=17,233; 97.9%), while 296 (1.7%) received two additional vaccines, and 70 (0.4%) received three or more additional vaccines. The most common additional vaccine was dTpa vaccine, which was received by 43.7% of adolescents (refer to Table 45). Table 45.

Adverse events Any adverse event Following vaccination, caregivers of 3,453 adolescents (8.8%) reported any adverse event. The rates of any adverse event were similar by Indigenous status (p=0.59). Caregivers of female adolescents reported any adverse event slightly more often than caregi vers of male adolescents (9.1% versus 8.5%; p=0.04). Caregivers of adolescents who received vaccine(s) in addition to HPV vaccine (including dTpa and/or other vaccine(s)) reported any adverse event more often than caregivers of adolescents who received onl y HPV vaccine (10.1% versus 7.7%; p<0.001). The rates of any adverse event by vaccine group are given in Table 46. Among participants who received HPV vaccine only, caregivers of adolescents who received 9vHPV vaccine reported any adverse event more often (1,658/21,330; 7.8%) than caregivers of adolescents who received 4vHPV vaccine (9/230; 3.9%; p=0.03).

Solicited adverse events The most common solicited adverse events reported were injection site reactions, headache and tiredness (refer to Figure 2 5). NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 182 of 262 The caregivers of nine adolescents reported altered level of consciousness ('non- responsiveness/loss of consciousness') following HPV vaccination, and the caregivers of three adolescents reported seizure following HPV vaccination.

The most commonly reported unsolicited adverse events were nausea (n=87; 19.4% of unsolicited AEFI reports), dizziness (n=23; 5.1%). All other uns olicited adverse events are detailed in the Appendix 11. Medical attendances The caregivers of 227 adolescents reported MA for an adverse event (N= 38,850; 0.6%). MA rates were similar by sex (p=0.70), Indigenous status (p=0.32) and additional vaccine stat us (p=0.07; Table 10). Rates were also similar by vaccine type (4vHPVvaccine or 9vHPV vaccine) among adolescents who received HPV vaccine alone (Fisher's p=1.0). Table 48.

The caregivers of 132 of these adolescents (58.1%) provided further details by responding to the online survey. The AEFI profile was similar for children whose caregivers reported MA compared with children whose caregivers did not report MA (refer to Figure 2 6).

Caregivers of 2,708 (41.8%) adolescents participated in surveillance. NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 185 of 262 Demographic summary Of the 2,708 adolescents, 1,178 (43.5%) were female; 1,530 were male (56.5%); and 64 of 2,708 (2.4%) were Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander. The median age of the adolescents was 13 years, with a range of 12 -14 years. All Vaxtracker participants were vaccinated in NSW as part of school -based HPV immunisation programs. The majority (74.8%) were vaccinated in October 2019, with the remainder (25.2%) vaccinated in November 2019. Vaccine details All participants received only the 9vHPV vaccine. For the majority of participants (99.1%), this was recorded as a second dose of HPV vaccine; it was recorded as the first dose of HPV vaccine for 24 participants (0.9%). No information was available regarding additional vaccines, but as dose 2 of the 9vHPV vaccine delivered in NSW schools is typically administer ed alone, it is likely that most participants received only 9vHPV vaccine and no additional vaccines. No additional vaccines were recorded as given to any participant in this cohort. Adverse events Any adverse event Following vaccination, caregivers of 237 adolescents (8.8%) reported any adverse event. The rates of any adverse event were similar by Indigenous status (p=0.128). Caregivers of female adolescents reported any adverse event slightly more often than caregiv ers of male adolescents (10.0% versus 7.8%; p=0.04). Solicited adverse events The most common solicited adverse events reported were injection site reactions, headache and tiredness (refer to Figure 2 7). There was one reported case of altered level of consciousness. The caregiver of a 12 -year-old male reported that he experienced pain at the injection site and fainted after the injection was administered.

NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 187 of 262 Figure 28: Number and percentage of solicited adverse events reported by medical attendances following HPV vaccination (n = 8) ALOC : altered level of consciousness; IS: injection site Summary/discussion This review of 11 years of post -marketing vaccine safety surveillance data from Australia's spontaneous adverse event reporting system AEMS and nearly 2 years of active surveillance data from AusVaxSafety has provided valuable information on HPV vaccine sa fety. While the overall adverse event reporting rate from AEMS (48.5 per 100,000 doses administered)160 was higher than the rate of reporting to the US VAERS (32.7 per 100,000 doses distributed),154 this was because of higher reporting rates during the enhanced surveillance period. Excluding the enhanced surveillance period, the reporting rate (39.8 per 100,000 doses) among all funded primary and catch- up cohorts was similar to that of VAERS and is robust due to the use of denominator data obtained from the HPV Register on doses administered. Reporting rates were maintained at slightly higher levels following the enhanced surveillance period which likely reflects continued improvements in the reporting system and the commensurate increased awareness of and reporting of adverse events , as has been seen for other NIP vaccines over time.161 While the increase in reporting during the enhanced surveillance period may suggest underreporting at other NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 188 of 262 times, the higher proportion of reports that were non- serious dur ing enhanced surveillance, as a result of instructions to nurses to report simple syncope, is reassuring. Syncope was notable as the adverse event detected at an increased rate during the period of enhanced nurse -led school -based surveillance. For the composite outcome of 'syncope' (including the MedDRA preferred terms 'syncope', 'syncope vasovagal' and 'loss of consciousness'), nearly half of all reported cases occurred during the 2 -year enhanced surveillance period, and the rate was over four times higher among both females and males in the primary target cohort during this time than in the periods of routine surveillance. Inclusion of data from this enhanced surveillance period likely explains why the overall rate of syncope in this study was nearly doubl e the rate reported by VAERS in 2018 using the same preferred terms. 154 Analysis of enhanced surveillance data also revealed that syncope was about three times as likely to occur in younger adolescents (aged 12 to 13 years) than in older males (14 to 15 years), as noted in a preliminary report by the TGA.162 However, syncope rates in 12 - to 13 -year-old females were similar to those in males of the same age. This suggests an age -related relationship with this well -recognised immunisation stress -related react ion that has not previously been noted in population- level post -marketing surveillance, to our knowledge. These comprehensive data on syncope in both sexes of young adolescent vaccine recipients during the enhanced surveillance period allowed for a greate r awareness of this condition among immunisation program staff. As a result , these staff then ensured management protocols were in place to mitigate syncope and prevent syncope- induced injury. The proportion of reports of syncope associated with a preferred term indicating injury was low in this study. Similarly, the TGA review of the enhanced surveillance period identified very few syncopal episodes resulting in injury or requiring further medical review, such that a decision was made not to request school -based reporting of simple syncopal events in the second year of enhanced surveillance. 162 Syncope can create concern among vaccine recipients and/or carers and lead to negative perceptions of vaccination. However, in many instances, it is preventable or t he risk of injury minimised. It is important that immunisation providers are aware of the frequency at which this can occur, particularly in younger adolescents, to avoid unduly negative outcomes.163 The rate of anaphylaxis was higher in our study than the rate reported to VAERS (0.32 per 100,000 doses administered compared with 0.06 per 100,000 doses administered for VAERS),154 but was similar to previously reported rates from Australia (0.32 per 100,000),83 Canada (0.3 per 100,000)164 and Europe (0.22 per 100,000).165 This was likely due to high awareness and reporting of anaphylaxis following initial signal investigation early in the HPV vaccination program in Australia.166 In this context, it was considered possible that there was a reduced threshold for using adrenaline and that syncope cases were more likely to meet the Brighton Collaboration criteria for anaphylaxis where anaphylaxis code was based on the treatment given. The reporting rate for anaphylaxis was not elevated during the enhanced surveillance period, during which it was a specified condition, which further supported our impression that anaphylaxis is rare after HPV vaccination, occurring in fewer than 1 in 300,000 young adolescent 4vHPV vaccine recipients. We selected a number of other AESI to analyse in detail. Notably, while many reports were not confirmed to meet diagnostic criteria for the various conditions, reporting rates were nonetheless NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 189 of 262 low and comparable with rates using similar surveillance methods.154 Spontaneous reporting system s like AEMS have specific characteristics, including incomplete and selective reporting, which means it is almost never possible to conclusively determine causality for an individual case on the basis of available data. The absence of detailed clinical dat a, despite requests initiated by the TGA, made it difficult to assess a causal relationship to vaccination for the reports in this study. Importantly, these conditions occur at a background rate in the population, irrespective of vaccination, 167 although data on local and age -specific prevalence and incidence are variably available.82 Only four cases of GBS were reported following immunisation with Gardasil (4vHPV), two of which had documented infection prior to disease onset, during the entire 11 -year surv eillance period. The incidence of acute flaccid paralysis in Australia (of which GBS is the diagnosis in almost half of cases) has been estimated to be 0.8 per 100,000 children aged <15 years. 168 An early possible signal for GBS following HPV vaccine was i dentified and investigated in the U S169 but was not confirmed in analyses of either VAERS154 or the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD).152,1 70 While a cohort study in France suggested an elevated hazard ratio for GBS in vaccinated versus unvaccinated females,171 a UK self -controlled case series subsequently found no evidence of an increased risk in the 3 months following vaccination,172 and a Canadian study did not identify any increased risk of GBS -related hospitalisation in HPV -target cohorts.173 Evidence from our analysis is consistent with these studies in suggesting no increase in GBS in association with the introduction of HPV vaccination. Adverse events identified using the search criteria that may suggest POTS, a syndrome of orthostatic intolerance assoc iated with an increase in heart rate in the absence of orthostatic hypotension that is associated with light -headedness, palpitations and weakness, 157 were reported at a low rate in our study, similar to that from two analyses of US VAERS data (0.11 and 0. 16 per 100,000 doses distributed, respectively).154,17 4 Many of the adverse events in our study described simple postural dizziness on the day of vaccination; for those reported as POTS specifically, it was not possible to establish a diagnosis of POTS acc ording to published criteria in any case. While some published reports have suggested an association between POTS and HPV vaccination,151 neither the W HO's Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS)175 nor the American Autonomic Society found evidence to support a causal association.176 Although the prevalence of POTS in Australia is not well described, globally it is estimated to affect 0.2% of the population, supporting the observation of low rates in our cohort.157 POTS is a heterogeneous condit ion that is prevalent in the same population that receives HPV vaccine (adolescents and females), and symptoms can overlap with other syndromes that occur in adolescence, such as fatigue syndromes. 176 No association between HPV vaccination and increased ri sk of fatigue syndromes has been identified in epidemiological studies.177,178 We found insufficient clinical information to confirm the diagnosis of POTS in any of the cases identified using this search strategy. Similarly, in a recent study based on VAE RS data, only 29.5% (n=29) of reports (using the preferred terms that we also used in our study) met POTS diagnostic criteria, and a pre- existing medical condition was documented in 20 cases, including five cases of CFS. 174 Most reports in our study were m ade after 2015, which may reflect the responsiveness of spontaneous reporting systems to media interest and public concern; clusters of non -specific NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 190 of 262 symptoms attributed to POTS and CFS were reported in Denmark and increased following heightened media repor ting in 2013 and 2015.179 Concern arising from causal attribution given to such temporal associations has led to declines in vaccine uptake in some countries,180,18 1 resulting in lost opportunities to prevent cervical and other cancers. Of the other AESI e xamined, no vaccine safety signals were identified. Although disease flare in individuals with pre- existing AID was reported in three cases, clinical trials have not identified any difference in the risk of disease flare between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals with pre - existing AID.151 New-onset AID was reported rarely, with no consistent pattern and variable syndromes reported. Similarly, large population- based studies have not demonstrated any increased risk of new -onset AID following 4vHPV vaccin e.182,183 The rate of complex regional pain syndrome was similar to that reported from the US (0.28 per million doses distributed).154 The reported rate of POI was low with lack of clinical and diagnostic data, similar to that in a recent population- based epidemiological study which found no significant risk of POI following 4vHPV vaccine (HR 0.30; 95% CI: 0.07- 1.36) .184 This lack of significant risk of POI associated with HPV vaccine was further supported by a 2017 statement issued by the GACVS declaring t here was no evidence of a causal association between HPV vaccine and POI.175 The rate of VTE in our study, based on just three cases, was comparable to the rate reported to VAERS;154 recent evidence183,185 has not supported any increased risk of VTE follow ing the early safety signal identified in VAERS data.186 While HPV vaccines are not recommended for use in pregnancy, data from spontaneous reporting systems as well as registries have not identified fetal loss or congenital anomalies above background rate s or any concerning pattern of fetal loss following 4vHPV vaccine;150,151,18 7 our study findings supports this conclusion. In 2017, the GACVS concluded that inadvertent administration of 4vHPV during pregnancy has not been shown to be associated with adverse outcomes. 175 AusVaxSafety also captured post -licensure surveillance data, especially in school -delivered vaccination settings in 2018- 2019. AusVaxSafety data showed that more AEFI were reported when HPV vaccine was given with other vaccine(s), than HPV alone, but this did not affect the medical attendance rates (proxy for more s erious adverse events) and rates overall were low . It was noted that caregivers of female children reported slightly more AEFI than caregivers of male children. Furthermore there were more AEFI post 9vHPV vaccine than 4vHPV vaccine when HPV vaccine was giv en alone, but 4vHPV vaccine numbers were much smaller than 9vHPV vaccine numbers and caution should be taken in interpreting these data. There are several limitations in our vaccine safety evaluation. A limitation of the AEMS data is interpretation of the seriousness code for reported adverse event which, while included for completeness, is primarily used as a guide for sponsor reporting. Although multiple attempts are made to obtain additional information from the reporter, coding may not be based on revi ew of detailed and verified clinical data in every case and may not capture all medically important events. 188 These limitations should be considered in interpreting the code and it should not be considered definitive of the seriousness of the event. As it is not necessarily applied based on review of detailed and verified clinical data, and may not capture all medically important events, NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 191 of 262 reporting rates of serious adverse event are unlikely to be robust. Identification of potential AESI was limited by the search terms selected, which may not have captured all potentially relevant cases. Review of individual AESI was limited by the case details provided by the reporter during investigation; despite multiple attempts, sufficient detail is not always obtained. Our study is also subject to the inherent limitations of spontaneous reporting systems, including incomplete and selective reporting. While essential for signal detection and hypothesis generation (which is undertaken prospectively by the TGA and may lead to investigation and regulatory action), spontaneous reporting systems do not allow comparison to rates in unvaccinated populations; epidemiological studies are required to explore a potential association. 189 The use of national vaccine registry data as a denominator for doses administered may slightly underestimate total doses because of under -notification from predominantly catch- up vaccination delivered by primary care practices, which may have modestly inflated rate estimates. In conclusion, the data r eported here are consistent with an overall high level of safety of HPV vaccines since their inclusion in the NIP schedule. Over the evaluation period, reporting rates of adverse events following HPV vaccine administration in Australia were consistent with data from similar surveillance systems internationally and did not reveal any new or concerning safety issues. However, during a period of enhanced surveillance implemented to monitor introduction of the vaccine to adolescent males in addition to females, syncope was noted to occur at a higher rate in younger adolescents than previously observed. AESI, except for syncope (a common adverse event), were reported rarely and no new or concerning patterns were identified. This comprehensive analysis further contributes to the large body of existing data affirming the safe post-marketing profile of the HPV vaccine in both males and females and the value and characteristics of long- term spontaneous reporting systems in monitoring vaccine safety. NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 192 of 262 Impact on disease burden: Cervical abnormalities and tumours Aims To assess the impact of the HPV vaccination program, that commenced in 2007, on the epidemiology of disease outcomes, including cervical high-grade abnormalities (HGA), HPV - associated cancers and recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP). Specific objectives To detect any significant changes in incidence and hospitalisation rates due to each disease outcome, between the pre- and post -vaccine periods, with stratification by age group (based on eligibility f or the vaccine program), gender, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status and jurisdiction. Methods In our analysis , we used an ecological design with 'before and after' comparisons. Section 1 of this report describes the impact of the HPV vaccination program on HPV -associated disease burden using published literature. This chapter contains HPV vaccination impact assessment based on primary analyses of relevant data from several data sources. The following are the data sources used for cervical abnormalities, associated cancers and RRP: Reports and data published by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) 2004- 2017, including incidence rates of HGA (defined as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN] 2 and 3 or adenocarcinoma in situ [AIS ]) detected by histology, incidence rates for cancers of the cervix and mortality rates of cervical cancer.190, 19 1 Incidence data of cancers (anus, penis, vagina, vulva, oral cavity, oropharynx and larynx) hospitalisation datasets 2002- 2017 for hospital separations containing International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision, Australian Modification (ICD- 10-AM) and the Australian Classific ation of Health Interventions (ACHI) coded diagnoses for each condition or disease as listed in Table 49. For anal, vaginal, vulval and penile disease both cancers and high- grade intraepithelial lesions (i.e. grade 3 precancerous lesions, coded as carcinom a in situ) were included. Note that there is no specific ICD code for RRP and codes to which hospitalisations due to the disease are likely to be mapped are used as proxies to indicate probable RRP. Principal diagnosis was used in the analysis for HGA and cancers. Cause of death dataset 2006- 2017 using underlying cause of death for the selected diseases and conditions listed in Table 49. Death data were obtained from the Cause of Death Unit NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 193 of 262 Record File (COD URF) from the Australian Coordinating Registry (AC R). The Queensland Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages (RBDM) is the ACR for COD URF data. The ACR coordinates the approval and release of COD URF files on behalf of the data custodians - Australian Registrars of Births, Deaths and Marriages (RBDM), S tate/Chief Coroners and the National Coronial Information System (NCIS). Since 1997, ICD -10 has been used to identify the cause of death. Data were tabulated and examined by gender, age group (<20; 20- 24; 25 -29; 30 years), Aboriginal and Torres Strait Is lander status and jurisdiction, where applicable. For each disease outcome incidence rates and rate ratios (RR), pre- to post -vaccine introduction with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and p values, were calculated. Rates were presented, where relevant, as either per 1,000 females screened or per 100,000 females, males or population using Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) census data as the denominator (June 2019, 3101.0 Australian Demographic Statistics, Tables 59- 51). Statistical tests for trends were us ed to evaluate changes from before HPV vaccination program introduction (2002- 2007) to after (2008- 2017). Where the year of hospital admission was not available (11,382/857,211, 1.3%), the separation year was used as a proxy. Subgroup analysis by Aborig inal and Torres Strait Islander status was undertaken to assess whether vaccine impact on disease burden is equitable. Of note, because of the incompleteness of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status reporting on pathology forms, cervical screening program outcomes are not reported by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status. The time periods for which different data elements were available across the data sources varied. For AIHW datasets the relevant time periods were: HGA incidence 2004 - June 2017, cervical cancer incidence by age group 2000- 2015, cervical cancer incidence by state and territory 2010- 2014, cervical cancer mortality 2000- 2017, anogenital, oropharynx, larynx and oral cavity cancer incidence 2002- 2016.

However, cervical HGA incidence rate increased by 5% and 13% in females aged 25- 29 years and 30 years, respectively. There was a progressive decline in the proportion of cervical HGA that was diagnosed in individuals aged <30 years, from 53% in 2004- 2006 to 50% in 2007- 2012 and then to 41% in 2013 - June 2017. The overall age -standardised cervical HGA rate declined from 8.4 per 1,000 females screened in 2007 to 5.8 per 1,000 females screened in the first half of 2017. The cervical HGA incidence rate in women aged 35 years gradually increased over the time period.

A small but significant increase was noted among women aged 30 years. In Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander females aged <25 years, the cervical HGA hospitalisation rates declined over the same period by 58% and 14% in the age groups of <20 and 20- 24 years, respectively, which were eligible for v accination. Conversely there were concomitant increases in cervical HGA hospitalisation rates in older Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander females of 11% and 15% in the age groups of 25- 29 years and 30 years, respectively.

The number of new cases and incidence rates for anogenital cancers and oropharyngeal cancers were very small in both pre- and post -vaccine periods for those aged <30 years, hence any observed changes in these age groups are likely due to chance. Hospitalisation rates also fluctuated during these periods. Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis The hospitalisation rate for probable RRP ( as principal diagnosis or procedure code) in females decreased in those aged <20 years (3.1 to 2.4 per 100,000) and increased in those aged 30 years (3.9 to 5.7 per 100,000) from pre - to post -vaccine period (refer to Table 53) . The rate in males decreased in those aged <30 years (4.2 to 2.7 per 100,000) and increased in those aged 30 years (11.5 to 13.0 per 100,000) from pre - to post -vaccine period. Probable RRP hospitalisation rates were low in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations, with only 123 male and 104 female hospitalisations in the 16- year study period. Note that the diagnosis code D14.1 was found to be highly sensitive (97.7%) fo r RRP admissions and had a high positive predictive value (98.1%) in children in a NSW study. 132 D14.1 made up the majority of cases in these data (97.8%). However, none of these codes have been validated in adults who may have multiple hospitalisations/tr eatments with RRP. Other causes of benign disease at these sites in adults or children may utilise these codes.

Cervical pre -cancerous HGA have significantly declined in females age- eligible for HPV vaccine, although in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander females this decline has only been observed in females aged <25 years to date (unlike in non- Indigenous females in whom declines are now also being observed in females ag ed 25- 29 years). In older cohorts with lower levels of vaccination coverage there have been significant increases in HGA over time, continuing pre -vaccine trends. The decline in HGA incidence by age group is consistent with expected trends by vaccine- eligible cohort as they age, with a decline in incidence evident from 2009 in women aged 20- 24 years and from 2014 in those aged 25- 34 years. No decline was observed in women aged >35 years who were not eligible for funded HPV vaccine either through the school -based or community catch -up programs. The declining trend in all -age HGA incidence was observed across all Australian states and territories. Data linkage studies have shown that fully vaccinated females in 2007- 2014 had lower rates of HGA compared with unvaccinated females of the same age, a trend that was consistent across jurisdictions, remoteness and socioeconomic areas.195 The rate of HGA in the pre-vaccine cohort was significantly higher than in unvaccinated females in the post -vaccine cohort, indicat ing herd benefit effect.195 In addition, a recent Australian study showed that one dose of the HPV vaccine had comparable effectiveness as two or three doses in preventing HGA in a high coverage setting.196 Also, a comparison with a historical cohort of ag e-matched women showed that the result was not due to herd protection alone.196 In Australia, incidence rates of cervical cancer in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women aged 20-69 years were more than double that of their non- Indigenous counterparts . 190 A previous study found that of the 101 cervical cancers diagnosed in fully HPV -vaccinated females in Australia between 2007 and 2012,99 occurred in females estimated (based on age, date of vaccination and date of commencing screening) to have been exposed to HPV before vaccination and the other two were cancers not caused by HPV.195 As expected, the all -age cervical cancer incidence rate has not declined since the vaccine introduction, although the mortality rate has declined in this period in those a ged over 30 years (who were not vaccine- eligible).190 The age -standardised mortality rate of cervical cancer in females decreased from 5.2 to an estimated 1.8 per 100,000 females between 1982 and 2019.190 This decrease was greatest in women aged 20- 69 years (targeted screening age group), in whom the mortality rates (per 100,000 women) were 5.5 in 1982 and 1.7 in 2015 and is likely to be attributable to cervical screening. 190 NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 201 of 262 Our findings show that cervical cancer hospitalisation rates were lower in the post -vaccine period than in the pre- vaccine period in Australian females aged 30 years, among both the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and non- Indigenous populations. In Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander females, the lower rate of cervical cancer hospitalisations in the post -vaccine period was seen also in the younger age group (25- 29 years). Note that interpretation of hospitalisation data needs to take into account that there could be multiple hospitalisations per patient for use of inpatient and outpatient services over time. These reductions seen in cervical cancer hospitalisations and mortality without a similar decline in the overall cervical cancer incidence may be a reflection of the reduction in severity of cervical cancer in cases and ea rlier detection and effective treatments. The Northern Territory (NT) had the highest cervical cancer incidence rate overall.190 This disparity may be due to the greater proportion of the population that are of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander origin, given that they currently bear a disproportionate burden of cervical cancer.190 Remoteness also affects cervical cancer incidence, with a higher rate in 'remote and very remote' locations than in 'major cities'. 190 A study that used data from the New South Wales (NSW) Cancer Registry from 2001 to 2014 found that incidence rates in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women were significantly higher than in non- Indigenous women in all 10- year age groups from 30 to 79 years.197 Linked cervical screening and hospitalisation data showed that in 2010- 2011, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women in Queensland who attended screening had a significantly higher prevalence of cytological low - and high -grade abnormalities and histologically confirmed high- grade abnormalities than non -Indigenous women.112 A study exploring factors associated with cervical cancer in women in N ew South Wales , the NT, QLD , VIC, SA and W A reported that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women with cervical cancer were more likely to have associated comorbidities, including congestive heart failure, chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes and moderate- severe kidney disease. 198 The survival rate for cervical cancer was lower in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women between 2003- 2007 and 2008- 2012.198 HPV has been estimated to cause 85% of anal cancers, 50% of penile cancers, 70% of vaginal cancer, 40% of vulval cancer and 35% of mouth and oropharyngeal cancers. 199 The transition from 4vHPV va ccine to 9vHPV vaccine in Australia has been predicted to prevent a further 15% of cervical cancers and 11% of anal cancers.200 However, this proposed reduction in cancer incidence is not expected to be evident possibly for decades, given the difference in the mean age of disease diagnosis of these cancers and the current age of fully vaccinated adults.200 A more recently identified impact of the N ational HPV V accination Program is the significant reduction in juvenile- onset RRP (JoRRP), a condition associated with vertical transmission of HPV infection before or during birth, particularly type 6 or 11.12,132,133 Our estimated hospitalisation rates (given there is no unique ICD code for RRP and no validation of these codes has been undertaken in adults) foll ow the expected pattern that JoRRP predominantly affects children aged <12 years and adult -onset RRP (AoRRP) predominantly affects adults aged 20- 30 years and >60 years. Since the introduction of the HPV vaccination program, hospitalisation rates for probable RRP (i.e. ICD codes likely to be associated with RRP) have decreased in females aged <20 years and males aged <30 years, while ICD codes likely to be associated with RRP in adults increased in NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 202 of 262 both males and females aged 30 years. This declining incidence in JoRRP supports reduced mother -child HPV transmission and Australia was the first globally to document this impact of a 4vHPV vaccination program on JoRRP.201 Previous studies have demonstrated declines in prevalence of 4vHPV vaccine genotypes, and also potential herd protection in the older unvaccinated age groups.50,94,95, 96,98, 202,203,204 The decrease in prevalence of HPV infection following vaccination among Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander females was only observed in those aged <25 years but the prevalence of HPV infection remains higher than in non- Indigenous females in each age group. 100 The decline in prevalence of 4vHPV vaccine genotypes in males in the younger age groups is supported by prevalence and serosurveillance studies in Australia. 101,102,103,104 In conclusion, we found significant reductions in cervical high- grade lesions and also in probable RRP that may be attributable to the female and male HPV immunisation programs in Australia. NCIRS i mpact evaluation of Australian national human papillomavirus vaccination program Page 203 of 262 Impact on disease burden: Genita l warts Aims To estimate the hospitalisation rates for anogenital warts by gender, age, jurisdiction and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status, and to assess changes in hospitalisation rates for anogenital warts following introduction of the HPV vac cination program in Australia. Methods We used data from the National Hospital Morbidity Database of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) for this analysis . Data included age, gender and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status of hosp italised patients and hospital diagnoses coded using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Australian Modification; (ICD -10-AM). The population estimates used as denominators for rate calculations were obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (cat no. 3101.0, release date 19 March 2020). All AIHW hospitalisation data that included ICD -10-AM code A63.0 ('anogenital warts') as the principal or any of the additional diagnoses, for the years 2003- 2017, were included. Most genital warts do not result in hospitalisation and these data represent the most severe cases. Some individuals could have multiple episodes of treatment which cannot be identified as belonging to a single individual in these data. Hospitalisation rates were calculated per 100,000 people on the basis of total hospital admissions over a relevant 12 -month period and the corresponding mid- year resident population estimate. Hospitalisations were stratified by sex and by age group (<10 years, 10- 19 year s, 20 -29 years, 30- 39 years and 40 years). Complete data for both numerators and denominators for all Australian states and territories, and for both Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and non- Indigenous populations, were available for the period 2003- 2017. Average annual hospitalisation rates in the pre -vaccine period of 2003- 2007 were compared with those in two post -vaccine periods: 2008- 2013 and 2014- 2017. Results Between 2003 and 2017, a total of 40,612 hospitalisations that had a diagnosis of anogenital warts (ICD- 10-AM code A 63.0) were identified across Australia. Of those hospitalisations 22,924 (56.4%) were in females and 17,688 (43.6%) in males. There were 960 (1.2%) hospitalisations in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people: 679 (70.7%) in females and 281 (29.3%) in males. Overall, there was a gradual decline in anogenital warts hospitalisations across the study period in both females and males. This decline was more pronounced in females (refer to Figure 3 1).

There was no significant change in the rates in <10 years and 40 years age groups. The greatest reduction in rate was in the 10- 19 years age group followed by 20- 29 and 30- 39 years. Annual average hospitalisation rates per 100,000 population for anogenital warts in the age groups 10- 19 years, 20- 29 years and 30-39 years in the pre- vaccine period (2003- 2007) were 16.9, 49.6 and 23.6, and these rates decreased to 4.3, 22.8 and 18.4 in the post -vaccine period, equating to declines of 74.4%, 54.1% and 22.1%, respectively. Hospitalisation rates decreased further in the 2014- 2017 period, compared w ith the 2008 -2017 period, to 1.5, 10.6 and 13.6 per 100,000 population in the age groups 10- 19 years, 20- 29 years and 30- 39 years, respectively, equating to further declines of 65.5%, 53.2% and 25.8%, respectively.

Annual average hospitalisation rates in the 10- 19 years and 20 -29 years age groups declined from 31.7 and 70.1 per 100,000 population in pre -vaccine period (2003- 2007) to 6.3 and 26.3 in the post -vaccine period (2008- 2013), equating to a reduction of 80.3% and 62.5%, respectively. Rates in the 2014- 2017 period declined t o 1.6 and 8.0 per 100,000 population in the 10- 19 and 20-29 years age groups, respectively, equating to a further 74.0% and 69.5% decline compared with the 2008- 2013 period. In males, annual hospitalisation rates in the years 2003- 2013 (corresponding to t he period before the commencement of the male HPV vaccination program) were 2.6 and 24.1 per 100,000 population in the 10- 19 years and 20- 29 years age groups, respectively. These rates decreased by 48.0% and 45.2% to 1.4 and 13.2 per 100,000 population in the 10- 19 and 20- 29 years age groups, respectively, in the 2014- 2017 period. Hospitalisations by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status In Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, there was a significant decline in hospitalisation rates for anog enital warts from pre - to post -HPV vaccine introduction in the 10- 19 and 20- 29 years age groups (refer to Table 54), in both females and males (refer to Figure 33 and Figure 3 4). However, in the 30- 39 years age group there was a significant increase in hospitalisation rate in the post -vaccine period (2008- 2017) compared with the pre -vaccine period (2003- 2007), and the rate was significantly higher in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people compared with their non-Indigenous counterparts (refer to Tabl e 55). In Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander males aged 10- 19 years and 20- 29 years, hospitalisation rates in the 2003 -2013 period were 1.9 and 9.9 per 100,000 population and these rates decreased by 52.7% and 14.9%, respectively, to 0.9 and 8.4 per 100,000.

There were stati stically significant reductions in the 20-29 years age groups in all jurisdictions and in the 10- 19 years age group in all except the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), where the number of hospitalisations was very small (refer to Table 56). In states with larger populations (i.e. New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland) there were also significant reductions in hospitalisations in the 30- 39 years age group. In the <10 and 40 years age groups there were no significant changes except in Queensland where t here was an increased rate in the 40 years age group in the post -vaccine period (refer to Table 56). Average annual hospitalisation rates per 100,000 population by individual state/territory, age and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status are summar ised in Appendices 15 -22.

Our data are also in concordance with data from Europe and North America where a significant reduction in diagnoses or hospitalisations for genital warts have been noted in age groups eligible for vaccination. 209-211 These declines are believed to be a reliable early marker of disease reduction due to HPV vaccination and associ ated herd protection.212, 213 For the first time in Australian data analyses, we found a significant decrease in hospitalisations for genital warts in the 30- 39 years age group, likely because the earliest vaccinated cohorts are now reaching that age. Howe ver, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people aged 30- 39 years had increased rates of hospitalisations in the post -vaccine period (2008- 2017) than in the pre- vaccine period (RR 2.2; 95% CI: 1.0- 4.6) and were twice as likely to be hospitalised with anog enital warts compared with their non- Indigenous counterparts in both the 2008- 2013 2.0- 5.5) periods. This may be due to lower uptake of vaccination in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people during the adult catch- up program in 2007- 2009 than in non- Indigenous people.34 We did not find any significant change in hospitalisation rates in those aged 40 years, consistent with other studies that noted no significant decreases as yet i n older age groups. 207,214 Our analysis used national data up to 5 years after the extension of HPV vaccination program to males, but has some limitations. We did not include hospital admissions coded as procedures related to genital warts or explore program impact by either socioeconomic or geographic factors beyond state of residence, as we did not have access to postcode -level data. We were unable to assess impact on men who have sex with men (MSM),215 as it was not possible to identify MSM through hospitalisation data.
