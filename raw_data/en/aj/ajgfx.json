It does not contain all the available information. It does not take the place of talking to your doctor or pharmacist. All medicines, including vaccines, have risks and benefits. Your doctor has weighed the risks of you having Vivaxim against the benefits they expect it will have for you. If you have any concerns about this vaccine, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. Keep this leaflet. You may need to read it again. What VIVAXIM is used for Vivaxim is a vaccine used to help prevent typhoid fever and hepatitis A disease in adults aged 16 years and older who are at risk of these diseases. How it works Vivaxim works by causing your body to produce its own protection against typhoid fever and hepatitis A infection. It does this by making substances called antibodies in the blood, which fight the typhoid bacteria and hepatitis A virus. If a vaccinated person comes into contact with the typhoid or hepatitis A organisms, the body is usually ready to destroy them. Your body usually takes two weeks after vaccination to develop protection against typhoid fever and hepatitis A infection. Initial protection is provided by one dose of Vivaxim. For long-lasting protection against hepatitis A virus a booster vaccination with a hepatitis A vaccine will be required 6 to 36 months after vaccination with Vivaxim. The body does not develop long-term protection against typhoid fever and repeat vaccinations are required to maintain protection. Most people will produce enough antibodies against typhoid fever and hepatitis A infection. However, as with all vaccines, 100% protection cannot be guaranteed. The vaccine will not give you typhoid fever or hepatitis A infection. The chance of a severe reaction from Vivaxim is very small, but the risks from not being vaccinated against typhoid fever or hepatitis A infection may be very serious. Before you are given VIVAXIM When you must not be given it You have had a severe reaction to a previous injection of this vaccine. Do not have Vivaxim if you have an allergy to: - Vivaxim or any of the ingredients listed at the end of this leaflet. Symptoms of an allergic reaction may include: - Shortness of breath, wheezing or difficulty breathing - Swelling of the face, lips, tongue or other parts of the body - Skin rash, itching or hives. Do not have Vivaxim if you have a fever or acute illness. Minor infections are not a reason to delay vaccination. Do not give Vivaxim to persons younger than 16 years. The safety and effectiveness of Vivaxim in persons under 16 years have not yet been established. Do not have Vivaxim after the expiry date printed on the pack. Do not have Vivaxim if the packaging is torn or shows signs of tampering. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure whether you should have Vivaxim. Before you are given it Tell your doctor if you have ever had a serious allergic reaction to a vaccine. Tell your doctor if you have an infection or high temperature. Your doctor may decide to delay vaccination until the illness has passed. A mild illness, such as a cold, is not usually a reason to delay vaccination. Tell your doctor if you have, or have had, any medical conditions, especially the following: - Lowered immunity due to diseases such as some blood disorders, malaria, kidney disease requiring dialysis, HIV/AIDS or cancer - Lowered immunity due to treatment with medicines such as corticosteroids, cyclosporin, or other medicines used to treat cancer (including radiation therapy) - Leukaemia or any other cancers of the blood, bone marrow or lymph system. If you have lowered immunity then the vaccine may not work as well as it would in healthy individuals. Tell your doctor if you have allergies to: - Any other medicines - Any other substances, such as foods, preservatives or dyes - Neomycin. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or intend to become pregnant. Vivaxim is not recommended for use during pregnancy. If there is a need to consider Vivaxim during your pregnancy, your doctor will discuss with you the benefits and risks of having it. Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding. Your doctor will discuss the possible risks and benefits of having Vivaxim during breastfeeding. Having other medicines As Vivaxim does not contain any live bacteria or viruses, it can generally be given at the same time as other inactivated vaccines, but at a different injection site. Vivaxim can be given at the same time as yellow fever vaccine at different injection sites. Other medicines should be taken as usual after the vaccination. How VIVAXIM is given Vivaxim is given as a slow injection into the muscle of your upper arm. Vivaxim should not be injected into the veins or into the buttocks. How much is given The dose is one millilitre of the mixed vaccine. When it is given Vivaxim should be given 14 days before you may be exposed to the typhoid fever and hepatitis A. For long term protection against infection with hepatitis A virus you should obtain a booster dose of hepatitis A vaccine 6-36 months after your initial dose of Vivaxim. If you are at ongoing risk of infection with typhoid fever, you should be revaccinated against typhoid fever, every 3 years. After having VIVAXIM Things you must do: - Keep an updated record of your vaccinations - Attend any other appointments made by your doctor or nurse - Report any side effects to your doctor.
