Richmond Waldorf School (RWS) and Waldorf Education Mission Richmond Waldorf School provides a learning environment that promotes independent thinking, cultivates creativity, builds confidence, and develops practical skills. Our proven, holistic approach to education lays the foundation for a life full of meaning and purpose. Vision We embrace every opportunity to develop curious, confident, and capable individuals who can bring forth healthy change in the world. Values We believe that students thrive when exposed to a hands -on, integrated curriculum that is developmentally appropriate and grounded in artistic and practical work. We believe that all students must develop intellectual curiosity, social sensitivity, and physical stamina in order to meet their full potential . We believe that students who are exposed to world cultures through story and sensory experience will become thoughtful, clear -thinking adults who understand and take an interest in the world and its people. We believe in the importance of a safe, inclusive learning environment where the interests and strengths of all students are honored and encouraged. We believe that schools should awaken social responsibility, service to community and stewardship of the earth . We believe that open, clear and direct communication is critical for maintaining a supportive and productive educational community. We believe that effective teachers are committed to building long -term relationships with students, while demonstrating enthusiasm and honest striving in the world. We believe that cooperation and collaboration between parents and teachers play a vital role in helping students meet their full potential. We believe that strong schools rely on initiative and commitment from all members of the community. We believe in the power of the human spirit to invoke positive change in the world. 6 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Richmond Waldorf School welcomes students, families, faculty, staff, and g uests of all races, ethnicities, cultural and religious heritages, socio- economic backgrounds, geographic origins, gender identities, sexual orientations, and family structures. We educate our students to respect the dignity of all people, and we reject d iscrimination in all its forms. We seek to create, embrace, support, and nurture a diverse and inclusive community where everyone feels respected, connected, honored, and valued. The Essentials of Waldorf Education \"We believe that schools should awaken social responsibility, service to community and stewardship of the earth.\" The Whole Child Richmond Waldorf School provides an education that addresses the whole human being body, soul and spirit. In everything we do, we strive to nourish and devel op our students' thinking, feeling, and willing through an education of the head, heart, and hands. At RWS we nurture students' minds by developing their capacities for critical thinking and creativity, observation and discernment, imagination and problem -solving. We nurture students' hearts by fostering kindness and courtesy, respect for others and the world, integrity and the courage to act according to one's convictions . We nurture students' wills by teaching them diligence and perseverance, by developing their ability to transform thought into action and inspiration into reality. A Developmental Approach We strive to give children the right content in the right way at the right time. We use a curriculum and methodology that takes children's intellectual, emotional, and social development into account so that students are truly ready for whatever they learn. We recognize the individuality of each child and strive to allow them to develop their unique gifts at their own pace. Living Learning Rudolf Steiner, the founder of Waldorf education, encouraged teachers to transform education into an art. This means that we work to create opportunities for learning that are alive, immediate, and meaningful. Teachers use the arts to engage their students; and students are taught how to express themselves through drawing, painting, and sculpture; speech, writing, and drama; music and movement. Students learn by listening, discussing, observing, and through hands -on working. In the grades, every child creates an impressive body of work that expresses his or her experience in each subject. 7 Education for Social Responsibility Teachers work to lay a foundation for social responsibility by fostering a sense of wonder, reverence, gratitude, and respect for nature and for our fellow human beings. Children develop their social skills by learning and working as a class community, resolving social issues, sharing responsibility for the care and upkeep of the classroom and the school, and developing a meaningful relationship to the natural and human world. The Importance of Community Waldorf education prepares chi ldren to enter adulthood with social awareness and self -discipline and a wonder and reverence for the world. Our goaL is to help students develop self - confidence born out of the ability to perceive clearly, think creatively, judge fairly, and act effectiv ely. The faculty and staff at Richmond Waldorf School work in partnership with parents to sustain a healthy, vibrant school. Our school is at its best when we take a genuine interest in one another and work to bring out the best in each other. The Background of Waldorf Education In the early twentieth century, Rudolf Steiner , an Austrian philosopher, became increasingly well known as an author and lecturer. He wrote more than 50 books and gave over 6,000 lectures on a wide variety of topics including philosophy, science, the evolution of consciousness, religion, agriculture, medicine, art, and education. Steiner's work in these fields resulted in a new form of agriculture, new techniques in curative education, new approaches to the arts, and a new form of education. In 1919, Rudolf Steiner was asked to find a school in Stuttgart, Germany. Steiner trained the teachers, developed the curriculum and methodology, and worked closely with faculty until his death in 1925. Because of its philosophy and innovative methods, the original Waldorf school gained international recognition and inspired the establishment of Waldorf schools throughout the world. Anthroposophy and Religion in the Waldorf School Parents new to a Waldorf school quickly sense that t here is something that underlies their child's education, the teacher's work, and the school's operation. This \"something\" is anthroposophy, the worldview developed by Rudolf Steiner. Anthroposophy is difficult to define, as it encompasses a vast body of research and teaching. Rudolf Steiner defin ed it as \"a path of knowledge, to guide the spiritual in the human being to the spiritual in the universe.\" Anthroposophy is a worldview and a path of inner development. Anthroposophy aids teachers in their preparation and their work . 8 Waldorf teachers are carefu l not to teach anthroposophy, so they do not interfere with their students' religious or philosophical orientation, which is the province of the family. Waldorf education seeks to bring meaning and purpose to all areas of human endeavor. Through every subject in the curriculum \u2014painting or poetry, science or sports, mathematics or world languages \u2014teachers hope to stimulate in their students a deep sense of self, awaken compassion and understanding for others, and instill a feeling of respon sibility for society and for the earth. Although religion is not taught within our school, themes from world religions are included in the study of literature, history, and geography. They help students to appreciate the rich cultural heritage of the dif ferent peoples of the world. This builds a foundation for their sense of identity, and, in adulthood, a free relationship to a religious or spiritual striving. Religious rituals are not practiced within Waldorf schools, but throughout the grades, children sing songs, recite verses that have a reverential character, and celebrate various religious and cultural festivals. Such celebrations are not intended to promu lgate any particular denomination or belief; but to enrich the curriculum through direct experience. Celebrating festivals mark the cycle of the year and deepen students' connection to the natural world; celebrating festivals from other cultures and faith s enhances students' appreciation for other people; and the act of celebration fosters a sense of community within the class and within the school as a whole. Rudolf Steiner articulated the goal of Waldorf education as follows: \"Our highest endeavor must be to develop free human beings, who are able of themselves to impart purpose and direction to their lives.\" In this endeavor, the greatest respect is accorded to the individuality, the heritage, and the spiritual freedom of all child ren and their families. 9 School Constituencies Richmond Waldorf School comprises four main groups: students, parents, staff, and school governance bodies. The students are the reason our school exists; everything that happens at the school is done on their behalf. Parents at RWS make it possible for our school to operate. They support their children's education by being involved in their children's classes and supporting the school through tuition, philanthropic gifts, and community service. The staff provides the educational program and the administrative support that keeps the school operating properly. The governance bodies include the Board of Trustees and the Faculty College. They hold the vision of the school, develop long -range plans to realize that vision, oversee the management of the school, and ensure that the school achieves its mission through its program, staffing, and facilities. 10 Governance Structure 11 Membership 2021- 2022 Board of Trustees Vyana Lafland, Chair Derek Starr , Vice Gulati Lindsey Kirchmier Christopher McQuale Kevin Williams Terry Wyllie Ex Officio Members Rebecca Gibbs, Director of Administration Joanne Garner, Director of Education Dawn Pollard, Faculty College Representative Nicole Randall, Parents Association Moderato r Leadership Team Joanne Garner, Director of Education Rebecca Gibbs, Director of Administration Jenny Dilworth, Faculty College Chair Faculty College Jenny Dilworth , Chair Amey Deborah Boes Katie Dawn Pollard Faculty Chairs Joanne Garner , Director of Education & Faculty Coor dinator Deborah Boes, Early Childhood Chair Letitia Amey , Grades S chool Chair Parents Association Nicole Randall , Parents Association Moderator Michele Burt , Treasurer Maddie Kolenich , Secretary Erica Childress, Historian Administrative Staff Joanne Garner, Director of Education Rebecca Gibbs, Director of Administration Valerie Hogan, Marketing & Enrollment Administrator Rachel Davis , Advancement Specialist LaToya Good, Administrative Coordinator Lorraine Graff, Account ing Coordinator David Garner, Facilities Coordinator Rachel White York , High School Transition Coordinator The Board of Trustees The Board of Trustees has legal and fiduciary responsibility for the school. It sets policies for and oversees the following areas: tuition, the operating budget, fundraising, financial aid and scholarships, school contracts, insurance, and the school facilities. The Board has ultimate responsibility for the financial state of Richmon d Waldorf School. The Board meets monthly, and reports of its work are published in The Messenger. More information about school governance can be found at RichmondWaldorf.com/governance/ The Faculty College The Faculty College is responsible for the spiritual work of the school as expressed in its mission, program, staffing, and facilities. The Faculty College strives to cultivate a spiritual relationship with the school through meditation, study, an d self -development. Just as the child is the teacher's focus, the school as an organism is the Faculty College's focus. 12 The Leadership Team The Leadership Team serves as the executive arm of the Board and the Faculty, and it is overseen and accountable to those bodies. The Team includes the Director of Administration , the Director of Education , and the Faculty College Chair who work to ensure coordination and execution of tasks and communication among all realms of the school. The Director of Administration is responsible for operations and administrative staff, and the Director of Education f or the pedagogical program and teaching staff. The Faculty College Chair coordinates the work of the College of Teachers and serves in an advisory capacity to the Director of Administration and the Director of Education . The Leadership Team shares respon sibility for community relations and communication on behalf of the school. The Parents Association The Parents Association (PA) is the collective parent body of the Richmond Waldorf School. Their mission is to infuse our school community with vitality through social gatherings, education, special events, and fundraising that promotes the school's mission. The PA works in partnership with the Faculty and Board. Information about the PA (policies, meeting agendas and notes, class representatives and important school links) can be found on the Parent's Corner page of the RWS website. II. Community Engagement, Service, and Volunteerism \"We believe that strong scho ols rely on initiative and commitment from all members of the community.\" Richmond Waldorf School depends on our community's engagement, service, and volunteerism to help us achieve our mission. Working together as parents and staff strengthens our school, and models important values for our children. We do not require parents to perform community service, but if each family contributes at least eight hours of community service per year, we will be able to staff our community projects and events. Parents are also welcome to join in the work of our school by becoming Class Parents, taking leadership roles in the Parents Association, or joining a committee of the Board of Trustees. 13 21-22 Class Responsibilities Early Childhood: Lantern Walk/Martinmas refreshments, May Faire support 1st Grade: Lantern Walk (Martinmas) support/Coat drive, May Faire support 2nd Grade: Games Night support, May Faire support 3rd Grade: Michaelmas support, May Faire support 4th Grade: Lost and Found support, May Faire support 5th Grade: All School Work Day food support, May Faire support 6th Grade: Community weather gear swap, Commencement support, May Faire support 7th Grade: Commencement support, May Faire support 8th Grade: May Faire support 14 III. Institutional Advancement \"Our vision is of a thriving, well -supported, inclusive school that nurtures the mind, the heart and the will of each child towards becoming a thinking, caring, self -directed individual with balance and purpose.\" In order to fulfill its mission and achieve its vision, Richmond Waldorf School needs to grow. This growth will allow us to serve a greater number of families and to achieve our long -range goals. The key to growth is enrollment, and we encourage every family to work actively to spread the word about our school and the unique education that we provide. Parent Ambassadors Parents are our best ambassadors and can help us become better known in the broader Richmond community. Parents don't have to be experts on Waldorf Education to convey their heart -felt appreciation for the school and how it serves their children. Word of mouth is by far our most effective marketing tool, and we urge all parents to help us get the word out. We hope that parents will invite friends and acquaintances to school events, observation days, and open houses. For brochures or invitations, please ask our Enrollment/Marketing Coordinators. Financial Support Every school depends on its community for financial support. This support is expressed through Tuition and fees Annual giving Participation in fundraising events Capital or designated gifts The Annual Fund is our school's most important fundraising opportunity. The fund allows us to continue to offer our rich program, properly compensate our faculty, maintain our facilities, and offer tuition support and scholarships. A high level of participation in the Annual Fund shows our community's support for the school and helps to pursue grant funding. In the past three years we achieved 100% participation from the Board and College and over 90% participation from parents and faculty. 15 The Founders' Scholarships In Europe, Waldorf Schools receive public assistance, making them accessible to all. In North America, however, we are dependent on tuition for our main source of income. RWS wishes to become a truly diverse community that can serve all families who wish to provide this education to their children. T o do this, we will need a much higher level of economic support for our school than is provided by tuition alone. In the meantime, we have established the Founders' Scholarships in order to make Waldorf education available to students who would otherwise not be able to attend. Each year, RWS grants scholarship s to several qualified children whose families are new to our school. Our Founders' Scholars have gone on to attend Appomattox Regional Governor's School, Collegiate School, Maggie L. Walker Regional Governor's School, and Trinity Episcopal School to name a few. Please contact the Enrollment & Marketing Administrator to suggest any individual, foundation, or corporate support for this important program . IV. Richmond Waldorf School Program and Curriculum \"We believe that students thrive when exposed to a hands -on, integrated curriculum that is developmentally appropriate and grounded in artistic and practical work.\" The Early Childhood Program Our Early Childhood program offers a nurturing, loving and secure environment for children ages two and a half to six years old. The program provides a transition between the worlds of home and school. Our goals are to help each child gain confidence, develop good educational habits, and experience a world outside of the home filled with friends, songs, stories, play, art and movement. Depending on age at the time of enrollment, a child may be enrolled from one to four years in our Early Childhood program bef ore moving on to the first grade. During their years in the E .C., children may return to the same teacher and group of friends, or they may change classes. These decisions are made by the Early Childhood faculty. In a physically beautiful, emotionally supportive, and carefully structured environment, the child ren's day flows naturally between group and individual activities that reflect their need for both outer and inner activity. The teacher carefully determines th e rhythm that carries a c hild 16 throughout the day, week and each season . Early Childhood teachers provide a curriculum enriched by meaningful, real -life activities such as baking bread, setting the table, cleaning, and gardening. Imaginative play is an important part of the day, allowing children to use what is around them to imitate both what they have learned about the world and to express their active imaginations. Special attention is placed on surrounding the c hildren with beautiful, natural, and interesting toys and materials t o use in their play. Children also learn about the world and themselves through many types of activities. These include watercolor painting, drawing with crayons, beeswax modeling, singi ng, circle verses and movement, seasonal festivals, stories, special arts and crafts projects and puppetry. Storytelling provides the children with an introduction to the flowing stream of literacy that will continue throughout their school years. The Early Childhood program has achieved and holds Full Membership status with WECAN (Waldorf Early Childhood Association of North America). In addition, the program is licensed by the Virginia Department of Education , which periodically inspects the premi ses, student and faculty records, playground safety, and program guidelines. The Grades Program The Waldorf grades curriculum is based on a developmental approach to education. The skills, knowledge, and modes of expression introduced each year are caref ully designed to meet the needs and interests of the growing child. Particularly in the early grades, all subjects are presented through activities that stir the child's imagination, feelings, and senses so that the ideas and facts are powerfully and deeply experienced. The Class Teacher Each grade has a class teacher who continues with the same class for a number of years, ideally through the entire eight -year cycle. The class teacher works in close collaboration with the specialty teachers and with the children's families to serve each child's needs. Class teachers teach the main lesson curriculum and academic skill s classes, as well as drawing, painting, modeling, speech, drama, and singing. Waldorf teachers share what they have learned through their own research, study, and experience rather than relying on textbooks or technological tools to impart knowledge. As active learners, students create their own illustrated books that chronicle thei r experience in the subjects. As they grow older, workbooks or textbooks may be used in various subjects to help students practice the material on their own. 17 The Waldorf Curriculum The Waldorf curriculum embraces all of the major subjects in the humanit ies, sciences, and mathematics. A detailed Curriculum Outline of the academic subjects is included in the Appendix. The Waldorf Main Lesson : One of the hallmarks of Waldorf schools is that students have intensive courses called \"main lesson blocks\" where they study one subject for three to six weeks during a two-hour period in the morning. Subjects needing continual practice \u2014such as language arts, mathematics, world languages, and music are taught in weekly specialty periods throughout the year. Main lessons are designed so that students become deeply immersed in a subject through presentation, review , discussion, individual and group work. Specialty Subjects Specialty classes supplement the main lesson curriculum and include handwork, two world languages, movement, chorus, games, woodworking, strings, and recorder. These classes are taught by specialty teachers or class teachers who have expertise in the subject. Handwork and Woodwork : The use of our hands strengthens the will \u2014 the capacity to keep moving forward and complete a task \u2014 and works on the brain, integrating left - and right -brained thinking. In their elementary years, Waldorf students learn to knit, crochet, cross stitch, felt, create patterns, and sew by hand and on a machine. Woodwork begins in fifth grade and continues through the Middle School Years. The students learn to use a va riety of hand tools to create objects that are not only beautiful and useful, bu t also may complement their academic studies. World and Classical Languages : The RWS grades curriculum includes Russian and Spanish, engaging the natural linguistic capacities of young children and their ability to delight in cultural differences. The children experience the culture and spoken language through songs, verses, stories, games and play. Beginning in third grade, the students gradually learn written language and its grammar, culminating in reading, writing, conversation and drama in the middle grades. In fifth grade students are introduced to Ancient Greek . In sixth, seventh, and eighth grades, they study Latin. Music : Music is an integral part of the Waldorf curriculum. All students participate in musical activities throughout the week. Beginning in Early Childhood, students learn songs and rhythmic games. The vocal music curriculum continues through the grades becoming ever more diverse and complex. Instrumental music instruction begins in the first grade when students learn how to play the pentatonic flute. In fifth grades, their instrumental instruction includes mu sic theory , reading music, and playing in ensembles. Movement : The Movement Arts program consists of imaginative play, games, exercises, and performance training. We approach movement in a holistic manner through dance, theater, and 18 sport. End- of-Year Report (for students in the Grades) The year -end report contains three parts: a Curriculum Overview; a Narrative; and Rubrics. Curriculum Overviews, written by the class teacher and specialty teachers, outline the content of the subjects The Narrative Report, written by the class teacher, strives to give a com plete and accurate description of the child personally, academically, and socially. The Student Description includes work habits, ability to listen and contribute, oral and written work, and rhythmic work. It may also describe highlights of the students ye ar, areas of challenge, and artistic work. The Social Description includes the student in relationship to adults and to peers. The rubrics give a succinct picture of the child's work in language arts, mathematics, and - for the upper grades - all specialty subjects. Rubrics have an area for comments by class and specialty teachers. (Please see the appendix for further information on how we assess our Grades students.) Program Adjustment s A program adjustment will be made when the Class Teacher and/or Specialty teacher/s determine a student's needs are not being met due to either intellectual, mental, emotional or physical ability. (Please see the appendix for more information) Homework At Richmond Waldorf School, we try to keep the homework load manageable so that students and their families have time for other interests and activities. In our view, homework provides students with opportunities to: Practice their academic, reading, musical, and practical skills Complete assignments begun at school Strengthen their work habits Develop a sense of responsibility Homework is not intended to be burdensome or to interfere with family life, and parents who are concerned about their child's homework load are encouraged to discuss it with their child's teachers. Types of Assignments Homework requirements and assignments change throughout the elementary school years. In grades one and two, there is no formal homework. In third grade, some assignments or projects may be gi ven In grades four and five, homework consists of nightly reading and practicing academic skills 19 as necessary In grades six through eight, homework may also include independent projects and preparation for dramatic and musical performances. Time Spent on Homework The total time a student spends on homework (including instrument practice) should not exceed approximately ten minutes per grade level per school night (e.g. up to 40 minutes in 4th grade) Except for reading and extended projects, homewo rk will not be assigned over weekends, holidays or vacations. V. Richmond Waldorf School Parent -Teacher Partnership Communication \"We believe that open, clear and direct communication is critical for maintaining a supportive and productive educational community.\" Communication is vital to the parent -teacher relationship, and it is important that parents and teachers be respectful and direct in their dealings with one another. Where there are persistent tensions or misunderstandings between parents and their child's class teacher, it is helpful to have the Director of Education facilitate a meeting. Parents may request a short written report of the meeting . We encourage parent s to avoid speaking about important topics with class teachers when they are dropping off or picking up their children. At these times, teachers are still responsible for their students and are not able to engage in substantive conversation. The best meeti ngs between parents and teachers are those that are scheduled and prepared in advance. Each teacher at RWS will provide parents with means of communication by phone and/or email . Parent -Teacher Conferences Twice yearly Parent -Teacher conferences are designed to strengthen the parent -teacher relationship and their ability to work together for the benefit of the child, to share teacher evaluation of the child, and to set goals for the child's further progress. At the conference, parents are asked to share how the year is going from their perspective and if there are any pressing issues. 20 During these conferences, teachers speak about their expectations for the class and how the specific child meets or does not meet those expectations. Conferences are an ideal time to review students' challenges and to discuss any needed remedial plans. Specialty teachers may request conferences with parents, especially if there are concerns. Class teachers may suggest specialty teacher conferences to th e parents. Because these conferences promote the parent -teacher partnership, both parents should attend whenever possible. Class Meetings Teachers plan several class meetings for each year. A schedule will be posted on the RWS online calendar and distributed in advance. These meetings are an integral part of our school life. They are an important bridge between home and school and offer parents an opportunity to hear about the children 's work and to participate in the type of activities done in the class. These meetings include discussion on various aspects of Waldorf education. They also serve as social gatherings for parents. Attendance at these meetings is essential . If parents are u nable to attend these meetings, they should notify their child's teacher and choose another parent as their designated listener. VI. Richmond Waldorf School Family Life Festivals and Celebrations Richmond Waldorf School celebrates many festivals during the school year. Some festivals are held during school while others are during the evenings and on weekends. Check the school calendar for specific dates. Brief descriptions of our festivals are incl uded in the appendix. For more information, parents should speak with their child's teacher or visit RichmondWaldorf.com/festivals -and- celebrations/ . Children's education is not restricted to what they experience at school. While home is very different from school, these two environments weave the fabric of the child's life. Children benefit from a strong connection between home and school, we share the following ideas and suggestions for parents' consideration. Sleep Sometimes the hardest job parents do all day is getting their child to bed at night. We recommend an early bedtime at the same time each night. Getting enough sleep helps children get the most out of their school day. It is helpful to remember that Sunday night is also a school night. Children younger than seven years old need 10-12 hours of sleep each night in addition to the nap they may 21 take. Media Richmond Waldorf School is dedicated to nurturing children's capacities for clear, creative thought, compa ssion, and purposeful action. It is our experience that these capacities develop best through warm human interactions, artistic endeavors, and meaningful tasks. They are strengthened by contemplation, exploration, and enthusiastic experiences in the natura l world that engage all the senses. Electronic media present children with strong, ready -made images that do not require active participation , numb the imagination, and interfere with creativity and clear thinking . These media also often give children a pessimistic view of human nature and a distorted view of human relationships. Teachers at Richmond Waldorf School have observed the following about children who have fewer media experiences: Physically, they are more comfortable in their bodies are more active, better coordinated and are able to play more freely have keener senses and better sensory integration have better physical/intuitive sense for cause and effect Emotionally and Socially, they are more relational, more interested in and responsive to other people and better able to read social and emotional cues are better able to react to people and situations with genuine feeling demonstrate greater empathy are calmer and less reactive Intellectually, they have keener attentiveness and ability to focus have a deeper sense of curiosity, wonder and interest are more creative and open to new ideas are better able to sustain intellectual engagement are better able to differentiate what is real from what is fantasy are more positive and optimistic in their thinking are more receptive and engaged in school activities Media Guidelines Television/Videos/Movies: As adults, we have developed filters for the barrage of electronic stimulation that we encounter each day, but this is not true for children. The faculty therefore strongly urges parents to minimize or eliminate television and video viewing by 22 their children . If children are permitted to watch television or mo vies, we ask that parents limit this to weekends and vacations (not the night before returning to school), and to exercise parental oversight. Computer/Electronic Games: Children benefit from activities that include meaningful social encounters and an experience of nature. Although children may find computer, video, Wii, and other electronic games fascinating , they are poor substitutes for active , creative play. The Faculty therefore strongly urge parents to minimize or eliminate gaming by their children. Cell Phones/Social Media: Developments in online cell phone technology have changed the way many of us relate to one another and to the world. While adults have the maturity and experience to be able to view the online world with perspective, children do not. Children find it difficult to resist the addictive quality of the online experience, and they can easily encounter harmful content. The Faculty therefore stro ngly urges parents to minimize or eliminate children's online activities and cell phones or to actively monitor their children's use of these media portals. Toys A child at play is projecting fantasy and imagination onto a toy. The ideal toy encourages a child to play imaginatively. Present children of any age with potential, and they will fill it from an unlimited fountain of creativity. Giving them finished prod ucts unwittingly limit s their resourcefulness. This is one of the maxims of Waldorf education: while teaching, give children only enough to stir their own creative processes, and then provide them guidance in expressing what the lessons have awakened. This fosters creative activity in the soul of the child and leads to imaginative thinking in the adolescent. We recommend simple toys made of natural materials. Limiting the number of toys can give a child a sense of order and clarity , which is healthy for children \u2014and adults as well! Rhythm, Reverence, and Ritual Rhythm, Reverence and Ritual are the three R's of Waldorf education. When experienced in childhood they can lead to an experience of responsible freedom in adulthood. Rhythm is a natural and healthy part of life. Most of us are not fully aware of the continuing rhythms of nature. Parents can teach the beneficial effects of rhythm, reverence and ritual to children within the home through nurturing these qualities within themselves. Observance of festivals, saying grace and lighting a candle before meals, having a bedtime story, song or prayer , or creating a special family tradition can become special rituals within the home. A healthy rhythm is established when meals are served at the same time each day and when bedtime is at a regular hour. A child who lives in rhythm grows physically strong and gains a secure foundation for life as an adult. 23 Predictability does not leave out the possibility for new and different adventures - or spontaneity ! It is the overall outline of the day, waking and sleeping, meals and restful moments that give each day an essential structure . Sensationalism, sensory overstimulation, advertising, and competitiveness are a few of the trends of modern life that undermine these profound qualities. 24 Policies and Procedures I. Communication At RWS we strive for warm, cordial relationships and communication. We encourage people to speak to each other directly regarding questions and concerns. Whenever possible, these conversations should be face -to-face. The chart below outlines the channels of communication at RWS. In each category, parents should start by contacting the first person listed. If the matter remains unresolved or would benefit from the involvement of another person, please contact the other people listed or a member of the Leadership Team in whose department the matter lies.

Class teachers publish their communication framework to parents Finances Richmond Waldorf School is an educational institution with a spiritual mission . It also has a responsibility to manage its revenue and expenses efficiently and effectively. Parents assist the school's economic operations by fulfilling their contractual obligations communicating and returning paperwork in a timely manner supporting the school through fundraising and community service Tuition Payments RWS uses TADS for managing tuition payments. Parents may enroll in annual, biannual and monthly payment plans, using either ACH or credit cards. All tuition for the current year is due upon enrollment and can be financed through April. RWS expects that parents will meet their contractual obligations in a timely manner. The school is willing to work with a family who is experiencing financial difficulties to accommodate a justified exception to the usual payment plans. If a family is experiencing or expecting financial difficulties, they should contact the Director of Ad ministration. RWS will follow our policy for Past Due Accounts (below) if a family does not remit payment in a timely manner. Tuition Adjustment Richmond Waldorf School is committed to socioeconomic diversity, and Tuition Adjustment is available for families with financial need. Applications for tuition adjustment are evaluated separately from the admissions process. RWS utilizes TADS to make an initial estimate o f the family contribution. The Tuition Adjustment Committee uses TADS analysis and policy guidelines to ensure equity in our decisions. Parents must provide verification of income and expenses to TADS. This could include a copy of filed previous year federal income tax return, including copies of W -2s, 1099s, paystubs, and verification of ex penses.

Parents should inform the teacher or Administrative Coordinator by email if their child is being picked up by anyone not on the child's authorized pick up list. 30 Late Arr ivals The school day begins at 8:15 a.m. We encourage students to arrive 10-15 minutes early to have time to settle in and prepare for the day. To support the rhythmic life of each student, on -time arrival is imperative. This aids a student in establish ing good habits and helps each classroom to function smoothly. Any student arriving after 8:15 a.m. must be signed in by an authorized caregiver at the Main Entrance. EC students will be immediately escorted to their classrooms. Grades students will be held in the office until 8:30 a.m. School notification : If a student will be absent or tardy beyond 8:30 a.m. the parent or guardian should call the school office by 8:15 a.m. The Attendance Line is 804-377- 8024. Early and Late Pickup If a child is scheduled to leave school before afternoon pick -up time, parents should phone the Front Office. Children will wait in the Front Office to be picked up where they will be signed out and brought to the parent at the front entrance. Children who are not picked up within 15 minutes of end of day dismissal will be taken to Aftercare and parents will be billed. Aftercare Aftercare is provided for children in Early Childhood (1:00 -6:00 pm) and students in the Grades (3:00- 6:00 pm) Mondays through Fridays days when school is in session. Aftercare can be contracted by the school year or scheduled as a drop in. Drop -ins must be requested by 5 p.m. the business day before care is needed.

The Aftercare Program is licensed by the Virginia Department of Education , which periodically inspects the premises, student and faculty records, playground safety, and program guidelines. Attendance Policy Our program is created to promote a rhythm that allows learning to unfold in a balanced way. Regular, timely attendance allows students to fully experience the curriculum. If a student is absent or tardy more than four days in a six -week period), the family will be contacted and may be required to meet with the Director of Education. Special consideration will be given to circumstances such as student illness, medical appointments, family bereavement, religious holidays, and high school visits. The Faculty Co llege will consider if the student is progressing appropriately. 31 Inclement Weather Closings and Delays The Director of Administration decides whether school should be closed or have a delayed start due to inclement weather. Text message alerts and emails will be sent to families informing them of a delay or closing. The school calendar and weather scrolls for Channels 6, 8, and 12 will be updated. On any day that the school has a delayed opening due to inclement weather, it i s possible that Aftercare will close early and that after school or evening activities and events may be cancelled. Inclement weather make- up days are built into the school calendar. Except under unusual circumstances, school closings do not impact the number of instructional school hours.

Lost and Found items will be placed outside the EC entrance and Grades drop off/pick up area at least once a month . We ask that students and parents check Lost and Found regularly. All items in Lost and F ound at the end of the semester will be donated to charity . Forgotten items If parents need any items brought to their child during the school day please call the Front Office and speak with the Administrative Coordinator for item drop off instructions. Dress Code The dress code is designed to create an atmosphere conducive to learning by focusing attention on the children rather than on their clothing. The faculty reserves the right to decide if dress and appearance c reate a distraction. If a child is not dressed appropriately, teachers may req uire a child to wear something that covers the inappropriate clothing, or parents may be called to bring a change of clothing. General Principles Students should wear clothing that is clean, neat, modest and suitable for the activity and the season. Cloth ing should be well fitted - not so large or long that it extends over hands or feet or overly short or tight. Clothing may not have tears, holes or unfinished edges (such as cut -off jeans).

Health and Safety COVID -19 Health & Safety Policy Refer to separate COVID -19 Policy & Procedure Immunization Policy At Richmond Waldorf School, our students' health and safety are always a priority and concern. The school follows the immunization requirements of the Virginia Department of Health. The Commonwealth of Virginia requires all children to be immunized but allows for a religious exemption. Richmond Waldorf School advises our parents to consider their social and civic responsibility as members of the greater Richmond community when making decisions regarding immunization. We also recognize that a parent's decision to immunize their children happens before they enter school and that it is a decisi on made in consultation with their family doctor. RWS honors each family's decision, but we will also meet our social and civic responsibility to the community. Please note that per the Commonwealth of Virginia Certificate of Religious Exemption form, in the occurrence of an outbreak, potential epidemic or epidemic of a vaccine -preventable disease within the school the State Health Commissioner may order the exclusion of unvaccinated children until the danger has passed. Parents must submit a School Entrance Health Form completed by their child's physician along with immunization records in order for their child to attend school. If a child has had a physical examination recently, it must be within 12 months prior to attendance. In addition, the School must receive an updated immunization record yearly for all students who are immunized. If your child is either not vaccinated at all or not vaccinated in accordance with either the current harmonized schedule or the harmonized catch -up schedules (including meeting all minimum age and interval requirements) considered to be appropriately immunized for school attendance, parents must submi t to the school a Notarized Religious Exemption Form . Please follow this link for more detailed immunization Information: https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/immunization/requirements/ 34 Illness Richmond Waldorf School does not have facilities to care for children who are ill. If a child is not well enough to participate fully in the program, that child should be kept at home. If a child becomes ill while at school, a parent will be called to take the child home. Children must remain at home for at least 24 hours after a fever breaks or after vomiting and diarrhea related to a stomach virus. When deciding whether a child is ready to return to school, please keep in mind that even when a child seems better at home, the effort of participating in a school day may be too much for someone recuperating from an illness. Any child who contracts a contagious illness must be kept at home until no longer contagious. School administration should be informed of any student 's contagious illness. If children are found to have any contagious illness they will be sent home . If there is a health issue that could affect the school community, parents will be informed by Constant Contact email Head Lice If a child is found to have head lice during the sc hool day we will call and inform the child 's parents and request the child be picked up immediately. We ask that parents begin treatment at home using a prescription or over the counter medication and remove nits from the head. This step is required before the child may return to school. Children may return to school after the first at home lice treatment . Re-treatment is recommended after 9 -10 days. Medications If a child is taking medication, the child's teacher should be informed and alerted to any potential side effects. RWS staff is not permitted to administer any medication without written parental permission for short term medication and written parental and physician permission for long term medication. If a child requires medication or supplements while at school, the medication should be brought in its original container to the Front Office by a parent and a medication consent form should be completed. Please see LaToya Good in the Front Office for a form granting permission to administer medication. If a child requires medication during the school day, it must be administered by school personnel. In order to keep all of our students safe, we ask that medica tions and supplements never be sent to school in a child's lunchbox or backpack. Field Trips All grades classes take field trips to enrich the children's experience of the curriculum. Volunteer parent drivers provide transportation for field trips. Copies of the vehicle operators' licenses and insurance cards must be provided to the 35 school 5 days prior to l eaving the school grounds with the students. All children must be properly restrained in each driver's car. Student Electronics and Cell Phone Use Students are not permitted to carry or use cell phones or any electronic device that has internet connectivity on campus or during school sponsored events . Devices that have internet connectivity, such as Apple watches, may not be connected to the internet while on campus or during school sponsored events. If parents find it necessary for their child to bring a cell phone or electronic device that has internet connectivity to school, it must be turned off and stored out of sight or secured by school personnel. Unless the device is secured by school personnel, RWS assumes no responsibility for the device. Students who need to make a phone call while at school or during school events can request permission to use a school phone or the supervising adult' s phone. If a student is found using a cell phone or electronic device that has internet connectivity on school property or during school events, it will be held by staff and returned to the student's parents or guardia n. Behavior on School Property RWS prohibits and does not tolerate violent acts or threats against students, employees, visitors, guests, or other individuals within its facility, on its property, or while conducting organization business. This includes, but is not limited to, intimidation, harassment, assault, battery, stalking, or conduct that causes a person to believe that he or she is under a threat of death or serious bodily injury. All threats of violence will be treated as serious threats to the school community. Weapons or any other item designed to inflict harm are strictly prohibited from being brought onto school property. RWS property includes parking lots, buildings, yards, and vehicles as well as property used for school functions such as picnics, etc. Even though an indi vidual may have lawfully issued permits or licenses to carry such weapons, our policy prohibits these items on our property except by a law enforcement officer authorized to carry a firearm. Violations of this policy may also result in arrest and/or prose cution. Missing Child Policy As soon as a child is reported missing the entire RWS staff will be alerted. All available staff will immediately initiate a search. If the child cannot be found, the parents and the police department will be contacted immedia tely. Virginia Department of Social Services is contacted within 24 hours if the child is not found. When the child is found, the same parties are notified. Allegations of Child Abuse Any RWS employee who receives a report of alleged child abuse or has reason to suspect abuse as defined in the Code of Virginia (63.2-100) is required to report the allegation to the 36 Child Protective Services (CPS) office where the alleged abuse took place. RWS employees are defined as mandated reporters (63.2-1509). Teachers should contact the Director of Education with concerns and allegations. The Director of Education will be the point of contact for CPS. Fire Drills and Emergency Response Plan Fire drills are conducted regularly so that the children learn to exit from the building in an expedient and safe manner. Emergency drills are also conducted regularly so that children learn where to go and how to respond to unforeseen emergencies. A copy of the RWS Emergency Response Plan is kept in the Front Office. In the event of a natural disaster all children will be moved to safe locations designated in the RWS Emergency Plan. Teachers will stay with their class until the danger is over. A schematic drawing outlining the exits is posted in each classroom. Insurance Church Mutual Insurance insures Richmond Waldorf School. Student Accident Insurance Company offers optional additional individual insurance. The school's insurance covers children, parents and visitors while at school as well as while away on school trips. Volunteers, Chaperones, Faculty and Administrative positions Purpose : To ensure the safety and security of students when in the presence of someone not an Employee and who is participating in a school activity, defined below.

Student Conduct A Caring Community Richmond Waldorf School values a safe, inclusive environment where students can work and learn together. We seek to help children develop moral and social consciousness by teaching self - discipline, awakening an awareness of others, and strengthening the capaci ty to act and interact effectively. Our Code of Conduct is designed to support these goals. At RWS, adults share the responsibility of socially responsible conduct \u2014 interacting with respect, goodwill, and constructive communication. By cultivating a healthy community, we can serve as a model for our children and enrich their growth and learning. Code of Conduct Students at Richmond Waldorf School have the following rights: To be treated with respect To have personal property treated with respect To have a safe, supportive learning environment To ensure those rights, students are expected to abide by the following code of conduct: To treat others with respect in word and deed To treat personal and school property with respect Our code of conduct is in effect at school, at school events, and during school -sponsored trips. While RWS is not directly responsible for students when they are not at school, the school will determine whether and how to address out -of-school behaviors that affect the class or school community. Discipline Because children need to learn to conduct themselves appropriately, dis cipline is part of everyday school life. Children learn to behave properly under their teachers' guidance and through reinforcement, reminders, and redirection. 38 Teachers in a Waldorf school have full authority over discipline in their classrooms, and each has his or her individual style. Teachers will keep parents informed about their approach to discipline, and parents are encouraged to ask their child's teachers if they would like to know more and to inform them if there are circumsta nces in the child's life that may result in misbehavior at school. Serious Misconduct: Inappropriate and Aggressive Behavior Serious misconduct is behavior that goes beyond expected improper behavior in degree, persistence, intent, and the effect it has on other students. Examples of serious misconduct include Physical injury: Pushing, hitting, biting, scratching, pinching, spitting, etc. Verbal injury: Demeaning, insulting, taunting, shouting; etc. Written, drawn or gestural expressions which are bot hersome, distressing, provocative, threatening, vulgar, obscene, or violent Damage or destruction to school or personal property Theft or the threat of theft Disruptive behavior: Interrupting or arguing with a teacher; sarcastic or rude behavior or speech; refusal to follow instructions; excessive conversation, noise or activity; unresponsiveness, etc. Possession and/or use of forbidden items: Materials that ar e obscene, vulgar, violent or pornographic; weaponry or otherwise dangerous items; tobacco, alcoholic beverages or other controlled substances Bullying Bullying is defined as hostile behavior that is targeted at an individual, is intentionally harmful, is persistent, and demonstrates a relational imbalance of power. Any form of inappropriate or aggressive behavior - physical, verbal, gestural; in writing or images - that meets these criteria will be determined to be bullying. Additional forms of bullying include but are not limited to: Sexual bullying: Unwelcome physical contact; demeaning; taunting Racist bullying: Racial insults, jokes and gestures; graffiti and racist insignia/badges; circulating racist literature Cyberbullying: via electronic media; internet, including but not limited to, email, posts, chat rooms; cell phone calls and text or imag e messages; camera, web cams, and video. It is important to note that some negative behaviors can be within the scope of normal child development yet may not be construed as bullying. Some examples of behaviors that do not meet the criteria in the definiti on are: Teasing or joking that isn't intended to hurt Impulsivity Behavior or statements meant to be complimentary Automatic reactions to various forms of injury 39 Reporting and Classification Reports of serious misconduct may be made by students, parents, or staff members to the child's primary teacher or the Early Childhood or Grade School Chair who will investigate the incident, make a determination, and communicate with the family. Serious misconduct can be classified in three levels according to seriousness or recurrence. These behaviors are described and dealt with as follows: Level One: Serious or repeated infractions of the code of conduct. Level Two : More serious misconduct than Level One or repeated misconduct that indicates that remediation has not been successful. Level Three: More serious misconduct than Level Two or repeated misconduct that indicates that remediation has not been successful. Process Level One : Within 24 hours of the incident being observed or reported, the teacher will inform the parents of the students involved, fill out the necessary forms, and meet with the appropriate Section Chair to review the incident. If there are issues regarding s tudent safety, the Director of Administration and the Director of Education will be informed. Within a week of the incident being observed or reported, the teacher will meet with the student's family to discuss the situation and to review plans for remedi ation. The teacher and parents will continue to monitor the situation and to meet as necessary. The teacher will keep the Section Chair informed about the situation. Depending on the circumstances and type of misconduct, the Section Chair may require anoth er teacher to observe in the classroom and to provide a written report. The forms and reports generated by this process are kept with the student's school file but the school will decide whether and how these are shared with anyone other than the family and the RWS faculty. Level Two : The parents are informed by the primary teacher or the Section Chair and the student is suspended from school while the Director of Education , and the teacher will make a determination regarding the seriousness of the misconduct. The Director of Education will share relevant information with the parents of other students involved where state and federal privacy laws and regulations allow. Before the student is readmitted to school, the student's parents need to meet with the primary teacher and the College Chair to discuss the situation and to agree on a course of action. Level Three: Same as Level Two except that the student is suspended from school until the matter is discussed by the Faculty College, which will determine whether and on what terms the student may return to school. Before the student is readmitted to school, the student's parents need to meet with the primary teacher and the College Chair to discuss the situation and to agree on a course of action. 40 Possible Courses of Action for Levels Two and Three include : Probation: Terms will be established under which the student may remain at school. Leave of Absence: The student's enrollment may be suspended for a period of time. Dismissal 41 APPENDICES I.

Appendix 4 - School Festivals and Assemblies Assemblies Before Thanksgiving, before Spring Break, and on the last day of school, we have major assemblies that are designed to showcase e ach class's academic and artistic work. Families are encouraged to attend assemblies because it allows them to experience what has been learned in the different subjects across the grades. Festival Descriptions The Rose Ceremony : The Rose Ceremony marks the beginning of the school year for all grades students. This special ceremony welcomes the rising first grade into the elementary school. Michaelmas : Richmond Waldorf School celebrates the autumn season with service projects, f ield games, and with a pageant performed by the students in the grades. Although Michaelmas is not commonly celebrated in North America, it is an important festival in Waldorf schools throughout the world. Michaelmas honors the archangel Michael who is th e embodiment of courage. Martinmas & the Lantern Walk : From France comes the story of St. Martin of Tours, a Roman soldier who exhibited great generosity. Each year, RWS gathers to celebrate Martinmas. Each student creates a beautiful candle -lit lantern , which symbolizes the light in all of us as we enter the darkening months of winter. We light lanterns and share gingerbread and warm cider. The Spiral of Light : Throughout Europe, northern Asia, and ancient Egypt, there have been festivals in the dar kest time of year that celebrate the coming return of warmth and light. This holiday has had festival connotations of light and the sun -- of the time when winter draws to its close and spring begins. At Richmond Waldorf School, children are asked to pa rticipate in a very special celebration. Each child walks through a spiral of evergreen boughs to light their candle from the large center candle. This represents light in the darkest days of winter. As he or she returns through the spiral, the child choos es a place along the path to set the candle. As the number of candles grow, so does the beauty and magic of the experience. May Faire : This public event draws members of the larger Richmond community to RWS to celebrate. Children decorate wreaths with fre sh spring flowers, dance around the Maypole and sing songs of spring. Children's activities, stories and treats are available for the whole family. Birthday Celebrations The birthday ceremony is an important event at school and for each child. With respec t and reverence, the class honors each child's birthday. Children celebrate birthdays at school with only their classmates and teachers present. "}
