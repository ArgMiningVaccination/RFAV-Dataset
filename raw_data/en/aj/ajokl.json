End of life decisions and Advance Directives (living wills) Adults 18 years and older can make decisions about their own care, including refusing treatment. It's possible that someday you could become so sick or injured that you can't tell your providers whether you want a certain treatment or not. If you have written an Advance Directive, also called a living will, your providers may follow your instructions. If you don't have an Advance Directive, your providers may ask your family what to do. If your family can't or won't decide, your providers will take the usual steps in treating your conditions. If you don't want certain kinds of treatment, like a breathing machine or feeding tube, you can write that down in an Advance Directive. It lets you decide your care before you need that kind of care - in case you are unable to direct it yourself, such as if you are in a coma. If you are awake and alert your providers will always listen to what you want. You can get an Advance Directive form at no cost by calling CareOregon Customer Service at 800-224-4840, TTY 711. You can also get it from Oregon Health Decisions by calling toll-free 800-422-4805. If you write an Advance Directive, be sure to talk to your providers and your family about it and give them copies. They can only follow your instructions if they have them. Some providers and hospitals will not follow Advance Directives for religious or moral reasons. You should ask them about this. If you change your mind, you can cancel your Advance Directive anytime. To cancel your Advance Directive, ask for the copies back and tear them up, or write CANCELED in large letters, sign and date them. If you think CareOregon did not follow Advance Directive requirements, or if your provider does not follow your wishes in your Advance Directive, you can complain.
