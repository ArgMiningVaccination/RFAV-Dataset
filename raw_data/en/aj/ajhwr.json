There is something in your life that you do not want to absorb. The obvious challenge may have come from something ingested, inhaled or absorbed. Emotionally, there may be something that you don't want to integrate or deal with or there may even part of you that you reject. This can be expressed in different ways: - Rejecting the visualisation of something you do not want to see. - Wishing a desirable situation had never happened. - Fear of something about to happen. - Fear, rejecting an idea or experience. - Feeling threatened at that moment by someone or something. - Disgusted by what is going on. - Feeling sick of something or someone. - Feeling uneasy with and resistant to those in your environment who don't resonate with you. - Sick of doing something for someone that does not appreciate your efforts According to Evette Rose in her book, Metaphysical Anatomy, she states: \"As your body is always ready for flight or fight, it can produce too much gastric acid. This is also related to the vomiting instinct. The body tries to rid itself of excess acid. This can happen when a person tries to rid themselves of circumstances that are triggering old trauma. It's the body's way of trying to create a barrier between you and a stressful environment.\" When there is nausea due to a stomach ulcer, you could be trying to escape from a current or past situation that is eating away at you. You fear the past situation could repeat itself. You don't know when to feel safe or relax. This is a fear of letting go of the old and welcoming the new.

These symptoms can be similar to mild panic or anxiety where you have a need to take control of a new threatening situation in which you believe that there will be no escape. There is a strong desire to control everything. Trusting the journey can release the fear of a negative outcome. Louise L. Hay in her book [Heal Your Body](https://amzn.to/3LoLmOy) states that seasickness relates to fear, fear of death, and lack of control. As over-rich food can cause nausea and vomiting, so can overpowering positive emotions. As we have become used to certain foods in our lives, excess or too much exotic food can make us nauseous in trying to reject it. The same applies to overpowering emotional excitement. The body attempts to throw back overstimulation and return things to the level we think as normal. Spiritual Cause of Nausea During Pregnancy There may be a few subconscious fears that may be \"hard to swallow\" during pregnancy: - The dramatic change in the mother's physical form. - Fear of losing your freedom, which may be hard to stomach. - A lack of support from the child's father. - Fear of birth or being a future mother.

About My Work & How I Could Help You My work as a Soul Whisperer is to help you to communicate with your soul's needs and desires. Your current health challenges are a result of a build-up of unresolved negative emotions and pre-programming, often from your childhood.

Should you fail to listen to the messages that are crying out to be heard, these messages become stronger and harder for you to ignore. They then become manifestations of pain, discomfort, or ill-health. Your soul must find a way to get you to take action. Your soul probably brought you to my website today!
