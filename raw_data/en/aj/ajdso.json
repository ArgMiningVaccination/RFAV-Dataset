These standards are based on current ly available evidence based information, Alberta Health (AH) policy, and provincial and national guidelines. Immunizers must be knowledgeable about the specific vaccines they administer . Background Proper v accine administration is a key element to ensuring the optimal safety and eff ectiveness of vaccines. Vaccine administration practices are based on clinical trials that determine the dose, route and schedule for each vaccine to optimize vaccine effectiveness and reduce the risk of local reactions or other adverse events .17 There may be situations where vaccine administration decisions need t o be reviewed and assessed on a case by case basis. Immunizers should receive educational and competency based training on vaccine administration before immunizing. Professional standards for medication and vaccine administration and federal/provincial/te rritorial policies and procedures also guide immunization practices.17 It is the individual immunizer 's professional responsibility to ensure they are following these standards. There are many components in the immunization process including counselling a nd risk communication, informed consent, assessing if the individual is fit to immunize, reporting of adverse events following immunization , recognition and management of anaphylaxis, immunization documentation etc. These topics will be addressed in detail in other sections of the manual. Purpose The purpose of this Standard is to provide princip les and guidelines for the consistent administration of vaccines and biologicals. Applicability This standard applies to all AHS staff providing provincially fund ed vaccines and biologicals. Alberta Health Services Standard # 06.100 January 1, 2020 Immunization Program Standards Manual Page 2 of 26 Population , Public and Indigenous Health Competency In November 2008 the Public Health Agency of Canada published the Immunization Competencies for Health Professionals with a goal of promoting safe and competent practices for immunization providers. The followin g competencies outlined in that document are applicable to this standard: Types of Immunizing Agents and Their Composition - Prepares and administers immunization agents correctly. Administration of immunizing agents - Prepares and administers immunization agents correctly. This includes knowledge and understanding of techniques to reduce the pain associated with immunization. Definitions Beyond -use-date - new expiry date after opening a multi -dose vial. A beyond -use date must never extend beyond the manufacturer's expiry date . Manufacturer's expiration date - expiry date printed on the vaccine/biological by manufacturer . If the expiry date is only a month and year, the last day of the month would be used as the expiry date. Infant : birth up to 12 months of age Toddler: children 1 year of age up to and including 3 years of age Preschooler : children 4 years of age up to and including 6 years of age School Age : children in grade 1 up to the end of grade 12 Adolescent : 12 years up to and including 17 years of a ge Adult : 18 years of age and older Section 1: Preparation for Administration of Vaccine and Biological Products Standard Precautions : Biological products, syringes and needles are considered sterile once manufactured. Aseptic technique must be practiced when preparing these products. All vaccine vial stoppers are to be swabbed prior to use whether they are single dose or multi dose vials. Vial stoppers are not considered to be sterile even if the protective caps are in place.3 Wash hands well using soap a nd water, or a waterless hand cleaner prior to preparing biological products and between clients. Glove use i s NOT necessary, unless the immunizer will come in contact with body fluids or the skin on their hands is not intact. Gloves must be changed betwee n clients and hands cleaned before donning new gloves . Use separate, sterile safety engineered sharp devices (SEDS) for each injection. Engage the safety mechanism on needles immediately following administration of the biological product. Immediately disca rd the syringe/needle into a sharps container that is within arm's reach and easy view of the immunizer, but placed safely away from clients (and children). Never recap needles or empty used needles/syringes from one sharps container to another. Discard co tton balls into the regular garbage. If saturated with blood, dispose into sharps container. Sharps containers should be locked and changed when 2/3 full to avoid overfilling/packing of contents. When transporting sharps containers that are less than 2/3 full (either within the clinic setting or when using for off -site clinics), snap them closed securely . They can be reopened later for continued use. Excess pressure on containers should be avoided during transport. Alberta Health Services Standard # 06.100 January 1, 2020 Immunization Program Standards Manual Page 3 of 26 Population , Public and Indigenous Health Product Preparation : If immunizing more than one individual at the same clinic appointment, it is recommended to draw up and administer all the immunizations for the one individual before proceeding to the next. Check the expiry date of all products being administered, including diluent. Expir ed vaccine and diluent should never be administered . If only the month and year are provided for the expiry date, the vaccine can be used to the end of that month. Vaccine should be withdrawn from the vial by the immunizer administering the vaccine. Different vaccines must never be combined in the same syringe. Disposable syringes are not meant for storage of vaccines and biologicals . With the exception of vaccines or biologicals supplied preloaded by the manufacturer, syringes should not be preloaded due to uncertainty of vaccine stability in disposable syringes, the risk of contamination, an increased potential for vaccine administration errors and vaccine wastage.1 Live vaccines should be reconstituted and drawn up just prior to administration, as they are unstable and begin to deteriorate immediately after reconstitution. Refer to the product monograph for specific instructions . The needle should only be changed between drawing up and administering the vaccine/biological if the needle is: o bent o damaged o contaminated For viscous products it may be necessary to use blunt fill or larger bore needles. In this situation, it is necessary to change the needle as blunt fill or large bore needles should not be used to administer vaccines. Express air only until a drop of fluid is visible on tip of needle . Section 2 - Preparation Instructions General : When preparing any biological product, consider the \"7 Rights\" of immunization: o Right product (e.g., biological, vaccine and diluents)5,17,39 o Right client o Right dose o Right time (date and interval) o Right route, needle length and technique o Right reason (e.g., meet vaccine eligibility criteria) o Right documentation Thoroughly clean hands using soap and water or a waterless hand cleaner . Prepare necessary materials (e. g. single use, disposable sterile syringe/needle, vaccine, diluent if required, 70% isopropyl alcohol, sharps container, supplies for the management of anaphylaxis) Check the name, dosage and expiry date of the vaccine /biological and diluent three times in relation to the assessment of the client and their immunization history5 o When removing from the fridge or biological cooler o When drawing up/reconstituting the product o Before administration Visually inspect the vaccine /biological to ensure it appears as ex pected, per monograph, and there is no particulate. Do not administer if there is particulate that does not dissolve. Shake or roll container (according to manufacturer's instructions) before loading syringe and administering. Only use diluent supplied by the manufacturer for the same manufacturer's vaccine product.10 o Not all diluents are just sterile water and may contain a variety of components: stabilizers, bactericides, pH buffers, or chemicals to assist in dissolving the vaccine. o Diluent supplied for a vaccine m ay be a specific volume . Alberta Health Services Standard # 06.100 January 1, 2020 Immunization Program Standards Manual Page 4 of 26 Population , Public and Indigenous Health Vials : Thoroughly clean hands using soap and water or a waterless hand cleaner . Remove the cap from a single dose vial only after the vaccine has been confirmed and a fit to immunize assessment has been completed. If the cap has been removed from a single dose vial, the vaccine must be used by the end of the day or it is to be discarded. For a new vial , uncap the vaccine vial, clean the rubber stopper of the vial wi th an alcohol swab and allow to dry as some vaccine can be inactivated by alcohol. For a previously opened multi -dose vial , wipe off the rubber stopper with an alcohol swab and allow to dry before subsequent uses. Gently shake or roll the vial immediately before removing each dose to ensure that the contents are fully dispersed. For products that do not require reconstitution , draw into the syringe a volume of air equal to the quantity of biological product to be removed and inject into the vial . o The exception to this would be purified protein derivative (PPD) - it is not recommended to inject air into the vial prior to drawing up as this can cause oxidation of the biological and leakage from the vial stopper . For lyophilized products that require reconstitution, inject air equal to the volume of diluent into t he diluent vial. Draw up the diluent, and introduce it down the side of the vaccine vial , not directly into the vaccine powder, to avoid foaming or potential denaturing of the vaccine protein. Mix t he reconstituted vaccine with a careful swirling motion un til a uniform suspension is achieved prior to administration, unless otherwise instructed by the manufacturer. There is n o need to add air to the vial containing the lyophilized product . Place the vial right side up and insert the needle through the centr e of the rubber stopper. Slowly inject air or diluent from the syringe, except for PPD .11 Hold the vial upside down and withdraw the required quantity of biological product into the syringe. Refer to vaccine specific biological page for required volume. To assist with withdrawal of product from inverted vials, ensure end of the needle is below fluid level and situated in the groove of the vial stopper.5,6,7,12 Remove the needle from the vial and expel the air bubble(s). Never detach the needle from the s yringe and never leave the needle in a multi -dose vial to draw up further doses. Once vaccine has been withdrawn from a vial, it cannot be returned into the vial. For situations where the vaccine /biological dose required necessitates using more than one v ial (e.g., rabies immune globulin) multiple vials can be combined into the same syringe as long as the lot number is the same. If lot numbers are different then different syringes and different injection sites must be used. This does not apply to multi -dose vials (e.g., influenza vaccine) where vaccine/biological will be administered to multiple individuals. If entering a multi -dose vial for the first time, record the day opened on the vial using yyyy= 4 digit year, Mon= 3 letter month, dd= 2 digit date . Once vaccine has been withdrawn from a multi -dose vial, immediately r eturn it to temperature controlled storage container . Record on client health record. Use the lot number on box . Alberta Health Services Standard # 06.100 January 1, 2020 Immunization Program Standards Manual Page 5 of 26 Population , Public and Indigenous Health Amp oules: Thoroughly clean hands using soap and water or a waterless han d cleaner . Tap the ampoule lightly to ensure that the contents are in the lower part of the ampoule. Wrap an alcohol swab around the neck of the ampoule. Snap the top off by breaking it away from your body.12 Discard the neck of the ampoule in the sharps container. Withdraw the contents of the ampoule wit h a sterile syringe and needle. Filter needles are not indicated routinely for drawing up biological products or epinephrine from glass ampoules5. The reasons are as follows: o Vaccines and biological s are s upplied in small ampoules and fewer glass shards are introduced into the ampoule contents when opening this size of ampoule . 6, 7 o Exception - Ampoules larger than 1 mL have an increased risk of producing glass shards ; therefore filter needle s are recommend ed in these situations (e.g., Synagis\u00ae) o Fewer shards will potentially be drawn into smaller bore needles used for immunization6 (e.g., needles 23 G , 25 G, 27 G ) o Using an alcohol swab when opening the ampoule will reduce the risk of glass shards entering the ampoule contents o Filter needles could potentially filter out particulate matter such as adjuvants or other active ingredients, making a vaccine less effectiv e.5 Do not add air to the ampoule . Expel air bubble(s) from the syringe. Discard the ampoule in a sharps container. Record on client health record. Use the lot number on box. Prefilled Syringe : Thoroughly clean hands using soap and water or a waterless hand cleaner . Ensure lot number on syringe and box match as syringe is discarded after administeri ng vaccine. Shake or rotate syringe according to biological product monograph instructions. Grasp needle -cap firmly near end where needle attaches to syringe. For syringes with needle attached, rotate rubber needle -cap slowly until loosened. Slowly slide o ff the cap. For separate needles and syringes , firmly attach the needle onto the syringe with a push and clockwise twist. Use caution with products that have special safety engineered shields. Slowly eject the air bubble. If plunger is hard to push, hold syringe in one hand, and slowly rotate plunger clockwise (looking down on end of plunger) while pushing it into the barrel. (NOTE: Rotating plunger counter -clockwise may cause plunger to detach). If a needle has been placed on a preloaded syringe, the ste rile seal has been broken and the vaccine must be used or discarded in the time noted in the product monograph. Discard syringe and the attached needle in sharps container. Record on client health record. Use the lot number on box . Alberta Health Services Standard # 06.100 January 1, 2020 Immunization Program Standards Manual Page 6 of 26 Population , Public and Indigenous Health Oral Applicator : Thoroughly clean hands using soap and water or a waterless hand cleaner . Ensure lot number on syringe and box match as syringe is discarded after administering vaccine. Shake or rotate oral applicator according to biological product monograph instructions. Rem ove protective cap from oral applicator. Once the oral vaccine has been administered discard the applicator in the sharps container. Record on client health record. Use lot number on box. Section 3: Injection Site, Volume and Equipment Choose an injection site: Use clinical judgment to select an appropriate injection site and needle size. This assessment is based upon: Individual's age Volume of biological product to be administered Viscosity of biological product Adequacy of muscle mass Recommended route of administration for the biological Individual's u nique characteristics e.g., mastectomy, available limbs Number of products to be administered After selecting the appropriate injection s ite, inspect the skin's surface over the site. Do not inject vaccin e where there are bruises, scars, inflammation, masses, edema or tenderness as there might be interference with absorption of the biological. Both intramuscular (IM) and subcutaneous (SC) vaccines may be given through a tattoo. The literature contains var ying recommendations regarding the maximum number of injections and maximum volume of all injections to be given into one muscle. The decision regarding number of injections and maximum volume to be administered should be based on the age and assessed musc le mass of the individual.5 If multiple parenteral injections are required, use separate anatomic injection sites (different limbs) whenever possible . If multiple injections in the same limb are required, separate the injection sites by at least 2.5 cm (1 inch). In individuals where there is insufficient deltoid muscle mass, use the anterolateral thigh muscle.17 Use of separate limbs or adequate separation assists in differentiation of local adverse events following immunization.5 Do not administer a ctive immunizing agents into the gluteal muscles due to the risk of reduced immunogenicity from po or absorption if the injection does not reach the muscle.17 Choose a Route : Vacci nes should be given by the route recommended by the manufacturer because data reg arding safety and efficacy of alternate routes are limited. When a vaccine monograph notes an immunization can be given by either SC or IM, the IM route is preferred .13, 14 Alternate routes may be considered in special circumstances. Consultation with an MOH or designate is required. If a vaccine has been inadvertently given by a route other than that recommended by the manufacturer, contact the MOH or designate for recommendations for follow -up. Alberta Health Services Standard # 06.100 January 1, 2020 Immunization Program Standards Manual Page 7 of 26 Population , Public and Indigenous Health An appropriate gauge and length of needle must be chosen t o ensure that the vaccine is deposited within the proper tissue layer to decrease the chance of local adverse events and ensure efficacy . In general, vaccines containing adjuvant are administered IM to avoid irritation, induration, skin discoloration, in flammation, and granuloma formation. Most inactivated vaccines are given via the IM route , with a few exceptions. Needle length should be sufficient to reach the largest part of the muscle for IM injections to prevent the biological from being deposited into subcutaneous tissue and reduce the risk of abscess formation. Use of longer needles has been associated with less redness and swelling at the immunization site than occurs with shorter needles.5 Table 1: Injection Site, Age, Volume, and Equipment Gui delines 5, 15, 16, 17 , 18 a. Needle length may need to be adjusted based on nurse assessment of muscle size and subcutaneous tissue present . The following technique may help assess needle length for IM injections for clients who fall outside of the average range for weight and height or muscle mass. If using the deltoid or vastus lateralis muscle grasp the muscle between thumb and index finger. One half the distance between the thumb and index finger will be the approximate length of the needle required to penetrate that muscle.5 Make sure to also take the thickness of the adipose tissue into account. Route Site Age Needle Size/Lengtha Volume per Muscleb Intramuscular (IM) Vastus Lateralis Younger than 12 mo nths 25G 1\" 0.5 - 1.0 mL 12 months to preschool 25G 1\" 0.5 - 1.5 mL School age to 15 years 25G 1\"- 1\u00bd\" 0.5 - 4.0 mL 15 years and older 25G 1\" -- 1\u00bd\" Up - 5.0 mL Deltoid 12 months and older 25G 5/8\" - 1\" 0.5 - 1.0 m L School age to 15 y ears 25G 1\" 0.5 - 1.5 m L 15 years and older 25G 1\" - 1\u00bd\" 0.5 - 2.0 m L Ventroglutealc (immunoglobulin products only) Preschool age and youngerd 22G 1\" 0.5 - 1.5 mL School age to 15 yrs 22G 1\" - 1\u00bd\" 0.5 -- 2.5 mL 15 yrs. and older 22G 1\u00bd\" 2.0 - 5.0 mL Subcutaneous (SC) Usually given into the subcutaneous tissue of the upper outer triceps area of the arm. Other sites may be used if needed (e.g., antero - lateral thigh) .e All ages 25G 5/8\" 0.5 - 1.0 mL Intradermal (ID) Usually the flexor surface of the forearm, although mid - deltoid (e.g., for rabies vaccine given ID) may be used. All ages 26G - 27G 3/8\" - 5/8\" 0.1 mL Alberta Health Services Standard # 06.100 January 1, 2020 Immunization Program Standards Manual Page 8 of 26 Population , Public and Indigenous Health b. Adjust maximum volume according to muscle size. c. The dorsogluteal site is only recommended in adolescents and adults when the deltoid, vastus lateralis and ventrogluteal sites bilate rally have had maximum volume of an immune globulin preparation injected and an additional volume still needs to be administered. This is due to the possibility of sciatic nerve injuries when the injection is done in the dorsogluteal site. Gluteal muscles should never be used for active vaccine administration. d. For the majority of infants the vastus lateralis is the recommended site for injection because it provides a large muscle mass. I n extremely rare situations where the gluteal muscle must be used, care should be taken to define the anatomic landmarks for the ventrogluteal site to avoid injury of the sciatic nerve. e. For infants under 12 months of age, the usual site for SC administration of vaccine is the subcutaneous tissue of the anterolateral thigh. Special Considerations : Limb Integrity: Do not administer an immunizing agent in a limb that is likely to be affected by a lymphatic system problem, such as lymphedema or mastectomy with lymph node curettage. Vastus lateralis is an alternative site for all ages. Individuals who present with A-V fistula (vascular shunt for hemodialysis) and those lymph node curettage , axilla lymphade nectomies, limb paralysis and upper limb amputations may have short term or long term circulatory (e.g., lymphatic systems) implications that may impair vaccine absorption and antibody production. Bleeding Disorders: Individuals with a bleeding disorder or who are receiving anticoagulant therapy may develop hematomas in IM injection sites. When any intramuscularly administered vaccine is indicated for a patient with a bleeding disorder : Only one injection per muscle mass should be administered at each visit . A 23-gauge or finer needle should be used and the vaccine should be injected slowly . Apply f irm pressure to the site for at least 5 to 10 minutes after injection . Stabilization of the limb is of utmost importance and will reduce the risk of a hematoma . The site s hould not be rubbed or massaged. Instruct client/parent to monitor limb and to report any concerns to their hematologist immediately . Individuals receiving long -term anticoagulation with either warfarin or heparin are not considered to be at higher risk of bleeding complications following immunization . o They may be safely immunized through either the IM or subcutaneous (SC) route as recommended for the vaccine product, without discontinuation of their anticoagulation therapy. o Give IM vaccines using a small gauge needle (23 gauge or smaller) and ask the client to apply firm pressure to the injection site for 5 to 10 minutes. o There is a lack of evidence on whether there is an increased risk of bleeding complications following immunization with the newer types of anticoagulants, such as antiplatelet agents, but there is no reason to expect th at there is a greater risk of bleeding complications than with other anticoagulants. Alberta Health Services Standard # 06.100 January 1, 2020 Immunization Program Standards Manual Page 9 of 26 Population , Public and Indigenous Health Section 4 : Injection Technique Vaccines and biological s are injected by intradermal (ID), intramuscular (IM) or subcutaneous (SC) routes . The following are guideline s for each injection route . Do not massage the area after injection, as this can damage the underlying tissue or force vaccine up the needle track. Application of \"band -aids\" is not routinely recommended and may pose potential risks such as pain when band-aid is removed, and may be a potential choking hazard for young children. Reactions to band -aids may also be confused as a reaction to the vaccine. Parents requesting band -aids may be accom modated. Intradermal Injection Technique 2, 15, 19 Thoroughly clean hands using soap and water or a waterless hand cleaner . Choose an area of skin that is intact with good integrity . o Inspect for any pre -existing lumps, sebaceous cysts or scars16. o EMLA cream is not to be used for tuberculin testing.19 Thoroughly clean hands using soap and water or a waterless hand cleaner again . Draw up vaccine or biological per product instructions. Cleanse the injection site with new a lcohol swab by circling from the centre of the site outward for 1-2 inches. Let dry. Ensure the safety activator is on the same side of the syringe as the needle bevel. Stretch the selected area of skin taut between the thumb and forefinger. Hold the syringe with the needle bevel facing up and parallel to the site. Slowly insert the needle, in -between your thumb and forefinger, at a 5 - 15 degree angle Figure 1: Intradermal Injection33 Alberta Health Services: Public Health Central Zone. \"Administration of Biological Products\". Revised 06 -Jul- 2010. Release the stretched skin and hold the syringe in place with your thumb and forefinger. Maintain stability of limb and needle at all times. Grip the flange of the syringe between the first and middle fingers. S lowly depress the plunger . No aspiration. o You should feel fairly firm resistance during de pression o A tense, pale wheal or \"bleb\" should be seen. If not, re -administer immediately in opposite arm site.

Cleanse the injection site with new alcohol sw ab by circling from the centre of the site outward for 1-2 inches. Let dry. Bunch or squeeze the muscle between the non -dominant thumb and forefinger before injection to increase muscle mass and minimize the chance of striking bone . This bunching method is most commonly used for pediatric and geriatric or emaciated clients with reduced muscle mass when using a 1\" needle .7 Alternatively p lace your thumb and forefinger on either side of the site of injection and press the area flat. This method is recommende d when nursing judgement has deemed a 5/8\" needle appropriate for use based on client assessment. Insert the needle at an angle of 90\u00b0 to the skin to the desired depth.1, 9, 11, 16, 18, 20, 21 Alberta Health Services Standard # 06.100 January 1, 2020 Immunization Program Standards Manual Page 11 of 26 Population , Public and Indigenous Health Aspiration is not necessary; however, if blood is noticed in th e hub of the syringe, the needle should be withdrawn immediately and the needle and syringe including vaccine contents discarded. A new needle and syringe with vaccine will need to be prepared.1, 7, 11, 16, 17, 29, 30 Administer the vaccine29 while mainta ining stability of the limb and needle at all times. Rapid injection is not recommended for more viscous biological products such as immune globulin products. Remove the needle quickly. Activate the safety mechanism and discard into sharps container.

If you notice anything abnormal, do not use vaccine. Vaccine is given orally - straight from the tube, no mixing is necessary. Alberta Health Services Standard # 06.100 January 1, 2020 Immunization Program Standards Manual Page 16 of 26 Population , Public and Indigenous Health Get the tu be ready: Pull cap off and keep cap - you need cap to pierce the membrane. Repeatedly flick the top of the tube just below the membrane until it is clear of liquid. Turn cap upside down (180\u00b0) and position to open tube (there is a small spike inside the centre of the cap ). Keep the tube upright Hold the side s of the tube . Press the cap down to pierce the membrane then lift off cap. You do not need to twist. Check that the membrane has been pierced - there should be a hole at the top of the tube. If the membrane has not been pierced repeat steps. Administer vaccine immediately after opening: Position child leaning slightly backwards Squeeze liquid gently into the side of the child's mouth towards the inside of the cheek. Tube may need to be squeezed a few times to get all of vaccine out. It is okay if a drop remains in the tip of the tube. Once documentation is complete, discard the empty tube and cap in approved biological waste containers according to local regulations. Alberta Health Services Standard # 06.100 January 1, 2020 Immunization Program Standards Manual Page 17 of 26 Population , Public and Indigenous Health Figur e 12: RotaTeq\u00ae vaccine - each dose is supplied in a container consisting of a squeezable plastic, latex -free dosing tube with a twist -off cap, allowing for direct oral administration.

Clear the fluid from the dispensing tip by holding tube vertically and tapping cap. Open the dosing tube in 2 easy motions: 1. Puncture the dispensing tip by screwing cap clockwise until it becomes tight. 2. Remove cap by turning it counterclockwise. Administer dose by gently squeezing liquid into infant's mouth toward the inner c heek until dosing tube is empty (a residual drop may remain in the tip of the tube.) Once documentation is complete, d iscard the empty tube and cap in approved biological waste containers according to local regulations. Alberta Health Services Standard # 06.100 January 1, 2020 Immunization Program Standards Manual Page 18 of 26 Population , Public and Indigenous Health Oral Administration through a Nasogastric or Nasoje junal Tube Rotavirus vaccine can be administered via a nasogastric tube (NG) or a nasojejunal (NJ) tube. Parent/caregiver should be engaged in ensur ing appropriate tube placement and flush ing of tube pre and post administration of vaccine. It is the respon sibility of the health care provider to administer the vaccine. For additional information related to oral vaccine administration via NG tube see link. https://insite.albertahealthservices.ca/Main/assets/tms/phc/tms -phc-vs-oral-vaccine -administration - through -a-ng-tube-instructions.pdf Section 5: Client Position and Stabilization Stabilization measures are ne cessary to protect the child /client , minimize discomfort, and provide for client and nurse safety during the immunization procedure. The nurse should never assume that a particular child /client will be able to remain still during immunization. The immuniza tion procedure along with the stabilization guidelines should be carefully explained to the accompanying parent/guardian prior to administering the injection and the parent/guardian should always be involved in holding the child. It is essential that the p arent/guardian be aware that their role in holding the child is to stabilize the child and the limb while the nurse's role is to administer the injection. The nurse must be able to maintain control of the site and the needle during immunization. Assistance from another nurse should be sought when necessary to ensure adequate stabilization . In circumstances where excessive restraint would be necessary in order to ensure stability of the site (such as with an extremely combative older child or handicapped i ndividual), the nurse should defer the immunization until such time that the immunization can be accomplished with the use of normal stabilization measures. Consultation with MOH/MOH designate may be required under special circumstances. When immunizing i n the school, every effort should be made to enlist the child's cooperation; with some children this will require extra time and explanation. Occasionally, assistance from another nurse or staff member may be required to help distract and/or comfort the ch ild. It is acceptable, with the child's permission, to hold the child's hand or arm to avoid sudden movement. Excessive restraint (i.e. physical restraint, or holding child against their will) should not be used. If the child's cooperation cannot be obtain ed, the parent/guardian should be notified and alternate arrangements for immunization should be made . Choice of stabilization method depends on type of injection, site and age of child. Infants and Toddlers 1. Vastus lateralis Ask the parent/guardian to ho ld the child on their lap in a seated or semi -recumbent position so that the vastus lateralis site is clearly visible , with the child's arm tucked behind the parent. The child's head should rest on the parent/guardian's arm with the outside arm being held . Instruct the parent/guardian to hold the child 's outside leg around the calf or knee. Alternately, the parent/guardian may place the child's feet between their legs and secure the child's legs with their hand. If using this method, ensure parent/guardian sits forward in chair so the child cannot push their feet against the chair. The immunizer should hold the thigh to ensure proper stability of the site. Alberta Health Services Standard # 06.100 January 1, 2020 Immunization Program Standards Manual Page 19 of 26 Population , Public and Indigenous Health Figure 12: Stabilization Technique for Vastus lateralis Ensure the child's arm that is pos itioned closest to the caregiver, is tucked into the parent/guardian's side or placed behind the caregiver's back. The child's other arm is controlled with the parent/guardian's arm and hand placed over it. In the case of children under 1 year of age, the caregiver can control both arms with one hand. Instruct and guide the caregiver to firmly hold the child's legs and feet between his or her thighs and control them with their free hand. The caregiver's hand may be placed over the child's knee to prevent th e leg from being raised by the child during the immunization above in Figure 1 1. 2. Deltoid Ask the parent/guardian to hold the child so that the deltoid site is clearly visible and the child is firmly restrained to prevent movement during the immunization. Ask the parent/guardian to fully uncover/unclothe the child's arm and hold the child in a seated or semirecumbent position on their lap as in the Figure 12 below. Figure 13: Stabilization Technique for Deltoid Ensure the child's arm that is position ed closest to the caregiver is tucked into the parent/guardian's side or plac ed behind their back. The child's other arm is controlled with the parent/guardian's arm and hand placed over it as pictured above. Ask the parent/guardian to firmly hold the chil d's legs and feet between his or her thighs, and control them with their free hand, if necessary. Alberta Health Services Standard # 06.100 January 1, 2020 Immunization Program Standards Manual Page 20 of 26 Population , Public and Indigenous Health 3. Intradermal Injection Ask the parent/guardian to sit the child sideways on their lap with the child's legs between the parent/guardian's legs. The parent/gu ardian should hold the child snugly by wrapping their arm around the child's body. The parent/guardian can hold the child's left hand with their left hand and extend the child's arm so the flexor area of the forearm is exposed. If possible, rest the child' s arm on a firm surface. The nurse will hold the forearm to ensure proper stability of the site. Figure 14: Stabilization for Intradermal Injection School Aged and Older Children Deltoid Verbally instruct and physically guide the caregiver to hold the child so that the deltoid site is clearly visible and the child is firmly restrained to prevent movement during the immunization. Ask the caregiver to fully uncover/unclothe the child's arm and seat the child on parent's lap or have the child stand in fr ont of the seated caregiver. Ensure the child's arm that is positioned closest to the caregiver is placed behind the caregiver's back. The child's other arm is held close to the child's body with the caregiver's arm and hand placed over it as pictured abov e. Alberta Health Services Standard # 06.100 January 1, 2020 Immunization Program Standards Manual Page 21 of 26 Population , Public and Indigenous Health Section 6: Client Observation Advise recipients of any biological product to remain under observation for at least 15 minutes following the immunization regardless of whether or not they have had the biological product previously. Extend the obser vation period to 30 minutes when a person has a history of anaphylactic reaction to any agent (vaccines, biological , drugs, food, bee stings, etc.).15 Section 7: Management of Pain and Anxiety The purpose of this section is to provide strategies and inte rventions that health care providers and parents can use to reduce and/or prevent anxiety before and during administration of vaccines. Pain management is often based on a \" 5-P\" approach54: Physical Procedural Psychological Pharmacological Process The s trategies included in this section incorporate interventions from each approach. Wherever possible it is recommended that public health incorporate pain management activities into their immunization clinic routines . For infection control reasons, fabric products and items that will be touched by the client (e.g., distraction toys, pinwheels , and sweet tasting solutions) should be brought by the client/parent and not supplied by public health. Physical : Position of client : o Children three years of age and you nger - sitting upright and being held by a parent before, during and after the procedure are associated with reduced pain during immunization as compared to supine (lying down). For infants 0 to 1 month of age that may be immunized in the hospital setting, skin-to-skin (kangaroo care) can be considered. This involves placing a diaper -clad infant prone on the mother's chest before, during and after vaccine administration. o Children three years of age and older (including adults) - sitting upright promotes a sense of control which can have a positive impact on their experience of pain. The only exception would be if the client prefers to lie supine, or there is a history of fainting. Breastfeeding in children 0 to 2 years of age before, during and after proce dure - this has been shown to have analgesic effects by combining a number of interventions to reduce pain in infants - presence of a comforting person, holding the child, skin to skin contact (physical sensation), feelings of satiety, the act of sucking ( diversion) and sweet -tasting milk and other chemicals in the milk that produce analgesia and relaxation . Research indicates that infants who are breastfed during immunization do not experience aspiration, vomiting, cyanosis or respiratory changes during th e procedure. Alternatively, a baby can be held and bottle -fed with expressed breast milk or formula throughout the procedure which simulates aspects of breastfeeding and may confer benefit. Sucking / pacifier before, during and after injection in children 0 to 2 years of age - non- nutritive sucking (e.g. pacifier or engaging in thumb sucking ) before, during and after vaccine administration , has been shown to have an algesic effects . Sweet tasting solutions can be combined with non -nutritive sucking in childr en 0 to 2 years of age . Alberta Health Services Standard # 06.100 January 1, 2020 Immunization Program Standards Manual Page 22 of 26 Population , Public and Indigenous Health Individuals greater than or equal to 7 years of age with history of fainting - The individual should be screened for prior episodes of fainting and appropriate interventions should be considered prior to immunization (e.g., the cli ent can be immunized lying down ). Procedural : Aspiration - aspiration before injection can increase the length of time the needle is in the tissue and potentiate the she aring action of the needle. Aspiration is not deemed necessary when immunizing because the sites recommended for immunization do not have large blood vessels. Order of vaccines - Research indicates that giving the most painful vaccine last decreases overall pain from injections. This strategy is recommended for all age groups. If an infant is getting rotavirus vaccine it is recommended to provide this vaccine first as rotavirus has a high concentration of sucrose (see Pharmacological section for more information on sweet -tasting solutions) . NOTE - simultaneous injections (immunizing with two nurses at the same time) are not recommended due to a lack of strong evidence of effectiveness and lack of feasibility. Psychological : Provide a verbal signal of impending procedure - this will help decrease the chan ce of sudden movements in individuals being immunized. Some suggestions include: \" Here I go...\" or \"On three...one, t wo three... \" Be cognizant of those who have indicated they would prefer to disengage, or they are so distressed that providing a prompt will increase their stress. Neutral language / watch non -verbals - instead of warning about the painful aspects of the procedure, use neutral language. Some suggestion s include: \" You will feel some pressure / squeezing / a twinge ...\" versus \"You will feel a sting / stab / ach e\". Avoid negative facial expressions (grimaces etc.). Parent Coaching - parent behaviours that can decrease children's pain -related distress include remaining calm, being matter -of-fact, including humour, and redirecting the child's attention. Distraction - involves taking attention away from the procedure. Involve parents and children in helping to select the best distraction strategies by offering a variety of suggestions. Choose age - appropriate strategies (for example - parent supplied toys and iPods, breathing with a toy, (pinwhee ls, bubbles ). Adults and adolescent s can use breathing interventions ( blowing, cough or deep breathing ). Note: If sites choose to allow the use of bubbles (supplied by the client) as a distraction, soap residue on the floor should be wiped up with a paper towel immediately to avoid a slip hazard. Cleaning staff should be notified so proper cleaning products can be used in areas where soap residue may have accumulated on the floor. Environment - Establish an environment that facilitates trust and respect. I mmunize the most anxious children first. Ensure the limb is stabilized just prior to vaccine administration . When possible, p rovide a private room for immunization . NOTE - It is not the expectation for the PHN to provide counselling regarding severe needle phobia. Alberta Health Services Standard # 06.100 January 1, 2020 Immunization Program Standards Manual Page 23 of 26 Population , Public and Indigenous Health Pharmacological : Sweet tasting solution (sugar water) : o Is an analgesic in infants. Proposed mechanism of analges ia involves release of endogenous opioids and distraction. o It is r ecommend ed that parents be support ed if they choose to use swe et-tasting solutions for children 2 years of age and younger who are not breastfed or bottle -fed during immunization. o Sweet tasting solutions are indicated for the management of painful procedures, not for general comfort or as a food supplement. o Adminis tration should take place 1 to 2 minutes before vaccine administration and the analgesic effect may last for up to 5 minutes. o For children receiving rotavirus vaccine the use of sweet tasting solutions may not be necessary as there is indication that rota virus vaccine could have a similar affect. If a child is getting rotavirus vaccine it is recommended to provide this vaccine first. o The use of sweet tasting solutions is not necessary for infants 0 to 2 years of age. If the infant is breastfed or bottle -fed, this is the preferred pain relieving intervention for this age group. Sweet tasting solutions can be combined with non -nutrit ive sucking in children 0 to 2 years of age Topical anesthetic creams and gels can reduce pain from cutaneous needle procedure s. If parents wish to use topical anesthetic creams/gels they should be referred to their physician or pharmacist for product recommendations and instructions for use. The Public Health Nurse can educate the individuals/p arent about the exact site or sites of vaccine administration. o Strategies NOT currently recommended: Skin -cooling techniques (vapo-coolants (e.g. Buzzy, Pain Ease ) and ice packs ): There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of skin -cooling techniques to reduce pain a t the time of injection in children and adolescents . Oral analgesics (acetaminophen /ibuprofen ): There is no demonstrated benefit of administering an oral analgesic to reduce injection pain at the time of immunization. Process (education and implementati on): All vaccine administrators should be educated in pain management techniques. Pain management strategies can be put into practice via various methods - verbal instruction, pamphlet, videos .
