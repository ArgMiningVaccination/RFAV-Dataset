Stein, MD Director, Office of New Drugs CDER/FDA Duke -Margolis Meeting: Translational key drug development -and in supporting regulatory decision -making Translational work, e.g., biomarkers, may not fulfill its potential in drug development unless the discovery phase is followed by adequate analytic and clinical validation Partnering with drug developers, consortia can allow translational science discoveries to fulfill their potential in drug developmentIntroductionwww.fda.gov12 BEST Resource: Biomarkers, Endpoint S, and other Tools A glossary of terminology and uses of biomarkers and endpoints in basic biomedical research, medical product development, and clinical care Created by the NIH -FDA Biomarker Working Group Publicly available a: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK326791/ BEST harmonizes terms and definitions and addresses nuances of usage and interpretation among various stakeholders, including: Biomedical scientists Translational and clinical researchers Medical product developers Patient/disease advocacy groups Government officials Clinicians Biomedical scientists Translational and clinical researchers Medical product developers Patient/disease advocacy groups Government officials Clinicians www.fda.gov13 BEST ( Biomarkers, Endpoint S, and other Tools) Classification: range of types Susceptibility / risk Safety biomarkerMeasures of disease presence and status Measure aspects of response to treatmentwww.fda.gov14 Potential \"regulatory\" roles of translational medicine Some key roles in early clinical development Demonstrating human target engagement Dose selection / E -R / supporting MIDD Initial PoC with PD endpoints Safety evaluation Study population selection Study enrichmentSome key roles in late clinical development Study population selection for target disease: (diagnostic BMs) Study enrichment: prognostic or predictive BMs Safety biomarkers PD BM response to correlate with effectiveness endpoints Surrogate endpoints Some key roles in supporting regulatory decision -making Defining indicated population where benefit outweighs risk for PI Surrogate endpoints to support accelerated or traditional approval Providing confirmatory evidence to support substantial evidence of effectiveness Providing supportive evidence BM supporting biosimilar approval FIH to Phase 2 Phase 3 development NDA / BLAwww.fda.gov15 Substantial evidence -a statutory standard for approval: role of confirmatory evidence As defined in Section 505(d), substantial evidence is : o\"evidence consisting of adequate and well -controlled investigation s, including clinical investigations, by experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug involved, on the basis of which it could fairly and responsibly be concluded by such experts that the drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling or proposed labeling thereof.\" FDAMA (1997) added flexibility : one A&WC trial and confirmatory evidence , if considered appropriate The FDA standard requirement for two A&WC studies Replication as scientific standard approach: reduces risk of false positive findings, bias or confounding in a single trial www.fda.gov16 Single trial plus confirmatory evidence: types of evidence Single A&WC clinical trial supported by: Results from trials in a related indication -Two or more completed A&WC trials demonstrating efficacy in an indication -FDA may accept one trial in a related indication (i.e., similar drug MOA in producing clinical benefit) Compelling mechanistic information from earlier clinical or non-clinical studies -Reliance on pharmacodynamic endpoint with well clinical endpoint -Reliance on well -established, translatable animal model Well described natural history of disease -Evidence clearly describing natural history of disease: may be natural history study, registry, compelling case series Adequate and well controlled trials from other members of same drug class -Same pharmacological target www.fda.gov17 The limitations of surrogate endpoints Not a direct measure of how a patient feels , functions or survives Intended to reflect and predict clinical benefit not measure the outcome With a surrogate endpoint, the benefit to risk balance based on assumptions regarding benefit -Challenges of translating from indirect measure to extent of clinical benefit -Often more limited trial safety exposure with surrogate endpoint -so less precision on \"risk\" -However , can still estimate \"quantum\" of benefit vs harm, even if more challenging And biomarkers may failto predict clinical benefit -residual risk that strength (or presence) of relationship to clinical endpoint is not valid -Many examples of \"sure failed -e.g., NSVT and deathwww.fda.gov18 Using confirmatory evidence to meet substantial evidence of effectiveness Pharmacodynamic or mechanistic information providing confirmatory evidence must be robust, using biomarkers that are well understood However , sponsors often focus on the AWC trial -especially in rare diseases where only one such trial may be feasible -Common to have detailed discussions of AWC trial design -and little discussion of confirmatory evidence Approval based upon a \"single\" AWC trial requires highly persuasive evidence (essentially comparable to two positive trials) -a high bar Essential to plan confirmatory evidence early in program -not after the fact (i.e., when the single trial does not provide highly persuasive evidence) Work to enhance analytic and clinical support for proposed biomarker or other mechanistic evidence -must start early and requires meaningful resource investment Importance of meetings with FDA divisions to discuss / support planningwww.fda.gov19 The challenges of biomarker development Disease characteristics that challenge biomarker development : -Slowly progressive, or rare, disorder impeding biomarker validation: long course to outcomes -Diseases that are genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous, especially with differences in pathogenetic mechanisms: multiple subtypes of widely accepted diagnosis -creating \"noise\" for qualification of biomarker understanding of disease pathogenesis -Many changes in proteomic, lipidomic, gene expression profile, changes in imaging etc-but limitations in separating pathogenic vs epiphenomenon (\"downstream\" of disease, or unrelated) Biomarker development is a long and resource -intensive process -Biomarker discovery : biased or unbiased screening in animal, clinical, epidemiological datasets -Early animal translational models -Clinical or validation efforts: assure accuracy reproducibility of measure with \"gold standard\" endpoints compared to candidate -with multiple different treatments (different MOAs) to show that BM works across drug classeswww.fda.gov20 The challenges of biomarker development (cont.) Many stakeholders in the mix -with potential for competing interests -Academic investigators at multiple institutions, US and ex -US -Often several academic societies in disease area with different viewpoints and membership -Different companies -both drug and device -focused may be working in the area -May be different patient stakeholder organizations Development program -related -Lack of clarity on biomarker purpose -biomarker development program aimed too broadly, seeking to validate multiple COUs -lack of focus -Lack of adequate analytic validation efforts early -unreliable assays undermining observations -Lack of cohesive planning -focused purpose, focused program Lack of infrastructure to align varying interests into cohesive development program The challenge : how to prioritize biomarker needs, focus resources, and integrate efforts across stakeholderswww.fda.gov21 The Specific Context of Use for a Biomarker Drives the Extent of Evidence Needed for Qualification Analytical Validation (establish performance and acceptance characteristics of the biomarker assay)Clinical Validation (establish that the biomarker acceptably identifies, measures, or predicts the concept of interest) Reference Ranges/ Decision PointsPre-Analytical and Stabilitywww.fda.gov22 Biomarker Integration into Drug D evelopment Biomarker Qualification Program Drug Approval Process Scientific Community Consensus Note : These pathways do not exist in isolation and many times parallel efforts are underway within or between pathways.
