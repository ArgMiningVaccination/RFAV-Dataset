It is not necessary that all the tasks suggested for each chapter/unit be conducted in class and nor is it necessary for all tasks/activities to be assessed or marked. However , students should be aware of the activities/tasks which will be considered for assessment. Activities should be built into the teaching-learning process and be a seamless part of the classroom process. The Formative Assessments should be based on both the Literature Reader and Language skills (MCB/ Workbook). The Formative tasks should take into account the four skills-Listening, Speaking, Reading and Writing. The marks for each task may be decided by the teachers, however , the weightage for each Formative Assessment should be calculated for 10%. The Summative 1 will cover all the Units taught in the First Term and the Summative 2 will cover all the Units taught in the Second Term. 3 Formative Assessment - Learning OutcomesLear ning Outcomes 1.

There was a clatter of shutters being closed hastily by trembling hands - the citizens of Paris knew that once the fury of the people was excited there was no telling what they might do. They came to an old house which had a workshop on the ground floor. A head popped out of the door to see what it was all about. \"Get him! Get Thimonier! Smash his devilish machines!\" yelled the crowd. They found the workshop without its owner . M.Thimonier had escaped by the back door. Now the fury of the demonstrators turned against the machines that were standing in the shop, ready to be delivered to buyers. They were systematically broken up and destroyed- dozens of them.

As you listen, complete the worksheet as directed. It requires a cool head rather than great skill to make a successful parachute jump. When you leave the plane you have to remain cool enough to remember not to pull the ripcord till you have counted three quite slowly . Then, during the descent, it is no use getting into a panic when the parachute develops a rapid pendulum motion. You must remain calm and pull a few of the cords to let out some of the air. Even in landing, it is a cool head that will enable you to think quickly and act quickly so that no accident may occur , for none need occur as it is only like jumping from a thirteen feet wall. 1. Skill is more important than a cool head in parachute jumping. False 2. Wait till you've counted till three before pulling the ripcord. 3. There is excess air in the parachute. 4. You can let out air from the parachute by pulling a few cords. (True) 5. While descending, you may land on a thirteen feet wall. (False) You will listen to an extract from the novel \"Born Free\".

There we saw a great old elephant, his head buried in a bush, enjoying his breakfast. Suddenly , Elsa, who had crept up from behind, took a playful swipe at one of his hind legs. A scream of shocked surprise and injured dignity followed this piece of impertinence. Then, the elephant backed from the bush and charged. Elsa hopped nimbly out of his way and quite unimpressed, began to stalk him. It was a very funny but alarming sight and we could only hope that we should not need to use our guns. Luckily , after a time, both became bored with the game, the old elephant went back to his meal and Elsa lay down, close by and went to sleep. 1. Elsa was a lion cub 2. Elsa should have been afraid of the elephant because elephants regard lions as enemies of their young. 3. The author and his friends picked up their rifles and rushed out as they were afraid the elephant would harm Elsa. 4. The elephant screamed because its dignity was hurt. 5. The encounter between Elsa and the elephant ended when both the elephant and Elsa became bored with the game. You will listen to the story of an inventor called Griffin. Listen carefully to the story and as you listen, answer the questions by ticking the correct option. The two boys started in surprise at the fresh muddy imprints of a pair of bare feet. What was a barefooted man doing on the steps of a house, in the middle of London? And where was the man? As they gazed, a remarkable sight met their eyes. A fresh footmark appeared from nowhere! Further footprints followed, one after another , descending the steps and progressing down the street. The explanation of the mystery was really simple enough. The bewildered boys had been following a scientist who had just discovered how to make the human body transparent. Griffin, the scientist, had carried out experiment after experiment to prove that the human body could become invisible. Finally , he swallowed certain rare drugs and his body became as transparent as a sheet of glass - though it also remained as solid as glass. He escaped easily enough from the boys who followed his footprints in London. But he had chosen a bad time of the year to wander about London without clothes. It was mid-winter . The air was bitterly cold and he could not do without clothes. So he decided to slip into a big London store for warmth. He soon found a suitable shop. He made his way, invisible, upstairs and came out a little later, wearing bandages round his forehead, dark glasses, false nose, big bushy side- whiskers and a large hat. To escape without being seen, he callously attacked the shopkeeper from behind, after which he robbed him of all the money he could find.

You will listen to a passage on the organisation Child Relief and You or CRY which works for child rights. As you listen to the passage, answer the questions in the worksheet by ticking the correct option. In a country as vast as ours, keeping a tab on every child is a Herculean task. Many children are still employed in factories while their childhood goes unnoticed. They wash utensils when they should be playing with dolls and get married even before they reach adolescence. Most children don't know they are entitled to certain rights - child rights. To spread awareness, Child Relief and You (CRY) has organized its annual street theatre festival, Bal Natya Utsav , at Dilli Haat. The three days festival will end on November 14, in the form of short skits and plays performed by children attached to CRY projects, schools, colleges and different NGOs such as Kutumb and Manzil. The skits will focus on the different aspects of child rights, its importance and gross violation in the country . A two-day theatre workshop for the children of CRY donors was also organized. The workshop that ended on Sunday saw the participation of about 50 children of all ages. The workshop was conducted by Walter Peter of Theatre in Education (TIE) India Trust. The Trust works with schools conducting workshops for teachers. \"In these workshops, we stress on personality development. Children learn how to be more confident through exercises of the body and mind,\" said Peter , who has had a long association with the National School of Drama. CRY has also launched a new 'CRY Child Rights Band.' Priced at Rs 65, proceeds from the sale of the band will go towards supporting child rights.

As you listen to the passage, complete the worksheet by ticking the correct option. The good thing about staying fit is that there are countless ways to do it. Cycling tones up all parts of your body from ankle to neck. Cycling exercises your entire body . Resting your body weight on your hands with the front bent forward builds up your biceps, shoulders, chest and strengthens your backbone. A cycling coach draws a parallel between cycling and swimming as both sports demand total mobilisation of the body . These games require heavy use of ankles, legs, abdomen, hips and arm muscles, thereby tightening them up and streamlining the body . Not only does cycling take care of the extra flesh, but it also strengthens the heart. A cycling coach explains how it happens. \"To begin with, cycle at a constant speed, to stabilise the heart's pumping rate. Once you are through with this stage, sprint or cycle fast over short distances as this quickens the heart's functioning and makes it stronger .\" Cycling stimulates you mentally . As the coach says, \"Cycling early in the morning refreshes you. Although cycling does not involve too many technicalities, it's important to get the basics right.\" 1. Cycling is a good way of exercising one's entire body . 2. The biceps, shoulders, chest and backbone are strengthened as one cycles with the front bent forward and resting on the hands. (True) 3.

Lionel the duck, died a few minutes later. When Nola broke the news to her customers, they were devastated. One elderly gentleman was especially heart-broken. He used to feed Lionel a slice of bread or a biscuit which he kept in his pocket especially for the occasion. They would spend an hour every weeks like that, enjoying each other's company . When he heard about Lionel's death, the old man sat down on the same bench and let the tears run freely down his cheeks. Two weeks later, he was dead. Nola also had to tell the children who used to play with Lionel on their way to school. Lionel waddled around them, muttering and letting them feel his soft white feathers while they waited for the bus. Some of the children made sympathy cards for Nola. She also received many condolences-a few from friends and many from strangers. It was only then that we realized how many friends Lionel had made; how many hearts he had touched.

Mountain biking, kayaking on the Beas river, hot air ballooning in Jaipur and Delhi, camel safari in Jaisalmer...these are just a few of the exciting activities to offer. According to Alok Bajpai, CEO, The Explorers, an organization that specializes in catering to adventure and nature travel needs, the rising popularity of adventure tourism is a direct result of satellite television beaming in exciting activities into people's homes. \"The Indian tendency to lie safe has changed over the last 10 years. When we started in 1995, adventure travel was considered something that only the tourists indulged in. Today , people have a higher disposable income to spend on such activities. Besides, adventure travel is now considered glamorous and every one wants to talk about their experiences,\" he observes. Capt. Saurabh Mahajan of Colonel's Camps & Tours, which offers adventure travel options in and around Rishikesh agrees: \"Since we started in 2000, there has been a steady increase in the number of adventure seekers. The adventurous streak is not limited to one group of people. Students, executives, housewives, senior citizens, everyone enjoys river rafting, rock climbing etc. and several corporates send their executives to us for team building, adventure-oriented activities.\" He attributes the escalating numbers to people getting adventure-oriented and schools realizing the importance of adventure sports and love for flora and fauna. Explains psychoanalyst Dr. Harish Shetty: \"A passion for adventure stems from the need to experiment, to enjoy the thrills of difficult encounters.

Sighing, he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost plank; repeated the operation; compared the insignificant whitewashed streak with the far-reaching continent of unwhitewashed fence and sat down on a tree-box, discouraged. Jim came skipping out at the gate carrying a pail and singing. Bringing water from the town pump had always been a hateful work in Tom's eyes before, but now it did not strike him so. He remembered that there was company at the pump. Boys and girls were always there waiting their turns, resting, trading playthings, quarrelling, fighting. And he remembered that although the pump was only a hundred and fifty yards off, Jim never got back with a bucket of water before an hour-and even then somebody generally had to go after him.

They have stood for nearly 5000 years, and it seems likely that they will continue to stand for thousands of years yet. They are over eighty of them scattered along the bank of the Nile, some of which are different in shape from the true pyramids. The most famous of these are the 'Step' pyramid and the 'Bent' pyramid. Some of the pyramids still look much as they must have done when they were built thousands of years ago. Most of the damage suffered by the others has been at the hands of men who were looking for treasure or, more often, for stone to use in modern buildings. The dry climate of Egypt has helped to preserve the pyramids and their very shape has made them less likely to fall into ruins. These are good reasons why they can still be seen today , but perhaps the most important is that they were planned to last forever . One thing is certain: there must have been months of careful planning before they could begin to build. The first thing they had to do was to choose a suitable place. You may think that this was an easy task, with miles and miles of empty desert around, but a pyramid could not be built just anywhere. Certain rules had to be followed strictly and certain problems overcome. The pyramid had to be on the west side of the Nile; the side on which the sun sets. This was for religious reasons. The pyramid also had to stand well above the level of the river to protect it against the regular floods. The pyramid could not be too far from the Nile, however , as the stones to build it needed to be carried in boats down the river to the nearest point. Water transport was, of course, much easier than land transport. The builders also had to find rock, which was not likely to crack under the great weight of the pyramid. Finally , the pyramid had to be near the capital, or better still, near the king's palace so that he could visit it easily and personally check the progress being made on the final resting place for his body .

The electrified barrier , which rings the Aberdare mountain range, in west central Kenya, was initially intended to keep people out in order to save the few endangered black rhino within, but has become a model for countries struggling to protect scarce water resources. Colin Church, the chair of the Kenya-based Rhino Ark conservation group and a leading expert on African wildlife, said the fence, which took 21 years for local communities to complete, had failed to save the rhino in the uplands it surrounds. However , it had succeeded in protecting a large forest area and the sources of four of seven of Kenya's largest rivers, all of which rise in the Aberdares and provide electricity and water to major cities including Nairobi. \"In the early days, the motivation was to protect the black rhino, but then we all woke up to the fact that the farmers [who lived near the fence] were celebrating, and the reality is that this forested mountain area was the lifeblood for millions of people. We realised the whole ecosystem was at stake,\" he said. \"Our thinking had to change.The Aberdares are now the most secure mountain ecosystem in the whole of Kenya and maybe Africa.\" Kenya's wildlife service is now studying whether to put electric fences around Mount Kenya, the Mau forest, Mount Elgon and the Cherangani Hills, most of which have been invaded by thousands of poor people who threaten the country's water supplies, Julius Kipng'etich, the director of the wildlife service, said. The fence, which has 8,000 miles of wire, was built largely from recycled plastic stakes made from the waste of dozens of flower farms at nearby Lake Naivasha.

By contrast, it takes as little as 30 days for a recycled glass bottle to leave your kitchen recycling bin and appear on a store shelf as a new glass container . Glass containers are 100 percent recyclable, which means they can be recycled repeatedly , again and again, with no loss of purity or quality in the glass. Recovered glass from glass recycling is the primary ingredient in all new glass containers. A typical glass container is made of as much as 70 percent recycled glass. According to industry estimates, 80 percent of all recycled glass eventually ends up as new glass containers. Every ton of glass that is recycled saves more than a ton of the raw materials needed to create new glass, including: 1,300 pounds of sand; 410 pounds of soda ash; and 380 pounds of limestone. Because glass is made from natural materials such as sand and limestone, glass containers have a low rate of chemical interaction with their contents. As a result, glass can be safely reused. Besides serving as the primary ingredient in new glass containers, recycled glass also has many other commercial uses-from creating decorative tiles and landscaping material to rebuilding eroded beaches. On the basis of your reading of the above passage, complete the following statements by choosing the correct option from those given below: 1) It is important to send used glass bottles to a recycle plant because __________________ a) they are not biodegradable. b) they can be reused. c) they can be sold. d) they can be used for decoration. 2) Recycling glass will help the _______________________________ a) industrialists. b) government c) environment d) bureaucrats 3) Glass is safe to use as it _______________________________ a) has high resistance to chemicals. b) has low resistance to chemicals. c) looks very clean. d) can be cleaned easily . 4) The material used for making glass is _______________________________ a) soda ash & limestone. b) sand & lime stone. c) soda & lime. d) sandstone & tiles. 5) People don't mind using recycled glass as it ___________________________ a) remains pure. b) is cheaper . c) is easily available. d) is rated as good.53 333 Unit Unit Formative Assessment - Reading T asks 53READING COMPREHENSION: WORKSHEET 10 It is not easy to follow a healthy lifestyle in the presence of so many forces encouraging inactivity and bad eating habits. The stress and time pressure that we experience are major reasons for ill health today . It is well established that an emotional state can be transferred from person to person found in the phenomenon of higher tipping for a happy waitress. New work in the area of network theory has yielded intriguing results with implications for health and well being. Two recent studies show that people who are surrounded by many happy people are more likely to become happy in future. Statistical models suggested that clusters of happiness result from the spread of happiness. Similarly , obesity may spread in social networks in a pattern that depends on the nature of social ties. For obesity , social distance appears to be more important than geographical distance within these networks. Could a doctor play a helpful role in such a personal network? It is a reasonable supposition, given the time honoured notion that the doctor who knows you well and cares about you will be a better doctor .

I might come across the Professor then on his after-dinner stroll; and as often as not, he would be accompanied by my father , who would stop me and demand (partly , I thought, to impress the Professor) where I was off to or where I had been; insisting, with more than his usual force, that I come home right away , with no argument.I spent long hours cycling back and forth between our house and Ross McDowell or Jimmy Larwood's, my friends from school, and the Professor's house was always on the route.I was always aboard and waiting for something significant to occur , for life somehow to declare itself and catch me up.

Since the smiley icon was created more than forty years ago, they have been brightening days of millions of people. The origin of the traditional yellow smilies is not completely clear . There are at least three competing claims for the fatherhood of round, yellow smilies. In 1963, State Mutual Life Assurance, an insurance firm in the U.S.A, was looking for ways to lift the spirits of its employees following a difficult company merger . They hired graphic artist Harvey Ball to help out. He created a round yellow button with the now familiar two dots and a half circle. The idea behind wearing the brightly-coloured buttons was to inspire the workers to smile and to help them spread good cheer . In 1971, a French entrepreneur Franklin Loufrani began using smilies as icons to highlight good news stories as a part of a newspaper promotion. The icon is now trademarked by Loufrani in more than a hundred countries, but not in the United States. The 'Official' Website for smilies can be found at SmileyW orld.com. Smilies experienced a huge explosion of popularity during the 1970s. Two brothers named Murray and Bernard Spain began producing novelty items based on the yellow smiley icon face paired with the phrase-\"Have a Happy Day\". They ignited a smilies craze that lasted from 1970 until 1972. More than 50 million smilies were manufactured during this short two-year span. Smilies have evolved with technology and are used in ways that the original designers probably never thought of. But the basic goal of the smiley icon remains the same: to communicate good feelings and to make people smile. On the basis of your reading of the passage, complete the following statements by choosing the correct option from the list of options given below: 1) \"Is it possible to even say the word \"smilies\" without smiling a little?\" means that the 'smilies' are ____________. a) comical b) infectious c) hilarious d) peculiar 2) The word \"icon\" in the second line refers to ____________________________________ a) a trademark that cannot be used by anyone else. b) a yellow button with two dots and a half circle. c) a symbol created for easy and definite recognition. d) a logo designed for the Wal-Mart group of stores.60 333 Unit Unit Formative Assessment - Reading T asks3) Murray and Bernard Spain produced items with the smiley icon and the phrase \"Have a Happy Day\". This combination was highly successful. The expression that best describes this successful combination is _____________________________________________ a) hitting the bull's eye. b) flashing a red rag to a bull. c) telling a cock and bull story . d) taking the bull by the horns. 4) \"Smilies have evolved with technology and are used in ways that the original designers probably never thought of \" can be best understood as ___________________________ a) The original designers were pretty sure that smilies could evolve so much with technology . b) With the introduction of technology , it is almost like the original designers never made smilies. c) Even with technology , the smilies are used in the same way, as the original designers planned. d) Technology expanded the scope of smilies much more than what the original designers ever imagined. 5) The sentence that presents the best summary of the passage is that ________________ a) smilies originated in 1971 and have remained popular owing to the internet. b) smilies have no definite origin, but even today are used to spread positive feelings. c) smilies originated in the USA and today are popularized solely by the Wal-Mart chain. d) smilies were used to communicate goodwill during polls and helped parties win elections.61 333 Unit Unit Formative Assessment - Reading T asksREADING COMPREHENSION: WORKSHEET 14 The fire which broke out in a Colaba guest-house recently shows that elementary precautions against fire hazards are not being taken in the city. Rooms are built on mezzanine floors without providing either ventilation or windows. Often, there is no separate exit in these structures which are added onto buildings situated in narrow lanes in highly congested areas. Fortunately , the fire at colaba broke out in the afternoon when most of the guests were out. Otherwise, the poisonous fumes from the synthetic material within would have suffocated and killed scores of people. The fire could also have spread to the entire building which is full of old wooden beams and staircases. Such scandalous fire-traps invariably endanger the lives of the fire-fighting staf f as well. What is worse, even newly constructed buildings in Mumbai ignore fire-safety norms. Clearly , the municipal staff is not doing its duty. Ironically the building which caught fire in Colaba, houses an architect's office. Had it gone up in flames, the tragedy would have been doubly compounded because society looks up to these professionals for guidance and norms. Unfortunately , with the municipal corporation also proving increasingly incapable of protecting citizen's interests, it is now up to the people to come together and oppose illegal constructions in their areas. On the basis of your reading of the passage, complete the following statements by choosing the correct option from the list of options given below: 1) The recent fire in a Colaba Guest house highlights the fact that _______________________ a) elementary measures against fire hazards are being taken. b) elementary protections against fire hazards are being ignored. c) elementary measures against fire hazards are not being taken d) elementary precautions against fire hazards are being taken in the city. 2) The fire could not prove as destructive as it could have been because ________________ a) the fire broke out in the afternoon and most of the guests were out. b) the fire did not spread to the entire building and the staircases. c) the fire broke out in the afternoon and the wooden beams and staircases did not catch fire. d) the fire broke out in the afternoon but did not reach the architect's office. 3) The author says, \"clearly the municipal staff is not doing its duty\" because _____________ a) they are constantly on leave. b) the staff is negligent and not particular about safety measures. c) they do not have enough fire -fighters. d) they are endangering the life of the fire-fighting staff62 333 Unit Unit Formative Assessment - Reading T asks4) Society looks up to these professionals for guidance and norms. \"These professionals\" refers to a) fire-fighters b) municipal Corporation c) residents of Mumbai d) architects 5) The word/phrase closest to the meaning of scandalous is _________________________ a) embarrassment b) ashamed c) causing scandals d) disgraceful63 444 Unit Unit Formative Assessment - WritingWRITIN G Objectives To enable students to write factual description of a place, object, person or process. narrate events, trends, cause and effect relationships. present arguments and opinions. express themselves through letters (formal and informal) articles, diary entries, e-mails. expand notes into a piece of writing. transcode information from a diagram, table, picture to a written form. transcribe information from one text type to another .G G G G G G G A NOTE FOR THE TEACHER The writing skill tasks should be undertaken as a class activity .
