OIG is dedicated to the mission of detec ting fraud, waste, and abuse and promoting economy and efficiency in the programs of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Oversight of the Medicare and Medicaid programs, as well as the over 300 important discretionary programs administ ered by this Department, involves careful planning and effective resource allocation. To be effective, OIG must consistently evaluate and prioritize activ ities based on existing respons ibilities, new mandates, and unforeseen events. Over the last 6 months, OIG conducted a wide range of planned activities, addressed many significant new oversight responsibil ities under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), and responded to requests for assistance from the Department and the Inspector General community after the devastating hurricanes in the Gulf region. Balancing all of thes e activities required coordination between the components within OIG, as well as effective collaboration with the Department, Inspector General communit y, Federal law enforcement, and State and local entities. OIG work during this reporting period c ontinued to focus on Medicaid activities, including Medicaid prescription drug fra ud, drug pricing under the Federal upper limit program, and State financing mechanisms us ed to maximize Medicaid payments. In addition, quality of care in nursing homes and community-based settings and durable medical equipment pricing remained OIG priorities. The MMA mandated and prudent ov ersight work was also a focal point of OIG activities during the last 6 months. OIG issued a report on Medica re drug reimbursement for cancer patients and a report examining acce ss to drugs under prescription drug plans' formularies for beneficiaries tr ansitioning from Medicaid to Medicare. OIG continued to monitor implementation of the prescription drug benefit and th e potential fraud associated with this new program. ii As demonstrated by OIG's hurricane response, to be effective, we cannot operate in isolation. We must co ntinue to work closely with our Federal, State, and local partners to leverage limited resources to achieve the maximum results for the American taxpayer. This team approach becomes even more im portant as OIG begins implementing its new Medicaid fraud responsibilities under the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. I want to express my sincer e appreciation to Congress, as well as to the senior management of the Department, for their cont inued support. I am honored to be leading an organization of highly professional and talented employees who are committed to the mission of OIG and the important program s administered by the Department. Daniel R. Levinson Inspector General iii Highlights Summary of Accomplishments For the first half of fiscal year (FY) 2006, the Office of Inspector General (OIG) reported expected recoveries of approximately $1.02 bill ion: $288 million in audit receivables and $732.4 million in investigative receivables.* Also for this semiannual period, OIG reported exclusions of 1,540 individuals and entities for fraud or abuse involving Federal health ca re programs and/or th eir beneficiaries; 226 criminal actions against individuals or entities that engaged in crimes against departmental programs; and 119 civil actions, which include False Claims Act and unjust enrichment suits filed in district court, Civil Monetary Penalties Law settlements, and administrative recoveries related to provid er self-disclosure matters. Serono Settlement Serono, S.A., along with its U.S. subsidiari es, Serono, Inc., Serono Holdings, Inc., and Serono Laboratories, Inc. (colle ctively known as Serono), agreed to enter a global criminal, civil, and administrative settlement that included the payment of $704 million plus interest and a 5-year Corporate Integrity Agreemen t (CIA). The global settlement resolved allegations that Serono engaged in the illegal promotion of its AIDS-related drug Serostim and offered and paid illegal remunerations to physicians and pharmacies to induce them to prescribe and/or purchase Serostim. The company also used an unapproved medical device as a marketing tool to diagnose AIDS-wasting syndrome, the condition that Serostim was approved to treat. SmithKline Beecham Corporation Settlement Doing business as GlaxoSmithKline, SmithKline Beecham Corporation agreed to pay the Government $149 million plus interest and ente r into a 5-year addendum to its existing CIA with OIG. The settlement resolved al legations that the pharmaceutical manufacturer engaged in certain improper pricing and mark eting practices for Zofran and Kytril, two antiemetic drugs used primarily in conjunction with oncology and radiation treatment. Exclusion of South Beach Community Hospital OIG excluded South Beach Community Hospit al (formerly South Shore Hospital and Medical Center) from participation in Medicar e, Medicaid, and other Federal health care programs based on the hospital's material breach of a CIA. This action marks the first time that OIG has sought to exclude a provider for failure to abide by the terms of a CIA previously negotiated as part of the resolution of a False Claims Act case against that provider. *This figure represents HHS investigative receivables only; receivables on behalf of other Federal agencies, States, and others are not included here. Also, savings from implemented recommendations and other actions to put funds to better use are annual only and will be reported in the fall semiannual report. iv Medicare Drug Reimbursement As required by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, OIG analyzed a new met hodology for Medicare Part B reimbursement of certain drugs and biologicals used to treat cancer pati ents. The report concluded that physician practices in the sp ecialties of hematology, hemato logy/oncology, and medical oncology could generally purchase the drugs at prices below the new reimbursement rates. OIG based this conclusion on statistical estimates, including an estimate of average prices paid for selected codes that constituted more th an 94 percent of the $4.5 billion in total 2004 Medicare-allowed amounts for drugs associated with these three physician specialties. OIG recommended that Congress consider the resu lts of this review in deliberations about drug reimbursement methodology. Deficiencies in 340B Drug Di scount Program Oversight Because of systemic problems with the accuracy and reliability of the Government's record of 340B ceiling prices, OIG found that the Heal th Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) cannot appropriately oversee the 340B Drug Pricing Program because it lacks the oversight mechanisms and authority to ensure that 340B entities pay at or below the 340B ceiling price. HRSA and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) agreed with most of OIG's recommendations and have already taken steps to improve the calculation of the 340B ceiling price. Dual Eligibles' Transition: Drug Access Under Prescription Drug Plans' Formularies This study found that \"dual eligibles\"\u2014benefi ciaries of both Medicare and Medicaid\u2014 may need targeted assistance to navigate the transition from Medicaid to the new Medicare Part D drug benefit, given the variation among Part D formularies, as well as the medical and resource challenges faced by this popu lation. Taking advantage of the options available when their drug is not covered requires knowledge and proactive effort by beneficiaries and may require additional assistance from CMS and States to ensure a smooth transition. Outside Activities of FDA Employees OIG identified several vulnerabilities that limit the ability of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to effectively review the outside activities of its employees. Departmental employees are allowed, with a pproval, to work privately with non-Federal entities on their personal time, but these ac tivities must not conflict with employees' official duties. Series of Inspections on Caseworker Visi ts for Children in Foster Care Caseworker visitation is an element critical to maintaining the safety and wellbeing of children in foster care. Two related OIG reports found that a significant number of States could not quantify the extent to which child ren were receiving visi ts, despite Federal v investment in statewide automated systems. The Administration for Children and Families is taking steps to address these issues with the States. Medicaid Upper-Payment-Limit Calculations in Four States The Federal upper payment limit is an estimate of the amount that would be paid for Medicaid services under Medicare payment princi ples. As part of a series of reviews, OIG found that four States had made large Medicaid overpayments to hospitals and/or nursing facilities because the States had not calcula ted the upper payment limits in compliance with Federal regulations and State Medicaid plans. OIG recommended that Alabama, Indiana, and New York refund a total of approximately $72.2 million to the Federal Government and that Mississippi work with CMS to resolve approxima tely $171 million in potential Federal overpayments. Departmental Financial Statement Audit For the seventh consecutive year, the Department received a \"clean\" opinion on its financial statements, meaning that the statements were reliable and fairly presented. However, the auditors noted two material wea knesses. First, the lack of an integrated financial management system and weaknesses in internal controls made it difficult for the Department to prepare timely and accurate financial statements. Second, CMS lacked comprehensive controls over the payment of Medicare managed care benefits. Material weaknesses are systemic problems that affect a number of operating di visions or problems of significant dollar amounts that affect a single division. vii OIG's Hurricane-Related Activities In the months after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita hit the Gulf Coast, OIG launched an aggressive coordinated oversigh t effort. OIG is working to ensure that: Federal response and recovery funds are spent appropriately; those attempti ng to defraud the Government are brought to justice; and the individuals responsible for the relief efforts are wise stewards in their work assisting those impact ed by the hurricanes and their aftermath. In addition, more than 2,500 HHS staff and volunteers have been sent to the Gulf States in response to the hurricane disasters. OIG is working with Federal, State, and local pa rtners in this effort, including participating as a member of the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency Homeland Security Roundtable, which is coordinating the oversi ght activities of th e various Inspectors General. In addition, along with other memb ers of the OIG community, OIG is a member of the Department of Justice Katrina task force in Baton Rouge. This task force is designed to investigate allegations of fraud re lated to Federal outlays in connection with Hurricane Katrina. Separate fr om this, OIG is conducting se veral investiga tions jointly with the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit in th e State of Louisiana in connection with allegations of poor quality of care and patient abuse and neglect that occurred during and in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. OIG has initiated extensive au dit, inspection, and investiga tive activities related to the oversight of HHS hurricane recovery effort s. A list of current projects follows. HHS Tasks Requested by FEMA As of March 31, 2006, the total spending authority for hurricane-related tasks that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) asked HHS to perform totaled $349.4 million. HHS should provide timely, accurat e, complete, and consistent accounting for Gulf Coast-related costs reimbursed by FE MA. An OIG audit will determine whether HHS is appropriately accounting for these costs. Transporting Medically Needy Evacuees OIG is evaluating the performance of a cont actor in charge of returning all Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi evacuees who require en-route medical care and therefore cannot travel via commercial air or without me dical assistance. It is estimated that 6,000 individuals may need to be transported. This contractor was awarded $21 million for Texas evacuees, and an additional $20 mill ion may be awarded when Louisiana's infrastructure is reestablished to permit tr ansporting evacuees back to their respective medical facilities. Auditing Vulnerable Hurricane-Related Procurements OIG is reviewing all hurricane-related contractual procurements over $100,000 and a sample of contracts under $100,000 in two stages. Initially, OIG is assessing the risk of fraud, waste, or abuse in these procurements. Based on these risk assessments, OIG will viii select for indepth audit the mo st vulnerable hurricane-relate d HHS procurements. These audits will specifically focus on the methods of procurement, costs incurred, and the quantity, quality, and timeliness of deliverables. Ten audits are curren tly in progress. Investigations of Qualit y of Care Allegations OIG is currently investigating 13 quality of care cases in the Gulf area. The treatment of certain beneficiaries residing in health care facilities during the disaster is being investigated based on allegations of euthanasia , gross negligence, and poor quality of care. The Use of Purchase Cards in Response to Hurricane Katrina OIG is presently analyzing the use of pur chase cards by HHS personnel deployed in response to Hurricane Katrina. The study focuses on compliance with both established and emergency HHS and agency spending guidelines and procedures. This study builds on OIG's March 2003 report \"International Merchant Purchase Authorization Card Program: Review of Calendar Year 2001 Transactions.\" That study found that 44 percent of transactions sampled did not fully comply w ith requirements for using the IMPAC cards. These past findings, combined with the urge nt nature of the responses to Hurricane Katrina, provide a useful opportunity to ex amine the use of HHS purchase cards during responses to large-scale public health emergencies. Implementation of National Response Plan Responsibilities OIG will audit HHS's implementation of its responsibilities under the National Response Plan, specifically, Emergency Support Function #8: Public Health and Medical Services. At appropriate departmental, operating divisi on, and staff division levels, OIG will assess the handling of FEMA-requested mission assign ments using established plans, objectives, and other pertinent benchmarks. The aud it results will be critical for improving departmental processes for future public emergencies. Use of Emergency Preparedness Grants in Selected Gulf Coast States OIG will audit the use of HHS emergency prep aredness grant funding in the Gulf Coast States. OIG will determine whether such funding, which is provided annually by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Health Resources and Services Administration, has been utilized for appr oved purposes and whether items funded by these grants were effective in the hurricane response and recovery efforts. Reviews will be performed in Florida, Alabama, Lo uisiana, Texas, and Mississippi. Claims for Services Not Rendered in Medicare and Medicaid Programs OIG auditors will perform a data match of services performed during the months immediately following Hurricane Katrina to pr oviders located in zip codes declared national disaster areas. The re sults will be analyzed to determine whether any providers that were not in operation were continuing to bill the Medicare and/or Medicaid programs. Identification of Aberrant Provider s in Medicare and Medicaid Programs Through the use of software applications, OI G auditors will identify providers who submitted claims to Medicare and/or Medicaid for services provided to evacuees that greatly exceeded the number of claims su bmitted by other providers in the peer group. ix These claims will then be selectively review ed to determine whether they are legitimate and medically necessary. Establishment of Claims Identifiers in Medicare In \"Consolidated HHS Response to OMB Data Call: Katrina Stewar dship,\" the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) presented a risk assessment for Hurricane Katrina-related activities. As noted in this document, OIG auditors plan to determine whether (1) CMS established the necessary cl aims identifiers (cal led \"special claims condition codes and modifier s\") and CMS contractors im plemented those claims identifiers and (2) the claims identifiers a ccurately represent the numbers, dollars, and nature of disaster-related claims. Duplicate Medicaid Payments to Providers in Medicaid OIG auditors will determine whether providers submitted claims and were paid by multiple State Medicaid agencies for the same servi ce for the same evacuee. OIG auditors will conduct work to determine whether providers received (1) Medicaid payments from both the evacuee's home State and the host State in which the evacuee is residing or (2) Medicaid payments for services paid by FEMA. Commissioned Corps Deployment in Response to Hurricane Katrina OIG will evaluate whether the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps has achieved its goal to be 100 per cent deployable in order to e ffectively mobilize and respond to public health emergencies by the end of 2005, focusing on the recent deployments associated with Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The timing of the Commissioned Corps's goal coincides with one of the Corps's largest deployments in its 207-year history. In the weeks following Hurricane Katrina, more than 1,400 officers worked with State, local, and private agencies in 7 Gulf States, and after 1 month, over 700 remained in the Gulf States and evacuee areas to provide relief services. Nursing Home Evacuation Planning and Execution Nursing home residents and their families rely on facility administrators to plan for and execute appropriate evacuation procedures duri ng times of disaster. However, the recent catastrophes in the Gulf States precipitated by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita have raised concerns about nursing home ev acuation plans and coordination efforts between facilities and State/local resource s in times of disaster. To a ddress these concerns, the Senate Special Committee on Aging requested OIG to conduct a study of facility evacuation planning and execution. This study respond s to the Committee's request and also continues the ongoing work of OIG to monitor the health and safety of nursing home residents. Specifically, OIG will determine whether these homes complied with Federal requirements to develop and practice emergency prepare dness plans and whether the plans included evacuation of residents. This report will also examine to what extent plans were executed for facilities that evacuated or considered evacuation during recent di sasters. Additionally, the report will identify lessons learned from these facilities regarding development and x execution of emergency preparedness plans, including factors that promote or hinder successful evacuation. Hurricane Katrina-Related Medical Review Contract Because of the tragedy of Hurricanes Katrin a and Rita, beneficiaries of HHS programs who resided in the Gulf Coast States may have been evacuated to various places around the United States or otherwise significantly affected. In response to this tragedy, HHS expanded coverage criteria for some programs, including Medicaid, to make Federal benefits available to victims in their time of need. In this series of studies, OIG will focus on identifying the appropriateness of payments made to providers for medical and durable medical equipment services for beneficiaries who had benefits before the hurricanes and those who have qualified as a result of the hurricanes. xi Table of Contents CENTERS FOR MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVICES ......................................... 1 CMS-Related Reports

Numerical informat ion in this report is rounded. 1 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Serv ices (CMS) administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Financed by the Fede ral Hospital Insuran ce Trust Fund, Medicare Part A provides hospital and other institutiona l insurance for individuals 65 years old or older and for certain disabled persons. Medicare Part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance) is an optional progr am that covers most of the costs of medically necessary physician and other services and is financed by participants and general revenues. Medicare Part C (Medicare Advantage) enables beneficiaries of Medicare Parts A and B to choose to receive all of their health care services through a coordinated Medicare Advantage (MA) plan, which replaced the previous Medicare+Choice managed care plans. In addition, Medicare Part D is a new, optional program offering prescription drug coverage through private drug plans. Benefici aries may opt either to enroll in a stand- alone prescription drug plan an d receive their Part A and Pa rt B benefits through fee-for- service or to enroll in a Medicare Advant age prescription drug plan and receive all Medicare benefits, including dr ug coverage, through an MA plan. The Medicaid program provides funding to Stat es for medical care and other support and services for low-income individuals. Stat e expenditures for medical assistance are matched by the Federal Government using a formula that compares per capita income in each State relative to the national average. The State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) expands health coverage to uninsured children whose families earn too much for Medicaid but too little to afford private coverage. The Office of Inspector General (OIG) devotes significant resources to investigating Medicare and Medicaid fraud, waste, and abus e and to monitoring these programs. These activities have helped ensure the cost-eff ective delivery of Medi care, Medicaid, and SCHIP services; safeguarded quality of care to beneficiaries of these programs; and reduced the potential for fraud, waste, and abuse. In addition, these efforts have led to criminal, civil, and/or administrative actions against perpetrators of fraud and abuse. OIG also reports on audits of CMS financ ial statements, which currently account for more than 82 percent of Department of Hea lth and Human Services (HHS) net costs. In addition to issuing an opinion on the stat ements, auditors assess compliance with Medicare laws and regulations and th e adequacy of internal controls. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 2CMS-Related Reports Review of Services Provided by Inhalation Drug Suppliers In conjunction with drug payment cuts mandated by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), CMS raised the dispensing fee paid to Medicare suppliers of inhalation dr ugs from $5 to an interim amount of $57 for a 30-day drug supply, prompted in large part by a report sponsored by the American Association for Homecare showing that be neficiaries receive numerous important services from those suppliers. This OIG report was designed to identify services provided by suppliers and thereby assist CMS in setting a new dispensing fee for inhalation drugs for 2006. OIG reviewed services provided to a sample of Medicare beneficiaries in 2003 and found that 60 percent of beneficiar ies received at least one cont act for a monthly drug refill. However, 31 percent of beneficiaries who s hould have been contacted for a refill were not contacted, contrary to the Medicare Program Integrity Manual . Fewer than one-third of beneficiaries had their medication complia nce reviewed by their suppliers. Service levels dropped off after the first month s uppliers billed for drugs. Few beneficiaries received more intensive services such as education, care plan revision, or a respiratory assessment, and 16 percent of beneficiaries received no services at all. The most common way beneficiaries received services was by telephone; only 1 in 10 beneficiaries received a home visit. OIG also found that be neficiaries were three times more likely to receive a service beyond a re fill contact if their drug supplier also provided their respiratory equipment. (OEI-01-05-00090) Calculation of Volume-Weighted Averag e Sales Price for Medicare Part B Prescription Drugs In 2005, Medicare began paying for most Pa rt B drugs using a new methodology based on average sales prices (ASP). Section 1847A(b)(2)(B) of the Social Security Act (the Act) specifies the unit that manufacturers must use when submitting ASP data. The Act also specifies the way to calculate a volume- weighted ASP for a Medicare payment code based on manufacturer-reported ASP data. However, CMS opted to change the unit of ASP submission, exercising discretion permitted by section 1847A(b)(2)(B) of the Act. It was therefore necessary for CMS to modify the method for calculating volume- weighted ASP described in the law. OIG found that the me thod CMS curren tly uses to calculate a volume-weighted ASP is mathematically incorrect. Therefore, CMS's equation may not always yiel d a volume-weighted ASP that is consistent with the volume-weighted ASP derived from the calcu lation set forth in se ction 1847A(b)(3) of the Act. Because CMS calculates volume-wei ghted ASPs incorrectly, current and future reimbursement amounts may not be accurate. OIG recommended that CMS change its calculation of volume-weighted ASP. OIG proposed that CMS adopt an alternate equation that produces a volume-weighted ASP that is both mathematically correct and consistent with the results of the calculation set forth in section 1847A(b)(3) of the Act. CMS indicated that the report's findings are helpful to its ongoing refinement of the A SP payment methodology. As CMS gains more Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 3 experience with the ASP data, and as more information becomes available, CMS may consider altering the ASP methodology. (OEI-03-05-00310) Adequacy of Medicare Part B Drug Re imbursement to Physician Practices for the Treatment of Cancer Patients The MMA established a new methodology for Medicare Part B reimbursement of drugs and biologicals. This report found that ph ysician practices in the specialties of hematology, hematology/oncology, and medical oncology could generally purchase drugs for the treatment of cancer pa tients at prices below the MM A-established reimbursement rates. This finding was based on a statistical estimate of average prices paid by physician practices for 39 payment codes, constituting mo re than 94 percent of the $4.5 billion in total 2004 Medicare-allowed amounts for drugs associated with these three specialties. This finding was also based on a statistical estimate of the percentage of months for which physician practices were able to purchas e drugs at prices below the reimbursement amounts. Overall, OIG estimated that the aver age prices paid for dr ugs associated with 35 of the 39 payment codes were less than the reimbursement amounts. OIG recommended that Congress consider the results of this review in deliberations about the Medicare Part B reimbursement methodology for drugs for the treatment of cancer patients. CMS stated that the report provided us eful information about the payment adequacy for Part B drugs used in cancer treatment. (A-06-05-00024) Allergen Immunotherapy for Medicare Beneficiaries OIG found that approximately 62 percent of a llergen immunotherapy and related services allowed by Medicare in cale ndar year (CY) 2001 were not medically necessary (and, therefore, not covered by Medicare), were miscoded, and/or were undocumented. These inappropriately paid services potentially cost the program and its beneficiaries approximately $75 million. Furthermore, approximately 70 percent of Medicare beneficiaries who received al lergen immunotherapy in CY 2001 received care at some point during their course of treatment that did not meet professionally recognized standards. Finally, in the absence of na tional guidance, some carriers have adopted policies that diverge from pr ofessionally recognized sta ndards of health care. To address these issues, OIG recommended th at CMS instruct its carriers to educate physicians who provide allergen immunothera py about existing coverage, coding, and documentation requirements. OIG also recommended that CM S develop national coverage criteria for allergen immunotherapy based on professionally recognized standards of health care. CMS agreed with the recommendations. (OEI-09-00-00531) Use of Modifier 25 \"Modifier 25\" is used to allow additional payment for evaluation and management (E/M) services performed by a provider on the same day as a Medicare-covered procedure. Such payments are permissible when the E/ M services are signif icant, separately identifiable, and above and beyond the usual preoperative a nd postoperative care associated with the procedure. OIG found that 35 percent of claims for E/M services allowed by Medicare in FY 2002 did not meet program requirements, resulting in $538 million in improper payments. Modifier 25 was also used unnecessarily on a Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 4large number of other claims and, although such use may not have led to improper payments, the claims failed to meet program requirements. OIG recommended that CMS work with Me dicare carriers to reduce the number of claims submitted using modifier 25 that do not meet program requirements. OIG also recommended that CMS stress to providers that they must maintain appropriate documentation of both the E/M se rvices and procedures and remind them that modifier 25 should be used only on claims for E/M services. CMS concurred with OIG's recommendations. (OEI-07-03-00470) Use of Modifier 59 To Bypass Nati onal Correct Coding Initiative Edits \"Modifier 59\" is a coding modifier used to bypass automated edits in Medicare carriers' claims processing systems. Modifier 59 indi cates that a provider performed a distinct procedure or service for a beneficiary on the same day as another procedure or service\u2014so-called code pairs\u2014that normally should not be billed as more than one service. Based on a review of a sample of code pa irs billed with modifier 59 in FY 2003, OIG found that 40 percent of code pairs did not me et program requirements, resulting in an estimated $59 million in improper payments. For 15 percent of these code pairs, the services were not distinct from each other. For 25 percent of these code pairs, the services were not adequately documented. Also, separate analysis of 3.4 million code pairs billed with modifier 59 showed that 11 percent of code pa irs were paid when modifier 59 was attached to the incorrect c ode. This billing error represented $27 million in Medicare paid claims. In addition, OI G found that most carri ers did not conduct reviews of modifier 59; those that did f ound providers who were using modifier 59 inappropriately. OIG recommended that CMS encourage carriers to conduct prepayment and postpayment reviews of the use of modifier 59 and ensure that carriers' claims processing systems pay claims with modifier 59 only when the modifier is billed with the correct code. CMS concurred with these recomm endations. (OEI-03-02-00771) Billings for Home Health Services Under the Medicare prospective payment sy stem, home health agencies use a data instrument called the Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) to measure the care that each beneficiary needs over a 60-day service period known as an episode. One item on the OASIS requires home health agencies to identify all facilities that discharged the beneficiary in the 14 days preceding the home health episode. Medicare pays more for an episode preceded only by a discharge from a postacute care facility (a skilled nursing or rehabilitation facility) than for the same episode preceded by discharges from both an acute care hospital a nd a postacute care facility. This review found that home health agencies did not comply with Medicare requirements in billing for services that were preceded with in 14 days by discharges from both an acute care hospital and a postacute care facility. Specifically, the agencies improperly coded all 400 sampled claims as discharges from a postacute care facility only, rather than discharges from both an acute care hospital and a postacute care facility. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 5 overpayments occurred because home health agencies had not established the controls necessary to identify on the OASIS all facilities that discharged the beneficiary in the 14 days before the home health episode. In addition, during the audit period, Medicare had not established sufficient cont rols to prevent or detect overpayments and initiate recovery. As a result, OIG estimated that Medicare overpaid home health agencies approximately $48.1 million during FYs 2002 and 2003. OIG recommended that CMS (1) instruct its contractors to recove r the overpayments; (2) emphasize to home health agencies the need to educate their staffs regarding the identification on the OASIS of all facilities th at discharged the beneficiary within 14 days of the home health episode; (3) monitor the effectiveness of newly established prepayment edits and postpayment controls; an d (4) develop data analysis techniques to identify home health agencies with significant numbers of claims rejected or adjusted by the new payment controls, and then to subjec t those agencies to corrective action. CMS concurred with the recomme ndations. (A-01-04-00527) Fiscal Year 2005 Hospital Pa yment Monitoring Program CMS developed the Hospital Payment Monito ring Program (HPMP) to establish the Medicare fee-for-service paid claims error ra te for inpatient hospital services. Several CMS contractors operate the HPMP and conduct admission-necessity screenings, diagnosis-related group (DRG) va lidations, and quality cont rol reviews under contracts with CMS. For FY 2005, CMS generally ensured that its HPMP contractors had appropriate controls to ensure that admission-necessity and DRG validation screenings and quality control reviews followed established procedures a nd operated effectively. However, CMS and its contractors incorrectly sampled long term care hospital claims and did not complete the follow-up process for obtaining medical records. In addition, CMS did not ensure that an HPMP contractor used CMS's software to calculate error am ounts and, during the audit period, did not calculate and report ce rtain error amounts. OIG recommended that CMS direct its HPMP contractors to select a long term care hospital sample in accordance with established criteria, use the CMS software to reprice certain error amounts, and include all error amounts in future erro r rate calculations. CMS said that it would consider incorporating the CMS software into the HPMP process and agreed to implement the ot her recommendations. (A-03-05-00007) Fiscal Year 2005 Comprehensive Error Rate Testing Program CMS developed the Comprehensive Error Rate Testing (CERT) program to establish the Medicare fee-for-service paid claims error ra te for all types of services other than inpatient hospital services. In this evaluation of the FY 2005 CERT program, OIG found that CMS and the CERT contractor generally ha d in place appropriate controls to ensure that the contractor made medical review decisions in accordance with established procedures and that it adequately maintain ed, updated, and reported the results of those reviews. The CERT contractor had also implemented previous OIG recommendations to improve the completeness of quality assuranc e reviews. Finally, OIG found that CMS could do more to ensure consistency and coordination of the error rate programs. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 6OIG recommended that CMS work to establis h CERT and HPMP sample periods that are more consistent with each other and more closely aligne d with the FY. OIG also recommended that CMS consider centralizing the management of the error rate programs under a single office for consistency in me thodology and uniformity in reporting. CMS concurred with OIG's recommendations. (A-03-05-00006) Hospital Wage Data Used To Calcul ate Inpatient Prospective Payment System Wage Indexes Under the acute care inpatient prospective payment system, th e Medicare base rate paid to hospitals includes a labor-related share. CMS adjusts the labor-related share by the wage index applicable to the metropolitan statistical area in which each hospital is located. The wage index values are based on data on hospitals' Medicar e cost reports. OIG determined that a hospital in Connecticut did not fully comply with Medicare requirements for reporting wage data. Specifically, the hospital's FY 2003 Medicare cost report overstated wage data by approxi mately $2 million and 23,221 hours. If the hospital does not revise the wage data, the FY 2007 Connecticut rural wage index will be inflated, which will result in overpayments to the hospital and the 14 other hospitals that use this wage index. The hospital concurred with OIG's recommen dations to submit a revised FY 2003 cost report and ensure that the wage data repo rted on future cost reports comply with Medicare requirements. (A-01-05-00506) Compliance With the Interrupted Stay Provision of the Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility Pros pective Payment System OIG found that inpatient rehabi litation facilitie s (IRFs) did not always bill claims in compliance with Medicare prospective payment system regulations for interrupted stays. Specifically, during calendar years 2002 and 2003, Medicare made net overpayments of $5.9 million to 589 IRFs for interrupted stays billed as 2 or more claims. OIG recommended that CMS (1) direct its fiscal intermediaries to recover the $5.9 million in net overpayments identified in the review; (2 ) use the results of this review to clarify guidance to IRFs regarding the correct bill ing of interrupted stays; (3) strengthen its system edit to detect all in terrupted stays incorrect ly billed as two or more claims and prevent associated payments; a nd (4) instruct its fiscal intermediaries to conduct matches similar to the one that OI G conducted to identif y additional payment errors for claims after December 31, 2003. CMS agreed with OIG's recommendations to recover the overpayments and clarify guidance to the IRFs and stated that it had already implemented the recommended edit. CMS did not agree to instruct its fiscal in termediaries to conduc t matches for payment errors that occurred between January 1, 2004, and the date th e edit was implemented. (A-01-04-00525) Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 7 Graduate Medical Educati on for Dental Residents The Medicare program makes payments to teach ing hospitals to support graduate medical education (GME) programs for physicians and other practitioners. The payments, which cover both direct and indirect GME, are based in part on the number of full-time equivalent (FTE) residents that the hospita ls train. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 permitted hospitals to count dental resident s who train in nonhospital settings in their calculations of indirect, in a ddition to direct, GME payments. OIG reviewed hospitals in several States to determine whether they included the appropriate number of dental residents in their FTE counts when computing Medicare GME payments. Connecticut -A hospital in Connecticut appropriat ely included dental residents in the FTE counts it used to compute FYs 2000 th rough 2002 GME payments. The hospital's controls over the accumulation and computation of dental FTEs appeared to be adequate. Therefore, OIG did not make any recommenda tions to the hospital. (A-04-04-06010) Iowa-A hospital in Iowa generally included th e appropriate number of dental residents in its FTE counts used to compute FYs 2001 and 2002 GME payments. However, the hospital claimed classroom time for reside nts working in nonhospital settings. OIG recommended that the hospital work with CMS to resolve about $338,000 associated with classroom time. The hospital disagr eed, saying that the classroom time was allowable. (A-04-04-06011) Kentucky -A hospital in Kentucky appropriately included dent al residents in the FTE counts it used to compute FYs 2000 and 2001 GME payments . However, in FY 2002, the hospital inappropriately incl uded a dental resident who di d not meet the requirements for graduates of foreign dental schools. As a result, the hospital overstated its GME claims by about $16,000. In addition, the hospital claimed cl assroom time for residents working in nonhospital settings . OIG recommended that th e hospital make a financial adjustment for the foreign graduate, establ ish procedures for FTE counts for foreign graduates, and work with CMS to reso lve about $140,000 associated with classroom time. The hospital generally agreed. (A-04-04-06005) Massachusett s-A hospital in Massachusetts inappr opriately included some dental residents in the FTE counts used to compute FYs 2001 and 2002 GME payments. Contrary to Federal regulations, the hospital included the residents without incurring all of their training costs in nonhospital settings. As a result, the hospital overstated its GME claims by $4.9 million. OIG recommended that the hospital refund the $4.9 million, ensure that FTEs for residents in nonhospital settings include only those for which the hospital has incurred all or substantially all of the training costs, and refund any overpayments after FY 2002. The hospital generally disagreed. (A-04-04-06003) Pennsylvania -A hospital in Pennsylvania genera lly included the ap propriate number of dental residents in the FTE count s it used to compute FYs 2001 and 2002 GME payments. However, the hospital claimed classroom time for residents working in nonhospital settings. OIG recommended that the hospital work with CMS to resolve about $580,000 associated with classroom time. The hospital agreed to do so. (A-04-04-06002) Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 8Medicare Payments for Ambulance Transports Medicare covers and pays for emergency a nd nonemergency ambulance transports when a beneficiary's medical condition, at the time of transport, is such that other means of transportation\u2014such as taxi, private car, wheelchair van, or ot her type of vehicle\u2014would be contraindicated. OIG found that 25 percent of ambulance transpor ts in calendar year 2002 did not meet Medicare program requirements, resulting in an estimated $402 million in improper payments. Despite previous OIG reports indica ting that transports for dialysis treatment and other nonemergency transports were vulne rable to abuse, the error rates for these kinds of transports continue d to be high. Contractor safeguards were found to be insufficient to identify and prevent impr oper payments for ambulance transports. Contractors used few ambulance-specific prepay ment edits consistently and fewer than half of the contractors c onducted postpayment reviews of ambulance claims. When reviews were conducted, there was no uniform requirement regarding what documentation should be reviewed. Even th ough almost two-thirds of the coverage errors involved transport from a dialysis faci lity, hospital, or other third-party provider, those providers received little education regarding Medicare 's coverage requirements for ambulance transports. In this report, OIG recommended that CMS implement program integrity activities designed to reduce improper payments for ambulan ce transports at greatest risk for error. The following measures should be included in th ese activities: (1) instruct all Medicare contractors to implement prepayment edit s that target dialys is and nonemergency ambulance transport claims; (2) instruct all Medicare contra ctors conducting postpayment medical reviews to obtain documentation from ambulance suppliers and third-party providers so as to determine that ambulance transports meet program requirements; and (3) direct all Medicare contractors to ed ucate third-party provi ders responsible for initiating ambulance transports. CMS genera lly concurred with the recommendations. (OEI-05-02-00590) Billings for Ambulance Services Under the prospective payment system for acu te care hospitals, suppliers that render Medicare Part B ambulance services during inpatient stays are required to bill the hospitals, not the carriers, for those servic es. Medicare carriers are responsible for ensuring that they do not pay for nonphysician services provided to hospital inpatients. OIG found that during calendar years 2001 through 2003, carriers inappropriately made Part B payments for 203,377 ambulance services provided to hospital inpatients. Rather than billing the hospitals for services, ambulance suppliers billed the carriers and received separate payments. As a result, Medicare potentially overpaid $21.7 million by paying twice: once to the hospital as part of the prospective paym ent and again to the ambulance supplier under Part B. Furthermore, the Medicaid program , beneficiaries, or their supplemental insurers could have paid more than $6.2 million in coinsurance and deductibles related to thes e potential overpayments. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 9 OIG recommended that CMS instruct the car riers to recover the $21.7 million in potential overpayments, establish prepayment controls to detect and prevent such improper payments or postpayment review procedures to identify noncompliant providers, and alert the carriers to the most common types of payment errors and help them to educate ambulance suppliers about such improper billings. CMS agreed with the recommendations. (A-01-04-00513) A Review of Nursing Facility Resource Utilization Groups In this report, OIG described the extent to which Resource Utilization Groups (RUGs) on claims submitted by nursing facilities differ from those generated based on evidence in the rest of the medical record. Medicare pa ys for Part A skilled nursing facility stays using a prospective payment system that classifies residents into RUGs that each are weighted differently resulting in varying Medicare payment rates. Skilled nursing facilities determine a resident's RUG based on an assessment of the resident. This report was based on an independent review of th e medical records for 272 skilled nursing facility claims. When reviewers found that a particular resident assessment item was inconsistent with the rest of the medical r ecord, they recoded that item based on the entire medical record and used this recode d item to generate a new RUG. OIG found that 26 percent of claims submitte d by skilled nursing facilities had a RUG that was different from the one reviewers gene rated based on evidence in the rest of the medical record. These differences represen ted a net $542 million in potential Medicare overpayments for fiscal year 2002. OIG recommended that CMS take steps to ensure that skilled nursing facilities complete the minimum data set (MDS) accurately and assign each resident to the correct RUG. These steps could include (1) continuing th e type of analysis conducted by the Data Assessment and Verification project and (2) more carefully examining the 11 MDS items that OIG found were most often inconsistent with the rest of the medical record. CMS concurred with the recommendation. (OEI-02-02-00830) Community Mental Health Center Payments A community mental health center (CMHC) may provide a partial hospitalization program, an intensive outpatient program of psychiatric services provided to patients instead of inpatient psychiatric care. Partial hospitalization services are included in the Medicare hospital outpatient prospective payment system. OIG sampled 100 partial hospitalization claims from a CMHC in Louisiana and found that 51 did not meet Medicare reimburseme nt requirements, primarily because the services were unnecessary or lacked required documenta tion. Based on the sample results, OIG estimated that the CMHC received at least $3 million in unallowable payments. OIG recommended that CMS determine the allowability of the estimated unallowable payments. The CMHC disagreed with the findings. (A-06-04-00076) Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 10Medicare Contractor Pension Costs Since its inception, Medicare has paid a portion of Medicare contractors' annual contributions to their pension plans. CMS re quires that contractors' claims for pension costs comply with the Medicare contracts. This review found that a contractor in Indiana claimed more than $4.8 million of unallowabl e pension costs for FYs 1991 through 2002. OIG recommended that the contractor make a financial adjustment and claim future pension costs in accordance with the Medicare contracts. The contractor agreed. (A-07-05-00187) Dual Eligibles' Transition: Drug Access Under Prescription Drug Plans' Formularies This study determined the extent to whic h Medicare prescription drug plan (PDP) formularies include drugs that the \"dual eligible population\"\u2014beneficiaries of both Medicare and Medicaid\u2014co mmonly use under Medicaid. On January 1, 2006, outpatient prescription drug coverage for dual eligibles wa s transferred from Medicaid to Medicare. Differences in coverage of commonly used drugs may present challenges during this transition. OIG identified 200 drugs highly utilized by the dual el igible population in 2005. Of these, 178 drugs are eligible for Part D coverage, and 22 fall into categories that are statutorily excluded from Part D, but which States may opt to co ver through their Medicaid programs. This study found that PDP formularies include an average of 92 percent of the 178 eligible drugs OIG reviewed. Approximately half of these 178 common drugs are covered by all formularies. For the 22 drugs in OIG's re view that are excluded from Part D, dual eligibles' access under Me dicaid will not change in 45 of the 47 States OIG interviewed. Two States plan to cut Medicaid coverage of some cat egories of excluded drugs. Given the variation OIG found in PDP formularies' inclus ion of 178 common drugs, as well as the medical and resource challenges faced by this population, dual eligibles may need targeted assistance to navigate the tr ansition from Medicaid to Medicare coverage. CMS and States have undertaken efforts to educate and a ssist dual elig ibles and to incorporate safeguards into the program to ensure access to needed drugs. However, taking advantage of any of the options re quires knowledge and proactive effort by beneficiaries and may require additional assistance from CMS and States to ensure a smooth transition. CMS expressed concern with the report's me thodologies and scope, but came to conclusions similar to thos e found in OIG's report. (OEI-05-06-00090) How Inflated Published Prices Affect Drugs Considered for the Federal Upper Limit List The Federal upper limit program was established to ensure that the Federal Government acts as a prudent payer by taking advantage of current market prices for multiple-source drugs (i.e., drugs with generic equivalents). The Federal upper limit for a drug is set at 150 percent of the published pric e for the least costly, therap eutically equivalent product found in national compendia plus a reasonable di spensing fee. The aim of this report was to determine the extent to which the manda ted method for calculating Medicaid Federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 11 upper limit amounts causes qualified products to be excluded from the Federal upper limit list and the potential financial implications of these exclusions for Medicaid. OIG found that in the first two quarters of 2004, 58 drug products that met all statutory and regulatory requirements were not added to the Federal upper li mit list because of inflated published prices. On average, th e lowest published prices for these 58 drugs were almost two-and-a-half times the averag e manufacturer prices (AMP). Given that Federal regulation requires that these \"minimum\" published prices be multiplied by 150 percent, the difference between Federal upper limit amounts and AMPs has grown even wider. If Medicaid based Federal uppe r limit amounts on 150 percent of the average AMP\u2014the wholesale price\u2014rather than 150 pe rcent of the lowest published price, the program might have saved approximately $75 million in the first two quarters of 2004, because these excluded drugs would have be en added to the Federal upper limit list. These savings would have been in addition to the $650 million per year identified in a previous report that would have been save d based on similar reductions in the Federal upper limit amounts of drugs already included on the list. The report did not include any recommendations for CMS. (OEI-03-05-00350) Medicaid Disproportionate Sh are Hospital Payments States are required to make Medicaid disproportionate shar e hospital (DSH) payments to hospitals that serve disproportio nate numbers of low-income patients with special needs. Section 1923(g) of the Social Security Act (t he Act) limits these payments to a hospital's uncompensated care costs, which are the annu al costs incurred to provide services to Medicaid and uninsured patients less paymen ts received for those patients. The MMA implemented annual reporting and audit requi rements for the DSH program beginning in FY 2004. In a report summarizing review s of 10 States' DSH programs, OIG noted that 9 of the 10 States had not complied with the hospital-specific DSH limits imposed by section 1923(g) of the Act. As a result, DSH paym ents exceeded the hospital-specific limits by approximately $1.6 billion ($902 million Fede ral share). Of the $902 million Federal share, $679 million resulted from using histor ical costs rather than actual costs, and $223 million resulted from including unallowable costs in the DSH calculations. Also, three States required hospitals to retu rn DSH payments totaling approximately $3.6 billion through intergovernmental transfers. The use of such transfers does not further the intended purpose of the DSH program, which is to cover the uncompensated costs of treating Medicaid and uninsured patients at DSH-eligible hospitals. OIG recommended that CMS ensure that the monetary recommendations to the States are resolved; strengthen its review and approval of St ate plans to ensure consistency with Federal requirements; use the re sults of audits conducted under the MMA as part of this review process; and establish regulations requiring States to adjust future DSH payments to actual incurred costs, incor porate these adjustment procedur es into their approved State plans, and include only allowable costs as uncompensated care costs in their DSH calculations. CMS agreed with th e recommendations. (A-06-03-00031) Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 12Family Planning Service Costs The Federal Government reimburses the cost s of family planning services provided pursuant to Medicaid State plans at an e nhanced 90-percent matching rate. These services are intended to prevent or delay preg nancy or to otherwise control family size. In two reviews, OIG found that States did not always comply with Federal requirements for claiming these costs to Medicaid. Delaware -OIG could not validate Delaware's fa mily planning service rates, which were based on claims incurred between July 1991 and June 1994, because Delaware did not provide relevant data. De laware contended that the Fe deral Government's right to review these data ended in July 2000. Because Delaware could not ju stify its calculation, it was not entitled to the approximately $2.9 million enhanced Federal share. OIG recommended that Delaware (1) provide support for family planning service costs claimed between October 2000 and June 2004 or refund the overpay ment and (2) work with CMS to determine the amounts claimed fo r family planning service costs after the audit period, refund the enhanced portion, and discontinue claiming such costs at the enhanced rate until it provides ad equate support for its family planning rates. Delaware partially concurred with both recommendations. (A-03-03-00220) Pennsylvania -The State calculated its family planning service costs by multiplying a rate, known as the family planning factor , by its managed care capitation payments. The family planning factor represented the ra tio of family planning expenditures to total health care expenditures. However, the State incorrectly included family planning service costs for beneficiaries not eligible to enroll in managed care and services that did not qualify as family planning. As a result, Pennsylvania overstated its claim for family planning service costs by more than $44 million. By claiming these costs at the enhanced family planning rate, Pennsylvania received about $15.1 million in unallowable Federal reimbursement. OIG recommended that Pennsylvania refund the overpayment, use the audited family planning factors for future claims, a nd refund any associated overpayments. Pennsylvania did not concur with the refund, but it ag reed to consider the prospective use of the audited factors. (A-03-03-00214) Medicaid Upper-Payment-Limit Calcul ations for Hospitals and Nursing Facilities in Four States The Federal upper payment limit (UPL) is base d on an estimate of the amount that would be paid for Medicaid servi ces under Medicare payment princi ples. Some States make supplemental payments based on the differenc e between the regular Medicaid payment and the UPL. States must consider UPL pa yments and other payments received on behalf of Medicaid and uninsured patients when calculating hospital-specific DSH payment limits. In this reporting period, OIG issued four reports on UPL calculati ons for hospitals and nursing facilities: Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 13 Alabama-OIG found that for Stat e FY 2003, Alabama generally calculated the State and non-State government hosp ital outpatient UPLs in compliance with Federal regulations and its State plan amendment. However, Alabama did not comply with its State plan amendment when calculating th e State and non-State government hospital inpatient UPLs, nor did it comply with the revised Federal regulations when calculating the non-State government nursing facility UP L. As a result, Alabama made UPL overpayments of nearly $35.7 million ($25.7 m illion Federal share). Because Alabama did not include all hospital UPL payments in its calculation of hospital-specific DSH limits, the State also made potential DSH overpayments of $67.5 million (nearly $47.7 million Federal share). The actual DSH limits and associated overpayments cannot be computed until the UPL findings in this report are resolved. OIG recommended that Alabama (1) refund $25.7 million for UPL overpayments to State and non-State government facilities; (2) wo rk with CMS to re solve potential DSH overpayments currently valued at approxima tely $47.7 million; and (3) make procedural improvements. The State did not specifically address all of OIG's recommendations. Alabama believed that it had complied with its State plan amendment in the UPL calculations for inpatient hospital services and that it had properly calculated the cost of uncompensated care. (A-04-03-02027) Indiana -The State overstated the amounts ava ilable for UPL payments to non-State government hospitals for State FYs 2001 an d 2002. Indiana overstated those amounts primarily because it included unpa id Medicaid claims (claims that the State had denied as untimely) in its UPL calculations for many of the hospitals. Indiana made unallowable UPL payments to many non-State government hospitals for the 2-year period totaling more than $5.1 million (about $3.2 million Federal share). OIG recommended that Indiana refund the $3.2 million and revise its UPL methodology to exclude unpaid Medicaid claims from its calculations. The State said that Federal regulations and the State plan supported the inclusion of Medi caid unpaid claims in the UPL calculations. The State also said that it should not be required to refund the Federal share. (A-05-03-00068) Mississippi -The State calculated State FY s 2002 and 2003 UPLs for non-State government nursing facilities in accordance w ith Federal regulations and the approved State plan amendment. However, the State did not comply when calculating the inpatient and outpatient UPLs for private, State, and non-State government hospitals. As a result, Mississippi potentially overstated hospital inpatient UPL payments by about $183 million and hospital outpatient UPL payments by about $41 million. OIG recommended that Mississippi (1) work with CMS to resolve the potential UPL overpayments of approximately $224 million ($171 million Federal share) for hospital inpatient and outpatient services; (2) implemen t procedures to ensure that future UPL calculations comply with Federal regula tions; and (3) identify and refund any overpayments made subsequent to the audit peri od. Mississippi said that because of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 14Hurricane Katrina disaster, it had asked CMS to waive any requirement for the repayment of potential UPL overpayments. Also, Missi ssippi said that it had made procedural improvements to ensure that future UPL calculations comply with Federal regulations and that it was not aware of any overpayment s made subsequent to the audit period. (A-04-03-02025) New York -OIG found that the State calculated the State FY 2003 category-specific UPLs for non-State government hospitals and nursing homes in accordance with Federal and State requirements and prope rly included DSH payments in the limits. However, contrary to Federal regulations, New York based its State FY 2003 transition period excess payment on estima ted, rather than actual, Medicaid pa yment data from the base year. OIG recommended that New York refund to the Federal Government $43.3 million in overpayments to non-State government nursing homes for State FYs 2003, 2004, and 2005. In response, State offici als did not specifically addr ess OIG's recommendations or the State's use of estimated, ra ther than actual, Medicaid da ta in its calculations. The officials took exception to OIG's calcu lation of the overpayment amount. (A-02-03-01021) Medicaid Services Delivered in Schools The Medicaid program allows Medicaid re imbursement for cove red health-related services in a school se tting. Local education agencies (LEAs) bill the costs for these services to the States, which in turn bill th em to Medicaid. OIG ex amined in two states reimbursement for Medicaid serv ices provided in schools. Kansas -This State used bundled payment rates to reimburse LEAs for health-related services if students eligible for Medicaid at tended school at least once during the service month. OIG found that Kansas did not reim burse LEAs consistent with the payment rates' design or pursuant to Federal regulati ons and the State plan. Kansas designed the monthly payment rates to reimburse LEAs for a full year's costs over 9 school months. However, Kansas used the rates to reimburse LEAs for 12 months. As a result, Kansas overstated its Federal claim by $13.9 million for State FYs 1998 through 2003. Pursuant to a May 21, 1999, Dear State Medicaid letter , States are no longer permitted to claim through a bundled rate methodology. OIG recommended that Kansas refund the overp ayment and ensure that future claims comply with Federal regulations and the St ate plan. Kansas agreed to do so. (A-07-04-01003) Another review noted that Kansas claimed some costs that were not in accordance with Federal requirements or the State plan. Of 300 sampled claims in 3 districts, 217 were unallowable, and many had incomplete doc umentation. As a result, the Federal Government overpaid an estimated $5.1 million for FY 2002. Other claims outside the sampled districts may also have been unallowable. OIG recommended that Kansas refund th e overpayment, calculate and refund overpayments from districts outside the sample , provide correct billing instructions, and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 15 ensure that LEAs maintain required documentation. Kansas partly concurred with the recommendations. (A-07-03-00155) Texas -OIG found that of 2,175 claims sampled in Texas, 991 did not comply with Federal and State requirements and cont ained 1,146 errors. The State claimed reimbursement for services that were unallow able because of programmatic deficiencies (accounting for 804 errors) or that were re ndered by unqualified Medicaid providers (accounting for 342 errors). OIG estimated that the State agency inappropriately claimed at least $8.7 million in Federal reimbursement during State FY 2000. OIG stated that these errors occurred because th e State agency did not adequately monitor the LEAs' claims and issued improper guidan ce and because the LEAs did not maintain adequate supporting documentation. OIG recommended that the State refund the overpayment and make several procedural improvements; work with CMS to determine the financial impact to the Federal Government for overpayments made by the St ate agency for counseling services and make an appropriate refund; review tim e periods after the OIG audit and make appropriate financial adjustme nts for unallowable services; routinely monitor claims from LEAs for compliance with Federal and State re quirements; direct LEAs to ensure that service providers meet licensing requiremen ts; and issue guidance requiring LEAs to bill only for allowable Medicaid services rende red by qualified Medicaid providers. The State replied that before resolving any issues, it would need to analyze OIG's documentation. (A-06-02-00047) In another review, OIG reported on school-b ased administrative costs claimed by a consortium of Texas LEAs. So me of the costs claimed were not reasonable, allowable, or adequately supported. The costs include d expenditures for ineligible personnel, operating costs, and overstated costs. In addition, the consortium incorrectly allocated costs and did not offset costs wi th revenues received from othe r sources. As a result, an estimated $2.4 million was unallowable. OIG recommended that the consortium refund the overpayment and improve its procedures. The consortium partly concu rred and requested further information on certain findings. (A-06-02-00051) Determining if Children Classified as SCHIP Medicaid Expansion Meet Eligibility Criteria OIG assessed whether children classified under Medicaid expansion in the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP ) met State Medicaid-expansion eligibility criteria. To encourage States to expand ch ild health insurance eligibility, the Federal match rate for States' SCHIP expenditures, in cluding Medicaid expans ion, is greater than the rate for traditional Medicaid. Approximately 7 percent of sampled children did not meet States' eligibility criteria, based on a simple random sample of 357 cases from 29 of the 30 States that had expanded their Medicaid programs as of January 1, 2003. For 10 percent of sampled children, States could not suppor t their Medicaid-expansion eligibility determinations. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 16Two States had difficulty identifying thei r Medicaid-expansion populations, raising concerns about whether those States claimed the appropriate Federal match rate for some children. OIG recommended that CMS (1) work with St ates to improve caseworker performance in making eligibility determinations; (2) work with States to ensure that automated eligibility systems accurately classify children determined eligible under Medicaid- expansion criteria; (3) ensure that State Medicaid programs conduct redeterminations of Medicaid-expansion eligibility, as required; (4) remind States of the requirement to properly maintain case-file documentation; and (5) ensure that all States can accurately identify children determined eligible based on Medicaid-expans ion criteria. CMS concurred with these recomm endations. (OEI-07-03-00221) Medicaid Hospital Outlier Payments Some States make outlier payments to hosp itals when the cost of treating a Medicaid inpatient is extraordinarily high compared with the average cost of treating comparable conditions. OIG reported on three States' me thods of computing outlier payments. North Carolina -North Carolina's formula allowed inpatient hospitals to receive outlier payments for high charges rather than high costs. As a result, outlier payments increased at a significantly faster rate than Medicaid base payments . If the State had modified its outlier payment policy to ach ieve budget neutrality, it could have saved approximately $89.4 million during the 6-year audit period. OIG recommended that North Carolina revise its policy to ensure that future outlier payments achieve budget neutrality and more closely monitor the payments. North Carolina disagreed with the recommendations. (A-07-04-04038) Ohio -Ohio's computation method did not result in reasonable inpati ent cost outlier payments because the State used outdated fixed ratios rather than recent hospital-specific cost-to-charge ratios to convert allowable billed charges to outlier payments. As a result, outlier payments excee ded estimated costs by approximately $24.7 million during the 3-year audit period. OIG recommended that Ohio work with the St ate legislature to revise the State's cost outlier payment method. Ohio agreed. (A-05-04-00064) Pennsylvania -The State's computation method did not result in reasonable outlier payments because the State used an outdate d cost-to-charge ratio. As a result, the payments increased significantly and at a faster rate than other types of Medicaid payments. If Pennsylvania had applied a more current cost-to-charge ratio, it could have saved approximately $11.4 million at three sa mpled hospitals during the 5-year audit period. OIG recommended that Pennsylvania monitor and adjust the cost-to-charge ratio as necessary during the year and use the cost-to-charge ratio from the most recent cost Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 17 reporting period to adjust payments retroac tively. Pennsylvania said that it would evaluate its outlier policy to provide more precise payments. (A-03-04-00211) Medicaid Provider Overpayments An overpayment is a payment to a provider in excess of the allowable amount. Federal regulations require that State Medicaid agencies re fund the Federal share of overpayments at the end of the 60-day peri od following discovery, whether or not the State has recovered the overpayment from the provider, unless the provider has filed for bankruptcy or gone out of bus iness. Two OIG reviews focused on whether States reported Medicaid overpayments in accordance with Federal requirements. Florida -The State did not report all adjustme nts of Medicaid provider overpayments to CMS in accordance with Federal requirements between October 1, 2001, and December 31, 2002. Many adjustments were improper or untimely. OIG recommended that the State refund $14.5 million and improve its procedures and training on relevant Medicaid regulations. The State generally disagreed with OIG's recommendations. (A-04-03-06003) New Jersey -The State did not report all overpa yments in accordance with Federal requirements as of March 31, 2004. In addition, the State did not return the Federal share of the overpayment interest collected from providers, which it consid ered State revenue. The State's practices resulted in reporting de lays ranging from 90 days to more than 5 years. OIG recommended that the State refund $6.6 million and ensure that future overpayments are reported in accordance with Federal requireme nts. The State did not directly address OIG's recommendations. (A-02-04-01009) State Fees for Nurse Aide Registration Federal law prohibits States from imposing on individuals listed in a State's Nurse Aide Registry any charges related to registration. This study found that 24 States imposed fees that nurse aides may be required to pay for initial or con tinued placement on nurse aide registries. Of these 24 States, 20 States lis ted nurse aides as a source of payment for initial placement fees, and 14 States listed nurse aides as a source of payment for continued placement fees on their registries. Four additional States imposed fees on nurse aides as a requirement to work in l ong term care facilities. Also, CMS provided inconsistent guidance and limited oversight to States regarding registry fees. This report recommended that CMS (1) ensure that States cease imposing on nurse aides fees that violate Federal statut e; (2) clarify prohibitions on th e charging of fees related to nurse aide registries; and (3) conduct approp riate oversight to stop States from charging inappropriate fees. CMS concurred with al l OIG recommendations. (OEI-07-05-00070) CMS Financial Statement Audit The CMS FY 2005 financial statements received an unqualified audit opinion, which means that the statements were fairly pres ented in accordance with generally accepted Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 18accounting principles. However, auditors identified a material weakness in CMS's managed care benefits paymen t cycle. (A-17-05-02005) Outreach As part of its ongoing effort to promote the hi ghest level of ethical and lawful conduct by the health care industry, OIG has continued to issue advisory opinions and other guidance. Advisory Opinions In accordance with section 205 of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, OIG, in consultation with the Department of Justice, issues advisory opinions to outside parties regarding the interpretation and app licability of certain statutes relating to the Federal health care programs. This authority allows OIG to provide case- specific formal guidance regarding the applicat ion of the anti-kickback statute and safe harbor provisions and other OIG health care fraud and abuse sancti ons. For the period October 1, 2005, through March 31, 2006, OIG received 33 advisory opinion requests and issued 4 advisory opinions. Provider Self-Disclosure Protocol In keeping with a longstanding co mmitment to assist providers and suppliers in detecting and preventing fraudulent and abusive practices , OIG established a set of comprehensive guidelines for voluntary self-disclosure, ent itled \"Provider Self-Disclosure Protocol,\" available on the Internet at http://oig.hhs.gov in the \"Fraud Prevention & Detection\" section. The protocol guides providers and supplie rs through the proce ss of structuring a disclosure to OIG of matters that appear to constitute potential violat ions of Federal laws (as opposed to honest mistakes that may have resulted in overpayments). After making an initial disclosure, the provi der or supplier is expected to undertake a thorough internal investigation of the nature and cause of the matters uncovered and make a reliable assessment of their economic impact (e.g., an es timate of the losses to Federal health care programs). OIG evaluates the reported results of each internal investigation to determine the appropriate course of action. To date, OIG has received 295 submissions. Self-disclosure cases have resulted in 60 recoveries and 63 settlements, totaling $104.2 million collectively in HHS receivables. For example: Delaware -Following a voluntary se lf-disclosure filed pursuant to OIG's Provider Self-Disclosure Protocol, Delaware Bay Surgical Service, P.A., and a physician agreed to pay the Government $881,000 and enter into a comprehensive 3-year Integrity Agreement. The settlement agreement reso lved their liability for allegedly submitting improper claims, i.e., billing Medicare for both the professional and technical components of vascular studies when only the professional component was performed, between 1995 and January 2001. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 19 Virginia -Following a voluntary self-disclosure f iled pursuant to OIG's Provider Self- Disclosure Protocol, Inova Health Care Se rvices, doing business as Inova Fair Oaks Hospital, agreed to pay the Government more than $713,000 and enter into a comprehensive 3-year Certification of Compliance Agreement. The settlement agreement resolved its liability for allegedly subleasing space in one of the hos pital's medical office buildings to physician subtenants at rental ra tes significantly below the fair market value of the spaces the physicians occupied betw een 1998 and 2004, in potential violation of the Stark law and anti-kickback statute. Federal and State Part nership: Joint Audits of Medicaid Another major OIG outreach initia tive has been to work more closely with State auditors in reviewing the Medicaid program. To th is end, a partnership pl an was developed to foster joint reviews and provide broader coverage of the Medicaid program. The partnership approach has been an overwhel ming success in ensuring more effective use of scarce audit resources by bot h the Federal and the State audit sectors. To date, partnerships have been developed in 25 States. Reports issued to date have resulted in id entification of more th an $262 million in Federal and State savings and have le d to joint recommendations for savings at the Federal and State levels, as well as improvements in internal controls and computer system operations. OIG Administrative Sanctions During this reporting period, OI G administered 1,560 sanctions in the form of program exclusions or administrative actions for alle ged fraud or abuse or other activities that posed a risk to Federal health care programs and their beneficiaries. A brief explanation of these sanction authorities can be found in Appendix F. Program Exclusions During this reporting period, OIG excluded 1,540 individuals and entities from participating in Medicare, Medicaid, and other Federal health care programs. Most of the exclusions resulted from c onvictions for crimes relating to Medicare or Medicaid, for patient abuse or neglect, or as a result of license revocation. Examples include the following: Florida -OIG excluded South Beach Community Hospital (formerly South Shore Hospital and Medical Center) from partic ipation in Medicare, Medicaid, and other Federal health care programs. The exclusion resulted from South Beach's material breach of the terms of a CIA the hospital ne gotiated with OIG in 2002 as part of the resolution of a False Claims Act case against the hospital. OIG determined that South Beach was in material breach for its repeat ed failure to submit timely, complete, and accurate required reports, and its failure to implement fully the Independent Review Organization requirements of the CIA. Sout h Beach also neglected to notify OIG, as required under the CIA, of its sale to new owne rs, who are also subject to the terms of the CIA. OIG determined that South Beach's \"rep eated and egregious failure in this case to abide by the terms of its CIA [required the] OIG for the first time to seek exclusion for such a violation.\" Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 20 Colorado -A registered nurse was excluded fo r a minimum of 60 years based on her conviction for deliberately and intentionally ca using the death of a home health patient under her care, and for using the victim's cred it card to obtain cash and make purchases. The registered nurse was ordere d to serve a life sentence wit hout parole for first-degree homicide. In addition, she was sentenced to 30 years for aggravated robbery against an at-risk adult, 6 years for theft, and 3 y ears for unauthorized use of a credit card. Illinois -A laboratory owner was excluded for a minimum of 30 years based on his conviction for knowingly directing his employees to submit claims for laboratory tests that were not actually conducted, or that ot herwise did not qualify for payment from health care benefit programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. The owner was sentenced to 5 years in jail and ordered to pay $2.5 million in restitution for mail fraud. Maryland-A psychiatrist was excluded for a mi nimum of 25 years for his conviction related to a health care frau d scheme. The psychiatrist ca used an estimated loss of $1.7 million to the Medicaid program. He wa s sentenced to 18 months home detention and ordered to pay $305,000 in restitution. New York -A clinic owner/operator was exclude d for a minimum of 15 years as a result of his conviction for filing false claims to the Medicaid program. The subject was already excluded based on a prev ious conviction for conspiracy to commit health care fraud involving private health insurers. The owner/operator was sentenced to 1 year in jail and ordered to pay $245,000 in restitution. Also in New York, a pediatrician was excluded for an indefinite period. The pediatrician surrendered his New York license after he was convicted for possession of child pornography. Civil Monetary Penalties The Civil Monetary Penalties Law (CMPL) authorizes OIG to impose administrative penalties and assessments against a person w ho, among other things, submits claims to a Federal health care program that the pe rson knows or should know are false or fraudulent. Among the Civil Monetary Penalt ies actions resolved during this reporting period were: New Jersey-University of Medicine and Dentistr y of New Jersey (UMDNJ) agreed to pay $2 million and enter into an Annual Certif ication Agreement to resolve its liability under the CMPL for two cases in which UMDNJ billed for services provided by excluded individuals. In the first case, OIG alle ged that from November 1999 through October 2000, UMDNJ knowingly presented claims to Medi care for payment of medical items or services that were provided by a cardi ac surgeon who had b een excluded from participation in Federal health care program s in July 1997. The cardiac surgeon did not know that he had been excluded because he left the country in 1997. OIG's evidence against UMDNJ demonstrated that UMDNJ knew or should have known that the surgeon was an excluded individual based on the re sults of UMDNJ's tw o inquiries to the National Practitioner Data Bank in Sept ember 1999 and April 2000. Both reports specifically stated that the surgeon was excl uded. In the second case, OIG alleged that Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 21 from 1985 through 2000, UMDNJ presented claims for reimbursement to Medicare and to the New Jersey Medicaid program for prescr iptions that were dispensed and supervised by a pharmacist who had also been excluded fr om participation in Federal health care programs. Wyoming -Interim HealthCare of Wyoming, Inc. (Interim HealthCare), Interim HealthCare of Southern Wyoming, Inc., and the home health agencies' owner (collectively, Interim) agreed to pay $250,000 to resolve allegations th at Interim violated the CMPL by submitting claims for Medicare se rvices that were not provided as claimed and/or were false or fraudulent. In addition, Interim Health Care and its owner agreed to enter into 5-year Corporate and Individual In tegrity Agreements. Specifically, Interim and its former co-owner/chief financial offi cer (CFO) allegedly claimed his salary as CFO in cost reports for fiscal year s 1994 through 1998, when at the time he was otherwise employed full time. The settlement also resolved allegations that between January 1999 and December 2000, Interim subm itted claims for medi cal services that were false or fraudulent, or not medically n ecessary. In a separate settlement agreement with OIG, the former CFO agreed to pay $20,000 and to be permanently excluded. Iowa-A chiropractor agreed to pay $48,000 to resolve his liab ility under the CMPL for allegedly submitting claims for chiropractic services that were not provided as claimed and/or were false or fraudulent. OIG a lleged that between August 2000 and November 2004, the chiropractor submitted claims for chiropr actic services consis ting of the manual manipulation of the spine to treat subluxati ons. However, his documentation allegedly did not support the existence of subluxations that required tr eatment, nor did it establish that he actually performed services for which he billed. As part of the settlement agreement, he agreed to a 7-year exclusion. Patient Dumping Of the total civil monetary penalties OIG collected in the semi annual period ending March 31, 2006, $345,000 represents collections fr om 12 hospitals and 1 physician under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, a statute designed to ensure patient access to appropriate emergency medical services. The following are examples of settlements involving alleged vi olations of this statute: California-Queen of the Valley Hospital agreed to pay $80,000 to reso lve its liability. OIG alleged that the hospital failed to accept tr ansfer of a critical patient who needed the specialized capabilities of the hospital's inte nsive care unit and also failed to provide a medical screening exam to a pregnant wo man who presented to its maternity ward. Missouri -Poplar Bluff Regional Medical Center, formerly Three Rivers Healthcare, Inc., agreed to pay $60,000 to resolve its liabi lity. OIG alleged that the hospital failed to provide appropriate medical sc reening examinations or stabilizing treatment to several patients who presented to the hospital's emer gency department requesting evaluation and treatment for several potentially serious medical conditions. Florida -Englewood Community Hospital agreed to pay $38,000 to resolv e its liability. OIG alleged that the hospital refused to provide an appropriate medical screening Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 22examination and stabilizing treatment to a know n patient with a psychiatric history who presented by ambulance seeking help for a medi cal condition. Illinois -Pekin Memorial Hospital agreed to pay $35,000 to resolve its liability. OIG alleged that the hospital failed to provide appropriate screening, stabilizing treatment, and/or appropriate transfer to a pregnant patient, who presen ted for an evaluation of the progress of her labor, and to a teenager exhibiting symptoms of mental illness who sought help for chemical dependency. Criminal and Civil Enforcement One of the most common types of fraud pe rpetrated against Medicare, Medicaid, and other Federal health care progr ams involves the filing of false claims for reimbursement. False claims may be pursued under the civil Fa lse Claims Act and, in appropriate cases, under Federal and State criminal statutes. A description of these enforcement authorities can be found in Appendix F. The successful resolution of these matters often involves the combined investigative efforts and resources of OIG, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Medicaid Fra ud Control Units (MFCUs), and a variety of other law enforcement agencies. OIG has the responsibility of assisting the De partment of Justice in bringing and settling cases under the civil False Claims Act. Many pr oviders elect to settle their cases prior to litigation. As part of their settlements, provi ders often agree to enter integrity agreements with OIG to avoid exclusions and to be perm itted to continue participation in Medicare, Medicaid, and other Federal h ealth care programs. These agreements are monitored by OIG and require the providers to enhance existing compliance programs or establish new ones. The compliance programs are designed, in part, to prevent a recurrence of the underlying fraudulent activities. In the semiannual period ending Ma rch 31, 2006, the Government's enforcement efforts resulted in $544 million in HHS investigative receivables, representing civil and administrative settleme nts or civil judgments related to Medicare, Medicaid, and other Federal heal th care programs. Some of these successful actions, as well as notable criminal enforcement acti ons, are described belo w. Summaries are organized by the sector of the health care industry involved or by the nature of the offense. Prescription Drugs Massachusetts -Serono Laboratories, Inc., along with its Swiss parent Serono, S.A., entered into a civil False Claims Act se ttlement with the Government totaling $567 million. The civil settlement was part of a global criminal, civil, and administrative settlement relating to Serono's promotion of Serostim, a drug used to treat AIDS-wasting syndrome, a condition involving profound involunt ary weight loss in AIDS patients. Serono Laboratories, Inc., a subsidiary of Sero no Holdings, Inc., pled guilty in December 2005 to two criminal conspiracy charges. One relates to the illegal promotion of Serostim for non-FDA approved indications th rough the use of an adulterated misbranded medical device and related software. The second charge relates to the payment of Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 23 kickbacks to physicians in order to induce them to prescr ibe Serostim. The kickbacks took the form of an all-expense-paid trip to an HIV conference held in Cannes, France, in 1999. The guilty plea was accepted, and Serono Laboratories, Inc., was ordered to pay a $136.9-million criminal fine. Including intere st, the total resolution for this case was more than $716 million. Through the settlement, the Medicaid program will recover all monies paid for Serostim duri ng the time period 1996 through 2004. As a result of its criminal c onviction, Serono Laboratories, In c., will be excluded from all Federal health care programs for at least 5 ye ars. In addition, Serono Holdings, Inc., the U.S. parent of Serono Laboratories, Inc., ag reed to enter into a comprehensive 5-year Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA) that w ill cover Serono Laboratories, Inc., and all other U.S. subsidiaries of Serono Holdings, Inc. The CIA contains several unique provisions, including provisions focusing on Se rono's sponsorship of continuing medical education and provisions relating to off-label promotion issues. Also in Massachusetts, SmithKline Beecham Corporation, doing business as GlaxoSmithKline, agreed to pay the Government $149 million plus interest to resolve its liability associated with certain pricing an d marketing practices for Zofran and Kytril, two antiemetic drugs used primarily in c onjunction with oncology a nd radiation treatment to prevent nausea. The Government alleged that during different times between 1994 and 2002, GlaxoSmithKline engaged in a scheme to set and maintain fraudulent and inflated prices for the drugs knowing that Fede ral health care programs established reimbursement rates based on those prices. Th e inflated prices were substantially higher than the prices paid by the majority of Gla xoSmithKline's customers, and the company is alleged to have used the spread between the inflated prices and actual acquisition costs in marketing and selling the drugs to customers, causing the customers to submit false and fraudulent claims. The Government also alleged that, with regard to Kytril, GlaxoSmithKline engaged in a scheme to en courage customers to pool leftover product from multiple vials of Kytril to create an extra dose of the drug. The extra doses were then allegedly administered to patients and re billed to Federal health care programs. As part of the settlement, GlaxoSmithKline agre ed to enter into a 5-year addendum to its existing CIA with OIG. Hospitals Illinois-Rush University Medical Center agreed to pay $1 million to settle allegations that it filed false claims between September 1997 and Se ptember 2003. In July 2003, Rush voluntarily disclosed that it received ov erpayments related to billings for Medicare and Medicaid patients enrolled in clinical cancer treatm ent trials conducted by its Division of Hematology and Oncology. To correct billing issues related to clinical trials, Rush has taken extensive actions, includi ng the establishment of a clearinghouse to oversee all clinical trial billings. In exch ange for a release from OIG's permissive exclusion authority, Rush entered into a 3-ye ar Certification of Compliance Agreement. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 24Durable Medical Equipment Supplier Texas -A durable medical equi pment company owner was ordered to pay $546,000 in restitution. The company billed Medi care for power wheelchairs provided to beneficiaries who either did not receive a power wheelchair or for whom a power wheelchair was not medically necessary. Ambulance Company South Dakota -Sioux Falls Ambulance, Inc., agreed to pay the Government $500,000 and entered into a 5-year Corporate Integr ity Agreement to resolve its liability for submitting improper claims to Medicare and TR ICARE. The Government alleged that from April 1996 through December 2000 the ambulance provider submitted claims for emergency ambulance services that should ha ve been billed as nonemergency ambulance services. Practitioners West Virginia -An osteopathic physician agreed to pay the Government $311,000 and to be excluded from all Federal health car e programs for 10 years. Between May 1998 and June 2004, the osteopath allegedly submitted improper claims to Medicare and Medicaid for office visits for established pa tients, debridements, and new patient office visits that were not supported in the patients' records. Maine-A physician agreed to pay the Government $203,000 to settle allegations that he violated the physician self-referral (Stark) prohibition. Between 1999 and 2004, he allegedly referred Medicare patients to an oxygen supply company he owned at the time. In addition, the settlement requires the physician, who will be working outside the United States, to submit an Annual Cert ification for 3 years, attestin g that he has no involvement in the billing or coding of claims submitted to Federal health care programs, and that he is not receiving reimbursement for treating Fede ral health care program beneficiaries. Nursing Homes Illinois -The owner of a company that employed nu rses and nurse practitioners to treat wounds of nursing home patients was sent enced to 1 year and 1 day in prison, and ordered to pay a total of $187,000 in restitution for health care fraud and bank fraud. The owner billed for nursing home patients' wound care services under a physician's provider number without the physician's knowledge or consent. He billed as if the physician performed the services when nurses and nurse practitioners actually performed them. In addition, he provided false in formation on a bank loan that he had secured for his company. Medicaid Fraud Control Units Currently, 48 States and the District of Co lumbia have MFCUs, which investigate and prosecute, or refer for prosecution, provide rs charged with defrauding the Medicaid program or abusing, neglecting, or financia lly exploiting beneficiaries in Medicaid-Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 25 sponsored facilities. In FY 2005, OIG provi ded oversight for and administration of approximately $149 million in Federal grant funds to the units. Examples of cases worked jointly by OIG with MFCUs during this semiannual period include: Maryland -The founder and owner of a compa ny that provided nutritional counseling to high risk pregnant women and the person in charge of billing pled guilty to Medicaid fraud. Both were given a 5-year suspe nded sentence and paid a total of $412,000 in restitution and penalties. The two billed Medi caid for prenatal nutritional counseling not provided. This investigation involv ed OIG and the Maryland MFCU. Oregon -A podiatrist agreed to pay the Government $150,000 for allegedly submitting false claims to Medicare and Medicaid from January 1998 to September 2003 for podiatric services that misrepresented the bene ficiaries' medical conditions. Specifically, the Government alleged that in order to support his improper billings for nail debridements, the podiatrist falsified his medi cal records to reflect diagnoses of fungal infections and patient complaints of pain. As part of the settlement, the podiatrist agreed to be excluded from participation in Federal health care programs for 5 years. Prior to the settlement, he was convicted of making fals e statements related to health care matters for the same conduct and was ordered to pay a fine and special assessment totaling $1,700. This investigation involved OIG, the Oregon MFCU, and the FBI. Indiana -The former director of eight drug and alcohol rehabilitation clinics was sentenced to 14 months imprisonment for heal th care fraud (to run c oncurrently with the State sentence he received) and ordered to pay $118,000 in restitution. He must also forfeit monies totaling approximately $132,000 and property valued at approximately $165,000. The director billed the Indiana Me dicaid program for ps ychotherapy services he did not provide. This investigatio n involved OIG and the Indiana MFCU. 27 Public Health Agencies The activities conducted and supported by HHS public health agencies represent this country's primary defense against acute and chronic diseases and disabilities. These programs provide the foundation for the Nation' s efforts in promoting and enhancing the health of the American people. Public heal th agencies within the Department include: National Institutes of Health (NIH) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Health Resources and Serv ices Administration (HRSA) Indian Health Service (IHS) Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) OIG continues to examine the policies and pr ocedures of these agencies to determine whether appropriate controls ar e in place to guard against fraud, waste, and abuse. These activities include preaward a nd recipient capability aud its and evaluations. This oversight work has provided valuable re commendations to program managers for strengthening the integrity of agency policies and procedures and improving program performance. Public Health Agencies 28Public Health Agency-Related Reports HHS Agencies' Compliance With the National Practitioner Data Bank Malpractice Reporting Policy The National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) maintains a listing of medical malpractice cases and makes the information available to hospitals, licensure boards, and other designated health care organi zations. HHS agencies are required to report medical malpractice cases to the data bank. Failure to report such cases to the NPDB deprives health care organizations, such as hospitals and State licensure boa rds, of potentially useful information for their credentiali ng and regulatory activities, respectively. OIG found that three HHS agencies\u2014the Heal th Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), the National Institutes of Health (N IH), and the Indian Health Service (IHS)\u2014 underreported as many as 474 medical malpr actice cases to the NPDB. Individual agency underreporting was as follows: IHS, 290 cases; HR SA, 179 cases; and NIH, 5 cases. This departmentwide underreporting was caused by a number of factors, including lost medical malpractice files; incomplete information in medical malpractice files; a 1998 decision by the HHS peer review entity, th e Quality Review Panel, to not identify practitioners who meet the st andard of care; and the failure to replace a key Program Support Center claims official or to reassign his NPDB reporting duties. OIG recommended that HRSA, IHS, and NIH each take steps to (1) implement a corrective action process that would address the unreported cases, (2) improve internal controls involving case files management, a nd (3) assign staff to assume responsibility for addressing practitioner questions/complaints and data entry of reports to the NPDB. In response to the report, the Secretary indicated that th e Department is working to develop a final action plan, incl uding policy decisions relating to future reporting. The response noted that revised procedures have been implemented to track new reports of malpractice payments to help prevent future backlogs. The reply also stated that recommendations would be made to the Secr etary to ensure greater compliance in the future. IHS responded that it is addressing the issues an d recommendations identified in the report. (OEI-12-04-00310) Use of Departmental Alert List by CDC The Alert List is a tool used by an awardi ng HHS agency to safeguard Department funds by alerting other agencies to a particular gran tee's potential risks, such as the grantee's financial instability or inadequate management systems. An OIG study found that CDC did not consiste ntly follow Alert List policies. In particular, CDC did not always place grantees on the Alert Li st, check the Alert List prior to award and document when a grantee was found on the Alert List , consult with the agency that placed the grantee on the Alert List, complete certain monitoring activities when attaching a special award condition to a gr ant, or provide justification for retaining grantees on the Alert List after 2 years. OIG also f ound that competing priorities, misunderstandings, and concerns about several aspects of the Alert List may explain why grants officers are not follow ing Alert List policies. Public Health Agencies 29 OIG recommended that CDC ensure that gr ants officers follow Alert List policies, develop methods to ensure accountability to Alert List policies, and improve file maintenance to meet third-party review policies. The CDC took no exception to the report. (OEI-02-03-00010) National Institute of Environmen tal Health Sciences Superfund The National Institute of Environmental He alth Sciences receives Superfund money to carry out training and resear ch functions mandated by the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. Pursuant to the Act, OIG audited the Institute's Superfund obligations and disbur sements for FY 2004. The audit determined that these funds were administered in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. (A-04-05-01019) Ryan White Title II Funds in Puerto Rico Pursuant to Title II of the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act (CARE Act), HRSA makes grants to States and territories to fund comprehensive treatment services and drug therapies for peopl e with HIV/AIDS. The CARE Act Title II program is the payer of last resort for pe ople with no or limited health care coverage. This review found that Puerto Rico claimed unallowable Title II costs, did not have procedures to ensure that th e program was the payer of last resort, and did not always purchase drugs at the lowest prices available. These deficiencies resulted in $2.7 million in unallowable claims and excessive drug payments. OIG recommended that Puerto Rico ref und the overpayments and make procedural changes to comply with Federal requirement s. Puerto Rico neither concurred nor nonconcurred with the reco mmendations. (A-02-03-02002) Health Education Assistance Loan Defaults Through the Health Education Assistance Loan (HEAL) program, HRSA guarantees commercial loans to students seeking educatio n in health-related fields of study. The students are allowed to defer repayment of thes e loans until after they have graduated and begun to earn an income. Although the Depa rtment's Program Support Center (PSC) takes all steps it can to ensure repayment, there are some loan recipients who ignore their indebtedness. After PSC has exhausted efforts to secure repayment of a debt , it declares the individual in default. Thereafter, the Social Security Act permits, and in some instances mandates, exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid, and all Federal health care programs for nonpayment of these loans. Exclusion m eans that the individual may not receive reimbursement under these programs for prof essional services rendered. During the period covered by this report, 34 individuals a nd related entities were excluded as a result of PSC referral of their cases to OIG. Individuals who have been ex cluded as a result of defaul t may enter into settlement agreements, whereby the exclusion is stayed while they pay specified amounts each Public Health Agencies 30month to satisfy the debt. If they default on these settlement agreements, the individuals can then be excluded until the entire debt is repaid and can not appeal these exclusions. Some health professionals, upon being notif ied of their exclus ion, immediately repay their HEAL debts. After being excluded for nonpayment of their HEAL debts, a total of 1,989 individuals have taken advantage of the opportunity to enter into settlement agreements or completely repay their debts. This figure includes the 50 individua ls who have entered into such a settlement agreement or complete ly repaid their debts during this reporting period. The amount of money being repaid through settlement agreements or through complete repayment totals $141.9 million. Of that amount, $3.3 million is attributable to this reporting period. In the following examples, each individual ente red into a settlement agreement to repay the amount indicated: A Pennsylvania physician-$165,000 A Texas podiatrist-$164,000 A Minnesota psychologist-$122,000 A Michigan podiatrist-$96,000 Public Health-Related Investigations OIG also investigates cases involving the misuse of public health agency funds and threats to public health a nd safety, such as the imprope r use of select agents. The following are examples of cases involving improper use of HHS grant funds resolved during this reporting period: Massachusetts -The National Coalition of Advocates for Students (NCAS) agreed to pay the Government $100,000 to settle allega tions that it improperly used CDC grant funds. In 2001, CDC awarded NCAS a 5-year gr ant to provide HIV education to migrant youths. NCAS, acting through an employee, allegedly misused the funds by charging inappropriate expenses to the grant, including certain entertainment and travel expenses. NCAS is no longer in business. Utah -A pediatrician who operated an immunization program utilizing Federal Vaccines for Children program funds agr eed to pay the Government $65,000. The pediatrician allegedly administered 3,851 vaccine doses to children who were not eligible to receive the free immunizations . He also allegedly admini stered expired vaccines to children in at least two cases. With regard to investigating the improper use of select agents, Section 201 of the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Prep aredness and Response Act of 2002, Section 351A(a) of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 262a (a), grants the Secretary authority to establish and maintain a list of each biological agent and toxin that has the potential to pose a severe threat to public hea lth and safety. Section 351A(i) of the Public Public Health Agencies 31 Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 262a(i), permits the imposition of civil monetary penalties on individuals or entities for failure to abide by regulations pertaining to the transfer, use, and possession of those agents and toxins (Selec t Agent regulations) promulgated by the Secretary, set forth in 42 C.F.R. part 73. The following case resolved in this reporting period involved the improper use of select agents: Maryland -An entity agreed to pay $150,000 to settle allegations that it violated the Select Agent regulations by making an unauthorized transfer of a select agent to an unregistered research facility. OIG allege d that in March 2004 the entity shipped the select agent to a research facility that was not registered with CDC to possess the select agent. In addition, OIG alleged that the ent ity never obtained authorization from CDC to ship the select agent to the research facility. 33 Administration for Children and Families and Administration on Aging The Administration for Children and Familie s (ACF) provides direction and funding for programs designed to promote stability, eco nomic security, responsibility, and self- support for the Nation's families. Some of the major programs include Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Child Support Enforcement, Foster Care, Family Preservation and Support, Head Start, and the Child Care and Development Block Grant. OIG reviews these programs to focus on ways to increase the efficient use of program dollars; to implement programs more effectiv ely; to better coordinate programs among the Federal, State, and local government s; and to strengthen States' financial management practices. The Administration on Aging (AoA) awards grants to States for establishing comprehensive community-based systems that assist the elderly in maintaining their independence and in remaining in their homes as long as possible. Socially and economically disadvantaged elderly and low- income minority elderl y are targeted for assistance, including supportive and nutrition services, education and training, low-cost transportation, and health promotion. Over the years, OIG has reported opportunities for program improvements to target the neediest for services, expand available financial resources, upgrade data collection and reporting, and e nhance program oversight. Administration for Children and Fa milies and Administration on Aging 34Administration for Children and Families-Related Reports State Standards and Capacity To Tr ack Frequency of Caseworker Visits With Children in Foster Care A critical element in maintaining the safety and well-being of children in foster care is face-to-face visits with casew orkers. There is no Federa l requirement regarding how often children in foster care are visited by ca seworkers. However, the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) reviews caseworker visits as part of its Child and Family Service Reviews (CFSRs). The objectives of this evaluation were to determine (1) whether States have implemented written standards for frequency of caseworker visits with children in foster care, (2) the extent to which States could generate statewide automated reports reflecting the frequency of caseworker visits, and (3) the exte nt to which statewide reports indicate that children were visited. Forty-three States ha d written standards calling for caseworkers to visit children in foster care at least monthly. Fifty of fi fty-one States (including the District of Columbia) had statewide mini mum standards regarding the frequency of caseworker visits covering the majority of chil dren in foster care placed in-State. Twenty States demonstrated their ability to produce statewide reports detailing the extent to which visits occurred during fiscal year (FY) 2003. Seven of the twenty statewide reports indicated on average that fewer than half of children in foster care were visited monthly in FY 2003. OIG recommended that ACF promote the development of automated systems such as the Statewide Automated Child Welfare Informa tion System and work with States with automated system capacity to record the fre quency of caseworker visi ts to ensure that visitation data are recorded in automated systems. ACF concu rred with the report's recommendations. (OEI-04-03-00350) State Standards and Practices for Cont ent of Caseworker Visits With Children in Foster Care Caseworker visits are a critical element in maintaining the safety and well-being of children in foster care. There are no Fede ral requirements regarding specific activities that caseworkers must perform during visits with children in foster care. However, ACF reviews caseworker visits as part of its CFSRs. The objective of this evaluation was to identi fy the written standards that States have implemented for the content of caseworker vis its with children in foster care and the practices of States without written standards. Forty-one out of fifty- one States (including the District of Columbia) reported having statewide written standards addressing the content of caseworker visits. Thirty-eight of these States had written standards specific to caseworker visits. Three of the forty-one States reported having written documents addressing the content of caseworker visits, but as part of broader program areas such as case planning and family service plans. Ten States did not have written standards, but eight of these States provided information about the content of caseworker visits. Administration for Children and Fa milies and Administration on Aging 35 OIG's report provides a national picture of State written standards and practices that could assist ACF as it conducts CFSRs and the States as they consider program enhancements. (OEI-04-03-00351) Title IV-E Training Costs Pursuant to Title IV-E of the Social Security Act, the Fede ral Government shares in the costs of training State caseworkers who serv ice foster and adoptive children meeting Federal eligibility requirements. OIG determ ined whether two States' claims for Title IV-E administrative and traini ng costs complied with their approved plans for allocating costs between Federal and State programs. Maryland -Maryland claimed costs for activities that were not included in its cost allocation plan or that were identified as St ate-funded activities. As a result, Maryland overstated its Federal claims by $4.3 milli on during 1999-2001. Maryland later adjusted its claims by about $3.2 million. OIG recommended that Maryland refund the remaining overpayments and review subsequent claims to identify any further ove rpayments. Maryland agreed to do so. (A-03-04-00580) New Hampshire-Contrary to Federal requirements , New Hampshire did not allocate its training costs between Federal and Stat e programs. As a result, New Hampshire overstated Federal claims by $1.76 million during State FYs 2001 through 2003. OIG recommended that New Hampshire make a financial adjustment and ensure that it follows allocation requirements in the fu ture. New Hampshire disagreed with the recommendations. (A-01-05-02500) Undistributable Child Suppor t Collections in Ohio ACF's Office of Child Support Enforcement (O CSE) requires States to offset Child Support Enforcement program costs by recogni zing and reporting program income from undistributable child support collections a nd interest earned on program funds. In this report, OIG found that Ohio did not report over $2.8 million ($1.8 million Federal share) in program income for undistributed collections for the quarters that ended December 1998 through September 2004. The State also did not recognize program income of more than $500,000 (over $330,000 Federal share) for unclaimed and undistributable collections that should ha ve been considered abandoned. These deficiencies happened because the State a nd certain county personnel were unaware of the reporting requirement and because the St ate did not provide sufficient oversight of county reporting of undistri butable collections and county and State recognition of unclaimed collections. OIG recommended that the State make financial adjustments and strengthen program oversight. The State agreed and said that th e proper systems were in place to assist the State and counties in following regul ations and OIG's recommendations. (A-05-04-00075) Administration for Children and Fa milies and Administration on Aging 36Administration on Ag ing-Related Report Performance Data for the Senior Medicare Patrol Projects: December 2005 Performance Report The Senior Medicare Patrol Projects receive grants from the Administration on Aging to recruit retired professionals to serve as educat ors and resources to as sist beneficiaries in detecting and reporting fraud, waste, and abus e in the Medicare program. A total of 57 projects operated from January through June 2005. The objectives of this report were to: (1) track performance data, (2) perform comparative data analysis, and (3) verify documentation of overpayments recovere d as a result of this project. The projects educated more than 192,000 beneficiaries in more than 64,000 group training sessions, and documented $83,200 retu rned to the Medicare program. The projects also reported $44,500 in savings to bene ficiaries. All of th e projects provided descriptions of out-of-pocket expenses being returned to beneficiar ies and savings due to the resolution of billing errors. (OEI-02-04-00362) Child Support Enforcement The detection, investigation, and prosecution of noncustodial parents who fail to pay court-ordered child support is a priority for OIG. Worki ng with OCSE, the Department of Justice, U.S. Attorneys' Offices, U.S. Mars hals Service, and other Federal, State, and local partners, OIG develops ways to expedite the collection of ch ild support. Since 1995, OIG has opened 3,085 investig ations of child support case s nationwide, resulting in 1,165 convictions and court-ordered rest itution and settlements of $60.8 million. Task Forces In 1998, OIG and OCSE initiated \"Project Sa ve Our Children,\" a child support initiative made up of multiagency, multijurisdictional investigative task forces for child support enforcement. The task forces are designed to identify, investigate, and prosecute egregious criminal nonsupport cases on both the Federal and State levels by coordinating law enforcement, criminal justice, and chil d support office resource s. The child support Task Forces Table appears on the following page. Administration for Children and Fa milies and Administration on Aging 37 Task Force Table Task Force Regions Task Force He adquarters Task Force States Great Plains Topeka, Kansas Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota Mid-Atlantic Baltimore, Maryland Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia Midwest Columbus, Ohio Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Wisconsin New England Boston, Massachusetts Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont Northeast New York, New York New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands Pacific North Olympia, Washington Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, Washington Rocky Mountains Denver, Colorado Colorado, Montana, Utah, Wyoming Southeast Atlanta, Georgia Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee Southwest Dallas, Texas Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas West Coast Sacramento, California Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada Central to the task forces are the screeni ng units located in each task force region and staffed by investigative analys ts from OIG and OCSE. The units receive child support cases from the States, conduct pr e-investigative analyses of these cases through the use of databases, and forward the cases to the inve stigative task force units, wherein they are assigned and investigated. Th e task force approach stream lines the process by which the cases best suited for criminal prosecution are identified, investigated, and resolved. To date, the task force units have received over 10,006 cases from the States. As a result of the work of the task forces, 605 Federal arrests have been executed and 586 individuals sentenced. The total ordered amount of rest itution related to Federal investigations is $26.8 million. There have been 380 arrests at the State level and 364 convictions or civil adjudications to date, resulting in $20.2 million in restitution being ordered as a result of State investigations. Administration for Children and Fa milies and Administration on Aging 38Investigations Nationwide, OIG investigations of child s upport cases resulted in 59 convictions and court-ordered restitution and settlements of $3.6 million during this semiannual period. Examples of the Federal arrests, convicti ons, and sentences for failure to pay child support include the following: Washington-A man was sentenced to 5 years probation, 250 hours community service, and was ordered to pay $69,000 in rest itution for failure to pay child support. He had three separate child support orders fr om Indiana. The man, who works as a phlebotomist at a hospital, was also ordere d to cease identifying himself as a Federal agent and medical doctor. Ohio -A man was sentenced to 5 years pr obation and ordered to pay $45,000 in restitution for failure to pay child support. The man held various positions in the telecommunications industry and evaded his child support obligation by receiving cash payments for his work and/or by moving from job to job within the industry. Maine-A man was sentenced to 3 months in prison, 3 months home confinement, and 1 year probation for failure to pay child suppo rt. He was also or dered to pay $43,000 in restitution for three separate child support obligations. Although the man inherited a significant amount of money, he never voluntarily paid any of his obligations. South Dakota -A woman was sentenced to 5 years supervised probation and ordered to pay $11,000 in restitution for failure to pay child support. After her arrest in November 2004 and prior to sentencing, she pa id $1,000 toward her arr earage. In 1999, she was ordered to pay $260 per month in support of her children. 39 General Oversight The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Budget, Technology and Finance (ASBTF) is responsible for developing and executing the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) budget; ensuring that HHS performance measurement and reporting are in compliance with the Government Performa nce and Results Act; establishing and monitoring departmental policy for financia l management (including debt collection, audit resolution, cost policy, and financial re porting); and developing and monitoring HHS information technology policy (including information technology security). The Assistant Secretary is the Department's Chief Financial Officer and oversees the Department's Chief Information Officer. Th e Department also has the responsibility, by virtue of the magnitude of its funding, to ne gotiate the payment rates and methods that many outside entities, such as State and lo cal governments, charge for administering HHS and other Federal programs. The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management (ASAM) is responsible for HHS policies regarding human resources, grants, and acquisition management. This office also oversees the Program Support Center, which provides a range of administrative services, such as human resources, financial management, and administrative operations. OIG has general oversight responsibility for these activities. A related major responsibility derives from Office of Mana gement and Budget (OMB) Circular A-133, under which HHS is the cognizant agency to au dit the majority of Federal funds awarded to major research schools and State and local government cost allocation plans. OIG also oversees the work of non-Federal auditors of Federal money at some 6,700 entities, such as community health centers and Head Star t grantees, as well as at State and local governments, colleges and universities, and ot her nonprofit organizations. OIG also is responsible for auditing the Department's financial statements. OIG reviews audits, evaluations, and studi es performed by others, such as OMB's Program Assessment and Rating Tool and re ports of the Government Accountability Office. It takes these studi es into account when planning its own work and examines management actions designed to correct the deficiencies cited in these prior studies. General Oversight 40General Oversight-Related Reports Departmental Financial Statement Audit The Chief Financial Officers Act (the Act) of 1990, as amended, requires OIG or an independent external auditor, as determ ined by OIG, to audit the HHS financial statements in accordance with applicable st andards. Auditors provided an unqualified opinion on the FY 2005 HHS consolidated/combi ned financial statements. This means that for the seventh consecutive year, the statem ents were reliable and fairly presented. However, the report on internal contro ls noted two material weaknesses: Financial Systems and Processes -Although HHS made some progress in preparing financial statements, the lack of an integrated financial management system(s) and weaknesses in internal contro ls made it difficult for HHS to prepare timely and accurate financial statements. Substantial manual pr ocesses, significant adjustments to reported balances, and numerous accounting entries record ed outside HHS's general ledger system were necessary. In addition, deficiencies were noted in regional office oversight of States' Medicaid and SCHIP programs and data analyses and reconciliations. Managed Care Payments -CMS lacked comprehensive controls over the managed care benefits payment cycle, including overs ight of managed care organizations. CMS implemented the Medicare Managed Care System despite known deficiencies in the system that led to erroneous payments. In addition, CMS failed to establish a process to ensure that accounting and operational i ssues were addressed throughout the new payment system implementation process. A lthough the majority of the payment errors were identified and corrected, policies and procedures did no t adequately reduce the risk that material benefit payment errors would occur and not be detected and corrected in a timely manner. These material weaknesses re presented departures from certain Federal laws and regulations. (A-17-05-00001) Departmental Service Organizations To support the audit of the Department's FY 2005 financial statements, OIG contracted for examinations of several service organiza tions that provide common administrative, data processing, and accounting se rvices to the operating divi sions. In accordance with the Statement on Auditing Standards No. 70, independent certified public accounting firms examined the organizations' controls a nd tested their operating effectiveness. The results follow: Division of Payment Management, Program Support Center -Controls were suitably designed and operating with sufficient effectiveness. No significant exceptions were noted. (A-17-05-00009) Division of Financial Opera tions, Program Support Center -Controls were suitably designed and operating with sufficient effectiv eness, with the exceptions of application software development and change controls, lo gical access controls, and system software controls. (A-17-05-00011) General Oversight 41 Human Resources Service, Program Support Center -Controls were suitably designed and operating with sufficient effectiv eness, with the exceptions of application software development and change controls an d certain deficiencies in the transaction processing system. (A-17-05-00012) Center for Information Technology, National Institutes of Health -Controls were suitably designed and operating with sufficient effectiveness, with the exceptions of documentation and logging of change requests, authorizations, testi ng, and approval on mainframe and Windows host platforms. (A-17-05-00010) North Carolina Internal Service Fund North Carolina's Office of Information Tec hnology Services (ITS) operates an internal service fund that provides centrally managed computing services to State agencies and some county and city governments. The Fede ral Government shares in the costs of ITS services when the user agencies claim reimbursement for those costs under Federal programs. This review found that the State failed to return the $8.2 million Federal share of excess revenues transferred from its internal service fund. The State did not return the funds because ITS did not have procedures to ensure that the Federal G overnment received its share of all revenues in excess of costs. OIG recommended that the State refund the $8.2 million and implement procedures to ensure that the Federal Government receives its share of future excess revenues. The State generally disagreed with OI G's computation. (A-04-04-03503) Non-Federal Audits OMB Circular A-133 establishes audit requir ements for State and local governments, colleges and universities, and nonprofit organi zations receiving Federal awards. Under this circular, covered entities are required to have an annual organiza tion-wide audit of all Federal money they receive. These audits are conducted by non-Federal auditors, such as public accounting firms and State auditors. OI G reviews the quality of these audits and assesses the adequacy of the entity's management of Federal funds. In the first half of FY 2006, OIG's National External Audit Review Center re viewed 1,191 reports that covered $473.2 trillion in audited costs. Federal dollars covered by these audits totaled $118.5 billion, about $61.5 billi on of which was HHS money. OIG's oversight of non-Federal audit activit y informs Department managers about the soundness of management of Federal programs and identifies any significant areas of internal control weakness, noncompliance, and questioned costs that require formal resolution by Federal officials. OIG identif ies entities for high-risk monitoring, alerts program officials to any tre nds that could indicate prob lems in HHS programs, and profiles non-Federal audit fi ndings of a particular progr am or activity over time to identify systemic problems. OIG also pr ovides training and t echnical assistance to grantees and the auditing profession. General Oversight 42OIG maintains a quality control review proces s to assess the quality of the non-Federal reports received and the audit work that suppor ts selected reports. The non-Federal audit reports reviewed and issued during this repo rting period are categorized in the box below: Reports issued: Without changes or with minor changes 1,015 With major changes 117 With significant inadequacies 59 Total: 1,191 The 1,191 reports included recommendations for HHS program officials to take action on cost recoveries totaling $522,000, as well as 4,333 recommendations for improving management operations. In addition, these audit reports provided information for 95 special memoranda that identified concerns for increased monitori ng by departmental management. Resolving Recommendations The following tables are provided in accordance with section 5 of the Inspector General Act and indicate the dollar value of actions taken on OIG's recommendations.

General Oversight 45 Legislative and Regulatory Review and Development Regulatory Review Functions Section 4(a) of the Inspector General Act of 1978 requires that the Inspector General review existing and proposed legislation a nd regulations and make recommendations in this report concerning the im pact on the economy and efficien cy of the administration of the Department's programs and on the prevention of fraud and abuse. In reviewing regulations and legislative propos als, OIG uses as the primary basis for its comments the audits, evaluations, investigatio ns, and other activities highli ghted in this and previous semiannual reports. During the first half of FY 2006, OIG was invo lved in the review and clearance of the implementing regulations and other policy guidance resulting from the various Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) provisions. OIG reviewed and provided comments on pot ential fraud and abuse issues arising in connection with implementation of the Me dicare Part D Prescription Drug Benefit, establishment of the Medicare Advantage pr ogram, and e-prescribing standards for the prescription drug program. Regulatory Development OIG is responsible for the development and publication of a variety of sanction regulations addressing civil money pena lty and program exclusion authorities administered by the Inspector General, as we ll as regulations promulgating safe harbors related to the anti-kickback statute. During this semia nnual reporting period, OIG did the following: In accordance with the MMA, published prop osed rulemaking that would establish a new safe harbor under the anti-kickback stat ute for certain arrangements involving the provision of electronic prescr ibing technology. Specifica lly, the safe harbor would protect certain arrangements involving hospitals, group practices, a nd prescription drug plan sponsors and Medicare Advantage organizati ons that provide to specified recipients certain nonmonetary remuneration in the form of hardware, software, or information technology and training services necessary fo r and used solely to receive and transmit electronic prescription drug information. (70 FR 59015; October 11, 2005) In accordance with section 205 of the Health Insurance Po rtability and Accountability Act, published a Federal Register notice soliciting proposals and recommendations for developing new and modifyi ng existing safe harbor provisions under the anti-kickback statute, as well as new OIG Special Fr aud Alerts. (70 FR 73186; December 9, 2005) Continued to develop proposed rulemaking that would reorganize and revise 42 CFR part 1003 by establishing separate subparts to address OIG's authority to propose the imposition of civil money penalties and a ssessments for false or fraudulent claims, violations by managed care organizations, and other violations. General Oversight 46In addition, OIG published a number of Federa l Register notices that offer guidance to alert health care providers and program beneficiaries about poten tial problems or areas of special interest. During this semi annual period, OIG guidance included: A Federal Register notice setting forth OIG's Special Advisory Bulletin on patient assistance programs for Medicare Part D enrollees. (70 FR 70623; November 22, 2005) A Federal Register notice seeking public comment on draft compliance program guidance for recipients of extramural resear ch awards from the National Institutes of Health and other agencies of the U.S. Public Health Service. The guidance is intended to set forth OIG's general views on the value and fundamental princi ples of compliance programs for colleges and univers ities and other recipients of PHS awards for biomedical and behavioral research and the specific elements that these award recipients should consider when developing and implementing an effective compliance program. (70 FR 71312; November 28, 2005) A Federal Register notice setting forth an adjustment in the fees charged for each query submitted by authorized entities to access the data bank, in accordance with the implementing regulations for the Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank. (71 FR 12368: March 10, 2006) Employee Fraud and Misconduct Most individuals employed by HHS are dedica ted, honest civil servants. Occasionally, however, individuals violate thei r ethical and fiduciary respon sibilities. OIG conducts or oversees investigations of serious allegations of wrongdoing by Department employees, as in the following examples: Maryland -A former NIH employee was ordered to pay $49,000 in restitution for theft of Government property. The employee recorded unautho rized overtime she did not work into the time and attendance system, resu lting in her obtaining fraudulent payments. Also in Maryland, a former NIH employee was ordered to pay $12,000 in restitution for theft of Government property. The employee used her Government-i ssued credit card in an unauthorized manner, includi ng to pay her monthly apartment rent, college tuition fees for her daughter, and kennel services for her dog. Prosecutions During this semiannual reporting period, OIG i nvestigations resulted in 226 successful criminal actions. Also during this semi annual period, 595 cases were presented for criminal prosecution to the Department of Ju stice and, in some instances, to State and local prosecutors. Prosecutors brought criminal charges against 263 individuals and entities. In addition to terms of imprisonment and probation imposed in the judicial processes, $732.4 million was ordered to be returned, or was returned, as a result of OIG General Oversight 47 investigations during this reporting period. Civil settlements from investigations resulting from audit findings are included in this figure. 49 APPENDIXES 51 Appendix A: Savings Achieved Through Implementation of Recommendations in Audits and Evaluations and Investigative Recoveries October 1, 2005, Through March 31, 2006 The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates annual Federal sa vings expected to result from the enactment of legislation as part of the process of informing Congress of the potential impact of legislation under consideration. Afte r laws involving HHS programs have been enacted, OIG analyzes them to identify provisions that were recommended in OIG-issued reports. A similar process occurs with respect to administrative changes recommended by OI G and implemented by HHS operating or staff divisions. When this occurs, the savi ngs estimated to accrue are developed by the relevant HHS operating or staff division or by OIG. Savings of this kind depend greatly on the c ontributions of others , such as other HHS divisions and the Department of Justice. The amounts claimed represent funds that will be available for better use as a result of documented actions taken, including reductions in budget outlays, deobligations of funds, re ductions in costs incurred, preaward grant reductions, and reductions and/or withdrawal of the Federal portion of interest subsidy costs of loans or loan guarantees, insurance, or bonds. Total estimated savings from implemented recommendations and other actions to put funds to better use were $32.6 billion fo r the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005. Effective with this semiannual report, OIG w ill report savings in the Fall issue only. In doing this, OIG's presentations of savings will be consistent with the annualized estimates reported by CBO. 53 Appendix B: Unimplemented Of fice of Inspector General Recommendations To Put Funds to Better Use This schedule represents potential annual sa vings or one-time recoveries that could be realized if OIG recommendations were en acted by Congress or th e Department through legislation, regulation, or management action. In some cases, these recommendations are beyond the direct authority of the resp ective departmental operating division. Congress develops savings over a 5- or 10-year budget cycle th at result in far greater dollar impact than the annual estimates shown in the table below. The same can be said for regulations issued and management acti ons taken by the Department. Savings are based on preliminary OIG estimates and reflec t economic assumptions that are subject to change. The magnitude of the savings may increase or decrease because of interactive effects if changes are enacted together. More detailed informati on may be found in OIG's Red Book . (See http://oig.hhs.gov .) OIG Recommendation Status Savings (millions) Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Clinical Laboratory Tests: CMS should develop a methodology and legislative proposal to pay for tests ordered as custom panels at substantially less than the full price for individual tests and study reinstating the beneficiary coinsurance and deductible provisions for laboratory services as a means of controlling utilization. (A-09-89-00031, A-09-93-00056) CMS has taken corrective actions to reduce payments for laboratory services. A proposal to reduce payment updates from FY 2003 through 2005 was included in the President's FY 2001 budget, as well as was a proposal to reinstate laboratory cost sharing. Neither of these proposals was enacted. The Balanced Budget Act (BBA) required the Secretary to request that the Institute of Medicine (IOM) study Part B laboratory test payments. As a result of IOM's recommendations, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) mandates that CMS conduct a demonstration that applies competitive bidding for clinical laboratory services. The MMA also set the laboratory fee schedule updates at 0 percent for 2004 through 2008. $1,130 * Outpatient Surgery Rates: CMS should seek authority to set rates that are consistent across sites and reflect only the costs necessary for the efficient delivery of health services and remove the procedure codes that meet its criteria for removal from the Ambulatory Surgery Center (ASC) list of covered procedures. (A-14-89-00221, A-14-98-00400, OEI-09-88-01003, OEI-05-00-00340) CMS agreed to consider seeking authority to set rates that are consistent across sites as it develops its legislative program. CMS published the Medicare Program; Updated ASC List of Covered Procedures on May 4, 2005. The MMA requires CMS to implement a revised payment system for ASCs between January 2006 and January 2008. $1,100 * This savings estimate would result from the copayment; the savings estimate for fee schedule adjustments has yet to be determined. Appendix B 54 OIG Recommendation Status Savings (millions) Medicaid Reimbursement for Brand-Name Drugs: CMS should encourage States to bring pharmacy reimbursement in line with pharmacies' actual acquisition costs of brand-name drugs. OIG recommended a four-tier approach to reimbursement: single-source innovator drugs, all drugs without Federal upper limits (FUL ), multiple-source drugs without FULs, and multiple-source drugs with FULs. (A-06-00-00023, A-06-02-00041) CMS concurred with OIG's recommendation and is working with States to review their estimates of acquisition costs in light of OIG's findings. OIG will continue to monitor the pricing of Medicaid reimbursement for brand- name drugs . $1,080 Medicare Payments for Mental Health Services: CMS should ensure that mental health services are medically necessary, reasonable, accurately billed, and ordered by an authorized practitioner by using a comprehensive program of targeted medical reviews, provider education, improved documentation requirements, and increased surveillance of mental health services. (OEI-02-99-00140, OEI-03-99-00130, A-04-98-02145, A-01-99-00507, A-01-99-00530) CMS concurred and has initiated some efforts, particularly regarding community mental health centers. OIG is reviewing this area to determine if substantial errors are still present. $676 Medicaid Reimbursement for Generic Drugs: CMS should encourage States to bring pharmacy reimbursement more in line with pharmacies' actual acquisition costs of generic drugs. OIG recommended a four-tier approach to reimbursement: single-source innovator drugs, all drugs without FULs, multiple-source FULs, and multiple-source drugs with FULs. (A-06-01-00053, A-06-02-00041) CMS concurred with OIG's recommendation. The agency is working with States to strongly encourage them to review their estimates of acquisition costs and will follow up to ensure that they take OIG's findings into account. The Deficit Reduction Act (DRA) changed the Medicaid reimbursement rate for generic drugs, whereby the Federal Government will set a FUL on Medicaid drug payment that is equal to 250 percent of the average manufacturer's price (AMP) for a generic version of the drug. The DRA redefined AMP as the average price at which manufacturers sell their drugs to wholesalers. The President's FY 2007 Budget would build on the DRA with changes to the FULs for multiple source drugs and would limit reimbursement for multiple source drugs to 150 percent of AMP. OIG will continue to monitor the pricing of Medicaid reimbursements for generic drugs. $470 Payment Policy for Medicare Bad Debts: OIG presented options for CMS to consider: the elimination of a separate payment for bad debts, the offset of Medicare bad debts against beneficiary Social Security payments, the limitation of bad debt payments to prospective payment system hospitals that are profitable, and the inclusion of a bad debt factor in the diagnosis- related group rates. CMS should seek legislative authority to further modify bad debt policies. (A-14-90-00339) The BBA provided for some reduction of bad debt payments to providers. The Benefits Improvement Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA) subsequently adjusted upwards the percentage of total hospital bad debt that would be reimbursed. Medicare now pays 70 percent of allowable bad debts. Additional legislative changes are required to implement the modifications OIG recommended. $340 The President's FY 2007 budget proposal phases out bad debt payments over 4 years. Appendix B 55 OIG Recommendation Status Savings (millions) Cost Effectiveness of \"Pay and Chase\" Methods for Medicaid Pharmacy Third-Party Liability Recoveries: CMS should determine whether States' cost- avoidance waivers for pharmacy claims are meeting the cost-effectiveness criterion. CMS can ascertain cost-effectiveness by requiring States to track dollars that they pay and chase and the amounts that they recover. CMS should also review States' policies to determine if they are paying and chasing pharmacy claims without waivers. (OEI-03-00-00030, OEI-03-00-00031) CMS agreed with the recommendation and has worked to improve its oversight of the cost avoidance waiver process. The recommendation was discussed with CMS's regional offices in February 2005 to assess whether States are appropriately paying and chasing claims. In addition, CMS provided training for staff to ensure that appropriate cost avoidance waiver criteria are being applied in granting any such waivers. In addition, CMS is currently planning to survey and update State progress in cost avoiding several major claim types . The President's FY 2007 Budget proposes to discontinue all waivers that permit pay and chase of pharmacy claims. $185 Graduate Medical Education: CMS should revise the regulations to remove from a hospital's allowable graduate medical education (GME) base-year costs any cost center with little or no Medicare utilization and submit a legislative proposal to compute Medicare's percentage of participation under the former, more comprehensive system. (A-06-92-00020) CMS did not concur with the recommendations. Although the BBA and the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 (BBRA) contained provisions to slow the growth in Medicare spending on GME, OIG believes that its recommendations should be implemented and that further savings can be achieved. $157.3 Medicaid Drug Rebate Program: The best-price calculation in the Medicaid drug rebate program should be indexed to the consumer price index-urban. (A-06-94-00039) CMS continues to disagree with the recommendation. OIG continues to monitor the drug rebate program; audits will continue to focus on enhancing the collection of rebates and providing potential savings to the rebate program. OIG has issued rebate reports to each State Medicaid agency as it relates to the State's internal control. $123 Inappropriate Payments for Nail Debridement: CMS should require Medicare carriers to recoup the overpayments found in OIG's sample and to carefully scrutinize payments for nail debridement services through medical reviews, require podiatrists to adequately document the medical necessity of all nail debridement services, and require CMS regional offices and carriers to educate podiatrists on Medicare payment policies for nail debridement claims. (OEI-04-99-00460) CMS concurred; the agency plans to continue to maximize the effectiveness of its medical review strategy, collect the overpayments identified in OIG's sample, and educate podiatrists on Medicare policy for paying nail debridement claims. The agency planned to continue to maximize the effectiveness of its medical review strategy and collect the overpayments identified in our sample. CMS prepared a provider education article to educate podiatrists on Medicare policy for paying nail debridement claims. $96.8 Medical Equipment/Supply Claims Lacking Valid, Active Unique Ph ysician Identification Numbers: CMS should create edits to identify medical equipment and supply claims that do not have a valid and active unique physician identification number (UPIN) listed for the ordering physician. (OEI-03-01-00110) CMS concurred and implemented an edit to reject claims listing a deceased physician's UPIN beginning in April 2002. CMS decided not to implement edits for inactive and invalid UPINs. Instead, the agency initiated provider education efforts and issued two program memorandums. $91 Appendix B 56 OIG Recommendation Status Savings (millions) Expansion of the Diagnosis Related Group Payment Window: CMS should propose legislation to expand the diagnosis related group payment window to at least 7 days immediately before the day of admission. (A-01-92-00521, A-01-02-00503) CMS concurred with OIG's recommendation; however, CMS noted that some additional factors would have to be considered before a legislative change could be advanced . $37 End-Stage Renal Disease Payment Rates: CMS should reduce the payment rates for outpatient dialysis treatments to reflect current efficiencies and economies in the marketplace. (A-14-90-00215) CMS agreed that the composite payment rates should reflect the costs of outpatient dialysis treatment in efficiently operated facilities, and the BBA required the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to audit the cost reports of each dialysis provider at least once every 3 years. The BBRA increased each composite rate payment for dialysis services furnished during 2000 by 1.2 percent above the payment for services provided on December 31, 1999. The BIPA of 2000 increased the payment rate for services provided in 2001 by 2.4 percent and required the Secretary to develop a composite rate that includes, to the maximum extent feasible, payment for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests and drugs that are routinely used in dialysis treatments but are currently separately billable by dialysis facilities. The MMA, title VI, section 623, increased the composite rate by 1.6 percent for 2005, restored the composite rate exception for pediatric facilities, and required the Secretary to establish a basic case- mix adjusted prospective payment system for dialysis services. $22 Indirect Medical Education: CMS should continue to pursue legislation to reduce the indirect medical education (IME) adjustment factor to the level supported by CMS's empirical data and initiate further st udies to determine whether different adjustment factors are warranted for different types of teaching hospitals. (A-07-88-00111) CMS agreed with the recommendation. The BBA, as amended by the BBRA, reduced the IME adjustment to 5.5 percent in 2002 and thereafter. OIG believes that the factor should be further reduced to eliminate overlap with the disproportionate share adjustment. To Be Determined (TBD) Inpatient Psychiatric Care Limits: CMS should develop new limits to deal with the high cost and changing utilization patterns of inpatient psychiatric services and apply a 60-day annual and a 190-day lifetime limit to all psychiatric care regardless of the place of service. (A-06-86-62045) CMS initially agreed with OIG's findings but stated that further analysis would be required before any legislative changes could be supported. TBD Appendix B 57 OIG Recommendation Status Savings (millions) Hospital Capital Costs: CMS should determine the extent to which capital reductions are needed to fully account for hospitals' excess bed capacity and report the percentage to Congress. (A-09-91-00070, A-14-93-00380) CMS did not agree with the recommendation. Although the BBA reduced capital payments, it lacked certain measures concerning excess bed capacity and other elements in the base- year historical costs. The President's FY 2001 budget proposed reducing capital payments and savings $630 million from FY 2001 through FY 2005. TBD Connection Between the Calculation of Medicaid Drug Rebates and Drug Reimbursement: CMS should seek legislation to require participating manufacturers to pay Medicaid drug rebates based on average wholesale price (AWP) or study other alternatives to the current program of using average manufacturer price to calculate the rebates. This legislation would have resulted in $1.15 billion in additional rebates for 100 brand-name drugs with the highest total Medicaid reimbursements in calendar years 1994-1996. (A-06-97-00052 ) CMS agreed to pursue a change in the Medicaid drug rebate program similar to that recommended. No changes have yet been made. However, committees in both the Senate and House have proposed language establishing a better connection . The President's FY 2007 Budget proposed to eliminate best price an d revise the rebate percentage, in a budget neutral manner, to help offset the cost. TBD Home Health Agencies: CMS should revise Medicare regulations to require the physician to examine the patient before ordering home health BBA included provisions to restructure home health benefits, CMS still needs to revise Medicare regulations to require that physicians examine Medicare patients before ordering home health services. Subsequent to the BBA, OIG's four-State review found that unallowable services continued to be provided because of inadequate physician involvement. CMS agreed in principle and recognized the need for physician involvement in home health care planning. CMS also provided additional payments for physician care plan oversight and education for physicians and beneficiaries. TBD Payments Returned by Public Providers: CMS should propose legislation to require that Medicaid payments that public providers return to States be declared a refund to be used to offset or credit the Federal financial participation that the original payment generated. (A-03-00-00216) In April 2004, CMS testified before the House Energy and Commerce Committee and indicated that it supported declaring returned funds as credits or refunds to offset the original State payment. The Federal share would then be calculated based on the net Medicaid payment that the provider retained. The President's FY 2007 Budget proposes an administrative change that builds on past CMS efforts to curb questionable financing practices by (1) recovering Federal funds diverted from Government providers and retained by the State and (2) capping payments to Government providers to no more than the cost of furnishing services to Medicaid beneficiaries. TBD Appendix B 58 OIG Recommendation Status Savings (millions) Definitive Guidance on Calculating Upper Payment Limits and Use of Facility-Specific Limits Based on Actual Costs: CMS should provide States with definitive guidance on calculating UPLs so that a uniform standard is applied to all States. This guidance could be provided through a letter to the Medicaid Directors. States should use facility-specific UPLs that are based on actual cost report data. (A-03-00-00216) CMS partially concurred with OIG's recommendations. CMS agreed that it should provide more guidance on calculating the UPL. The President's FY 2007 budget contains a proposal to limit payments to Government providers to no more than the cost of providing services. TBD Excessive Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments: CMS should ensure that the monetary recommendations made to individual States regarding Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments that exceeded the hospital-specific limits have been resolved. CMS should also establish regulations requiring States to (1) implement procedures to ensure that future DSH payments are adjusted to actual incurred costs, (2) incorporate the procedures into their approved State plans, and (3) include only allowable costs as uncompensated care costs in their DSH calculations. CMS should also strengthen its review and approval of State plans to ensure consistency with Federal requirements and use the results of MMA-required audits as part of its review process. (Various audit reports) CMS has begun taking action in individual States to recover overpayments. On March 26, 2004, CMS published a notice in the Federal Register on the Medicaid DSH program. TBD Compliance With Requirements for Medicaid School-Based Health Services: CMS should recover the overpayments identified during OIG's individual Stat e audits of school-based health claims. In addition, States should disseminate CMS guidance and other information to local education agencies in a timely manner, monitor local education agencies to ensure compliance with Federal and State requirements, and assist local education agencies in developing written policies and procedures that require service providers to document all health services and to retain those records for review. (Various audit reports) CMS has begun taking action in individual States to recover overpayments. CMS has recently undertaken a significant effort to bring State plans into compliance with Federal law, regulations, and policy in the coverage areas that pertain to Medicaid services delivered in school settings . The President's FY 2007 Budget proposes to prohibit Federal Medicaid reimbursement for school-based administrative or transportation costs. TBD Eliminate or Reduce Transition Periods for Compliance With Revised Medicaid Upper Payment Limits: CMS should seek authority to eliminate or reduce the 8-year transition period included in the revised UPL regulation. (A-03-00-00216) CMS did not concur with OIG's recommendation. According to CMS, the transition periods were established pursuant to either notice-and-comment rulemaking or legislation, and offering new proposals at this time would undermine the consensus reached through those processes. CMS anticipates no further action on OIG's recommendation. Five States remain with transition periods through September 1, 2008. TBD 59 Appendix C: Unimplemented Of fice of Inspector General Program and Management Im provement Recommendations This schedule represents OI G findings and recommendations that, if implemented, would result in substantial benefits. The benefits relate primarily to effectiveness, rather than cost efficiency. More detailed information can be found in OIG's Orange Book . (See http://oig.hhs.gov .) OIG Recommendation Status Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Accountability Over Billing and Collection of Medicaid Drug Rebates: The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) should ensure that States implement accounting and internal control systems in accordance with Federal regulations for the Medicaid drug rebate program. Such systems must provide for accurate, current, and complete disclosure of drug rebate transactions and provide CMS with the financial information it needs to effectively monitor and manage the Medicaid drug rebate program. (A-06-92-00029, A-06-03-00048) CMS concurred with the recommendation and set up a reporting mechanism to capture rebate information. The agency still needs to ensure that States establish adequate accounting and internal control systems to obtain reliable information. Current audit results have shown that this remains a problem in most States. Fairly Presenting the Medicare Accounts Receivable Balance: CMS should require Medicare contractors to implement or improve internal controls and systems to ensure that reported accounts receivable are valid and documented. (A-17-95-00096, A-17-97-00097, A-17-98-00098, A-17-00-00500, A-17-00-02001, A-17-01-02001, A-17-02-02002, A-17-03-03003) CMS hired consultants to assist in validating accounts receivable reported by Medicare contractors and provided comprehensive instructions to contractors. For the long term, CMS is developing an integrated general ledger system as the cornerstone of its financial management controls. Guidance to Drug Manufacturers To Better Implement the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program: CMS should survey manufacturers to identify the various calculation methods used to determine average manufacturer price (AMP). In addition, CMS should develop a more specific policy for calculating this price that would both protect the interests of the Government and be equitable to the manufacturers. (A-06-91-00092) CMS did not concur, stating that the drug law and the rebate agreements already established a methodology for computing the AMP. OIG disagrees because the rebate law and agreements defined the AMP but did not provide specific written methodology for computing it. Appendix C 60 OIG Recommendation Status Accuracy of Carrier Payment Date: CMS should conduct a review of carriers' claims processing data to examine the scheduled date of payment entered on claims sent to the Common Working File (CWF). If there is no correlation between the claims payment date variable and the actual date of payment, CMS should define what data should be entered into this field and how the data should be calculated, and/or revise the current variable definition to clarify for National Claims History data users that the scheduled date of payment is not an accurate reflection of the actual claim payment date. CMS should also review the carriers' claims processing data to determine the accuracy of the information contained in the Contractor Reporting of Operational and Workload Data system. (OEI-03-00-00350) CMS stated that a review is under way to compare data contained in the National Claims History File with data at the carrier level. CMS has also approved two new edits, which will enforce the payment floor standards on claims sent to the CWF. Resident Assessment Instruments: CMS should more clearly define minimum data set (MDS) elements and work with States to train nursing home staff. OIG recommended that CMS establish an audit trail to validate the 108 MDS elements that impact facility reimbursement by Medicare. (OEI-02-99-00040, OEI-02-99-00041) CMS generally concurred with OIG's recommendations for improved data definitions and training, but did not concur with the recommendation to establish an audit trail. In 1998, CMS devoted significant resources to the development of an accuracy improvement program by letting a contract to develop MDS accuracy review protocols. Once the protocols were developed, CMS funded a program safeguard contractor in September 2001, known as the data assessment and verification system (DAVE), to audit and verify MDS data. In January 2004, CMS developed and implemented the DAVE project onsite and offsite audit process of the MDS in long term care facilities to assess the accuracy and reliability of assessment data submitted. Assessments of Mental Illness: CMS should work with States to improve the assessment of persons with serious mental illness and use survey and certification to monitor compliance. OIG also recommended that CMS define specialized services that are to be provided by the State to nursing home residents with mental illness. (OEI-05-99-00700) CMS concurred with most of OIG's recommendations and has made revisions to its training curriculum for nursing home surveyors. In addition, CMS offered several national satellite broadcasts in 2001 and 2004 to increase surveyor knowledge and ability to recognize mental illness, to educate surveyors on Pre-Admission Screening and Resident Review (PASRR) implementation and oversight, and to improve surveyors' abilities to de termine facility compliance with assessment and care requirements. CMS has also held several training conferences for Resident Assessment Instrument coordinators to improve the identification of mental illness symptoms in patients in nursing facilities. CMS is also exploring the role State surveyors may have in identifying compliance with PASRR Level II assessment requirements. Appendix C 61 OIG Recommendation Status Nursing Home Residents With Serious Mental Illness: CMS should improve the quality and usefulness of its data sources by requiring the use of a unique provider number across systems, requiring reporting of resident data by age and diagnosis, and encouraging States to use these data in demonstrating their progress in placing disabled persons in the most integrated settings. OIG also recommended training to improve data collection and accurate coding. (OEI-05-99-00701) CMS concurred with most of OIG's recommendations, except for reporting the MDS records by primary, secondary, and tertiary diagnoses. In February 2005, CMS issued a letter to State Medicaid directors indicating that it will begin to release MDS data to States with Americans with Disabilities Act compliance activities. CMS will also require States to evaluate the PASRR outcomes, further obligating States to develop accurate data systems useful for identifying serious mental illness in nursing facility residents. In addition, CMS is planning to implement the use of a unique provider number on or before May 2007. Payments for Mental Health Services: CMS should promote provider awareness of documentation and medical necessity requirements, develop a comprehensive list of psychological testing tools that can be correctly billed, target problematic services for prepayment edits or postpayment medical review, and encourage carriers to take advantage of the MDS, especially for its assessment of patient cognitive level. (OEI-03-99-00130, OEI-02-99-00140) CMS generally concurred with OIG's recommendations. It plans to explore a variety of educational efforts and will refer the reports to the carrier clinical workgroup on psychiatric services. Carriers will conduct data analysis of psychological testing and psychotherapy claims and will conduct medical reviews, if indicated. CMS provided training for providers concerning Medicare payments for Part B mental health services via Medlearn in April 2003. Organ Donation: CMS should revise the Medicare conditions for coverage for organ procurement organizations (OPOs) to make them more accountable for implementing the new donation rule and require OPOs to provide hospital-specific data on referrals and on organ recovery. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) should require that OPOs submit hospital-specific data on referrals and on organ recovery and support demonstration projects on how to effectively train and make use of designated requestors. (OEI-01-99-00020) CMS concurred with the recommendations and indicated that it will explore ways in which additional data can be used to assess OPO effectiveness and hospital compliance with the donation rule. CMS published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on February 4, 2005, establishing new conditions of coverage regarding OPOs. That proposed regulation requires OPOs to report hospital-specific organ donation, including organ donor potential and the number of actual donors, at least annually to the public. HRSA, through its contract for operation of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, requires OPOs to submit hospital-specific data on organ recovery. Outpatient Surgery Rates: CMS should (1) seek authority to set rates that are consistent across sites and reflect only the costs necessary for the efficient delivery of health services and (2) remove the procedure codes that meet its criteria for removal from the Ambulatory Surgery Center list of covered procedures. (OEI-05-00-00340) Section 626 of Public Law 108-173 mandates that the Government Accountability Office conduct a study that compares the relative costs of procedures furnished in ambulatory surgical centers with the relative costs of procedures furnished in hospital outpatient departments. The report w ill include recommendations that advise CMS regarding payments to ambulatory surgical centers and CMS will implement a new payment system for ambulatory surgical centers beginning on or after January 1, 2006, and not later than January 1, 2008. CMS issued a proposed rule on November 26, 2004, to update the list continued\u2014 Appendix C 62 OIG Recommendation Status Outpatient Surgery Rates (continued): of Medicare-approved ambulatory surgical centers procedures in 2005. CMS proposed to remove from the ambulatory surgical centers list a number of the codes recommended for deletion by OIG. Nearly 500 comments were submitted timely and CMS is reviewing those comments and preparing a final rule for implementation. Medicare-Approved Heart Transplant Centers: CMS should develop standards for continuing approved centers as well as guidelines for what levels of performance trigger specific responses from CMS. In the short term, OIG also recommends that CMS improve its oversight of centers by entering into an arrangement with HRSA for the regular exchange of volume and survival rate data. (OEI-01-02-00520) On February 4, 2005, CMS published proposed rule (70 FR 6140), \"Hospital Conditions of Participation: Requirements for Approval and Reapproval of Transplant Centers to Perform Organ Transplant.\" The notice of proposed rulemaking established the requirements for approval and reapproval of transplant centers to perform organ transplants. The approval requirements include data submission, outcome measures, and process requirements. CMS expects to publish the final rule within 18 months. HRSA has partnered with CMS in developing outcome measures for the proposed rule and will continue to act as a liaison between CMS and the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients to provide assistance to review data on transplant center(s) performance. Quality Improvement Processes in Dialysis Facilities: CMS should revise the Conditions of Coverage, examine ways to foster the commitment of attending physicians to performance measures, develop more effective intervention stra tegies for facilities, and work with the corporations to share experiences and minimize reporting burdens on dialysis facilities. (OEI-01-99-00052) CMS concurred with most of OIG's recommendations. The Conditions of Coverage proposed rule was published in February 2005. The proposed conditions would require a facility-level data driven Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement program (QAPI), an increased participation of attending physicians in patient care and in supporting the facility QAPI program, increased medical director role, and electronic clinical measure reporting. End-Stage Renal Disease Data Management: CMS should develop a strategic plan for addressing End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) data management, including creating short- and long-term remedies for current data problems, reassessing the data needs of users, improving the efficiency of data distribution, improving ongoing communication with users and data contributors, and coordinating better with the Social Security Administration. (OEI-07-01-00250) CMS concurred with OIG's recommendations. As of February 15, 2005, CMS, the ESRD networks, its contractors, and the renal community worked together to consolidate its three ESRD systems, known as the Consolidated Renal Operations in a Web-enabled Network (CROWN). The three systems include the Renal Management Information System (REMIS), the Standard Information Management System (SIMS), and the Vital Information System to Improve Outcomes in Nephrology. SIMS went into production on January 1, 2000, and REMIS went into production on July 13, 2003. The REMIS application directly addresses concerns raised by OIG. The CROWN is the automated system that combines all of CMS's electronic data on ESRD benefits and utilization; it provides for the collection, validation, and storage of information about the national ESRD program, its beneficiaries, and the services provided to them. Appendix C 63 OIG Recommendation Status Accuracy of Nursing Home Compare: CMS should require State agencies to verify that the most recent inspection results are in CMS databases and establish a single point of contact for reporting discrepancies on the Web site. (OEI-01-03-00130) CMS agreed with the first recommendation. CMS will consider adding regional office contact information to the Nursing Home Compare to facilitate corrections to the Web site. CMS is currently working with the Web site designers and the regional offices to develop the most efficient means of providing CMS oversight over State survey agency data entry. Variation in State Medicaid Drug Prices: CMS should share more accurate drug pricing information with States, conduct further research on the factors that affect States' drug prices, and annually review States' reimbursement data to target technical assistance to higher paying States. (OEI-05-02-00681) CMS plans to follow up with States that paid higher relative drug prices, particularly States with prices above the UPL. CMS Oversight of Cost-Avoidance Waivers: CMS should approve only waivers that meet the criteria for cost-effectivene ss as set forth by Federal regulations, strengthen oversight activities through improved document retention, and collect information from States regarding recovery rates from pay-and-chase activities. Cost avoidance involves returning claims to providers so that the providers can bill the liable third parties. (OEI-03-00-00031) CMS concurred with OIG's recommendation that it approve only cost-effective waivers. CMS continues to address the oversight of and/or need for cost-avoidance waivers. CMS central and regional offices continue to work closely with States to identify circumstances for which cost-avoidance waivers are not necessary (i.e., Medicaid services not covered by third parties or benefits not directly available to the provider). CMS has also worked with States to diminish the need for waivers by frequently encouraging States to eliminate paying and chasing of claims and relying instead on cost-avoidance. CMS has made substantial progress on Medicaid pharmacy claims. In August 2001, OIG reported that only 17 States were cost-avoiding (in part or whole) pharmacy claims. A recent CMS survey indicated that 40 States currently meet that description and an additional 4 States are planning systems conversions. CMS plans to follow up with remaining States to consider what further assistance should be offered. Where waivers continue to be necessary, CMS will continue to emphasize cost-effectiveness and proper document retention. Uninsured Children Through State Children's Health Insurance Programs: CMS should resolve the inconsistency between the requirement that States report on changes in the number of uninsured children and the practice of accepting enrollment data as a proxy, and ensure the integrity, validity, and usefulness of the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) Annual Report and SCHIP enrollment data. (OEI-05-03-00280) CMS concurred with several of OIG's specific recommendations and has already implemented steps to improve the integrity of the State Annual Report submissions. In addition, CMS has taken steps to enhance technical assistance (TA) to States to improve their measurement capabilities and has held a TA session at the National Academy for State Health Policy's annual conference in August 2004. CMS is currently reviewing all State reports on progress towards covering the uninsured and providing State- specific TA to the States not measuring progress. Appendix C 64 OIG Recommendation Status Public Health Agencies Oversight of Tissue Banking: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) should expedite publication of its regulatory agenda requiring registration of tissue banks, enhanced donor suitability screening, and testing the use of good tissue practices. FDA shou ld set a realistic yet aggressive date by which it would complete an initial inspection of all tissue banks. It should determine the appropriate minimum cycle for tissue bank inspections and work with States and professional associations to determine in what areas oversight activities could be coordinated. (OEI-01-00-00441) The Deputy Secretary concurred that FDA should expedite its planned rulemaking activities related to tissues, specifically the final rule to require registration of tissue banks. The Department also found \"considerable merit\" in OIG's recommendation for an intensified inspection program directed toward entities that procure, process, and store human tissues. In congressional testimony, FDA said that all three of the proposed rules have been published and one rule (Establishment Registration and Listing) was finalized. FDA contacted all 36 uninspected tissue banks. The results were: 31 inspections were completed, 3 firms were out of business, 1 firm could not be located, and 1 firm was not an FDA obligation because it handled only vascularized organs. In 2004, FDA finalized donor eligibility and good tiss ue practices regulations, which became effective on May 25, 2005. This completes the rulemaking activities related to human tissues. Effectiveness of FD A's Adverse Event Reporting System for Dietary Supplements: FDA should: (1) facilitate greater detection of adverse events by requiring dietary supplement manufacturers to report serious events to FDA, (2) obtain more information on adverse event reports by requiring manufacturers to register themselves and their products with FDA, (3) notify manufacturers when FDA receives a serious adverse event report and develop a new computer database to track and analyze adverse event reports, (4) expedite the development and implementation of good manufacturing practices for dietary supplement manufacturers, and (5) disclose more useful information to the public about dietary supplement adverse events. (OEI-01-00-00180) In response, the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) developed a single system for entering adverse events and product quality complaints reports involving foods, cosmetics, and dietary supplements: the CFSAN Adverse Event Reporting System (CAERS). CAERS became partially operational in June 2003. The new system incorporates all existing adverse event reporting systems into one state-of-the-art reporting and monitoring system. FDA routinely notifies manufacturers regarding adverse events associated with the use of their products. A proposed final rule for good manufacturing practices for dietary supplements was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on October 25, 2005. In response to the food facility registration in the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness Act of 2002, FDA requires facilities that manufacture, process, pack, or hold dietary supplements to be registered with the FDA. FDA informs the public of developments through its dietary supplements Web site. Protection for Research Subjects in Foreign Clinical Trials: FDA should examine ways to obtain more information about the performance of non-U.S. OHRP concurred with OIG's recommendations and a variety of national, regional, and international organizations with a goal of establishing effective continued\u2014 Appendix C 65 OIG Recommendation Status Protection for Research Subjects in Foreign Clinical Trials (continued): Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) and help inexperienced IRBs build their capacities, encourage all non-U.S. investigators participating in research to sign attestations upholding human subject protections, and develop a database to track the growth and location of foreign research. The Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) should exert leadership in developing strategies to ensure adequate human subject protections for non-U.S. clinical trials funded by the Federal Government and those that contribute data to new drug applications. (OEI-01-00-00190) education and review processes around the world. In 2004, OHRP sponsored capacity-building workshops for IRB members, gave presentations at international conferences, and began translating key guidance documents into foreign languages. FDA published a proposed rule in 2004, \"Human Subject Protection: Foreign Clinical Studies Not Conducted Under an Investigational New Drug Application\" (21 CFR 312.120), to promote good clinical practice regardless of the location of the clinical trial. FDA also contributed to the HHS/OHRP/National Institutes of Health Working Group for Equivalent Protections in developing a HHS report and Federal Register Notice announcing proposed criteria for clinical trials conducted outside of the United States. In addition, FDA has assisted other countries with capacity-building activities, including Singapore and Australia, for international good clinical practices (GCP) inspectorates. An ongoing FDA initiative to develop better communication with the European Medicines Agency will improve coordination between the respective European and FDA programs involving clinical trials. FDA has also provided staff as faculty to professional associations for outreach training programs, as well as creating a GCP Web site for current information about FDA clinical trial requirements. Administration for Children and Families Children's Use of Health Care Services While in Foster Care: OIG conducted a series of inspections examining the access of foster care children in several States to Medicaid health care servic es. OIG found that access varied in each state and generally recommended that CMS and the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) work with the States to increase access to health care services for eligible foster care children and educate foster parents on available services. (OEI-02-00-00360, OEI-02-00-00363, OEI-07-00-00640, OEI-07-00-00642, OEI-07-00-00643) CMS and ACF generally concurred with the recommendations and in many cases are actively working with the State and local entities to improve access, clarify obligations, and educate all the parties involved regarding Medicaid health care services. Appendix C 66 OIG Recommendation Status General Oversight Cost Principles for Federally Sponsored Research Activities: The Department should modernize and strengthen cost principles applicable to hospitals by either revising existing guidelines to conform with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-21 or working with OMB to extend Circular A-21 coverage to all hospitals. (A-01-92-01528) The Department circulated several draft iterations of the hospital cost principles to internal users for comment. Many of the policies in the outdated document have been updated in a draft regulation. As of March 2006, the draft regulation had not been issued. 67 Appendix D: Notes to Tables 1 and 2 Notes to Tables 1 1The opening balance was adjusted upward $ 82.4 million 2During the period, revisions to previously reported management decisions included: Central Identification Number (CIN): A-02-9 1-01006 BLUE SHIELD OF WESTERN NY-Final settlement of an audit resulted in a decrease in the original concurrence amount of $1.5 million.

A selection of othe r authorities appears below: Program Exclusions Section 1128 of the Social S ecurity Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a -7) provides several grounds for excluding individuals and entities from pa rticipation in Medicare , Medicaid, and other Federal health care programs. Exclusions are required for individuals and entities convicted of the following types of criminal offenses: (1) Medicare or Medicaid fraud; (2) patient abuse or neglect; (3) felonies for other health care fraud; and (4) felonies for illegal manufacture, distribution, prescription, or dispensing of controlled substances. OIG has the discretion to exclude indivi duals and entities on se veral other grounds, including misdemeanors for other health care fraud (other than Medicare or Medicaid) or for illegal manufacture, distribut ion, prescription, or dispen sing of controlled substances; suspension or revocation of a license to pr ovide health care for reasons bearing on professional competence, professional performance, or fina ncial integrity; provision of unnecessary or substandard servi ces; submission of false or fraudulent claims to a Federal health care program; or engaging in unlawful kickback arrangements. Providers subject to exclusion are granted due process rights (incl uding a hearing before an HHS administrative law judge and appeal s to the HHS Departmental Appeals Board and Federal district and appe llate courts) regarding whether the basis for the exclusion exists and the length of the exclusion is reasonable. Patient Dumping Section 1867 of the Social Security Act ( 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395dd) provides that when an individual presents to the emergency room of a Medicare-partic ipating hospital, the hospital must provide an appropriate medi cal screening examination to determine whether that individual has an emergency me dical condition. If an individual has such a condition, the hospital must provide either tr eatment to stabilize the condition or an appropriate transfer to another medical facility. If a transfer is ordered, th e transferring hospital must provide stabilizing treatment to minimize the risks of transfer and must ensure that the receiving hospital agrees to the transfer and has available space and qualified pe rsonnel to treat the individual. In addition, the transferring hospital must eff ect the transfer thro ugh qualified personnel and transportation equipment. Further, a participating hospital with specialized capabilities or facilities may not refuse to accept an appropria te transfer of an individual who needs services if the hospital has the capacity to treat the individual. OIG is authorized to colle ct civil monetary penaltie s of up to $25,000 against small hospitals (less than 100 beds) and up to $50,000 against larger hospitals (100 beds or more) for each instance in which the hospital ne gligently violated any of the section 1867 requirements. In addition, OIG may collect a penalty of up to $50,000 from a responsible Appendix F 80 physician for each negligent violation of any of the section 1867 requirements and, in some circumstances, may excl ude a responsible physician. Civil Monetary Penalties Law Under the Civil Monetary Penalties Law (CMP L), section 1128A of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7a), a person is subjec t to penalties, assessments, and exclusion from participation in Federal health care progr ams for engaging in cert ain activities. For example, a person who submits to a Federal health care program a claim for items and services that the person knows or should know is false or fraudulent is subject to a penalty of up to $10,000 for each item or service falsely or fraudulently claimed, an assessment of up to three times the amount falsely or fraudulently claimed, and exclusion. For the purposes of the CMPL , \"should know\" is defined to mean that the person acted in reckless disregard or deliberate ignorance of the truth or fals ity of the claim. The CMPL also authorizes actions for a variety of other violations, including submission of claims for items or services furnished by an exclude d person; requests for payment in violation of an assignment agreement; violations of rules regarding the possession, use, and transfer of biological agents and toxins; and payment or receipt of remuneration in violation of the anti-kickback st atute (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7b(b)). Anti-Kickback Statute and Civil False Claims Act Enforcement Authorities The Anti-Kickback Statute- The anti-kickback statute au thorizes penalties against anyone who knowingly and willfully solicits, re ceives, offers, or pays remuneration, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for (1 ) referring an individual to a person or entity for the furnishing, or arranging for the furnishi ng, of any item or service payable under the Federal health care programs; or (2) purch asing, leasing or orderi ng, or arranging for or recommending the purchasing, leasing or ordering of any good, facility, service, or item payable under the Federa l health care programs (Sec tion 1128B(b) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7b). Individuals and entities that engage in unl awful referral or kickback schemes may be subject to criminal penalties under the gene ral criminal anti-kic kback statute, civil monetary penalties under OIG's CMPL aut hority (Section 1128A(a)(7) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7a), and/or program exclusion under OIG's permissive exclusion authority (Section 1128(b)(7) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a- 7(b)(7)). False Claims Act- Under the ms Act (FCA) (31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3729- 3733), a person or entity is liable for up to treble damages and a penalty between $5,500 and $11,000 for each false claim it knowingly submits or causes to be submitted to a Federal program. Similarly, a person or ent ity is liable under the FCA if it knowingly makes or uses, or causes to be made or used, a false record or statement to have a false claim paid. Appendix F 81 The FCA defines \"knowing\" to include not only the traditional definition, but also instances in which the person acted in deliber ate ignorance of the truth or falsity of the information or in reckless disr egard of the truth or falsity of the information. Under the FCA, no specific intent to defraud is required. Furt her, the FCA contains a qui tam or whistleblower provision that allows a privat e individual to file su it on behalf of the United States and entitles that whistleblower to a percentage of any fraud recoveries.
