However, maternal antibodies can interfere with infant vaccine responses. We inves- tigated the effect of and heterologous antibody responses to routine immunisations given in the rst year of life. Methods: In total, 471 healthy infants were included. At 7 and 13 months of age, antibodies to the primary course of routine vaccines given at 6 weeks, 4 and 6 months of age (pertussis (pertussis toxin (PT), lamentous haemagglutinin (FHA), pertactin (PRN)), polio (type 1, 2, 3), Haemophilus in fluenzae type b (Hib), pneumococcus (serotype 1, 18C, 19A, 19F, 23F)) were and at 13 months of age, antibodies tothe 12-month routine vaccines (Hib, meningococcus C, measles, mumps and rubella). The seroprotection rates for each vaccine and the geometric mean concentrations (GMC) of antibodies were compared between infantswhose mothers did or did not receive dTpa or TIV immunisation during pregnancy. Results: A total of 369 infants were included in the nal analysis. Maternal dTpa immunisation was associated with reduced antibody responses to both speci c (diphtheria and pertussis) and heterologous (polio and pneu- mococcus) vaccine antigens. This effect was stronger for persistence of antibodies at 13 months of age than it wasat 7 months of age. At 7 months of age, adjusted average antibody concentrations were signi cantly lower for diphtheria, pertussis (PT, FHA, PRN) and polio type 2, and at 13 months of age, for diphtheria, pertussis (PT, FHA, PRN), polio type 1 -3 and pneumococcal serotypes 1, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 18C and 23F. Additionally, at 13 months of age, seroprotection rates for diphtheria, PT, pneumococcal serotype 1, 6A and 6B were signi cantly lower in infants after maternal dTpa immunisation. In contrast, for Hib, in infants with maternal dTpaimmunisation, the adjusted average antibody concentration and the seroprotection rate were higher, particularlyat 7 months of age. Maternal TIV immunisation had minimal effect on infant vaccine responses. Conclusion: Whilst maternal immunisation protects infants in the rst few months of life, it might interfere with both speci c and heterologous (unrelated) vaccines responses in infants. Research in context: Evidence before this study: Maternal immunisation during pregnancy helps to protect infants during the period before they complete their primary immunisations. It has been proven to be safe and bene cial. However, pre-existing maternal antibodies can in fluence antibody responses following infant immunisation, an effect called 'blunting '. Previous studies have investigated the in fluence of dTpa but not in fluenza immunisation during pregnancy on infant vaccine responses.

As most vaccines induce very high antibody responses, small differences in antibody concentrations may not be of clinicalsignicance. However, since maternal immunisation during pregnancy also in fluences seroprotection rates, strat- egies, such as additional booster doses in the second year of life, particularly for pertussis and pneumococcus, might need to be considered to address this. \u00a9 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction Immunisation during pregnancy aims to protect infants during the period before they complete their primary immunisations. Antenatal immunisation against tetanus has been recommended in certain set- tings for decades and is estimated to have reduced the burden of neona- tal tetanus by 96% [1]. Recently, many countries have reported a steep rise in pertussis cases, with high rates of disease in infants youngerthan 2 months of age, who are too young to have been vaccinated. This age group has the highest rates of pertussis-related hospitalisations and deaths. For this reason, maternal pertussis immunisation has been recommended in many countries since 2012 [2,3] . Similarly, because of the increased risk of severe in fluenza in pregnant women, as well as adverse outcomes for infants, in fluenza immunisation is also rou- tinely recommended during pregnancy [4]. The transfer of maternal immunoglobulin G (IgG) to the foetus is an active process but not all IgG antibodies are transported to the same ex-t e n t .T h i si sr e flected by the fact that, towards the end of pregnancy, IgG antibody concentrations against polysaccharide antigens are similar inthe foetus and mother, whereas those against proteins are higher in the foetus [5]. Of the multiple factors that in fluence the transfer of IgG across the placenta, maternal antibody concentration is an importantone. Infants whose mothers receive diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis (dTpa) immunisation during pregnancy have higher antibody concentrations to these antigens at birth compared to those whose mothers do not receive the vaccine [6-12]. Following birth, maternal antibodies in infants wane with a half-life of approximately four to sixweeks [13]. Higher antibody concentrations at birth are associated with a longer duration of protection [14]. Despite the bene ts of maternal immunisation, there are also poten- tial disadvantages. Pre-existing maternal antibodies in fluence antibody responses following infant immunisation, an effect called 'blunting '.A recent meta-analysis showed that for immunisation with inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), a two-fold higher maternal antibody concentration is associated with up to 28% lower post-immunisation antibodies in in- fants [13]. For acellular pertussis, tetanus and diphtheria, these esti- mates are 11%, 13% and 24%, respectively [13]. Apart from the type of vaccine, blunting of infant antibody production is also in fluenced by the age of infants at immunisation, the effect being stronger in youngerinfants [13]. Nevertheless, for acellular pertussis, diphtheria and IPV, the influence of maternal antibodies has been reported to be still evident after booster immunisation at 12 to 24 months of age [13]. Whilst a large number of studies have investigated the association between maternal antibody concentrations and infant antibody produc- tion [13], the effect of maternal immunisation on infant vaccine re- sponses has been less extensively investigated [6-10,15 -17].P r e v i o u s studies have investigated the in fluence of dTpa but not in fluenza im munisation during pregnancy [6-10]. The results of these studies show that antibody concentrations against diphtheria, tetanus and per- tussis, as well as against hepatitis B (HepB), polio and Hib, are higher at birth in infants whose mothers received dTpa during pregnancy [6-10].Notably, the majority of studies investigated antibody concentrations only to the speci c vaccine antigens included in the maternal immunisation, and there is scarce data available on heterologous vac-cine responses, particularly pneumococcal responses. In this study, we investigated the effect of dTpa and in fluenza immunisation during pregnancy on speci c and heterologous antibody responses to routine infant immunisations given in the rst year of life. 2. Methods 2.1. Study Design and Population Participants were a subset of infants from the Melbourne Infant Study: BCG for Allergy and Infection Reduction (MIS BAIR). This randomised controlled trial comprises 1272 healthy infants whose mothers were recruited antenatally from 2013 to 2016 to investigate whether Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) immunisation at birth protects against childhood infection, allergy and asthma. Inclusion criteria were: N32 week gestation, birth weight N1500 g and absence of symptoms or signs of illness. Three-monthly parent questionnaires were used to pro-spectively collect demographic and other data. From participants whose parent/guardian provided consent, blood samples were obtained during study visits at 7 and 13 months of age,designed to be 4 weeks after the administration of routine scheduled immunisations. Only participants who had a blood taken between 28 \u00b1 14 days after their 6-month and 12-month routine vaccines, respec- tively, were included in the nal analysis (with the exception of the sub- set of infants who had their blood analysed at 13 months of age forpersistence of antibodies to their primary course of vaccines ending at 6 months). Participants of twins were excluded, because they were not considered as being independent. 2.2. Infant Immunisation All infants received routine immunisations according to the Australian National Immunisation bioCSL )); 6 weeks, 4 and 6 of age: intramuscular combined diphtheria-tetanus-acellularpertussis (DTPa)-HepB-inactivated polio oral rotavirus vaccine (conjugated to tetanus toxin) (Menitorix\u00ae (GlaxoSmithKline )). Approximately half of intradermal BCG-Denmark ( Statens Serum Institute, Copenha- gen) shortly after birth as part of the MIS BAIR. None of the infants re- ceived an in fluenza vaccine. Vaccine records were obtained from the22 P. Zimmermann et al. / EClinicalMedicine 13 (2019) 21 -30National Australian Immunisation register and/or individual immunisation records. 2.3. Maternal Immunisation Maternal immunisation during vaccine (TIV), or neither during pregnancy. 2.4. Blood Collection Blood samples were collected at study visits approximately 4 weeks after the scheduled 6-month routine vaccines ( '7 months ') and the scheduled 12-month routine vaccines ( '13 months ') in tubes containing sodium-heparin (S-monovette\u00ae ( )). Plasma was stored at until analysis.2.5. Antibody Assay Blood samples were analysed at the National Institute for Health and Environment, in Bilthoven, the Netherlands. IgG antibodies against 26 vaccine antigens (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (pertussis toxin (PT), l- amentous haemagglutinin (FHA), pertactin (PRN)), polio (types 1, or in-house reference, controls and blanks were included oneach plate. All analyses were performed with a Bio-Plex 200 in combina- tion with Bio-Plex manager software (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). 2.6. Statistical Analysis The proportion of infants with an antibody concentration above the standard protective correlate value for each vaccine (seroprotection rate) [21,24,25] was calculated in each group of infants, together with 95% con dence intervals (CI) using the Clopper-Pearson method. For pertussis no clear correlate of protections exists. However, an antibody concentration against pertussis toxin of N25 IU/mL is generally consid- ered as protective and was therefore used in this study, althoughthere is no consensus on this. We did not calculate seroprotection rates of FHA and PRN for which no accepted protective correlate value exists. Proportions were compared using Fisher's exact test and 95% CIs for differences in proportions estimated. In each group, the geomet- ric mean concentration (GMC) for each vaccine antibody (immunoglob- ulin G) was calculated. Geometric mean antibody ratios (GMR) with 95% con dence interval (CI) were derived from the anti-logged coef - cient using a linear regression with log-concentrations outcomeand maternal status (dTpa or TIV) as Effect modi cation was assessed using the following pre-speci ed potential Fig. 1.

The GMR for each vaccine antigen was adjusted for those factors that had an effect on the vaccine antigen responses (detailed in each table). As Menitorix in-cludes a tetanus toxoid and Hib component, infants who had received this vaccine before blood sampling at 13 months of age were excluded from the analysis of antibody persistence against these two vaccine an- tigens. A 5%-signi cance level was used. All statistical analyses were done using R version 3.4.3. 2.7. Ethics Informed consent was obtained from participants' parents or guardians. The study was approved by the Royal Children's Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC, authorisation (38124A)). MIS BAIR is registered with the Australia & New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (1051228) and the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NCT01906853). 3. Results Of the 471 potentially eligible participants, seven were excluded be- cause they were a twin of another participant, four because they were not vaccinated according to the vaccine schedule and one because vac- cine records were not available. Of the remaining 459 participants, 368 had blood taken in the prede ned time frame (28 \u00b1 14 days after their 6-month and 12-month vaccines, respectively ( Fig. 1 )). At 7 months of age, 91 (45 with and 46 without maternal dTpa immunisation, 55 with and 36 without maternal TIV immunisation) were included in thenal analysis. At 13 months of age, 311 (146 with and 165 without maternal dTpa immunisation, 175 with and 136 without maternal TIVimmunisation) were included for measurement of persistence of anti- bodies against the primary course of vaccines ending at 6-months and 145 (67 with and 78 without maternal dTpa immunisation, 85 with and 60 without maternal TIV immunisation) for responses to the 12- months vaccines. The number of participants who were included at both time points (n = 33) was too small to allow longitudinal analysis. Baseline characteristics are summarised in Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1. A comparison of the GMCs for each of the vaccine antigens in infants with and without maternal dTpa immunisation is shown in Supplemen-tary Figs. 1 and 2, and in infants with and without maternal TIV immunisations is shown in Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4. 3.1. The effect of Maternal dTpa Immunisation on Antibody Concentrations at 7 Months of Age Adjusted GMRs at 7 months of age were less than one (indicating lower average antibody concentrations in the group with maternal dTpaimmunisation) for all vaccine antigens except tetanus, Hib and pneumo- coccal serotype 3 and 4. These differences reached statistical signi cance for diphtheria, pertussis (PT, FHA and PRN), polio type 2 and Hib. At 7 months of age, the large majority of infants had antibody con- centrations above the standard protective correlate value (theseroprotection rate was above 95% for 16 of the 22 antigens). Low seroprotection rates were observed for Hib and pneumococcal serotype 4(Table 2 andFig. 2 ). At 7 months of age, seroprotection rates were generally lower for in- fants with maternal dTpa immunisation, with the largest difference ob- served for pneumococcal serotype 4 and PT. In contrast, the seroprotection rate was higher for Hib in infants with maternal dTpa immunisation. None of these differences reached statistical signi cance (Table 3 andFig. 3 ).

The Effect of Maternal TIV Immunisation on Antibody Concentrations at 13 Months of Age (to the Primary Course of Vaccines and to the 12-Month Vaccines) There was no consistent effect of maternal TIV immunisation on GMRs or seroprotection rates at 13 months of age (Supplementary Ta-bles 2 and 3). 4. Discussion Maternal immunisation has been proven to be safe and bene cial, and is now widely recommended [11,26 -28]. For pertussis, for example, maternal immunisation leads to higher infant antibody concentrations at birth and during the rst few months of life, which is highly effective in preventing severe pertussis in infants. The vaccine effectivenessagainst hospitalisation is estimated to be 91 -94% and for preventing in- fection or mild disease 69 -90%[29-31].Our study investigated the effect of maternal dTpa immunisation on infant antibody responses to a large number of speci c and heterolo- gous vaccines, including measurement of the persistence of antibodies at 13 months of age. It is the rst study to investigate the in fluence of maternal in fluenza immunisation on heterologous infant vaccine re- sponses. Our results show that antenatal maternal dTpa immunisation strongly in fluences infant antibody responses at both 7 and 13 months of age and is associated with both reduced speci c (diphtheria and per- tussis) and heterologous (polio and pneumococcal) vaccine responses, but higher Hib responses at 7 months of age. In contrast, maternal TIV immunisation during pregnancy has no consistent effect on infant vac- cine responses. Thendings of our study in relation to the primary course of vac- cines are consistent with previous studies. To date, four studies have compared antibody concentrations one month after completion of pri- mary immunisations between infants whose mother did or did not re- ceive dTpa during pregnancy. These report higher GMCs for tetanus [7, 10,32] and Hib [10,32] in infants with maternal dTpa immunisation Fig. 3.

Zimmermann et al. / EClinicalMedicine 13 (2019) 21 -30during pregnancy, but lower GMCs for diphtheria [7,10,16,32] ,p e r t u s s i s (FHA, mbriae (FIM), PRN and PT) [7,10,16] ,H e p B [10] and polio [10]. Two additional studies report higher GMCs for tetanus [8,33] and Hib [33], and lower GMCs diphtheria [8]and pertussis (PRN, PT, FHA, FIM) [8,33] , in infants whose mother received a pertussis-containing vaccine during pregnancy compared with those whose mother received a tetanus-containing vaccine (TCV) only. Ourndings in relation to persistence of antibodies before a booster- dose are also consistent with two studies which found higher GMCs fortetanus [10,16] and Hib [10], and lower GMCs [16],p e r - tussis (FHA, FIM, PRN and PT) [10,16] and polio [10], in infants whose mothers received dTpa during pregnancy. Additionally, one larger study found higher GMCs for tetanus and Hib, and lower GMCs for per- tussis (FHA, FIM, PRN and PT), in infants whose mother received a pertussis-containing vaccine during pregnancy compared with those whose mother received a TCV only [33]. Two previous studies have compared pneumococcal vaccine re- sponses between infants whose mother did and did not receive dTpa during pregnancy. Both reported signi cantly lower GMCs against pneumococcal serotype 1, 3, 6A, 7F, 9V, 14 and 19A and lowerseroprotection rates for serotype 3, 5 and 9V one month after primary immunisation [32,34] . The second study also measured vaccine re- sponses 2.5 months after a booster dose of pneumococcal immunisationat 12 months of age and reported that GMCs remained lower in infants whose mother received a vaccine during pregnancy for serotype 1 and 4, without a difference in seroprotection rates [34]. One proposed mechanism for the inhibition of infant antibody pro- duction after maternal immunisation is that maternal antibodies bind to vaccine epitopes and mask them from infant B lymphocytes, leading to attenuation of responses to these antigens. Hence, the ratio between maternal antibody concentrations and dose of vaccine antigen might in- fluence the degree of inhibition [35,36] . Since the carrier protein CRM197 in PCV13 is a modi ed diphtheria toxin, maternal antibodies against diphtheria might also mitigate responses to pneumococcal con- jugate immunisation, which might explains the lower infant pneumo- coccal vaccine responses. Hib is conjugated to tetanus toxin as a carrier protein and responses to both tetanus and Hib are consistently (although not always signi cantly) higher in infants whose mother re- ceived dTpa during pregnancy. An unexpected nding in our study, which cannot be explained by a carrier protein, is that infants whosemothers received dTpa immunisation during pregnancy also had lower antibody responses to IPV. Previously, it has been suggested that because of the short half-life of maternal antibodies (e.g. pertussis-speci c IgGs are undetectable by the age of 2 months in infants of unvaccinated mothers) [37],m a t e r n a la n - tibody interference of infant antibody production is only relevant dur- ing the rst few months of life. However, in our study the effect of maternal dTpa immunisation during pregnancy (both reduced GMCsand seroprotection rates) was stronger at 13 months of age than at 7 months of age. Furthermore, three studies that compared vaccine re- sponses in infants whose mothers received dTpa during pregnancy afterbo oster immunisations given in the second year of age reported consis- tently (although not statistically signi cant) lower antibody for diphtheria [7,10, [10],H e p B [10] and polio [10]. This suggests that the effect of maternal immunisation during pregnancy persists even after booster doses. In our study, the lowest seroprotection rates were observed for per- tussis (although the protection correlate value is debated) and pneumo- coccus. For pertussis, the main aim is to protect infants during the highest risk period occurring during the rst few months of life and hence, the shift of the disease to a later period, as a result of maternalpertussis immunisation [39], might by an acceptable trade-off. How- ever, the low seroprotection rates against pneumococcus at the age of13 months are a concern, as this is a vulnerable age group for invasive pneumococcal disease.Priming also occurs in infants after maternal vaccination. As most vaccines induce very high antibody responses, small differences in anti- body concentrations may not be of clinical signi cance in terms of pro- tective ef cacy or may only impact the duration of protection. However, seroprotection rates are de ned as correlates of clinical signi cance. Therefore, the differences in seroprotection rates found in our studymight in fluence clinical outcomes. Nevertheless, protection induced by vaccines may not relate only to antibody concentration, but also to the quality of antibodies and cellular and cytokine responses. For exam- ple, for pertussis, there is no clear correlation between antibody concen- tration and protection rates. Nevertheless, countries that implement maternal immunisation might consider adapting their infant immunisation schedule to a later start (starting at 3 months of age with a 2-dose primary schedule results in higher antibody responses than a 3-dose schedule started at 2 months of age) [40]or including ad- ditional booster doses (e.g. pneumococcal vaccine in the second year oflife to ensure protection during the at-risk period up to 5 years of age). Of note, new vaccines which interfere less with maternal antibodies are in development: animal studies show that co-injection of antigen and antigen-speci c IgM increases antibody responses in the presence of in- hibitory IgGs [41]. The strengths of our study include the low variation in background characteristics between groups, the detailed demographic and clinicaldata available from participants allowing for adjustment for potential confounding factors, the homogeneity in the vaccines given and the broad range of antibodies measured. T he limitations of the study include the non-random allocation of maternal immunisations during pregnancy,the fact that maternal vaccines were given at different time points during pregnancy, that not all infants had antibody response measured exactly 4 weeks after immunisation and that not all infants had received their 12-month immunisation by the time blood samples were taken at 13 months, meaning a smaller number of participants available for assess- ment of responses to the 12-month vaccines, and that the number of in- fants included at both time points was too low to allow longitudal analysis. In addition, in the interpretation of our results, the lack of con- sensus on the protective correlate value for PT and the use of multiple sig- nicance testing need to be taken into consideration. In conclusion, whilst maternal immunisation protects infant in the rst few months of life, it might increase the risk of disease in older in- fants as a result of blunting of responses to both related (speci c) and unrelated (heterologous) vaccines. Since the risk of hospitalisationand death is less in older infants, this might be an acceptable trade-off. Strategies, such as additional booster doses in the second year of life, particularly for pertussis and pneumococcus, should be considered to address this.
