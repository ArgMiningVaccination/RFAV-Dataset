It forms when the body breaks down chemical substances called purines. Most uric acid dissolves in the blood, filters through the kidneys, and leaves the body through urine. While some remain in the blood, which is not harmful. However, if uric acid levels go above or below a healthy range, it can result in health problems. E-Uric Acid Drops (AKG-27) by Excel Pharma may be one of the best Homeopathy medicines for the uric acid problem. Uric acid is a byproduct of purine metabolism in the body. Generally, an improper elimination of this waste product out of the body causes hyperuricemia, that is, high uric acid concentration in the blood. Common symptoms of a high uric acid problem are joint stiffness, joint pain, redness and swelling, and difficulty moving the affected joints. In the case of gout, the urate crystals are deposited between the small joints of the body, like the fingers and toes, which eventually lead to inflamed joints and often lead to a deformity in the affected joints. High uric acid levels also cause kidney stones. Studies also show that a high uric acid level in the body may also lead to hypertension. Uric acid treatment in Homeopathy may be an ideal solution to get permanent relief from this condition. E-Uric Acid Drops may work on the increased uric acid problem and simultaneously assure better bone and heart health. Causes of High Uric Acid The high uric acid problem is the result of disturbed protein metabolism and is triggered by one or more of the following: - High consumption of purine-containing foods. - Consuming high protein supplements. - Reduced elimination of uric acid from the body due to a kidney problem. - Weight loss activities may result in an elevated uric acid problem. - Certain medicines can also cause the uric acid level to rise. In a healthy individual, the excess uric acid is eliminated from the body via urine. On the other hand, in a high uric acid patient, the excess uric acid gets deposited in the small joints as rate crystals. It causes pain and inflammation of the joints - a characteristic symptom of gout. How is Uric Acid Treatment in Homeopathy a Better Choice? The conventional treatment often aims at suppressing the production of uric acid in the body, along with cutting the protein consumption for the patient. Oftentimes, this approach is only short-acting. It is seen that as soon as the patient stops taking medicines or starts consuming proteins as normal, the problem comes back again. On the other hand, Uric Acid Treatment In Homeopathy targets and treats the root cause of the disease as well as any underlying problems. As a result, Homeopathy Medicines For Uric Acid are not just effective but safer compared to conventional medicines. E-Uric Acid Drops for Effective Uric Acid Treatment In Homeopathy E-Uric Acid Drops is one of the most effective Homeopathy medicine for uric acid problems in all of the above-mentioned cases.
