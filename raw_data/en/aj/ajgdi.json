Here are a few, drawn from the science of Ayurveda. Gargling Try gargling with warm salt water twice a day. Gargling cleans out bacteria and germs that linger in the nasal passages and throat for 24 to 48 hours before getting into the bloodstream and weakening immunity. Using a neti pot is also a nice option for clearing the sinuses; use it each morning, followed by a few drops of nasya oil. Eating Mindful eating is so important for healthy digestion and strong immunity. To receive the nourishment in your food, you need to chew thoroughly. Slow down and enjoy each meal in a peaceful environment. Try at least one relaxing\u2014and if possible, silent\u2014meal a day, and no eating within two hours of bedtime to ensure proper digestion and a good night's sleep. Sipping Sip hot water throughout the day. This soothes, hydrates, decongests, and helps cleanse the body. Carry a thermos of hot water with you and regularly take sips. In general, drink warm over cold beverages. Anything iced is difficult to digest when immune function is low. Meditating Daily [meditation](http://kripalu.org/blog/thrive/2014/01/30/meditation-resistance-and-the-practice-of-compassion/) reduces stress, settles the nerves, and calms the mind. Silence miraculously boosts our buffer against germs. Whether you prefer sitting or walking meditation, opt for at least 10 minutes per day. Practicing yoga nidra or Savasana for 20 minutes a day, two to three times a week, will further soothe the nervous and endocrine systems. Sleeping Each night before getting into bed, try jotting down things for which you are grateful. Perhaps you're grateful for your yoga practice or peaceful moments in nature. Whatever it is, writing it down each night helps you to focus on the positive, and also quiets the mind and reduces stress\u2014easing you into a good night's sleep, which is essential for boosting immunity. \u00a9 Kripalu Center for Yoga & Health.
