You are then escorted to a comfortable office where any questions or concerns are addressed. Intake counselors make every effort to assist you in making the decision to get alcohol or drug treatment, which is most-likely the right decision. Due to the nature of alcohol and drug treatment, there are many forms to fill out, which is also something the intake counselors assist you with. The time it takes from the receptionist to alcohol and drug detox admission is normally 45 minutes to 1 hour. Medical and Psychological Assessments Once you have made the decision to enter alcohol or drug treatment, a nurse from the detox unit will assess you to see if medical detoxification is required. A psychological assessment may also be ordered. These assessments will ensure that you receive the necessary treatment to recover from addiction. Initial Property Search You will be asked to give consent for a search of you and your belongings, and some items may be removed from your luggage. This is to ensure that the alcohol and drug detox environment remains safe and contraband free. Any item that is not allowed on the unit may be taken home with your loved ones or stored until you discharge from alcohol and drug treatment. All illegal contraband and paraphernalia will be destroyed. Entering Alcohol and Drug Detox - Full Search One of our counselors or technicians will greet you when you enter the alcohol and drug detox unit and inform you of the detox admission procedure. You will then be escorted to your room where you and your property will be searched, and a urine sample will be obtained. While a thorough search is mandatory for the safety of all patients, detox staff members are professional and very respectful of your privacy. Tarzana Treatment Centers offers several options to make this process comfortable for you. We understand that you may feel sick and nervous, so just ask what can be done for you. Any further items confiscated will be returned upon discharge from alcohol and drug treatment and illegal items destroyed. Alcohol and Drug Detox Medication Once you are settled in, a staff physician will assess you and prescribe any medications necessary along with a dosing schedule. Any medications you currently take and conditions that you may be dealing with need to be addressed here. Medical staff will continue to monitor your progress on a daily basis, and address any medical concerns as they may arise. Settle In After you receive your first dose of medication you are free to make yourself at home and get to know other patients. If you have further questions or concerns, you may want to speak to one of our friendly and understanding technicians. Some of our patients just want to lie down, which is understandable as well. This is the biggest decision you've made, probably in your life, so just let us know what you need at this point. Alcohol and Drug Addiction Counseling While in alcohol and drug detox, your physical health is the priority. But Tarzana Treatment Centers knows that more than physical changes occur with you during the detox process, which is where the counseling staff lends a hand. So starting with your first full day of alcohol or drug treatment you will meet your primary counselor for a one to one session. You will also attend 2 group sessions and get a visit from some folks living in recovery each day during detox. Tarzana Treatment Centers does not overwhelm you with groups and sessions at this time. But addressing emotional issues and aftercare planning is critical during the alcohol and drug detox processes. Aftercare Planning Before you discharge from detox, you will have a plan for aftercare whether it is residential or outpatient treatment. Other than your physical well-being, our goal is for you to see yourself as worthy of a better life than you have offered yourself. Counselors can guide you through the decision process, and offer resources to find the best fit for the new you. Miscellaneous Points For the safety of all of our patients, there are several rules to follow. You will be informed of these rules upon admission, but if you want help you probably won't even notice that they exist. Of course, patients are served 3 meals a day, and can take up to 2 trips to the snack store if so desired. Phones are available for patients to make personal calls. Games and activities help fill in free time. Southern California Locations for Alcohol and Drug Treatment Tarzana Treatment Centers has locations all over Southern California in Los Angeles County.
