Itreduces suppliers' costs, enables departments to fulfil commitmentsfaster, and more effectively and gives citizens more responsive andbetter value for money (VFM) public services. Don't blame Brussels The EC Rules are often cited as the cause of delay. Yet the minimumtimes that apply in the EC procedures are largely insignificantcompared with the time departments need before the start ofprocurement and when measured against the whole procurementprocess. Of course it takes time to run a proper procurement but we cansave everybody's time and effort by being absolutely clear in what wewant and by keeping changes to an absolute minimum. Set appropriateevaluation criteria at the beginning and make sure suppliers understandthose criteria and the nature of the requirement so that we only havecredible bidders in the competition. Use of Frameworks If frameworks exist, including frameworks managed by othergovernment departments & OGC, that are accessible across government,which fully meet the department's requirements and deliver VFM, usethem. They have already been competed, so we don't need a secondcompetition. However, we must stay within agreed framework terms &conditions. If these do not fit the requirements, we cannot use theframework. Speeding up your projects Effective and efficient procurement is rooted in professionalism - mostdelays spring from a lack of clarity and are exacerbated by the absenceof the right people with appropriate skills. Senior management sets thetone for fast, successful procurement and correct, well-considered,timely decisions taken upfront are paramount. Make sure your projectteam has suitable experience and the appropriate skills. Not just procurement Procurement can be fundamental to the development of a strategicbusiness change and delivery programme. It is important to payattention to the business-change elements. Having a clear and sharedunderstanding of how the organisation is to work in its new state willhelp ensure that the procurement fully supports the business need andisn't delayed by decisions about the business change. Complexity and risk Wherever possible avoid complexity but if we must run a complexproject, break it down to reduce risks eg by piloting, modulardevelopment or time-boxing (what can be done by a defined point intime). Follow recognised good practice on risk identification, assessmentand management. We should do as much as we can upfront to reduceproject risks. Remember that where the market hasn't done it successfully before, there is always a possibility that it could go wrong . Once a risk is identified, it should be managed. If we are transferring risks to asupplier, make sure we allocate or apportion each risk to the party bestable to manage it.Sound advice Many projects need external advice and when this is necessary select theadvisers with care. Look at their experience and track record. Make surethey are familiar with the government and departmental best practicewe want to use. T ry to incentivise them to facilitate a speedy andeffective procurement and make sure they are under effectivedepartmental control. After all they only advise - we decide! Competence and capacity None of us would want to fly with an inexperienced pilot. Therefore weshould not expect fast, successful projects from inexperienced projectteams. The greater the risks the greater the need for experience andcompetence. The Successful Delivery Skills Framework lets us check whether or not our people have the necessary skills for the task.Inexperienced project teams can be a recipe for failure. If we have to take on more projects than we have competent people to run them, there really are only three options - develop, recruit, or doless. Knowledge of how to run projects is so important that it needs to be developed, extended and nurtured. In too many cases, hard-wonknowledge is being thrown away at the end of the project, when theteam is disbanded. Project teams need to be clear on the decisions they can take and the ones they have to refer upwards. We should not keep them waiting fordecisions. Confidence makes for rapid progress; fear of criticism orfailure will slow things down. Keeping to time Make sure our people know that we expect project teams to set realistictimescales and for the project to come in on time. Expect timelywarning of any unavoidable delays. Remember that suppliers have togear up for procurement projects, so make sure they're kept in thepicture if things start to go wrong Practice makes perfect As far as possible, all procurements should follow a proven path, basedon recognised good practices such as those in the OGC Successful Delivery T oolkit or equivalent departmental standards where there is a successful track record. Remember, we must be prepared to tailor thegeneric timetable to take into account the particular circumstances ofthe project. However, the more repeatable the project processes are, theeasier it is to sustain a cycle of improvement in project timescales andsuccess generally. We should use the findings from the departments'Gateway Reviews and post-project reviews to learn lessons and improveour practices. We must learn from others so that we do not keep makingthe same mistakes. Role of the Procurement Professional It is important that the project receives experienced professionalprocurement and commercial support. Departmental procurementprofessionals can fulfil this role and they should be engaged from thestart of the project and throughout the procurement.Improving the efficiency and effectiveness of procurement to achieve faster deliveryLet us know what you think See the successful delivery toolkit for related sources of best practice, tools and techniques; www.ogc.gov.uk/sdtoolkit Address: Office of Government Copyright This document is printed on paper comprising 75% post-consumer waste and 25% elemental chlorine free pulp.

Have we an effective mechanism for communicating with and involving all key stakeholders? Have we effective mechanisms to manage risks and to resolve potential conflicts? Can we ensure on-going commitment from management at the appropriate level? Will there be continuity among the procurement team throughout the procurement process? Is there an effective change management procedure in place so we can be confident that we can manage any changes that might occur, and ensure that they are aligned to the business strategy? Do we have the necessary access to specialist resources to provide expert advice on legal or technical issues etc? Do our plans provide for the advance preparation of evaluation criteria etc to be done in parallel with the rest of the procurement process? Have we allowed the time for gateway reviews, if appropriate, in our plans? Do we have appropriate resources and procedures for effective supplier management post award? BEST PRACTICE Improving the efficiency and effectiveness of procurement to achieve faster delivery During the procurement process:Throughout theprocurement we need toensure that our processesare aligned for swift,effective and efficientdelivery. If we cannot obtain a satisfactory response to thefollowing questions theprocurement is not attunedto meet the requirementand deadlines may not bemet.Preparation: The people who are mostable to influenceprocurement timescalesare the department'ssenior management withinput from otherstakeholders. If we cannot obtain a satisfactory response tothe following questions,procurements will sufferdelay and disappointment:we would be embarkingon a journey unprepared. Why are we doing this project? What is it required to achieve? What assumptions have been made? What are the business drivers and constraints? What will constitute success? Who are the senior keystakeholders - do they understand and agree? Does the project fit with the business strategy and programmes? Is the business case sound? Have all the whole life cycle costs been assessed, including staff, training, accommodation and our costs in running the competition? Is the requirement affordable? Have weassessed the market to check? Has the necessary budget been secured? What are the risks? Are we biting off more than we can chew? Are we breaking new ground? Is the project too complex? Can it be phased or modularised? What can we do to minimise risks to anacceptable level? Have all dependencies been identified and is there full provision to manage them? Is the Board committed to delivery? Do we have a Senior Responsible Owner who will drive it through? Will the Board support this person, give them consistent advice and direction, and givethem enough time and resources to do the job? Will we provide a competent project team led by anexperienced project manager and give them enough time and support to do an effective job? Have we fully analysed the markets in which the procurement will take place? Can we guarantee a proper competition, which includes all credible bidders, especially in re-competition? Have we identified bidders' likely information needs during bidding, and taken adequate steps to provide the full range of data within the procurement timetable? Have we identified all thenecessary contact points for each of the bidders throughout the procurement? Do we understand the extent of the change to be managed, of which the procurement is a part? Do we plan to engage relevant stakeholders, including technical authorities and customers, and toensure their interests are identified and catered for? Will we invoke best practice for managingsuccessful projects and programmes? Do we have the necessary capability and capacity to own and manage related business changes? Have we developed a realistic project plan? Do we have an effective control system, to ensure the project remains on track, with any changes to the plan, the timetable or the project's risks assessedfor impact and communicated to those who need to know? Have we allowed sufficient time to obtain all necessary consents, permissions, or legislative changes and developed plans to manage possible public or stakeholder opposition? Are our procurement strategies well thought through and finalised? Has the procurement unit been properly consulted? Have we learnt from others and from past mistakes? Is the procurement timetable a generic one, or is it adequately tailored to take into account the particular circumstances of the project?Grant aided Improv Effic 18/6/03 8:33 am Page 2 "}
