Your Employer has agreed to be subject to the terms and conditions of the Administrator's Provider agreements which may include pre-service review and utilization management requirements, coordination of benets, timely ling limits, and other requirements to administer the benets under this Plan.

OF BENEFITS The Schedule of Benets is a summary of the Deductibles, Coinsurance, Copayments, maximums and other limits that apply when you receive Covered Services from a Provider. Please refer to the \"Covered Services\" section of this Benet Booklet for a more complete explanation of the specic services covered by the Plan. All Covered Services are subject to the conditions, exclusions, limitations, terms and provisions of this Benet Booklet including any endorsements, amendments, or riders. This Schedule of Benets lists the Member's responsibility for Covered Services. To receive maximum benets at the lowest Out-Of-Pocket expense, Covered Services must be provided by a Network Provider . Benets for Covered Services are based on the Maximum Allowable Amount, which is the maximum amount the Plan will pay for a given service. When you use a Non-Network Provider you are responsible for any balance due between the Non-Network Provider's charge and the Maximum Allowable Amount in addition to any Coinsurance, Copayments, Deductibles, and non-covered charges. Under certain circumstances, if the Plan pays the Provider amounts that are your responsibility, such as Deductibles, Copayments or Coinsurance, the Plan may collect such amounts directly from you. You agree that the Plan has the right to collect such amounts from you. Copayments/Coinsurance/Maximums are calculated based upon the Maximum Allowable Amount, not the Provider's charge. Essential Health Benets provided under this Plan are not subject to lifetime or annual dollar maximums. Certain non-essential health benets, however, are subject to either a lifetime and/or annual dollar maximum. Essential Health Benets are dened by federal law and refer to benets in at least the following categories: \u008fAmbulatory patient services, \u008fEmergency services, \u008fHospitalization, \u008fMaternity and newborn care, \u008fMental health and substance use disorder services, including behavioral health treatment, \u008fPrescription drugs, \u008fRehabilitative and habilitative services and devices, \u008fLaboratory services, \u008fPreventive and wellness services, and \u008fChronic disease management and pediatric services, including oral and vision care.

To receive maximum benets for Covered Services ,care must be received from a Primary Care Physician (PCP), Specialty Care Physician (SCP) or another Network Provider to be a Covered Service, except for Emergency Care and Urgent Care. Services which are not received from a PCP, SCP or another Network Provider or approved as an Authorized Service will be considered a Non-Network service, except as specied above. The amount payable for Covered Services varies depending on whether you receive your care from a PCP, SCP or another Network Provider or a Non-Network Provider, except for Emergency Care and Urgent Care. If you use a Non-Network Provider, you are responsible for the difference between the Non-Network Provider's charge and the Maximum Allowable Amount, in addition to any applicable Coinsurance, Copayment or Deductible. The Plan cannot prohibit Non-Network Providers from billing you for the difference in the Non-Network Provider's charge and the Maximum Allowable Amount. All Covered Services and benets are subject to the conditions, Exclusions, limitations, terms and provisions of this Benet Booklet, including any attachments, riders and Health Benet BookletM-20 COVERED SERVICES endorsements. Covered Services must be Medically Necessary and not Experimental/Investigative. The fact that a Provider may prescribe, order, recommend or approve a service, treatment or supply does not make it Medically Necessary or a Covered Service and does not guarantee payment. To receive maximum benets for Covered Services, you must follow the terms of the Plan, including receipt of care from a PCP, SCP or another Network Provider, and obtain any required Prior Authorization or Precertication. Contact your Network Provider to be sure that Prior Authorization/Precertication has been obtained. The Administrator bases its' decisions about Prior Authorization, Precertication, Medical Necessity, Experimental/Investigative services and new technology on the Administrator's clinical coverage guidelines and medical policy. The Administrator may also consider published peer-review medical literature, opinions of experts and the recommendations of nationally recognized public and private organizations which review the medical effectiveness of health care services and technology. Benets for Covered Services may be payable subject to an approved treatment plan created under the terms of this Benet Booklet. Benets for Covered Services are based on the Maximum Allowable Amount for such service. The Plan's payment for Covered Services will be limited by any applicable Coinsurance, Copayment, Deductible, or Benet Period Limit/Maximum in this Benet Booklet. Ambulance Services See the Schedule of Benets for any applicable Deductible, Coinsurance, Copayment, and Benet Limitation information. Medically Necessary ambulance services are a Covered Service when: \u008fYou are transported by a state licensed vehicle that is designed, equipped, and used only to transport the sick and injured and staffed by Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT), paramedics, or other certied medical professionals. This includes ground, water, xed wing, and rotary wing air transportation. And one or more of the following criteria are met: \u008fFor ground ambulance, you are taken: \u008eFrom your home, the scene of an accident or medical Emergency to a Hospital; \u008eBetween Hospitals, including when the Administrator requires you to move from a Non-Network Hospital to a Network Hospital; \u008eBetween a Hospital and a Skilled Nursing Facility or other approved Facility. \u008fFor air or water ambulance, you are taken: \u008eFrom the scene of an accident or medical Emergency to a Hospital; \u008eBetween Hospitals, including when the Administrator requires you to move from an Non-Network Hospital to a Network Hospital; \u008eBetween a Hospital and an approved Facility. Ambulance services are subject to Medical Necessity reviews by the Administrator. Emergency ground ambulance services do not require precertication and are allowed regardless of whether the Provider is a Network or Non-Network Provider. Non-Emergency ambulance services are subject to Medical Necessity reviews by the Administrator. When using an air ambulance for non-Emergency transportation, the Administrator reserves the right to Health Benet BookletCOVERED SERVICES M-21 select the air ambulance Provider. If you do not use the air ambulance Provider the Administrator selects, the Non-Network Provider may bill you for any charges that exceed the Plan's Maximum Allowed Amount. You must be taken to the nearest Facility that can give care for your condition. In certain cases the Administrator may approve benets for transportation to a Facility that is not the nearest Facility. Benets also include Medically Necessary treatment of a sickness or injury by medical professionals from an ambulance service, even if you are not taken to a Facility. Ambulance services are not covered when another type of transportation can be used without endangering your health. Ambulance services for your convenience or the convenience of your family or Doctor are not a Covered Service. Other non-covered ambulance services include, but are not limited to, trips to: a)A Doctor's ofce or clinic; b)A morgue Important Notes on Air Ambulance Benets Benets are only available for air ambulance when it is not appropriate to use a ground or water ambulance. For example, if using a ground ambulance would endanger your health and your medical condition requires a more rapid transport to a Facility than the ground ambulance can provide, the Plan will cover the air ambulance. Air ambulance will also be covered if you are in an area that a ground or water ambulance cannot reach. Air ambulance will not be covered if you are taken to a Hospital that is not an acute care Hospital (such as a Skilled Nursing Facility or a rehabilitation facility), or if you are taken to a Physician's ofce or your home. Hospital to Hospital Transport If you are moving from one Hospital to another, air ambulance will only be covered if using a ground ambulance would endanger your health and if the Hospital that rst treats cannot give you the medical services you need. Certain specialized services are not available at all Hospitals. For example, burn care, cardiac care, trauma care, and critical care are only available at certain Hospitals. To be covered, you must be taken to the closest Hospital that can treat you. Coverage is not available for air ambulance transfers simply because you, your family, or your Provider prefers a specic Hospital or Physician. Autism Spectrum Disorder Services Coverage is provided for the treatment of autism spectrum disorders. Treatment is limited to services prescribed by your Physician in accordance with a treatment plan. Autism spectrum disorder means a neurological condition, including Asperger's syndrome and autism, as dened in the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association. Any exclusion or limitation in this Benet Booklet in conflict with the coverage described in this provision will not apply. Coverage for autism spectrum disorders will not be subject to dollar limits, Deductibles, Copayment or Coinsurance provisions that are less favorable than the dollar limits, Deductibles, Copayments or Coinsurance provisions that apply to physical illness under this Plan.

When the Administrator is contacted, you will be notied whether the Inpatient setting is appropriate, and if appropriate, the number of days considered Medically Necessary. By calling the Administrator, you may avoid nancial responsibility for any Inpatient care that is determined to be not Medically Necessary under your Plan. If your Provider does not have a contract with the Administrator or is a BlueCard Provider, you will be nancially responsible for any care the Administrator, on behalf of the Employer, determines is not Medically Necessary. Care and treatment provided once you are Stabilized is no longer considered Emergency Care. Continuation of care from a Non-Network Provider beyond that needed to evaluate or Stabilize your condition in an Emergency will be covered as a Non-Network service unless the Administrator authorizes the continuation of care and it is Medically Necessary.

The Administrator, on behalf of the Employer, will deem any Drug, biologic, device, Diagnostic, product, equipment, procedure, treatment, service, or supply to be Experimental/Investigative if the Administrator, on behalf of the Employer, determines that one or more of the following criteria apply when the service is rendered with respect to the use for which benets are sought. The Drug, biologic, device, Diagnostic, product, equipment, procedure, treatment, service, or supply: \u008fcannot be legally marketed in the United States without the nal approval of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), or other licensing or regulatory agency, and such nal approval has not been granted; \u008fhas been determined by the FDA to be contraindicated for the specic use; or \u008fis subject to review and approval of an Institutional Review Board (IRB) or other body serving a similar function; or \u008fis provided pursuant to informed consent documents that describe the Drug, biologic, device, Diagnostic, product, equipment, procedure, treatment, service, or supply as Experimental/Investigative, or otherwise indicate that the safety, toxicity, or efcacy of the Drug, biologic, device, Diagnostic, product, equipment, procedure, treatment, service, or supply is under evaluation.

Coverage for the \"Dependent\" will continue until the Enrollee discontinues his coverage or the disability no longer exists. The department may require, at reasonable intervals, but no more often than once a year, satisfactory evidence of the disability is continuing. \"Dependent Limiting Age\" is the end of the month in which the child attains age 26.

A rescission of coverage means that the coverage may be legally voided back to the start of your coverage under the Plan, just as if you never had coverage under the Plan. You will be provided with a thirty (30) calendar day advance notice with appeal rights before your coverage is retroactively terminated or rescinded. You are responsible for paying the Plan for the cost of previously received services based on the Maximum Allowable Amount for such services, less any Copayments made or Fees paid for such services.

Any Subscriber or Dependent involved in the misuse of a Plan Identication Card will be liable to and must reimburse the Plan for the Maximum Allowable Amount for services received through such misuse. Continuation Federal Continuation of Coverage (COBRA) The following applies if you are covered under an Employer which is subject to the requirements of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) of 1985, as amended. COBRA continuation coverage can become available to you when you would otherwise lose coverage under your Employer's health plan. It can also become available to other Members of your family, who are covered under the Employer's health plan, when they would otherwise lose their health coverage. For additional information about your rights and obligations under federal law under the coverage provided by the Employer's health plan, you should contact the Employer. COBRA Continuation Coverage COBRA continuation coverage is a continuation of health coverage under the Employer's health plan when coverage would otherwise end because of a life event known as a \"qualifying event.\" Specic qualifying events are listed below. After a qualifying event, COBRA continuation coverage must be offered to each person who is a \"qualied beneciary.\" You, your spouse, and your Dependent children could become qualied beneciaries if coverage under the Employer's health plan is lost because of the qualifying event. Under the Employer's health plan, qualied beneciaries who elect COBRA continuation coverage may or may not be required to pay for COBRA continuation coverage. Contact the Employer for Fees payment requirements. If you are a Subscriber, you will become a qualied beneciary if you lose your coverage under the Employer's health plan because either one of the following qualifying events happens: \u008fYour hours of employment are reduced, or \u008fYour employment ends for any reason other than your gross misconduct. If you are the spouse of a Subscriber, you will become a qualied beneciary if you lose your coverage under the Employer's health plan because any of the following qualifying events happens: \u008fYour spouse dies; \u008fYour spouse's hours of employment are reduced; \u008fYour spouse's employment ends for any reason other than his or her gross misconduct; \u008fYour spouse becomes entitled to Medicare benets (under Part A, Part B, or both); or \u008fYou become divorced or legally separated from your spouse. Your Dependent children will become qualied beneciaries if they lose coverage under the Employer's health plan because any of the following qualifying events happens: Health Benet BookletM-62 CHANGES employment are reduced; \u008fThe parent-Subscriber's employment ends for any reason other than his or her gross misconduct; \u008fThe parent-Subscriber becomes entitled to Medicare benets (Part A, Part B, or both); \u008fThe parents become divorced or legally separated; or \u008fThe child stops being eligible for coverage under the Employer's health plan as a \"Dependent child.\" If Your Employer Offers Retirement Coverage Sometimes, ling a proceeding in bankruptcy under title 11 of the United States Code can be a qualifying event. If a proceeding in bankruptcy is led with respect to the Employer, and that bankruptcy results in the loss of coverage of any retired Subscriber covered under the Employer's health plan, the retired Subscriber will become a qualied beneciary with respect to the bankruptcy. The retired Subscriber's spouse, surviving spouse, and Dependent children will also become qualied beneciaries if bankruptcy results in the loss of their coverage under Employer's health plan. When is COBRA Coverage Available The Employer will offer COBRA continuation coverage to qualied beneciaries only after the Employer has been notied that a qualifying event has occurred. When the qualifying event is the end of employment or reduction of hours of employment, death of the Subscriber, commencement of a proceeding in bankruptcy with respect to the employer, or the Subscriber's becoming entitled to Medicare benets (under Part A, Part B, or both), then the Employer will notify the COBRA Administrator (e.g., Human Resources, external vendor) of the qualifying event. You Must Give Notice of Some Qualifying Events For the other qualifying events (divorce or legal separation of the Subscriber and spouse or a Dependent child's losing eligibility for coverage as a Dependent child), you must notify the Employer within 31 days after the qualifying event occurs. How is COBRA Coverage Provided Once the Employer receives notice that a qualifying event has occurred, COBRA continuation coverage will be offered to each of the qualied beneciaries. Each qualied beneciary will have an independent right to elect COBRA continuation coverage. Covered Subscribers may elect COBRA continuation coverage on behalf of their spouses, and parents may elect COBRA continuation coverage on behalf of their children. Health Benet BookletCHANGES IN COVERAGE: TERMINATION & CONTINUATION M-63 How Long Will Continuation Coverage Last? In the case of a loss of coverage due to end of employment or reduction in hours of employment, coverage may be continued only for up to a total of 18 months. In the case of losses of coverage due to the Subscriber's death, divorce or legal separation, the Subscriber's becoming entitled to Medicare benets or a Dependent child ceasing to be a Dependent under the terms of the Employer's health plan, coverage may be continued for up to a total of 36 months. When the qualifying event is the end of employment or reduction of the Subscriber's hours of employment, and the Subscriber became entitled to Medicare benets less than 18 months before the qualifying event, COBRA continuation coverage for qualied beneciaries other than the Subscriber lasts until 36 months after the date of Medicare entitlement. How Can You Extend The Length of COBRA Continuation Coverage? If you elect continuation coverage, an extension of the maximum period of coverage may be available if a qualied beneciary is disabled or a second qualifying event occurs. You must notify the Employer of a disability or a second qualifying event in order to extend the period of continuation coverage. Failure to provide notice of a disability or second qualifying event may affect the right to extend the period of continuation coverage. \u008fDisability An 11-month extension of coverage may be available if any of the qualied beneciaries is determined by the Social Security Administration (SSA) to be disabled. You must provide the SSA determination of your disability to the Employer within 60 days of receipt. The disability has to have started at some time before the 60th day of COBRA continuation coverage and must last at least until the end of the 18-month period of continuation coverage. Each qualied beneciary who has elected continuation coverage will be entitled to the 11-month disability extension if one of them qualies. If the qualied beneciary is determined by SSA to no longer be disabled, you must notify the Employer of that fact within 30 days after SSA's determination. \u008fSecond Qualifying Event An 18-month extension of coverage will be available to spouses and Dependent children who elect continuation coverage if a second qualifying event occurs during the rst 18 months of continuation coverage. The maximum amount of continuation coverage available when a second qualifying event occurs is 36 months. Such second qualifying events may include the death of a covered Subscriber, divorce or separation from the covered Subscriber, the covered Subscriber's becoming entitled to Medicare benets (under Part A, Part B, or both), or a Dependent child's ceasing to be eligible for coverage as a Dependent under the Employer's health plan. These events can be a second qualifying event only if they would have caused the qualied beneciary to lose coverage under the Plan if the rst qualifying event had not occurred. You must notify the Employer within 60 days after a second qualifying event occurs if you want to extend your continuation coverage. Trade Act of 1974 Special COBRA rights apply to Subscribers who have been terminated or experienced a reduction of hours and who qualify for a \"trade readjustment allowance\" or \"alternative trade adjustment assistance\" under a federal law called the Trade Act of 1974. These Subscribers are entitled to a second opportunity to elect COBRA coverage for themselves and certain family members (if they did not already elect Health Benet BookletM-64 HOW TO OBTAIN COVERED SERVICES COBRA coverage), but only within a limited period of sixty (60) days (or less) and only during the six (6) months immediately after their Employer health plan coverage ended. If you, the Subscriber, qualify for assistance under the Trade Act of 1974, you should contact the Employer for additional information. You must contact the Employer promptly after qualifying for assistance under the Trade Act of 1974 or you will lose these special COBRA rights. Premiums and the End of COBRA Coverage Premium will be no more than 102% of the Employer rate (unless your coverage continues beyond 18 months because of a disability. In that case, premium in the 19th through 29th months may be 150% of the Employer rate). Continuation coverage will be terminated before the end of the maximum period if: \u008fany required premium is not paid in full on time, \u008fa qualied beneciary becomes covered, after electing continuation coverage, under another Employer health plan, \u008fa qualied beneciary becomes entitled to Medicare benets (under Part A, Part B, or both) after electing continuation coverage, or \u008fthe Employer ceases to provide any group health plan for its employees. Continuation coverage may also be terminated for any reason the Employer would terminate coverage of a participant or beneciary not receiving continuation coverage (such as fraud). Other coverage options besides COBRA Continuation Coverage Instead of enrolling in COBRA continuation coverage, there may be other coverage options for you and your family through the Health Insurance Marketplace, Medicaid, or other group health plan coverage options (such as a spouse's plan) through what is called a \"special enrollment period.\" Some of these options may cost less than COBRA continuation coverage. You can learn more about many of these options at www.healthcare.gov. If You Have Questions Questions concerning your Employer's health plan and your COBRA continuation coverage rights should be addressed to the Employer. For more information about your rights under COBRA, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and other laws affecting group health plans, contact the nearest Regional or District Ofce of the U.S. Department of Labor's Employee Benets Security Administration (EBSA) in your area or visit the EBSA website at www.dol.gov/ebsa.

If a Non-Network Provider meets the Administrator's enrollment criteria and is willing to meet the terms and conditions for participation, that Provider has the right to become a Network Provider for the product associated with the Plan. Network Services and Benets If your care is rendered by a PCP, SCP, or another Network Provider benets will be paid at the Network level. Regardless of Medical Necessity, no benets will be provided for care that is not a Covered Service even if performed by a PCP, SCP, or another Network Provider. All medical care must be under the direction of Physicians. The Administrator, on behalf of the Employer, has nal authority to determine the Medical Necessity of the service. The Administrator, on behalf of the Employer, may inform you that it is not Medically Necessary for you to receive services or remain in a Hospital or other facility. This decision is made upon review of your condition and treatment. You may appeal this decision. See the Your Right To Appeal section of this Benet Booklet. \u008fNetwork Providers - include Primary Care Physicians (PCP), Specialty Care Physicians (SCP), other professional Providers, Hospitals, and other facility Providers who contract with the Administrator to perform services for you. PCPs include general practitioners, internists, family practitioners, pediatricians, obstetricians & gynecologists, geriatrician or other Network Providers as allowed by the Plan. The Primary Care Physician is the Physician who may provide, coordinate, and arrange your health care services. SCP's are Network Physician who provide specialty medical services not normally provided by a PCP. Referrals are never needed to visit a Network Specialist including behavioral health Providers. To see a doctor, call their ofce: \u008fTell them you are an Anthem Member, \u008fTell them the reason for your visit. \u008fWhen you go to the ofce, be sure to bring your Member Identication Card with you. The doctor's ofce may ask you for your group or Member ID number. \u008fFor services rendered by Network Providers: 1.You will not be required to le any claims for services you obtain directly from Network Providers. Network Providers will seek compensation for Covered Services rendered from the Plan and not from you except for approved Coinsurance, Copayments and/or Deductibles. You may be billed by your Network Provider(s) for any non-Covered Services you receive or when you have not acted in accordance with the Plan. 2.Health Care Management is the responsibility of the Network Provider. If there is no Network Provider who is qualied to perform the treatment you require, contact the Administrator prior to receiving the service or treatment and the Administrator may approve a Non-Network Provider for that service as an Authorized Service. Health Benet BookletM-66 HOW TO OBTAIN COVERED SERVICES After Hours Care If you need care after normal business hours, your doctor may have several options for you. You should call your doctor's ofce for instructions if you need care in the evenings, on weekends, or during the holidays and cannot wait until the ofce reopens. If you have an Emergency, call 911 or go to the nearest Emergency Room. How to Find a Provider in the Network There are three ways you can nd out if a Provider or Facility is in the network for this Benet Booklet. You can also nd out where they are located and details about their license or training. \u008fSee the directory of Network Providers at www.anthem.com, which lists the Doctors, Providers, and Facilities that participate in this plan's network. \u008fCall Member Services to ask for a list of doctors and Providers that participate in this plan's network, based on specialty and geographic area. \u008fCheck with your doctor or Provider. Please note that not all Network Providers offer all services. For example, some Hospital-based labs are not part of the Administrator's Reference Lab Network. In those cases you will have to go to a lab in the Administrator's Reference Lab Network to get Network benets. Please call Member Services before you get services for more information. If you need details about a Provider's license or training, or help choosing a doctor who is right for you, call the Member Services number on the back of your Member Identication Card. TTY/TDD services also are available by dialing 711. A special operator will get in touch with the Administrator to help with your needs. Non-Network Services Services which are not obtained from a PCP, SCP, or another Network Provider or are not an Authorized Service will be considered a Non-Network Service. The only exception is Emergency Care and Urgent Care. In addition, certain services are not covered unless obtained from a Network Provider, see your Schedule of Benets. For services rendered by a Non-Network Provider, you are responsible for: \u008fThe difference between the actual charge and the Maximum Allowable Amount plus any Deductible and/or Coinsurance/Copayments; \u008fServices that are not Medically Necessary; \u008fNon-Covered Benet BookletCLAIMS PAYMENT M-67 Relationship of Parties (Plan - Network Providers) The relationship between the Plan and Network Providers is an independent contractor relationship. Network Providers are not agents or employees of the Plan, nor is the Plan, or any employee of the Plan, an employee or agent of Network Providers. The Plan shall not be responsible for any claim or demand on account of damages arising out of, or in any manner connected with, any injuries suffered by a Member while receiving care from any Network Provider or in any Network Provider's facilities. Your Network Provider's agreement for providing Covered Services may include nancial incentives or risk sharing relationships related to provision of services or referrals to other Providers, including Network Providers, Non-Network Providers, and disease management programs. If you have questions regarding such incentives or risk sharing relationships, please contact your Provider or the Plan. Not Liable for Provider Acts or Omissions The Plan is not responsible for the actual care you receive from any person. The Plan does not give anyone any claim, right, or cause of action against the Plan based on the actions of a Provider of health care, services or supplies. Identication Card When you receive care, you must show your Identication Card. Only a Member who has paid the Premiums under the Plan has the right to services or benets under the Plan. If anyone receives services or benets to which they are not entitled to under the terms of this Benet Booklet, he/she is responsible for the actual cost of the services or benets. 10 CLAIMS PAYMENT When you receive care through a Network Provider, you are not required to le a claim. This means that the provisions below, regarding Claim Forms and Notice of Claim, do not apply unless the Provider did not le the claim. A claim must be led for you to receive Non-Network Services benets, but many Non-Network Hospitals, Physicians and other Providers will still submit your claim for you. If you submit the claim, use a claim form. How Benets Are Paid Maximum Allowed Amount General This section describes how the Administrator determines the amount of reimbursement for Covered Services. Reimbursement for services rendered by Network and Non-Network Providers is based on this/your Plan's Maximum Allowed Amount for the Covered Service that you receive. Please see the Inter-Plan Arrangements section for additional information. Health Benet BookletM-68 CLAIMS PAYMENT The Maximum Allowed Amount for this Plan is the maximum amount of reimbursement the Plan will allow for services and supplies: \u008fthat meet the Plan's denition of Covered Services, to the extent such services and supplies are covered under your Plan and are not excluded; \u008fthat are Medically Necessary; and \u008fthat are provided in accordance with all applicable preauthorization, utilization management or other requirements set forth in your Benet Booklet. You will be required to pay a portion of the Maximum Allowed Amount to the extent you have not met your Deductible or have a Copayment or Coinsurance. In addition, when you receive Covered Services from a Non-Network Provider, you may be responsible for paying any difference between the Maximum Allowed Amount and the Provider's actual charges. This amount can be signicant. When you receive Covered Services from Provider, the Administrator will, to the extent applicable, apply claim processing rules to the claim submitted for those Covered Services. These rules evaluate the claim information and, among other things, determine the accuracy and appropriateness of the procedure and diagnosis codes included in the claim. Applying these rules may affect the Administrator's determination of the Maximum Allowed Amount. The Administrator's application of these rules does not mean that the Covered Services you received were not Medically Necessary. It means the Administrator has determined that the claim was submitted inconsistent with procedure coding rules and/or reimbursement policies. For example, your Provider may have submitted the claim using several procedure codes when there is a single procedure code that includes all of the procedures that were performed. When this occurs, the Maximum Allowed Amount will be based on the single procedure code rather than a separate Maximum Allowed Amount for each billed code. Likewise, when multiple procedures are performed on the same day by the same Physician or other healthcare professional, the Plan may reduce the Maximum Allowed Amounts for those secondary and subsequent procedures because reimbursement at 100% of the Maximum Allowed Amount for those procedures would represent duplicative payment for components of the primary procedure that may be considered incidental or inclusive. Provider Network Status The Maximum Allowed Amount may vary depending upon whether the Provider is a Network Provider or a Non-Network Provider. A Network Provider is a Provider who is in the managed network for this specic product or in a special Center of Excellence/or other closely managed specialty network, or who has a participation contract with the Administrator. For Covered Services performed by a Network Provider, the Maximum Allowed Amount for this/your Plan is the rate the Provider has agreed with the Administrator to accept as reimbursement for the Covered Services. Because Network Providers have agreed to accept the Maximum Allowed Amount as payment in full for those Covered Services, they should not send you a bill or collect for amounts above the Maximum Allowed Amount. However, you may receive a bill or be asked to pay all or a portion of the Maximum Allowed Amount to the extent you have not met your Deductible or have a Copayment or Coinsurance. Please call Member Services for help in nding a Network Provider or visit www.anthem.com. Providers who have not signed any contract with the Administrator and are not in any of Administrator's networks are Non-Network Providers, subject to Blue Cross Blue Shield Association rules governing claims led by certain ancillary providers. Health Benet BookletCLAIMS PAYMENT M-69 For Covered Services you receive from a Non-Network Provider, the Maximum Allowed Amount for this Plan will be one of the following as determined by the Administrator: 1.An amount based on the Administrator's Non-Network Provider fee schedule/rate, which the Administrator has established in its discretion, and which the Administrator reserves the right to modify from time to time, after considering one or more of the following: reimbursement amounts accepted by like/similar providers contracted with the Administrator, reimbursement amounts paid by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for the same services or supplies, and other industry cost, reimbursement and utilization data; or 2.An amount based on reimbursement or cost information from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\"). When basing the Maximum Allowed amount upon the level or method of reimbursement used by CMS, the Administrator will update such information, which is unadjusted for geographic locality, no less than annually; or 3.An amount based on information provided by a third party vendor, which may reflect one or more of the following factors: (1) the complexity or severity of treatment; (2) level of skill and experience required for the treatment; or (3) comparable Providers' fees and costs to deliver care, or 4.An amount negotiated by the Administrator or a third party vendor which has been agreed to by the Provider. This may include rates for services coordinated through case management, or 5.An amount based on or derived from the total charges billed by the Non-Network Provider. Providers who are not contracted for this product, but are contracted for other products with the Administrator are also considered Non-Network. For this/your Plan, the Maximum Allowed Amount for services from these Providers will be one of the ve methods shown above unless the contract between the Administrator and that Provider species a different amount. For Covered Services rendered outside Anthem's Service Area by Non-Network Providers, claims may be priced using the local Blue Cross Blue Shield plan's non-participating provider fee schedule / rate or the pricing arrangements required by applicable state or federal law. In certain situations, the Maximum Allowed Amount for out of area claims may be based on billed charges, the pricing the Administrator would use if the healthcare services had been obtained within the Administrator's Service Area, or a special negotiated price. Unlike Network Providers, Non-Network Providers may send you a bill and collect for the amount of the Provider's charge that exceeds the Plan's Maximum Allowed Amount. You are responsible for paying the difference between the Maximum Allowed Amount and the amount the Provider charges. This amount can be signicant. Choosing a Network Provider will likely result in lower Out of Pocket costs to you. Please call Member Services for help in nding a Network Provider or visit the Administrator's website at www.anthem.com. Member Services is also available to assist you in determining this/your Plan's Maximum Allowed Amount for a particular service from a Non-Network Provider. In order for the Administrator to assist you, you will need to obtain from your Provider the specic procedure code(s) and diagnosis code(s) for the services the Provider will render. You will also need to know the Provider's charges to calculate your Out of Pocket responsibility. Although Member Services can assist you with this pre-service information, the nal Maximum Allowed Amount for your claim will be based on the actual claim submitted by the Provider. Health Benet BookletM-70 CLAIMS PAYMENT Member Cost Share For certain Covered Services and depending on your plan design, you may be required to pay a part of the Maximum Allowed Amount as your cost share amount (for example, Deductible, Copayment, and/or Coinsurance). Your cost share amount and Out-of-Pocket Limits may vary depending on whether you received services from a Network or Non-Network Provider. Specically, you may be required to pay higher cost sharing amounts or may have limits on your benets when using Non-Network Providers. Please see the Schedule of Benets in this Benet Booklet for your cost share responsibilities and limitations, or call Member Services to learn how this Plan's benets or cost share amounts may vary by the type of Provider you use. The Plan will not provide any reimbursement for non-Covered Services. You may be responsible for the total amount billed by your Provider for non-Covered Services, regardless of whether such services are performed by a Network or Non Network Provider. Non-Covered Services include services specically excluded from coverage by the terms of this Benet Booklet and services received after benets have been exhausted. Benets may be exhausted by exceeding, for example, benet caps or day/visit limits. In some instances you may only be asked to pay the lower Network cost sharing amount when you use a Non-Network Provider. For example, if you go to a Network Hospital or Provider facility and receive Covered Services from a Non-Network Provider such as a radiologist, anesthesiologist or pathologist who is employed by or contracted with a Network Hospital or facility, you will pay the Network cost share amounts for those Covered Services. However, you also may be liable for the difference between the Maximum Allowed Amount and the Non-Network Provider's charge. The Administrator and/or its designated pharmacy benets manager may receive discounts, rebates, or other funds from drug manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors, and/or similar vendors, which may be related to certain Prescription Drug purchases under this Plan and which positively impact the cost effectiveness of Covered Services. These amounts are retained by the Administrator. These amounts will not be applied to your Deductible, if any, or taken into account in determining your Copayment or Coinsurance. The following are examples for illustrative purposes only; the amounts shown may be different than this Benet Booklet's cost share amounts; see your Schedule of Benets for your applicable amounts. Example: Your plan has a Coinsurance cost share of 20% for Network services, and 30% for Non-Network services after the Network or Non-Network Deductible has been met. You undergo a surgical procedure in a Network Hospital. The Hospital has contracted with a Non-Network anesthesiologist to perform the anesthesiology services for the surgery. You have no control over the anesthesiologist used. \u008fThe Non-Network anesthesiologist's charge for the service is $1200. The Maximum Allowed Amount for the anesthesiology service is $950; your Coinsurance responsibility is 20% of $950, or $190 and the remaining allowance from the Plan is 80% of $950, or $760. You may receive a bill from the anesthesiologist for the difference between $1200 and $950. Provided the Deductible has been met, your total Out of Pocket responsibility would be $190 (20% Coinsurance responsibility) plus an additional $250, for a total of $440. \u008fYou choose a Network surgeon. The charge was $2500. The Maximum Allowed Amount for the surgery is $1500; your Coinsurance responsibility when a Network surgeon is used is 20% of $1500, or $300. The Plan allows 80% of $1500, or $1200. The Network surgeon accepts the total of $1500 as reimbursement for the surgery regardless of the charges. Your total out of pocket responsibility would be $300. Health Benet BookletCLAIMS PAYMENT M-71 \u008fYou choose a NON-NETWORK The Non-Network surgeon's charge for the service is $2500. The Maximum Allowed Amount for the surgery service is $1500; your Coinsurance responsibility for the NON-NETWORK surgeon is 30% of $1500, or $450 after the NON-NETWORK Deductible has been met. The Plan allows the remaining 70% of $1500, or $1050. In addition , the Non-Network surgeon could bill you the difference between $2500 and $1500, so your total Out of Pocket charge would be $450 plus an additional $1000, for a total of $1450 . Authorized Services In some circumstances, such as where there is no Network Provider available for the Covered Service, the Plan may authorize the Network cost share amounts (Deductible, Copayment, and/or Coinsurance) to apply to a claim for a Covered Service you receive from a Non-Network Provider. In such circumstance, you must contact the Administrator in advance of obtaining the Covered Service. The Plan also may authorize the Network cost share amounts to apply to a claim for Covered Services if you receive Emergency services from a Non-Network Provider and are not able to contact the Administrator until after the Covered Service is rendered. If the Administrator authorizes a Network cost share amount to apply to a Covered Service received from a Non-Network Provider, You also may still be liable for the difference between the Maximum Allowed Amount and the Non-Network Provider's charge. Please contact Member Services for Authorized Services information or to request authorization. The following are examples for illustrative purposes only; the amounts shown may be different than this Benet Booklet's cost share amounts; see your Schedule of Benets for your applicable amounts. Example: You require the services of a specialty Provider; but there is no Network Provider for that specialty in your state of residence. You contact the Administrator in advance of receiving any Covered Services, and the Plan authorizes you to go to an available Non-Network Provider for that Covered Service and the Plan agrees that the Network cost share will apply. Your plan has a $45 Copayment for Non-Network Providers and a $25 Copayment for Network Providers for the Covered Service. The Non-Network Provider's charge for this service is $500. The Maximum Allowed Amount is $200. Because the Plan has authorized the Network cost share amount to apply in this situation, you will be responsible for the Network Copayment of $25 and the Plan will be responsible for the remaining $175 of the $200 Maximum Allowed Amount. Because the Non-Network Provider's charge for this service is $500, you may receive a bill from the Non-Network Provider for the difference between the $500 charge and the Maximum Allowed Amount of $200. Combined with your Network Copayment of $25, your total out of pocket expense would be $325. Services Performed During Same Session The Plan may combine the reimbursement of Covered Services when more than one service is performed during the same session. Reimbursement is limited to the Plan's Maximum Allowable Amount. If services are performed by Non Network Providers , then you are responsible for any amounts charged in excess of the Plan's Maximum Allowable Amount with or without a referral or regardless if allowed as an Authorized Service . Contact the Administrator for more information. Health Benet BookletM-72 CLAIMS PAYMENT Claims Review The Administrator has processes to review claims before and after payment to detect fraud, waste, abuse and other inappropriate activity. Members seeking services from Non-Network Providers could be balanced billed by the Non-Network Provider for those services that are determined to be not payable as a result of these review processes. A claim may also be determined to be not payable due to a Provider's failure to submit medical records with the claims that are under review in these processes. Payment of Benets The Plan will make benet payments directly to Network Providers for Covered Services. If you use a Non-Network Provider, however, the Plan may make benet payments to you or the Non-Network Provider at its discretion. Payments may also be made to, and notice regarding the receipt and/or adjudication of claims sent to, an Alternate Recipient (any child of a Subscriber who is recognized, under a Qualied Medical Child Support Order (QMSCO), as having a right to enrollment under the Employer's Plan), or that person's custodial parent or designated representative. Any payments made by the Plan will discharge the Plan's obligation to pay for Covered Services. You cannot assign your right to receive payment to anyone, except as required by a \"Qualied Medical Child Support Order\" as dened by ERISA or any applicable state law. Once a Provider performs a Covered Service, the Plan will not honor a request to withhold payment of the claims submitted. Notice of Claim The Plan is not liable, unless the Administrator receives written notice that Covered Services have been given to you. The notice must be given to the Administrator, on behalf of the Employer, within 90 days of receiving the Covered Services, and must have the data the Administrator needs to determine benets. If the notice submitted does not include sufcient data the Administrator needs to process the claim, then the necessary data must be submitted to the Administrator within the time frames specied in this provision or no benets will be payable except as otherwise required by law. If the Administrator has not received the information it needs to process a claim, the Administrator will ask for the additional information necessary to complete the claim. Generally, you will receive a copy of that request for additional information, for your information. In those cases, the Administrator cannot complete the processing of the claim until the additional information requested has been received. The Administrator, on behalf of the Employer, generally will make its request for additional information within 30 days of the Administrator's initial receipt of the claim and will complete the Administrator's processing of the claim within 15 days after the Administrator's receipt of all requested information. An expense is considered incurred on the date the service or supply was given. If the Administrator is unable to complete processing of a claim because you or your Provider fail to provide the Administrator with the additional information within 60 days of its request, the claim will be denied and you will be nancially responsible for the claim. Failure to give the Administrator notice within 90 days will not reduce any benet if you show that the notice was given as soon as reasonably possible. No notice of an initial claim, nor additional information on a claim can be submitted later than one year after the 90 day ling period ends. Health Benet BookletCLAIMS PAYMENT M-73 Time Benets Payable The Plan will pay all benets within 30 days for clean claims led electronically, or 45 days for clean claims led on paper. \"Clean claims\" means a claim submitted by you or a Provider that has no defect, impropriety, or particular circumstance requiring special treatment preventing payment. If the Administrator has not received the information it needs to process a claim, the Administrator will ask for the additional information necessary to complete the claim. Generally, you will receive a copy of that request for additional information, for your information. In those cases, the Administrator cannot complete the processing of the claim until the additional information requested has been received. The Administrator generally will make its request for additional information within 30 days of the Administrator's initial receipt of the claim and will complete the Administrator's processing of the claim within 15 days after the Administrator's receipt of all requested information. Claim Forms Claim forms will usually be available from most Providers. If forms are not available, either send a written request for claim forms to the Administrator, or contact Member Services and ask for claim forms to be sent to you. If you do not receive the claim forms, written notice of services rendered may be submitted to the Administrator without the claim form. The same information that would be given on the claim form must be included in the written notice of claim. This includes: \u008fName of patient. \u008fPatient's relationship with the Subscriber. \u008fIdentication number. \u008fDate, type and place of service. \u008fYour signature and the Provider's signature. Member's Cooperation Each Member shall complete and submit to the Plan such authorizations, consents, releases, assignments and other documents as may be requested by the Plan in order to obtain or assure reimbursement under Medicare, Worker's Compensation or any other governmental program. Any Member who fails to cooperate will be responsible for any charge for services. Explanation of Benets (EOB) After you receive medical care, you will generally receive an explanation of benets (EOB). The EOB is a summary of the coverage you receive. The EOB is not a bill, but a statement from the Plan to help you understand the coverage you are receiving. The EOB shows: \u008fTotal amounts charged for services/supplies received. \u008fThe amount of the charges satised by your coverage. \u008fThe amount for which you are responsible (if any). \u008fGeneral information about your appeals rights. Health Benet BookletM-74 CLAIMS PAYMENT Inter-Plan Arrangements Out-of-Area Services Overview Anthem has a variety of relationships with other Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Licensees. Generally, these relationships are called \"Inter-Plan Arrangements.\" These Inter-Plan Arrangements work based on rules and procedures issued by the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association (\"Association\"). Whenever you access healthcare services outside the geographic area Anthem serves (the \"Anthem Service Area\"), the claim for those services may be processed through one of these Inter-Plan Arrangements. The Inter-Plan Arrangements are described below. When you receive care outside of the Anthem Service Area, you will receive it from one of two kinds of Providers. Most Providers (\"participating providers\") contract with the local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plan in that geographic area (\"Host Blue\"). Some Providers (\"nonparticipating providers\") don't contract with the Host Blue. Explained below is how the Plan pays both kinds of Providers. Inter-Plan Arrangements Eligibility - Claim Types Most claim types are eligible to be processed through Inter-Plan Arrangements, as described above. Examples of claims that are not included are Prescription Drugs that you obtain from a Pharmacy and most dental or vision benets. A.BlueCardR\u008dProgram Under the BlueCardR\u008dProgram, when you receive Covered Services within the geographic area served by a Host Blue, Anthem will still fulll it's contractual obligations. But, the Host Blue is responsible for: (a) contracting with its Providers; and (b) handling its interactions with those Providers. When you receive Covered Services outside the Anthem Service Area and the claim is processed through the BlueCard Program, the amount you pay is calculated based on the lower of: \u008fThe billed charges for Covered Services; or \u008fThe negotiated price that the Host Blue makes available to Anthem. Often, this \"negotiated price\" will be a simple discount that reflects an actual price that the Host Blue pays to the Provider. Sometimes, it is an estimated price that takes into account special arrangements with that Provider. Sometimes, such an arrangement may be an average price, based on a discount that results in expected average savings for services provided by similar types of Providers. Estimated and average pricing arrangements may also involve types of settlements, incentive payments and/or other credits or charges. Estimated pricing and average pricing also take into account adjustments to correct for over- or underestimation of past pricing of claims, as noted above. However, such adjustments will not affect the price the Plan used for your claim because they will not be applied after a claim has already been paid. B.Special Cases: Value-Based Programs BlueCardR\u008dProgram Health Benet BookletCLAIMS PAYMENT M-75 If you receive Covered Services under a Value-Based Program inside a Host Blue's Service Area, you will not be responsible for paying any of the Provider Incentives, risk-sharing, and/or Care Coordinator Fees that are a part of such an arrangement, except when a Host Blue passes these fees to Anthem through average pricing or fee schedule adjustments. Additional information is available upon request. C.Inter-Plan Programs: Federal/State Taxes/Surcharges/Fees Federal or state laws or regulations may require a surcharge, tax or other fee. If applicable, the Administrator will include any such surcharge, tax or other fee as part of the claim charge passed on to you. D.Nonparticipating Providers Outside Anthem's Service Area 1.Allowed Amounts and Member Liability Calculation When Covered Services are provided outside of Anthem's Service Area by non-participating providers, the Plan may determine benets and make payment based on pricing from either the Host Blue or the pricing arrangements required by applicable state or federal law. In these situations, the amount you pay for such services as Deductible, Copayment or Coinsurance will be based on that allowed amount. Also, you may be responsible for the difference between the amount that the non-participating provider bills and the payment the Plan will make for the Covered Services as set forth in this paragraph. Federal or state law, as applicable, will govern payments for out-of-network Emergency services. 2.Exceptions In certain situations, Anthem may use other pricing methods, such as billed charges or the pricing Anthem would use if the healthcare services had been obtained within the Anthem Service Area, or a special negotiated price to determine the amount the Plan will pay for services provided by nonparticipating providers. In these situations, you may be liable for the difference between the amount that the nonparticipating provider bills and the payment the Plan makes for the Covered Services as set forth in this paragraph. E.Blue Cross Blue Shield Global CoreR\u008dProgram If you plan to travel outside the United States, call Member Services to nd out your Blue Cross Blue Shield Global CoreR\u008dbenets. Benets for services received outside of the United States may be different from services received in the United States. The Plan only covers Emergency, including ambulance, and Urgent Care outside of the United States. Remember to take an up to date health ID card with you. When you are traveling abroad and need medical care, you can call the Blue Cross Blue Shield Global CoreR\u008dService Center any time. They are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The toll free number is 800-810-2583. Or you can call them collect at 804-673-1177. Keep in mind, if you need Emergency medical care, go to the nearest hospital. There is no need to call before you receive care. Please refer to the Health Care Management section in this Benet Booklet for further information. How Claims are Paid with Blue Cross Blue Shield Global CoreR\u008d In most cases, when you arrange inpatient hospital care with Blue Cross Blue Shield Global CoreR\u008d, claims will be led for you. The only amounts that you may need to pay up front are any Copayment, Coinsurance or Deductible amounts that may apply. You will typically need to pay for the following services up front: Health Benet BookletM-76 CLAIMS PAYMENT \u008fDoctors services; \u008fInpatient hospital care not arranged through Blue Cross Blue Shield Global CoreR\u008d; and \u008fOutpatient services. You will need to le a claim form for any payments made up front. When you need Blue Cross Blue Shield Global CoreR\u008dclaim forms you can get international claims forms in the following ways: \u008fCall the Blue Cross Blue Shield Global CoreR\u008dService Center at the numbers above; or \u008fOnline at www.bcbsglobalcore.com. You will nd the address for mailing the claim on the form. Health Benet BookletHEALTH CARE MANAGEMENT M-77 11 HEALTH CARE MANAGEMENT Your plan includes the process of Utilization Review to decide when services are Medically Necessary or Experimental/Investigational as those terms are dened in this Benet Booklet. Utilization Review aids the delivery of cost-effective health care by reviewing the use of treatments and, when proper, level of care and/or the setting or place of service that they are performed. A service must be Medically Necessary to be a Covered Service. When level of care, setting or place of service is part of the review, services that can be safely given to you in a lower level of care or lower cost setting / place of care, will not be Medically Necessary if they are given in a higher level of care, or higher cost setting / place of care. Certain Services must be reviewed to determine Medical Necessity in order for you to get benets. Utilization Review criteria will be based on many sources including medical policy and clinical guidelines. The Administrator may decide that a treatment that was asked for is not Medically Necessary if a clinically equivalent treatment that is more cost effective is available and appropriate. If you have any questions regarding the information contained in this section, you may call the Member Services telephone number on the back of your Identication Card or visit www.anthem.com. Coverage for or payment of the service or treatment reviewed is not guaranteed even if it is decide your services are Medically Necessary. For benets to be covered, on the date you get service: 1.You must be eligible for benets; 2.Fees must be paid for the time period that services are given; 3.The service or supply must be a Covered Service under your plan; 4.The service cannot be subject to an Exclusion under your plan; and 5.You must not have exceeded any applicable limits under your plan. Types of Review: \u008fPre-service Review - A review of a service, treatment or admission for a benet coverage determination which is done before the service or treatment begins or admission date. Precertication - A required Pre-service Review for a benet coverage determination for a service or treatment. Certain services require Precertication in order for you to get benets. The benet coverage review will include a review to decide whether the service meets the denition of Medical Necessity or is Experimental / Investigational as those terms are dened in this Benet Booklet. For admissions following Emergency Care, you, your authorized representative or Physician must tell the Administrator within 48 hours of the admission or as soon as possible within a reasonable period of time. For childbirth admissions, Precertication is not needed unless there is a problem and/or the mother and baby are not sent home at the same time. Precertication is not required for the rst 48 hours for a vaginal delivery or 96 hours for a cesarean section. Admissions longer than 48/96 hours require precertication. \u008fContinued Stay / Concurrent Review - A Utilization Review of a service, treatment or admission for a benet coverage determination which must be done during an ongoing stay in a facility or course of treatment. Health Benet BookletM-78 HEALTH CARE MANAGEMENT Both Pre-Service and Continued Stay / Concurrent Reviews may be considered urgent when, in the view of the treating Provider or any Physician with knowledge of your medical condition, without such care or treatment, your life or health or your ability to regain maximum function could be seriously threatened or you could be subjected to severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without such care or treatment. Urgent reviews are conducted under a shorter timeframe than standard reviews. \u008fPost-service Review - A review of a service, treatment or admission for a benet coverage that is conducted after the service has been provided. Post-service reviews are performed when a service, treatment or admission did not need a Precertication, or when a needed Precertication was not obtained. Post-service reviews are done for a service, treatment or admission in which the Administrator has a related clinical coverage guideline and are typically initiated by the Administrator. Typically, Network Providers know which services require Precertication when needed. Your Primary Care Physician and other Network Providers have been provided detailed information regarding Health Care Management procedures and are responsible for assuring that the requirements of Health Care Management are met. Generally, the ordering Provider, facility or attending Physician (\"requesting Provider\") will contact the Administrator to request a Precertication. However, you may request a Precertication or you may designate an authorized representative to act on your behalf for a specic request. The authorized representative can be anyone who is 18 years of age or older. The table below outlines who is responsible for Precertication and under what circumstances. Health Benet BookletHEALTH CARE MANAGEMENT M-79 Provider Network Status Responsibility to Get PrecerticationComments Network Provider \u008f The Provider must get Precertication when required. Non Network / Non-ParticipatingMember \u008f Member must get Precer- tication when required.

(Call Member Services.) \u008f Member may be - nancially responsible for charges/costs related to the service and/or setting in whole or in part if the service and or setting is found to not be Medically Necessary. \u008f Blue Card Providers must obtain precerti- cation for all Inpatient Admissions. NOTE: For an Emergency Care admission, Precertication is not required. How- ever, you, your authorized representative or Physician must tell the Administra- tor within 48 hours of the admission or as soon as possible within a reasonable period of time. How Decisions are Made The Administrator will utilize its' clinical coverage guidelines, such as medical policy, clinical guidelines, and other applicable policies and procedures to assist the Plan in making Medical Necessity decisions. This includes decisions about Prescription Drugs. These guidelines reflect the standards of practice and medical interventions identied as appropriate medical practice. The Administrator reserves the right to review and update these clinical coverage guidelines periodically. You are entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to any documents relevant to your request. To request this information, contact the Precertication telephone number on the back of your Identication Card. If you are not satised with the Plan's decision under this section of your benets, please refer to the \"Your Right to Appeal\" section to see what rights may be available to you. Health Benet BookletM-80 HEALTH CARE MANAGEMENT Decision and Notication Requirements Timeframes and requirements listed are based on federal regulations. If you reside and/or receive services in a state other than the state where your contract was issued other state-specic Health Care Management requirements may apply. You may call the telephone number on the back of your membership card for additional information. Type of Review Timeframe Requirement for Decision and Notica- tion Urgent Pre-service Review 72 hours or 2 business days from the receipt of all necessary information whichever is less Non-Urgent Pre-service Review 2 business days from the receipt of all necessary information Continued Stay / Concurrent Review when request is re- ceived more than 24 hours be- fore the end of the previous au- thorization24 hours from the receipt of all necessary information Urgent Continued Stay / Con- current Review when request is received less than 24 hours be- fore the end of the previous au- thorization or no previous au- thorization exists72 hours from the receipt of the request or 2 business days from the receipt of all necessary information whichever is less Non-urgent Continued Stay / Concurrent Review for ongo- ing outpatient treatment2 business days from the receipt of all necessary information Post-Service Review 2 business days from the receipt of all necessary information If additional information is needed to make a decision, the Administrator will notify the requesting Provider of the specic information necessary to complete the review. If the Administrator does not receive the specic information requested by the required timeframe, a decision will be made based upon the information in the Administrator's possession. The Administrator will notify you and your Provider of a decision in accordance with federal regulations. Notication may be given by one or more of the following methods: verbal, written, and/or electronic. Important Information Upon the recomendation of the Administrator, the Plan may, from time to time, waive, enhance, change or end certain medical management processes (including utilization management, case management, and disease management) and/or offer an alternate benet if in its sole discretion, such change furthers the provision of cost effective, value based and/or quality services. The Plan may also select certain qualifying Providers to take part in a program or a Provider arrangement that exempts them from certain procedural or medical management processes that would otherwise apply. The Plan may also exempt your claim from medical review if certain conditions apply. Just because the Plan exempts a process, Provider or claim from the standards which otherwise would apply, it does not mean that the Plan will do so in the future, or will do so in the future for any Health Benet BookletHEALTH CARE MANAGEMENT M-81 other Provider, claim or Member. The Plan may stop or change any such exemption with or without advance notice. You may nd out whether a Provider is taking part in certain programs or a Provider arrangement by contacting the Member Services number on the back of your ID card. The Administrator also may identify certain Providers to review for potential fraud, waste, abuse or other inappropriate activity if the claims data suggests there may be inappropriate billing practices. If a Provider is selected under this program, then the Plan may use one or more clinical utilization management guidelines in the review of claims submitted by this Provider, even if those guidelines are not used for all Providers delivering services to this Plan's Members. Health Plan Individual Case Management The Administrator's health plan individual case management programs (Case Management) helps coordinate services for Members with health care needs due to serious, complex, and/or chronic health conditions. The Administrator's programs coordinate benets and educate Members who agree to take part in the Case Management program to help meet their health-related needs. The Administrator's Case Management programs are condential and voluntary and are made available at no extra cost to you. These programs are provided by, or on behalf of and at the request of, your health plan case management staff. These Case Management programs are separate from any Covered Services you are receiving. If you meet program criteria and agree to take part, the Administrator will help you meet your identied health care needs. This is reached through contact and team work with you and/or your authorized representative, treating Doctor(s), and other Providers. In addition, the Administrator may assist in coordinating care with existing community-based programs and services to meet your needs. This may include giving you information about external agencies and community-based programs and services. In certain cases of severe or chronic illness or injury, the Plan may provide benets for alternate care that is not listed as a Covered Service. The Plan may also extend Covered Services beyond the Benet Maximums of this Plan. The Administrator will make any recommendation of alternate or extended benets to the Plan on a case-by-case, if in the Administrator's discretion the alternate or extended benet is in the best interest of you and the Plan and you or your authorized representative agree to the alternate or extended benet in writing. A decision to provide extended benets or approve alternate care in one case does not obligate the Plan to provide the same benets again to you or to any other Member. The Plan reserves the right, at any time, to alter or stop providing extended benets or approving alternate care. In such case, the Administrator will notify you or your authorized representative in writing. Voluntary Clinical Quality Programs The Administrator may offer additional opportunities to assist You in obtaining certain covered preventive or other care (e.g., well child check-ups or certain laboratory screening tests) within a specic timeframe. These opportunities are called voluntary clinical quality programs. They are designed to encourage You to get certain care when You need it and are separate from Covered Services under this Plan. These programs are not guaranteed and could be discontinued at any time. The Administrator will give you the choice and if You choose to participate in one of these programs, and obtain the recommended care within the program's timeframe, You may receive incentives such as gift cards or Health Benet BookletM-82 YOUR RIGHT TO APPEAL retailer coupons, which you are encouraged to use for health and wellness related activities or items. Under other clinical quality programs, You may receive a home test kit that allows You to collect the specimen for certain covered laboratory tests at home and mail it to the laboratory for processing. You may also be offered a home visit appointment to collect such specimens and complete biometric screenings. You may need to pay any cost shares that normally apply to such covered laboratory tests (e.g., those applicable to the laboratory processing fee) but will not need to pay for the home test kit. (If you have any questions about whether receipt of a gift card or retailer coupon results in taxable income to you, the Administrator recommends that you consult your tax advisor.) 12 YOUR RIGHT TO APPEAL The Plan wants your experience to be as positive as possible. There may be times, however, when you have a complaint, problem, or question about your Plan or a service you have received. In those cases, please contact Member Services by calling the number on the back of your ID card. The Administrator will try to resolve your complaint informally by talking to your Provider or reviewing your claim. If you are not satised with the resolution of your complaint, you have the right to le a Grievance / Appeal, which is dened as follows: For purposes of these Appeal provisions, \"claim for benets\" means a request for benets under the plan. The term includes both pre-service and post-service claims. \u008fA pre-service claim is a claim for benets under the plan for which you have not received the benet or for which you may need to obtain approval in advance. \u008fA post-service claim is any other claim for benets under the plan for which you have received the service. If your claim is denied or if your coverage is rescinded: \u008fyou will be provided with a written notice of the denial or rescission; and \u008fyou are entitled to a full and fair review of the denial or rescission. The procedure the Administrator will follow will satisfy the requirements for a full and fair review under applicable federal regulations. Notice of Adverse Benet Determination If your claim is denied, the Administrator's notice of the adverse benet determination (denial) will include: sufcient to denial; \u008fa provision(s) on which the Administrator's determination is based; \u008fa description of any additional material or information needed to perfect your claim; \u008fan explanation of why the additional material or information is needed; Health Benet BookletYOUR RIGHT TO APPEAL M-83 \u008fa description of the plan's review procedures and the time limits that apply to them; \u008finformation about any internal rule, guideline, protocol, or other similar criterion relied upon in making the claim determination and about your right to request a copy of it free of charge, along with a discussion of the claims denial decision; \u008finformation about the scientic or clinical judgment for any determination based on medical necessity or experimental treatment, or about your right to request this explanation free of charge, along with a discussion of the claims denial decision; and \u008fthe availability of, and contact information for, any applicable ofce of health insurance consumer assistance or ombudsman who may assist you. For claims involving urgent/concurrent care: \u008fthe Administrator's notice will also include a description of the applicable urgent/concurrent review process; and \u008fthe Administrator may notify you or your authorized representative within 72 hours orally and then furnish a written notication. Appeals You have the right to appeal an adverse benet determination (claim denial or rescission of coverage). You or your authorized representative must le your appeal within 180 calendar days after you are notied of the denial or rescission. You will have the opportunity to submit written comments, documents, records, and other information supporting your claim. The Administrator's review of your claim will take into account all information you submit, regardless of whether it was submitted or considered in the initial benet determination. The Administrator shall offer a single mandatory level of appeal and an additional voluntary second level of appeal which may be a panel review, independent review, or other process consistent with the entity reviewing the appeal. The time frame allowed for the Administrator to complete its review is dependent upon the type of review involved (e.g. pre-service, concurrent, post-service, urgent, etc.). For pre-service claims involving urgent/concurrent care , you may obtain an expedited appeal. You or your authorized representative may request it orally or in writing. All necessary information, including the Claims Administrator's decision, can be sent between the Administrator and you by telephone, facsimile or other similar method. To le an appeal for a claim involving urgent/concurrent care, you or your authorized representative must contact the Claims Administrator at the number shown on your identication card and provide at least the following information: \u008fthe identity of the claimant; \u008fThe date(s) \u008fthe provider's or supply for which approval of benets was sought; and \u008fany reasons why the appeal should be processed on a more expedited basis. Health Benet BookletM-84 YOUR RIGHT TO APPEAL All other requests for appeals should be submitted in writing by the Member or the Member's authorized representative, except where the acceptance of oral appeals is otherwise required by the nature of the appeal (e.g. urgent care). You or your authorized representative must submit a request for review to: Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, ATTN: Appeals, , P.O. Box 105568; Atlanta, GA 30348-5568. You must include Your Member Identication Number when submitting an appeal. Upon request, the Administrator will provide, without charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records, and other information relevant to your claim. \"Relevant\" means that the document, record, or other information: \u008fwas relied on in making the benet determination; or \u008fwas submitted, considered, or produced in the course of making the benet determination; or \u008fdemonstrates compliance with processes and safeguards to ensure that claim determinations are made in accordance with the terms of the plan, applied consistently for similarly-situated claimants; or \u008fis a statement of the plan's policy or guidance about the treatment or benet relative to your diagnosis. The Administrator will also provide you, free of charge, with any new or additional evidence considered, relied upon, or generated in connection with your claim. In addition, before you receive an adverse benet determination on review based on a new or additional rationale, the Administrator will provide you, free of charge, with the rationale. For Out of State Appeals You have to le Provider appeals with the Host Plan. This means Providers must le appeals with the same plan to which the claim was led. How Your Appeal will be Decided When the Administrator considers your appeal, the Administrator will not rely upon the initial benet determination or, for voluntary second-level appeals, to the earlier appeal determination. The review will be conducted by an appropriate reviewer who did not make the initial determination and who does not work for the person who made the initial determination. A voluntary second-level review will be conducted by an appropriate reviewer who did not make the initial determination or the rst-level appeal determination and who does not work for the person who made the initial determination or rst-level appeal determination. If the denial was based in whole or in part on a medical judgment, including whether the treatment is experimental, investigational, or not medically necessary, the reviewer will consult with a health care professional who has the appropriate training and experience in the medical eld involved in making the judgment. This health care professional will not be one who was consulted in making an earlier determination or who works for one who was consulted in making an earlier determination. Notication of the Outcome of the Appeal If you appeal a claim involving urgent/concurrent care , the Administrator will notify you of the outcome of the appeal as soon as possible, but not later than 72 hours after receipt of your request for appeal. Health Benet BookletYOUR RIGHT TO APPEAL M-85 If you appeal any other pre-service claim, the Administrator will notify you of the outcome of the appeal within 30 days after receipt of your request for appeal If you appeal a post-service claim, the Administrator will notify you of the outcome of the appeal within 60 days after receipt of your request for appeal. Appeal Denial If your appeal is denied, that denial will be considered an adverse benet determination. The notication from the Claims Administrator will include all of the information set forth in the above section entitled \"Notice of Adverse Benet Determination.\" Voluntary Second Level Appeals If you are dissatised with the Plan's mandatory rst level appeal decision, a voluntary second level appeal may be available. If you would like to initiate a second level appeal, please write to the address listed above. Voluntary appeals must be submitted within 60 calendar days of the denial of the rst level appeal. You are not required to complete a voluntary second level appeal prior to submitting a request for an independent External Review. External Review If the outcome of the mandatory rst level appeal is adverse to you and it was based on medical judgment, you may be eligible for an independent External Review pursuant to federal law. You must submit your request for External Review to the Administrator within four (4) months of the notice of your nal internal adverse determination. A request for an External Review must be in writing unless the Administrator determines that it is not reasonable to require a written statement. You do not have to re-send the information that you submitted for internal appeal. However, you are encouraged to submit any additional information that you think is important for review. For pre-service claims involving urgent/concurrent care, you may proceed with an Expedited External Review without ling an internal appeal or while simultaneously pursuing an expedited appeal through the Plan's internal appeal process. You or your authorized representative may request it orally or in writing. All necessary information, including the Administrator's decision, can be sent between the Administrator and you by telephone, facsimile or other similar method. To proceed with an Expedited External Review, you or your authorized representative must contact the Administrator at the number shown on your identication card and provide at least the following information: \u008fthe identity of the claimant; \u008fThe date(s) \u008fthe provider's or supply for which approval of benets was sought; and \u008fany reasons why the appeal should be processed on a more expedited basis. Health Benet BookletM-86 GENERAL PROVISIONS All other requests for External Review should be submitted in writing unless the Administrator determines that it is not reasonable to require a written statement. Such requests should be submitted by you or your authorized representative to: Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, ATTN: Appeals, , P.O. Box 105568; Atlanta, GA 30348-5568. You must include Your Member Identication Number when submitting an appeal. This is not an additional step that you must take in order to fulll your appeal procedure obligations described above. Your decision to seek External Review will not affect your rights to any other benets under this health care plan. There is no charge for you to initiate an independent External Review. The External Review decision is nal and binding on all parties except for any relief available through applicable state laws. Requirement to le an Appeal before ling a lawsuit No lawsuit or legal action of any kind related to a benet decision may be led by you in a court of law or in any other forum, unless it is commenced within three years of the Plan's nal decision on the claim or other request for benets. If the Plan decides an appeal is untimely, the Plan's latest decision on the merits of the underlying claim or benet request is the nal decision date. You must exhaust the Plan's internal Appeals Procedure but not including any voluntary level of appeal, before ling a lawsuit or taking other legal action of any kind against the Plan. 13 GENERAL PROVISIONS Entire Agreement This Benet Booklet, the Administrative Services Agreement, the Employer's application, any Riders, Endorsements or Attachments, and the individual applications of the Subscriber and Dependents, if any, constitute the entire agreement between the Plan and the Employer and as of the Effective Date, supersede all other agreements between the parties. Any and all statements made to the Plan by the Employer and any and all statements made to the Employer by the Plan are representations and not warranties, and no such statement, unless it is contained in a written application for coverage under the Plan, shall be used in defense to a claim under the Plan. Form or Content of Benet Booklet No agent or employee of the Administrator is authorized to change the form or content of this Benet Booklet. Such changes can be made only through an endorsement authorized and signed by a person authorized to sign on behalf of the Employer. Disagreement with Recommended Treatment Each Member enrolls in the Plan with the understanding that they, in consultation with their Providers, are responsible for determining the treatment appropriate for their care. You may, for personal reasons, refuse to accept procedures or treatment recommended by your Providers. Providers may regard such refusal to accept their recommendations as incompatible with continuance of the Physician-patient Health Benet BookletGENERAL PROVISIONS M-87 relationship and as obstructing the provision of proper medical care. In this event, the Provider shall have no further responsibility to provide care to you, and the Plan shall have no obligation to have Network Providers available who will render the care. If you refuse to follow a recommended treatment or procedure, and the Provider believes that no professionally acceptable alternative exists, you will be so advised. In such case, neither the Plan, nor any Provider shall have any further responsibility to provide care in the case of the Provider, and to arrange care in the case of the Plan for the condition under treatment or any complications thereof. Circumstances Beyond the Control of the Plan If circumstances arise that are beyond the control of the Plan, the Plan will make a good-faith gesture to arrange an alternative method of providing coverage. Circumstances that may occur, but are not within the control of the Plan, include but are not limited to, a major disaster or epidemic, complete or partial destruction of facilities, a riot, civil insurrection, labor disputes that are out of the control of the Plan, disability affecting a signicant number of a Network Provider's staff or similar causes, or health care services provided under the Plan are delayed or considered impractical. Under such circumstances, the Plan and Network Providers will provide the health care services covered by the Plan as far as is practical under the circumstances, and according to their best judgment. However, the Plan and Network Providers will accept no liability or obligation for delay, or failure to provide or arrange health care services if the failure or delay is caused by events/circumstances beyond the control of the Plan. Protected Health Information Under HIPAA The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), and the Privacy Regulations issued under HIPAA, contain provisions designed to protect the privacy of certain individually identiable health information. Your Employer's Group Health Plan has a responsibility under the HIPAA Privacy Regulations to provide you with a Notice of Privacy Practices. This notice sets forth the Employer's rules regarding the disclosure of your information and details about a number of individual rights you have under the Privacy Regulations. As an Administrator of your Employer's Plan, Anthem has also adopted a number of privacy practices and has described those in its Privacy Notice. If you would like a copy of Anthem's Notice, contact the Member Services number on the back of your Identication Card. Coordination Of Benets This Coordination of Benets (COB) provision applies when you have health care coverage under more than one Plan. Please note that several terms specic to this provision are listed below. Some of these terms have different meanings in other parts of the Benet Booklet, e.g., Plan. For this provision only, \"Plan\" will have the meanings as specied in the below. In the rest of the Benet Booklet, Plan has the meaning listed in the Denitions section. The order of benet determination rules determine the order in which each Plan will pay a claim for benets. The Plan that pays rst is called the Primary Plan. The Primary Plan must pay benets according to its policy terms regardless of the possibility that another Plan may cover some expenses. The Plan that pays after the Primary Plan is the Secondary Plan. The Secondary Plan may reduce the benets it pays so that payments from all Plans do not exceed 100% of the total Allowable expense. Health Benet BookletM-88 GENERAL PROVISIONS The Allowable expense under COB is generally the higher of the Primary and Secondary Plans' allowable amounts. A Network Provider can bill you for any remaining Coinsurance, Deductible and/or Copayment under the higher of the Plans' allowable amounts. This higher allowable amount may be more than the Plan's Maximum Allowable Amount. COB Denitions Plan is any of the following that provides benets or services for medical or dental care or treatment. If separate contracts are used to provide coordinated coverage for members of a group, the separate contracts are considered parts of the same Plan and there is no COB among those separate contracts. 1.Plan includes: Group and non group insurance contracts and subscriber contracts; Health maintenance organization (HMO) contracts; Uninsured arrangements of group or group-type coverage; Coverage under group or non group closed panel plans; Group-type contracts; Medical care components of long term care contracts, such as skilled nursing care; medical benets under group or individual automobile contracts (whether \"fault\" or \"no fault\"); Other governmental benets, except for Medicare, Medicaid or a government plan that, by law, provides benets that are in excess of those of any private insurance plan or other nongovernmental plan. 2.Plan does not include: Accident only coverage; Specied health for of long-term care coverage benets or other xed indemnity coverage; School accident-type coverages covering grammar, high school, and college students for accidents only, including athletic injuries, either on a twenty-four (24) hour or \"to and from school\" basis; and Medicare supplement policies. Each contract for coverage under items 1. or 2. above is a separate Plan. If a Plan has two parts and COB rules apply only to one of the two, each of the parts is treated as a separate Plan. This Plan means the part of the contract providing health care benets that the COB provision applies to and which may be reduced because of the benets of other plans. Any other part of the contract providing health care benets is separate from This Plan. A contract may apply one COB provision to certain benets, such as dental benets, coordinating only with similar benets, and may apply another COB provision to coordinate other benets. The order of benet determination rules determine whether This Plan is a Primary Plan or Secondary Plan when you have health care coverage under more than one Plan. When This Plan is primary, it determines payment for its benets rst before those of any other Plan without considering any other Plan's benets. When This Plan is secondary, it determines its benets after those of another Plan and may reduce the benets it pays so that all Plan benets do not exceed 100% of the total Allowable expense. Allowable expense is a health care expense, including Deductibles, Coinsurance and Copayments, that is covered at least in part by any Plan covering you. When a Plan provides benets in the form of services, the reasonable cash value of each service will be considered an Allowable expense and a benet paid. An expense that is not covered by any Plan covering you is not an Allowable expense. In addition, any expense that a Provider by law or in accordance with a contractual agreement is prohibited from charging you is not an Allowable expense; however, if a Provider has a contractual agreement with both the Primary and Secondary Plans, then the higher of the of the contracted fees is the Allowable expense, and the Provider may charge up to the higher contracted fee. The following are not Allowable expenses: Health Benet BookletGENERAL PROVISIONS M-89 1.The difference between the cost of a semi-private hospital room and a private hospital room is not an Allowable expense, unless one of the Plans provides coverage for private hospital room expenses. 2.If you are covered by 2 or more Plans that calculate their benet payments on the basis of usual and customary fees or relative value schedule reimbursement method or other similar reimbursement methods, any amount in excess of the highest reimbursement amount for a specic benet is not an Allowable expense. 3.If you are covered by 2 or more Plans that provide benets or services on the basis of negotiated fees, an amount in excess of the highest of the negotiated fees is not an Allowable expense. 4.If you are covered by one Plan that calculates its benets or services on the basis of usual and customary fees or relative value schedule reimbursement method or other similar reimbursement method and another Plan that provides its benets or services on the basis of negotiated fees, the Primary Plan's payment arrangement will be the Allowable expense for all Plans. However, if the Provider has contracted with the Secondary Plan to provide the benet or service for a specic negotiated fee or payment amount that is different than the Primary Plan's payment arrangement and if the Provider's contract permits, the negotiated fee or payment will be the Allowable expense used by the Secondary Plan to determine its benets. 5.The amount of any benet reduction by the Primary Plan because you have failed to comply with the Plan provisions is not an Allowable expense. Examples of these types of Plan provisions include second surgical opinions, precertication of admissions or services, and Network Provider arrangements. 6.The amount that is subject to the Primary high-deductible health plan's deductible, if the Administrator has been advised by you that all Plans covering you are high-deductible health plans and you intend to contribute to a health savings account established in accordance with Section 223 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 7.Any amounts incurred or claims made under the Prescription Drug program of This Plan. Closed panel plan is a Plan that provides health care benets primarily in the form of services through a panel of Providers that contract with or are employed by the Plan, and that excludes coverage for services provided by other Providers, except in cases of emergency or referral by a panel member. Custodial parent is the parent awarded custody by a court decree or, in the absence of a court decree, is the parent with whom the child resides more than one half of the calendar year excluding any temporary visitation. Order of Benet Determination Rules When you are covered by two or more Plans, the rules for determining the order of benet payments are: The Primary Plan pays or provides its benets according to its terms of coverage and without regard to the benets of under any other Plan. 1.Except as provided in Paragraph 2. below, a Plan that does not contain a coordination of benets provision that is consistent with this COB provision is always primary unless the provisions of both Plans state that the complying Plan is primary. Health Benet BookletM-90 GENERAL PROVISIONS 2.Coverage that is obtained by virtue of membership in a group that is designed to supplement a part of a basic package of benets and provides that this supplementary coverage will be excess to any other parts of the Plan provided by the contract holder. Examples of these types of situations are major medical coverages that are placed over base plan hospital and surgical benets, and insurance type coverages that are written in connection with a Closed panel plan to provide out-of-network benets. A Plan may consider the benets paid or provided by another Plan in calculating payment of its benets only when it is secondary to that other Plan. Each Plan determines its order of benets using the rst of the following rules that apply: Rule 1 - Non-Dependent or Dependent . The Plan that covers you other than as a Dependent, for example as an employee, member, policyholder, subscriber or retiree is the Primary Plan, and the Plan that covers you as a Dependent is the Secondary Plan. However, if you are a Medicare beneciary and, as a result of federal law, Medicare is secondary to the Plan covering you as a Dependent and primary to the Plan covering you as other than a Dependent (e.g. a retired employee), then the order of benets between the two Plans is reversed so that the Plan covering you as an employee, member, policyholder, subscriber or retiree is the Secondary Plan and the other Plan covering you as a Dependent is the Primary Plan. Rule 2 - Dependent Child Covered Under More Than One Plan . Unless there is a court decree stating otherwise, when a Dependent child is covered by more than one Plan the order of benets is determined as follows: 1.For a Dependent child whose parents are married or are living together, whether or not they have ever been married: \u008fThe Plan of the parent whose birthday falls earlier in the calendar year is the Primary Plan; or \u008fIf both parents have the same birthday, the Plan that has covered the parent the longest is the Primary Plan. 2.For a Dependent child whose parents are divorced or separated or not living together, whether or not they have ever been married: \u008fIf a court decree states that one of the parents is responsible for the Dependent child's health care expenses or health care coverage and the Plan of that parent has actual knowledge of those terms, that Plan is primary. This rule applies to plan years commencing after the Plan is given notice of the court decree; \u008fIf a court decree states that both parents are responsible for the Dependent child's health care expenses or health care coverage, the provisions of 1. above will determine the order of benets; \u008fIf a court decree states that the parents have joint custody without specifying that one parent has responsibility for the health care expenses or health care coverage of the Dependent child, the provisions of 1. above will determine the order of benets; or \u008fIf there is no court decree assigning responsibility for the Dependent child's health care expenses or health care coverage, the order of benets for the child are as follows: \u008eThe Plan covering the Custodial parent; \u008eThe Plan covering the spouse of the Custodial parent; \u008eThe Plan covering the non-custodial parent; and then \u008eThe Plan covering the spouse of the non-custodial parent. Health Benet BookletGENERAL PROVISIONS M-91 3.For a Dependent child covered under more than one Plan of individuals who are not the parents of the child, the provisions of item 1. above will determine the order of benets as if those individuals were the parents of the child. Rule 3 - Active Employee or Retired or Laid-off Employee . The Plan that covers you as an active employee, that is, an employee who is neither laid off nor retired, is the Primary Plan. The Plan also covering you as a retired or laid-off employee is the Secondary Plan. The same would hold true if you are a Dependent of an active employee and you are a Dependent of a retired or laid-off employee. If the other Plan does not have this rule, and as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benets, this rule is ignored. This rule does not apply if \"Rule 1 - Non-Dependent or Dependent\" can determine the order of benets. Rule 4 - COBRA or State Continuation Coverage . If you are covered under COBRA or under a right of continuation provided by state or other federal law and are covered under another Plan, the Plan covering you as an employee, member, subscriber or retiree or covering you as a Dependent of an employee, member, subscriber or retiree is the Primary Plan and the COBRA or state or other federal continuation coverage is the Secondary Plan. If the other Plan does not have this rule, and as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benets, this rule is ignored. This rule does not apply if \"Rule 1 - Non-Dependent or Dependent\" can determine the order of benets. Rule 5 - Longer or Shorter Length of Coverage . The Plan that covered you longer is the Primary Plan and the Plan that covered you the shorter period of time is the Secondary Plan. Rule 6 . If the preceding rules do not determine the order of benets, the Allowable expenses will be shared equally between the Plans meeting the denition of Plan. In addition, This Plan will not pay more than it would have paid had it been the Primary Plan. Effect on this Plan's Benets When This Plan is secondary, it may reduce its benets so that the total benets paid or provided by all Plans during a plan year are not more than the total Allowable expenses. In determining the amount to be paid for any claim, the Secondary Plan will calculate the benets it would have paid in the absence of other health care coverage and apply that calculated amount to any Allowable expense under its Plan that is unpaid by the Primary Plan. The Secondary Plan may then reduce its payment by the amount so that, when combined with the amount paid by the Primary Plan, the total benets paid or provided by all Plans for the claim do not exceed the total Allowable expense for that claim. Because the Allowable expense is generally the higher of the Primary and Secondary Plans' allowable amounts, a Network Provider can bill you for any remaining Coinsurance, Deductible and/or Copayment under the higher allowable amount. In addition, the Secondary Plan will credit to its Plan deductible any amounts it would have credited to its deductible in the absence of other health care coverage. If you are enrolled in two or more Closed panel plans and if, for any reason, including the provision of service by a non-panel Provider, benets are not payable by one Closed panel plan, COB will not apply between that Plan and other Closed panel plans. Right to Receive and Release Needed Information Certain facts about health care coverage and services are needed to apply these COB rules and to determine benets payable under This Plan and other Plans. The Administrator, on behalf of the Employer, may get the facts it needs from or give them to other organizations or persons for the purpose Health Benet BookletM-92 GENERAL PROVISIONS of applying these rules and determining benets payable under This Plan and other Plans covering the person claiming benets. The Administrator need not tell, or get the consent of, any person to do this. Each person claiming benets under This Plan must give the Administrator any facts the Administrator need to apply those rules and determine benets payable. Facility of Payment A payment made under another Plan may include an amount that should have been paid under This Plan. If it does, This Plan may pay that amount to the organization that made that payment. That amount will then be treated as though it were a benet paid under This Plan. This Plan will not have to pay that amount again. The term \"payment made\" includes providing benets in the form of services, in which case \"payment made\" means the reasonable cash value of the benets provided in the form of services. Right of Recovery If the amount of the payments made by This Plan is more than should have paid under this COB provision, the Administrator, on behalf of the Employer, may recover the excess from one or more of the persons: 1.The Plan has paid or for whom the Plan have paid; or 2.Any other person or organization that may be responsible for the benets or services provided for the Member. The \"amount of the payments made\" includes the reasonable cash value of any benets provided in the form of services. Medicare Any benets covered under both this Plan and Medicare will be paid pursuant to Medicare Secondary Payor legislation, regulations, and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) guidelines, subject to federal court decisions. Federal law controls whenever there is a conflict among state law, Plan provisions, and federal law. Except when federal law requires the Plan to be the primary payor, the benets under this Plan for Members age 65 and older, or Members otherwise eligible for Medicare, do not duplicate any benet for which Members are entitled under Medicare, including Parts B and/or D. Where Medicare is the responsible payor, all sums payable by Medicare for services provided to Members shall be reimbursed by or on behalf of the Members to the Plan, to the extent the Plan has made payment for such services. Physical Examination When a claim is pending, the Plan reserves the right to request a Member to be examined by an applicable Provider. This will be requested as often as reasonably required. Health Benet BookletGENERAL PROVISIONS M-93 Workers' Compensation The benets under the Plan are not designed to duplicate benets that Members are eligible for under the Workers' Compensation Law. All money paid or owed by Workers' Compensation for services provided to a Member shall be paid back by, or on behalf of, the Member to the Plan if the Plan has made or makes payment for the services received. It is understood that coverage under the Plan does not replace or affect any Workers' Compensation coverage requirements. Other Government Programs The benets under the Plan shall not duplicate any benets that Members are entitled to, or eligible for, under any other governmental program. This does not apply if any particular laws require the Plan to be the primary payer. If the Plan has duplicated such benets, all money paid by such programs to Members for services they have or are receiving, shall be paid by or on behalf of the Member to the Plan. Subrogation and Reimbursement These provisions apply when the Plan pays benets as a result of injuries or illness you sustained and you have a right to a Recovery or have received a Recovery. Subrogation The Plan has the right to recover payments it makes on your behalf from any party responsible for compensating you for your injuries. The following apply: \u008fThe Plan has rst priority from any Recovery for the full amount of benets it has paid regardless of whether you are fully compensated, and regardless of whether the payments you receive make you whole for your losses, illnesses and/or injuries. \u008fYou and your legal representative must do whatever is necessary to enable the Plan to exercise the Plan's rights and do nothing to prejudice those rights. \u008fIn the event that you or your legal representative fails to do whatever is necessary to enable the Plan to exercise its subrogation rights, the Plan shall be entitled to deduct the amount the Plan paid from any future benets under the Plan. \u008fThe Plan has the right to take whatever legal action it sees t against any person, party or entity to recover the benets paid under the Plan. \u008fTo the extent that the total assets from which a Recovery is available are insufcient to satisfy in full the Plan's subrogation claim and any claim held by you, the Plan's subrogation claim shall be rst satised before any part of a Recovery is applied to your claim, your attorney fees, other expenses or costs. \u008fThe Plan is not responsible for any attorney fees, attorney liens, other expenses or costs you incur. The \"common fund\" doctrine does not apply to any funds recovered by any attorney you hire regardless of whether funds recovered are used to repay benets paid by the Plan. Health Benet BookletM-94 GENERAL PROVISIONS Reimbursement If you obtain a Recovery and the Plan has not been repaid for the benets the Plan paid on your behalf, the Plan shall have a right to be repaid from the Recovery in the amount of the benets paid on your behalf and the following provisions will apply: \u008fYou must promptly reimburse the Plan from any Recovery to the extent of benets the Plan paid on your behalf regardless of whether the payments you receive make you whole for your losses, illnesses and/or injuries. \u008fNotwithstanding any allocation or designation of your Recovery (e.g., pain and suffering) made in a settlement agreement or court order, the Plan shall have a right of full recovery, in rst priority, against any Recovery. Further, the Plan's rights will not be reduced due to your negligence. \u008fYou and your legal representative must hold in trust for the Plan the proceeds of the gross Recovery (i.e., the total amount of your Recovery before attorney fees, other expenses or costs) to be paid to the Plan immediately upon your receipt of the Recovery. You and your legal representative acknowledge that the portion of the Recovery to which the Plan's equitable lien applies is a Plan asset. \u008fAny Recovery you obtain must not be dissipated or disbursed until such time as the Plan has been repaid in accordance with these provisions. \u008fYou must reimburse the Plan, in rst priority and without any set-off or reduction for attorney fees, other expenses or costs. The \"common fund\" doctrine does not apply to any funds recovered by any attorney you hire regardless of whether funds recovered are used to repay benets paid by the Plan. \u008fIf you fail to repay the Plan, the Plan shall be entitled to deduct any of the unsatised portion of the amount of benets the Plan has paid or the amount of your Recovery whichever is less, from any future benet under the Plan if: 1.The amount the Plan paid on your behalf is not repaid or otherwise recovered by the Plan; or 2.You fail to cooperate. \u008fIn the event that you fail to disclose the amount of your settlement to the Plan, the Plan shall be entitled to deduct the amount of the Plan's lien from any future benet under the Plan. \u008fThe Plan shall also be entitled to recover any of the unsatised portion of the amount the Plan has paid or the amount of your Recovery, whichever is less, directly from the Providers to whom the Plan has made payments on your behalf. In such a circumstance, it may then be your obligation to pay the Provider the full billed amount, and the Plan will not have any obligation to pay the Provider or reimburse you. \u008fThe Plan is entitled to reimbursement from any Recovery, in rst priority, even if the Recovery does not fully satisfy the judgment, settlement or underlying claim for damages or fully compensate you or make you whole. Health Benet BookletGENERAL PROVISIONS M-95 Your Duties \u008fYou must promptly notify the Plan of how, when and where an accident or incident resulting in personal injury or illness to you occurred, all information regarding the parties involved and any other information requested by the Plan. \u008fYou must cooperate with the Plan in the investigation, settlement and protection of the Plan's rights. In the event that you or your legal representative fails to do whatever is necessary to enable the Plan to exercise its subrogation or reimbursement rights, the Plan shall be entitled to deduct the amount the Plan paid from any future benets under the Plan. \u008fYou must not do anything to prejudice the Plan's rights. \u008fYou must send the Plan copies of all police reports, notices or other papers received in connection with the accident or incident resulting in personal injury or illness to you. \u008fYou must promptly notify the Plan if you retain an attorney or if a lawsuit is led on your behalf. \u008fYou must immediately notify the Plan if a trial is commenced, if a settlement occurs or if potentially dispositive motions are led in a case. The Plan Sponsor has sole discretion to interpret the terms of the Subrogation and Reimbursement provision of this Plan in its entirety and reserves the right to make changes as it deems necessary. If the covered person is a minor, any amount recovered by the minor, the minor's trustee, guardian, parent, or other representative, shall be subject to this provision. Likewise, if the covered person's relatives, heirs, and/or assignees make any Recovery because of injuries sustained by the covered person, that Recovery shall be subject to this provision. The Plan is entitled to recover its attorney's fees and costs incurred in enforcing this provision. The Plan shall be secondary in coverage to any medical payments provision, no-fault automobile insurance policy or personal injury protection policy regardless of any election made by you to the contrary. The Plan shall also be secondary to any excess insurance policy, including, but not limited to, school and/or athletic policies. Right of Recovery and Adjustment Whenever payment has been made in error, the Plan will have the right to recover such payment from you or, if applicable, the Provider or otherwise make appropriate adjustments to claims. In most instances, such recovery or adjustment activity shall be limited to the calendar year in which the error is discovered. The Administrator has oversight responsibility of compliance with Provider and vendor contracts. The Administrator may enter into a settlement or compromise regarding enforcement of these contracts and may retain any recoveries made from a Provider or vendor resulting from these audits if the return of the overpayment is not feasible. Additionally, the Administrator has established recovery and adjustment policies to determine which recoveries and adjustments are to be pursued, when to incur costs and expenses and settle or compromise recovery or adjustment amounts. The Administrator will not pursue recoveries for overpayments or adjustments for underpayments if the cost of the activity exceeds the overpayment or underpayment amount.

The Blue Cross and Blue Shield marks are registered by the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, an association of independently licensed Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Ofce in Washington, D.C. and in other countries. Further, Anthem is not contracting as the agent of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association or any other Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield plan or licensee. This paragraph shall not create any additional obligations whatsoever on the part of Anthem other than those obligations created under other provisions of this agreement. Conformity with Law Any provision of this Plan which is in conflict with federal law, is hereby automatically amended to conform with the minimum requirements of such laws. Clerical Error A clerical error will never disturb or affect a Member's coverage, as long as the Member's coverage is valid under the rules of the Plan. This rule applies to any clerical error, regardless of whether it was the fault of the Employer or the Plan. Policies and Procedures The Employer is able to introduce new policies, procedures, rules and interpretations, as long as they are reasonable. Such changes are introduced to make the Plan more orderly and efcient. Members must follow and accept any new policies, procedures, rules and interpretations. Under the terms of the Administrative Services Agreement, the Administrator has the authority, in its sole discretion, to introduce or terminate from time to time, pilot or test programs for disease management, care management or wellness initiatives which may result in the payment of benets not otherwise specied in this Benet Booklet. The Administrator reserves the right to discontinue a pilot or test program at any time. Medical Policy and Technology Assessment The Administrator reviews and evaluates new technology according to its technology evaluation criteria developed by its medical directors. Technology assessment criteria are used to determine the Experimental / Investigational status or Medical Necessity of new technology. Guidance and external validation of the Administrator's medical policy is provided by the Medical Policy and Technology Assessment Committee (MPTAC) which consists of approximately 20 Doctors from various medical specialties including the Administrator's medical directors, Doctors in academic medicine and Doctors in private practice. Health Benet BookletGENERAL PROVISIONS M-97 Conclusions made are incorporated into medical policy used to establish decision protocols for particular diseases or treatments and applied to Medical Necessity criteria used to determine whether a procedure, service, supply or equipment is covered. Payment Innovation Programs The Administrator pays Network Providers through various types of contractual arrangements. Some of these arrangements - Payment Innovation Programs (Program(s)) - may include nancial incentives to help improve quality of care and promote the delivery of health care services in a cost-efcient manner. These Programs may vary in methodology and subject area of focus and may be modied by the Administrator from time to time, but they will be generally designed to tie a certain portion of a Network Provider's total compensation to pre-dened quality, cost, efciency or service standards or metrics. In some instances, Network Providers may be required to make payment to the Administrator under the Program as a consequence of failing to meet these pre-dened standards. The Programs are not intended to affect Your access to health care. The Program payments are not made as payment for specic Covered Services provided to You, but instead, are based on the Network Provider's achievement of these pre-dened standards. You are not responsible for any Copayment or Coinsurance amounts related to payments made by or to the Administrator under the Program(s), and You do not share in any payments made by Network Providers to the Administrator under the Program(s). Waiver No agent or other person, except an authorized ofcer of the Plan, is able to disregard any conditions or restrictions contained in this Benet Booklet, to extend the amount of time for making a payment to the Plan, or to bind the Plan by making any promise or representation or by giving or receiving any information. Care Coordination The Administrator pays Network Providers in various ways to provide Covered Services to You. For example, sometimes the Administrator may pay Network Providers a separate amount for each Covered Service they provide. The Administrator may also pay them one amount for all Covered Services related to treatment of a medical condition. Other times, the Administrator may pay a periodic, xed pre-determined amount to cover the costs of Covered Services. In addition, the Administrator may pay Network Providers nancial incentives or other amounts to help improve quality of care and/or promote the delivery of health care services in a cost-efcient manner, or compensate Network Providers for coordination of Member care. In some instances, Network Providers may be required to make payment to the Administrator because they did not meet certain standards. You do not share in any payments made by Network Providers to the Administrator under these programs. Program Incentives The Plan may offer incentives from time to time, at its discretion, in order to introduce you to covered programs and services. The purpose of these incentives include, but is not limited to, making you aware Health Benet BookletM-98 DEFINITIONS of cost effective benet options or services, helping you achieve your best health, and encouraging you to update member-related information. These incentives may be offered in various forms such as retailer coupons, gift cards, health related merchandise, and discounts on fees or Member cost shares. Acceptance of these incentives is voluntary as long as the Plan offers the incentives program. The Plan may discontinue an incentive for a particular covered program or service at any time. If you have any questions about whether receipt of an incentive or retailer coupon results in taxable income to you, it is recommended that you consult your tax advisor. Employer's Sole Discretion The Employer may, in its sole discretion, cover services and supplies not specically covered by the Plan. This applies if the Employer, with advice from the Administrator, determines such services and supplies are in lieu of more expensive services and supplies which would otherwise be required for the care and treatment of a Member. 14 DEFINITIONS If a word or phrase in this Benet Booklet has special meaning, or is a title, it will start with a capital letter.

It does mean that as to the diagnosis or treatment of the Member's illness, injury or disease, the service is: (1) not more costly than an alternative service or sequence of services that is medically appropriate, or (2) the service is performed in the least costly setting that is medically appropriate. For example the Plan will not provide coverage for an inpatient admission for surgery if the surgery could have been performed on an outpatient basis or an infusion or injection of a specialty drug provided in the outpatient department of a hospital if the drug could be provided in a Physician's ofce or the home setting; \u008fNot Experimental/Investigative; \u008fNot primarily for the convenience of the Member, the Member's family or the Provider. \u008fNot otherwise subject to an exclusion under this Benet Booklet.

Applications To obtain coverage with the Indiana State Police Health Care Benet Plan, an Eligible Person must complete and submit an application to the Indiana State Police Human Resources Division. Acceptance of the application is shown by delivery of an identication card showing the Eligible Person's name and identication number. 4TERMINATION AND CONTINUATION Termination Except as otherwise provided, your coverage may terminate in the following situations. The information provided below is general and the actual effective date of termination may vary based on your Employer's specic requirements: \u008fIf you terminate your coverage, termination for Enrollees and Dependents will generally be effective on the earliest of:. \u008fThe date the Administrative Service Agreement or Plan is terminated; or \u008fThe date the payroll deduction authorization is withdrawn; or \u008fThe date the premiums are due and payable and unpaid; or \u008fTermination of employment (except when retiree coverage is elected); or \u008fThe date a Dependent ceases to be eligible as dened. \u008fSubject to any applicable continuation or conversion requirements, if you cease to meet eligibility requirements as outlined in this Benet Booklet, your coverage will terminate on the last day of the billing period. If you cease to be eligible due to termination of employment, your coverage will terminate on the last day of the billing period. You must notify your Employerimmediately if you cease to meet the eligibility requirements. You shall be responsible for payment for any services incurred by you after you cease to meet eligibility requirements. \u008fIf you perform an act, practice, or omission that constitutes fraud or make an intentional misrepresentation of material fact, as prohibited by the terms of your Plan, your coverage and the coverage of your Dependents can be retroactively terminated or rescinded. A rescission of coverage means that the coverage may be legally voided back to the start of your coverage under the Plan, just as if you never had coverage under the Plan. You will be provided with a thirty (30) calendar day advance notice with appeal rights before your coverage is retroactively terminated or rescinded. You are responsible for paying the Plan for the cost of previously received services based on the Maximum Allowable Amount for such services, less any Copayments made or Fees paid for such services. \u008fIf you permit the use of your or any other Member's Plan Identication Card by any other person; use another person's card; or use an invalid card to obtain services, your coverage will terminate immediately upon written notice. Any Subscriber or Dependent involved in the misuse of a Plan Identication Card will be liable to and must Vision Benet BookletTERMINATION AND CONTINUATION V-15 reimburse the Plan for the Maximum Allowable Amount for services received through such misuse. Federal Continuation of Coverage (COBRA) The following applies if you are covered under an Employer which is subject to the requirements of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) of 1985, as amended. COBRA continuation coverage can become available to you when you would otherwise lose coverage under your Employer's health plan. It can also become available to other Members of your family, who are covered under the Employer's health plan, when they would otherwise lose their health coverage. For additional information about your rights and obligations under federal law under the coverage provided by the Employer's health plan, you should contact the Employer. COBRA Continuation Coverage COBRA continuation coverage is a continuation of health coverage under the Employer's health plan when coverage would otherwise end because of a life event known as a \"qualifying event.\" Specic qualifying events are listed below. After a qualifying event, COBRA continuation coverage must be offered to each person who is a \"qualied beneciary.\" You, your spouse, and your Dependent children could become qualied beneciaries if coverage under the Employer's health plan is lost because of the qualifying event. Under the Employer's health plan, qualied beneciaries who elect COBRA continuation coverage may or may not be required to pay for COBRA continuation coverage. Contact the Employer for Fees payment requirements. If you are a Subscriber, you will become a qualied beneciary if you lose your coverage under the Employer's health plan because either one of the following qualifying events happens: \u008fYour hours of employment are reduced, or \u008fYour employment ends for any reason other than your gross misconduct.If you are the spouse of a Subscriber, you will become a qualied beneciary if you lose your coverage under the Employer's health plan because any of the following qualifying events happens: \u008fYour spouse dies; \u008fYour spouse's hours of employment are reduced; \u008fYour spouse's employment ends for any reason other than his or her gross misconduct; \u008fYour spouse becomes entitled to Medicare benets (under Part A, Part B, or both); or \u008fYou become divorced or legally separated from your spouse. Your Dependent children will become qualied beneciaries if they lose coverage under the Employer's health plan because any of the following qualifying events happens: \u008fThe parent-Subscriber \u008fThe parent-Subscriber's employment ends for any reason other than his or her gross misconduct; \u008fThe parent-Subscriber becomes entitled to Medicare benets (Part A, Part B, or both); \u008fThe parents become divorced or legally separated; or \u008fThe child stops being eligible for coverage under the Employer's health plan as a \"Dependent child.\" Vision Benet BookletV-16 TERMINATION AND CONTINUATION If Your Employer Offers Retirement Coverage Sometimes, ling a proceeding in bankruptcy under title 11 of the United States Code can be a qualifying event. If a proceeding in bankruptcy is led with respect to the Employer, and that bankruptcy results in the loss of coverage of any retired Subscriber covered under the Employer's health plan, the retired Subscriber will become a qualied beneciary with respect to the bankruptcy. The retired Subscriber's spouse, surviving spouse, and Dependent children will also become qualied beneciaries if bankruptcy results in the loss of their coverage under Employer's health plan. When is COBRA Coverage Available The Employer will offer COBRA continuation coverage to qualied beneciaries only after the Employer has been notied that a qualifying event has occurred. When the qualifying event is the end of employment or reduction of hours of employment, death of the Subscriber, commencement of a proceeding in bankruptcy with respect to the employer, or the Subscriber's becoming entitled to Medicare benets (under Part A, Part B, or both), then the Employer will notify the COBRA Administrator (e.g., Human Resources, external vendor) of the qualifying event. You Must Give Notice of Some Qualifying Events For the other qualifying events (divorce or legal separation of the Subscriber and spouse or a Dependent child's losing eligibility for coverage as a Dependent child), you must notify the Employer within 31 days after the qualifying event occurs. How is COBRA Coverage Provided Once the Employer receives notice that a qualifying event has occurred, COBRA continuation coverage will be offered to each of the qualied beneciaries. Each qualied beneciary will have an independent right to elect COBRA continuation coverage. CoveredSubscribers may elect COBRA continuation coverage on behalf of their spouses, and parents may elect COBRA continuation coverage on behalf of their children. How Long Will Continuation Coverage Last? In the case of a loss of coverage due to end of employment or reduction in hours of employment, coverage may be continued only for up to a total of 18 months. In the case of losses of coverage due to the Subscriber's death, divorce or legal separation, the Subscriber's becoming entitled to Medicare benets or a Dependent child ceasing to be a Dependent under the terms of the Employer's health plan, coverage may be continued for up to a total of 36 months. When the qualifying event is the end of employment or reduction of the Subscriber's hours of employment, and the Subscriber became entitled to Medicare benets less than 18 months before the qualifying event, COBRA continuation coverage for qualied beneciaries other than the Subscriber lasts until 36 months after the date of Medicare entitlement. How Can You Extend The Length of COBRA Continuation Coverage? If you elect continuation coverage, an extension of the maximum period of coverage may be available if a qualied beneciary is disabled or a second qualifying event occurs. You must notify the Employer of a disability or a second qualifying event in order to extend the period of continuation coverage. Failure to provide notice of a disability or second qualifying event may affect the right to extend the period of continuation coverage. \u008fDisability An 11-month extension of coverage may be available if any of the qualied beneciaries is determined by the Social Security Administration (SSA) to be disabled. You must provide the SSA determination of your disability to the Employer within 60 days of receipt. The disability has to have started at some time before the 60th day of COBRA Vision Benet BookletTERMINATION AND CONTINUATION V-17 continuation coverage and must last at least until the end of the 18-month period of continuation coverage. Each qualied beneciary who has elected continuation coverage will be entitled to the 11-month disability extension if one of them qualies. If the qualied beneciary is determined by SSA to no longer be disabled, you must notify the Employer of that fact within 30 days after SSA's determination. \u008fSecond Qualifying Event An 18-month extension of coverage will be available to spouses and Dependent children who elect continuation coverage if a second qualifying event occurs during the rst 18 months of continuation coverage. The maximum amount of continuation coverage available when a second qualifying event occurs is 36 months. Such second qualifying events may include the death of a covered Subscriber, divorce or separation from the covered Subscriber, the covered Subscriber's becoming entitled to Medicare benets (under Part A, Part B, or both), or a Dependent child's ceasing to be eligible for coverage as a Dependent under the Employer's health plan. These events can be a second qualifying event only if they would have caused the qualied beneciary to lose coverage under the Plan if the rst qualifying event had not occurred. You must notify the Employer within 60 days after a second qualifying event occurs if you want to extend your continuation coverage. Trade Act of 1974 Special COBRA rights apply to Subscribers who have been terminated or experienced a reduction of hours and who qualify for a \"trade readjustment allowance\" or \"alternative trade adjustment assistance\" under a federal law called the Trade Act of 1974. These Subscribers are entitled to a second opportunity to elect COBRA coverage for themselves and certain family members (if they did not already elect COBRA coverage), but only within a limited period of sixty (60) days (or less) and only during the six (6)months immediately after their Employer health plan coverage ended. If you, the Subscriber, qualify for assistance under the Trade Act of 1974, you should contact the Employer for additional information. You must contact the Employer promptly after qualifying for assistance under the Trade Act of 1974 or you will lose these special COBRA rights. Premiums and the End of COBRA Coverage Premium will be no more than 102% of the Employer rate (unless your coverage continues beyond 18 months because of a disability. In that case, premium in the 19th through 29th months may be 150% of the Employer rate). Continuation coverage will be terminated before the end of the maximum period if: \u008fany required premium is not paid in full on time, \u008fa qualied beneciary becomes covered, after electing continuation coverage, under another Employer health plan, \u008fa qualied beneciary becomes entitled to Medicare benets (under Part A, Part B, or both) after electing continuation coverage, or \u008fthe Employer ceases to provide any group health plan for its employees. Continuation coverage may also be terminated for any reason the Employer would terminate coverage of a participant or beneciary not receiving continuation coverage (such as fraud). If You Have Questions Questions concerning your Employer's health plan and your COBRA continuation coverage rights should be addressed to the Employer.

Under such circumstances, the Plan and Network Providers will provide the health care services covered by the Plan as far as is practical under the circumstances, and according to their best judgment. However, the Plan and Network Providers will accept no liability or obligation for delay, or failure to provide or arrange health care services if the failure or delay is caused by events/circumstances beyond the control of the Plan. Vision Benet BookletV-24 GENERAL PROVISIONS Coordination of Benets This Plan is considered primary in all circumstances. Other Government Programs The benets under the Plan shall not duplicate any benets that Members are entitled to, or eligible for, under any other governmental program. This does not apply if any particular laws require the Plan to be the primary payor. If the Plan has duplicated such benets, all money paid by such programs to Members for services they have or are receiving, shall be paid by or on behalf of the Member to the Plan. Right of Recovery Whenever payment has been made in error, the Plan will have the right to recover such payment from you or, if applicable, the Provider. In the event the Plan recovers a payment made in error from the Provider, except in cases of fraud, the Plan will only recover such payment from the Provider during the 24 months after the date the Plan made the payment on a claim submitted by the Provider. The Plan reserves the right to deduct or offset any amounts paid in error from any pending or future claim. The cost share amount shown in your Explanation of Benets is the nal determination and you will not receive notice of an adjusted cost share amount as a result of such recovery activity. The Administrator, on behalf of the Employer, has oversight responsibility for compliance with Provider and vendor and Subcontractor contracts. The Administrator, on behalf of the Employer, may enter into a settlement or compromise regarding enforcement of these contracts and may retain any recoveries made from a Provider, Vendor, or Subcontractor resulting from these audits if the return of the overpayment is not feasible. The Administrator, on behalf of the Employer, has established recovery policies to determine which recoveries are to be pursued, when to incur costs and expenses and settle or compromise recoveryamounts. The Administrator, on behalf of the Employer, will not pursue recoveries for overpayments if the cost of collection exceeds the overpayment amount. The Administrator, on behalf of the Employer, may not provide you with notice of overpayments made by the Plan or you if the recovery method makes providing such notice administratively burdensome. Conformity with Law Any provision of this Plan which is in conflict with federal law, is hereby automatically amended to conform with the minimum requirements of such laws. Clerical Error Clerical error, whether of the Employer or the Administrator, in keeping any record pertaining to this coverage will not invalidate coverage otherwise validly in force or continue coverage otherwise validly terminated. Policies and Procedures The Employer is able to introduce new policies, procedures, rules and interpretations, as long as they are reasonable. Such changes are introduced to make the Plan more orderly and efcient. Members must follow and accept any new policies, procedures, rules and interpretations. Under the terms of the Administrative Services Agreement, the Administrator has the authority, in its sole discretion, to introduce or terminate from time to time, pilot or test programs for disease management or wellness initiatives which may result in the payment of benets not otherwise specied in this Benet Booklet. The Administrator reserves the right to discontinue a pilot or test program at any time. The Administrator will provide advance written notice to the Employer of the introduction or termination of any such program.

The internal appeals process may be initiated by the Member, the Member's authorized representative, or a Provider acting on behalf of the Member within 60 days of receipt of the Plan written notice of a Coverage Denial, or any other adverse decision made by the Administrator, but must be led within six months of your receipt of the initial decision. The request should include any medical information pertinent to the appeal. All portions of the medical records that are relevant to the appeal and any other comments, documents, records or other information submitted by the Member relating to the issue being appealed, regardless of whether such information was considered in making the initial decision, will be considered in the review of the appeal. Any new medical information pertinent to the appeal will also be considered. Members are entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, documents, records, and other information relevant to the Member's appeal. If a representative is seeking an appeal on behalf of a Member, the Administrator must obtain a signed Designation of Representation (DOR) form from the Member. The appeal process will not begin until the Administrator has received the properly completed DOR. The Administrator will forward a Designation of Representation form to the Member for completion. The individuals responsible for reviewing your request for an internal appeal will not be the same individuals who made the initial denial ordetermination. They will not be the subordinates of the initial decision-maker either and no deference will be given to the initial decision. Within a reasonable period of time but no later than 30 days after receiving a written or an oral request for an appeal, the Administrator will send a written decision to the Member or their authorized representative.
