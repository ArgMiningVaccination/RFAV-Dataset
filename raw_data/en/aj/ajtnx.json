If you're in need of chiropractic services, search for \"best chiropractor near me\" and see that [Our Chiropractors in Atlanta](https://aica.com/chiropractors/) are experts on the nervous system! Chiropractic care focuses on the nervous system's health to improve the health and function in the rest of your body. Care from one of our chiropractic clinics can help individuals find relief from a number of ailments and discomfort, and it is a great non-invasive, non-surgical way to treat several health concerns, bring about pain relief, or to help individuals recover from an injury. 3166 Chestnut Drive Connector, Suite 100, 200 Atlanta, GA 30340 The central nervous system is made up of the brain and spinal cord, and it is responsible for telling the rest of the body what to do at all times. It makes your stomach digest food, it keeps your heart beating, and it keeps your lungs breathing. It also regulates hormones, makes your organs interact with one another properly, and keeps your immune system firing to fight off sickness and disease. All of the messages that the brain sends to the rest of the body go through the spinal cord and out into the rest of the nerves in the body. When your spine is misaligned (when a vertebra is slightly shifted or twisted), it puts pressure on the spinal cord and surrounding nerves, which interrupts the messages that are being sent from your brain. When these interruptions occur, the messages get jumbled or don't even get delivered, and your body simply cannot function without the brain's messages. This is when dysfunction occurs. Pain receptors are messed up, muscle balance is uneven, and the body's other systems (respiratory, reproductive, digestive, immune, etc.) cannot function properly. This is when sickness, disease, and pain occur in the body. Chiropractic care involves spinal adjustments that realign the spine and restore proper communication between the brain and the rest of the body. After a chiropractic adjustment, nerve interference is removed and proper function is reestablished all throughout the body. Imaging tools such as a CT scan, MRI, X-Ray, or nerve testing such as an EMG or NCS test can give AICA orthopedic specialists, such as chiropractors, the means to see specific problem areas within the body. Chiropractic care for spinal health is important for increasing and improving overall health and wellness. Being able to adequately diagnose the root cause of pain and dysfunction can ensure that chiropractors at AICA are able to provide the best comprehensive treatment plan possible to treat your pain. At AICA Orthopedics, our imaging tools are state of the art for the best picture and quality every time. Different diagnostic tools are useful for diagnosing a myriad of issues, and each tool is uniquely utilized. A misalignment of the spine can sometimes be felt with an initial assessment, but more serious problems such as pinched nerves or bulging discs may require and X-Ray first to get an accurate, up close picture of the inside of the body. Chiropractors can use X-Rays to remove problem areas and ensure proper spinal alignment to alleviate symptoms of pain. While not used as often as X-Ray images, CT scans can give chiropractors at AICA Orthopedics a look at an injury or problematic disc from multiple angles so they can accurately assess the issue and form the best method of treatment. If your injury or pain does not go away with chiropractic care, then there may be a larger problem going unnoticed. An MRI can show orthopedic specialists the soft tissue such as ligaments, muscles, or tendons that don't show up on an X-Ray or CT scan. Chances are, if chiropractic care for the spine doesn't alleviate back pain, there may be another area of concern that can be located with an MRI. Electromyograms and Nerve Conduction Studies are specifically used to assess nerve function. Again, most of the time, chiropractic care can bring about relief for the source of nerve pain in the back. But if not, your chiropractor may recommend an EMG or NCS to find out more about what may be causing your pain. After searching for \"chiropractor near me Atlanta\", and after scheduling a consultation with a highly qualified AICA chiropractor, you will receive the very best in chiropractic care.
