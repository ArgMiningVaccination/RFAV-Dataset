Then, it stings when you eat or drink, brush your teeth, or even just talk. A quick investigation in the mirror confirms it. You have a mouth ulcer. And whether the small, shallow sore clears up in a day or lingers, causing pain for weeks, depends on the type of ulcer it is. Mind your teeth The vast majority of mouth ulcers are caused by some kind of trauma in your mouth, says Michael McCullough, a University of Melbourne dentist and oral health researcher. \"It's often people biting their tongue or lip, the rubbing of braces or sharp fillings, or dentures not fitting properly that cause mouth ulcers,\" Professor McCullough said. Luckily, this type of ulcer doesn't last long \u2014 and it can even heal and disappear before you notice it's there. \"Your immune system will turn up to start healing it, making sure there is no infection, and then within about two days it will be gone,\" Professor McCullough said. \"Most people who bite their cheek won't even be able to remember where they bit it by the next day, because it heals up so quickly.\" This type of ulcer is best dealt with by your dentist, according to Harry Nespolon, a GP and president of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. \"People sometimes confuse ulcers with gingivitis \u2014 infection and inflammation of your gums \u2014 and your dentist can identify that too,\" Dr Nespolon said. Recurrent mouth ulcers Another type of mouth ulcer can hang around for a lot longer, and then, after healing, reappear in a different spot. These are called aphthous ulcers, and between 10 and 20 per cent of people will experience them, most often when they're between 10 and 30 years old. Aphthous ulcers are only about 1 or 2 millimetres across \u2014 often a lot smaller than trauma-associated mouth ulcers \u2014 and can last up to two weeks. \"You're more likely to get them if you're undergoing stress, if you have poor nutrition or if you're otherwise ill,\" Professor McCullough said. \"But stress, poor diet and illness don't actually cause mouth ulcers.\" These aphthous ulcers result from a local immune reaction, when the immune system responds to something in that small section of skin in your mouth. What exactly that \"something\" is, scientists don't really know. \"We really don't know what makes [aphthous] ulcers form,\" Professor McCullough said. \"We do know that if you're sick, not only are you more likely to get these ulcers, but they will hang around for longer too.\" This is because the normally very high cell turnover in your mouth is slowed down considerably when you're unwell, preventing your skin from healing as quickly. Treatment of recurrent aphthous ulcers is usually limited to pain relief in the form of steroid cream, paracetamol or antiseptic gel. Less common types of mouth ulcers include major aphthous ulcers which are usually single and can be up to 1 centimetre wide, and herpetiform ulcers which are multiple tiny ulcers than can coalesce together. Food's a factor, but not the cause It may seem like you get mouth ulcers after you eat certain foods, but it's more likely that eating and drinking just makes you more aware of the ulcers \u2014 thanks to that stinging and burning sensation. \"This can lead people to correlating eating a particular food with getting mouth ulcers, but the food isn't the cause,\" Professor McCullough said. \"If you've got an ulcer and you have something spicy, citrus, anything acidic, then you'll definitely notice the ulcers. \"But poor nutrition is an extra factor on top of the underlying immune response linked to mouth ulcers.\" There is [some evidence](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-4632.2012.05751.x) of a link between recurrent ulcers and deficiencies in micronutrients, such as vitamin B12, folic acid and iron, but Professor McCullough said it's not yet conclusive. A very small number of people with aphthous ulcers \u2014 about 2 to 3 per cent \u2014 will get them after eating certain foods, but this could also be due to a contact allergy. \"Sometimes it can be things within foods like preservatives, but it's very hard to pinpoint,\" Professor McCullough said, adding that he was not aware of any link between mouth ulcers and sugar consumption. Sign of something serious While mouth ulcers are painful but not life-threatening for most, they should be taken seriously, especially if children get them, Dr Nespolon said. \"If children get them, they sometimes refuse to drink because of the pain and can become dehydrated.\" Anyone with recurrent mouth ulcers should visit their GP to make sure they don't have a systemic illness. \"One ulcer while you're sick is OK, but persistent and recurrent ones could be a sign of illness,\" Dr Nespolon said. Aphthous ulcers can be a sign of systemic diseases including coeliac disease and inflammatory bowel disease \u2014 especially if you're also experiencing abdominal pain, diarrhoea and weight loss. Mouth ulcers can also be an indication of [oral cancer](https://www.cancer.org.au/about-cancer/types-of-cancer/mouth-cancer.html). If you're a smoker and you develop a mouth ulcer \u2014 particularly on your tongue \u2014 you should get it checked by GP, Dr Nespolon added. But oral cancer is not a disease that only affects smokers. \"The demographics of oral cancer have changed significantly over the last decade,\" said Professor McCullough. \"There's been an increase in the number of non-smoking people getting oral cancer. \"We think that heavy alcohol consumption may be playing a bigger role.\" And oral cancers are often detected very late, partly because people ignore symptoms, which include large mouth ulcers.
