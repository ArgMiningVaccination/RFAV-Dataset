You can feel the level of integrity Combining yoga and detox on a retreat can create a huge, positive shift in your experience of life. The detox will cleanse your body of all the junk, promote weight loss, and improve your overall health and well-being. A detox program may be the life-changing experience that you are looking for. Why? Because we've lost touch with our bodies, the land, and how food actually interacts within our system. Rather than supporting our bodies in the natural detoxification process, we are loading ourselves with toxins and stress. As a result, the mind and the body end up being sluggish and prone to disease. It's not easy to resist a toxic life, though. Society is full of companies urging you to do things that are actually against your own health and well-being. It's no wonder that we come to the point of desiring [detox retreats](https://bookretreats.com/blog/10-top-detox-yoga-retreats-of-2017-that-are-actually-awesome/) where we can get our body and mind right. A healing period where we can bring ourselves back into alignment. Learn to truly respect your body and live a sustainable healthy lifestyle. So what does a typical detox program look like? Typically there will be some amount of fasting, such as with a juice fasting retreat with juice cleanse. A juice fasting retreat detox uses juices and raw food to detox the body, while still providing the energy needed. In fact, you may even be able to find a juice detox retreat near you. You can also expect mostly vegetarian meals or vegan food to ensure lightness on the system. Raw food is also a popular dietary choice for many of these cleansings. A plant-based diet provides an abundance of nutrients while also supporting the body's natural detoxification process. You may be interested in a detox spa retreat offering massage, spa service, infrared sauna, and other healing modalities to promote the overall health of the mind and body. A few wellness retreats will offer some sort of detox spa, where skin brushing and sauna treatments are included. Find a detox spa retreat at a destination spa for luxurious holistic wellness. Many of them will also offer a daily yoga class and meditation in order to support a holistic healing program. A detoxifying yoga session can certainly help stimulate the elimination process, further facilitating the detoxification process. You can even expect to find the opportunity for colonic hydrotherapy or other colonics treatments, which adds another layer to a total detox cleanse and is *pretty* nerve-racking to do on your own. People often come out feeling like a new person in a body that is now clean and strong. It is almost like pushing that reset button. You might go in only looking to cleanse your body, and come out with much much more than that. An ideal detox holiday will cleanse your body, your mind, and maybe even a little bit of your inner demons that churn at night. In most cases, a detox health retreat is so much more than just a weight loss retreat (though weight loss will certainly happen!). Instead, expect a focus on overall wellness at a proper weight loss retreat, where holistic wellness treatments, including meditation and yoga can bring you back to your truest, purest self. That's a perfect trip to healing, health and happiness. Depending on your own interests, you can even look to include fitness classes, hatha yoga sessions, horseback riding, epic surf camps, take a mountain trek, even go on adventurous safaris if that's your perfect trip to detox and wellness. Call it a detox fitness retreat, if you like. You know, it kinda seems that way, doesn't it? And perhaps there are quite a few detox retreats that are capitalizing on this trend. But you know what?

[5 Day Pancha Karma Retreat in Maine, US](https://bookretreats.com/5-day-ayurveda-and-detox-pancha-karma-retreat-in-maine-us) Panchakarma is the purification therapy used in Ayurveda as a means of prevention as well as working with a wide variety of health concerns. Panchakarma translates to the five actions and refers to five procedures intended to both cleanse and restore supporting and bringing balance to the body, mind, and emotions. Ayurvedic medicine is the oldest healing system in the world, originating in India some 3,000-5000 years ago.

Panchakarma is based on central concepts of Ayurveda, which state that disease is caused by the build-up of toxic substances in the body and by imbalances in the body and mind. The main tools through its practice are the support of digestive health, the cleansing of toxins, and the balancing of emotions of the mind to create a sustainable life of balance through our intake within the five senses.
