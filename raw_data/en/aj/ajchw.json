A respirator (sometimes called \"a duckbill\") is a mask that can provide protection against certain bacterial and viral illness in the patient care setting. The mask must be \"fit tested\" to make sure there's a good seal but that can't happen unless we have this questionnaire completed. Instructions 1. Complete all \"self-report\" documents - Patient Registration, Health History, Meningitis Waiver, Respirator (clinical students only) 2. Collect prior immunization records, titers, TB test and x-ray results. If these services were received outside of the U.S. documentation must be provided in English. Dates should be completed in mm/dd/yyyy format. Lab reports must include your name, date, name/location of laboratory, results and reference ranges. Screen shots or flow sheets from electronic record systems are not adequate documentation. 3. Arrange a visit with your healthcare provider. Show them these requirements. Get your Physical Exam and Immunization forms completed. You may need blood tests to measure serologic immunity as outlined above. You will need to complete your tuberculosis testing. It is important these requirements are met as outlined in this document Health Requirements | 5 since requirements for health science students are much stricter than the general population. 4. After all requirements are satisfied, all forms signed and/or stamped, make a copy (or scan) of all materials for your records and then mail the originals to us by the appropriate deadline. 5. We will review all materials to verify compliance with our requirements. Note that if submitted documents do not meet our standards, you will be required to repeat missing requirements at SHS at your expense. Frequently Asked Questions What if I can't meet the submission deadline? You may not be able to register for coursework. Students with immunization deficiencies may be removed from academic activities under New York State law. I currently work or volunteer at a hospital. Can I use an Occupational/Employee Health Report to meet my requirements? No. While it is useful information it does not by itself meet our health requirements. You should have your healthcare provider complete our immunization form, and when possible, submit lab tests of immunity. I had varicella (chicken pox) as a child. Do I really need a titer? Immunity to varicella at our campus is demonstrated by positive lab test for varicella antibodies, or documentation of 2 doses of varicella vaccine administered 30 days apart, after your first birthday. I've received BCG vaccine and have been told I should not get a skin test. Do I really need a PPD? How about a blood test for TB? Our main clinical partner requires documentation of TB skin tests for students involved in patient contact. Prior immunization with BCG does not preclude testing for latent tuberculosis via skin test. While some of our affiliates might accept an interferon gamma release assay (\"tb blood test\") we must have skin test results on file. Can't I just do all this when I get to campus? No. Students must address requirements prior to arrival to campus. Those with significant deficiencies may have registration holds. Students not meeting immunization and meningococcal disease report requirements under NYS law within 30 days of the start of class may be placed on administrative leave. Health Requirements | 6 I completed everything as instructed but I am told I still have deficiencies. What does this mean? All submitted materials must meet our documentation standards and anything that doesn't will not count towards meeting your requirements. In the event you are told you have a deficiency you will be provided with instructions on how to resolve your issue. Where can I learn more about Student Health Services? Visit http://shs.med.cornell.edu to learn about our services, financial policy, and other important administrative information. Am I required to pay a fee for Student Health Services? All students in the MD, MDPHD, MSHS PA and PHD programs are required to pay a student health services fee and have access to all student health, mental health and counseling services. Students in a Master's Degree program or certificate program may opt of the health service fee under certain circumstances, but are still required to submit health forms, immunization records and will be charged an administrative document fee. Students who only pay an administrative document fee will not be eligible for any services. Where can I learn more about the student health insurance plan? Student Health Services does not administer the insurance plan. you will get more information about the health insurance plan, waiver process and optional dental and vision programs from your academic program. What insurance program does Student Health Services participate in? SHS is not in any insurance plans. All students who pay the health services fee, regardless of insurance, have access to Student Health Services. Insurance is required for prescriptions, labs and imaging tests, and any healthcare services provided outside of the student health center. Am I required to have a flu vaccine? Flu vaccine is required for all students with patient contact. All students who have patient contact and who start school between September and March must provide documentation of receipt a flu vaccine for the current season. Documentation must include the date, and name and address of the vaccine provider. Flu vaccine is provided yearly at no cost to eligible students. Is meningitis vaccination required? Meningitis vaccination is not required but we are required to provide you information about meningococcal disease and the availability of a vaccine. The next two pages provide information regarding meningococcal disease from the New York State Department of Health. Meningococcal Disease What is meningococcal disease? Meningococcal disease is caused by bacteria called Neisseria meningitidis. It can lead to serious blood infections. When the linings of the brain and spinal cord become inflamed, it is called meningitis. The disease strikes quickly and can have serious complications, including death. Anyone can get meningococcal disease. Some people are at higher risk. This disease occurs more often in people who are: Teenagers or young adults Infants younger than one year of age Living in crowded settings, such as college dormitories or military barracks Traveling to areas outside of the United States, such as the \"meningitis belt\" in Africa Living with a damaged spleen or no spleen Being treated with Soliris\u00ae or, who have complement component deficiency (an inherited immune disorder) Exposed during an outbreak Working with meningococcal bacteria in a laboratory What are the symptoms? Symptoms appear suddenly - usually 3 to 4 days after a person is infected. It can take up to 10 days to develop symptoms. Symptoms may include: A sudden high fever Headache Stiff neck (meningitis) Nausea and vomiting Red-purple skin rash Weakness and feeling very ill Eyes sensitive to light How is meningococcal disease spread? It spreads from person-to-person by coughing or coming into close or lengthy contact with someone who is sick or who carries the bacteria. Contact includes kissing, sharing drinks, or living together. Up to one in 10 people carry meningococcal bacteria in their nose or throat without getting sick. Is there treatment? Early diagnosis of meningococcal disease is very important. If it is caught early, meningococcal disease can be treated with antibiotics. But, sometimes the infection has caused too much damage for antibiotics to prevent death or serious long-term problems. Most people need to be cared for in a hospital due to serious, life-threatening infections. What are the complications? Ten to 15 percent of those who get meningococcal disease die. Among survivors, as many as one in five will have permanent disabilities. Complications include: Hearing loss Brain damage Kidney damage Limb amputationsDepa rtment of HealthMeningococcal Disease Fact SheetWhat should I do if I or someone I love is exposed? If you are in close contact with a person with meningococcal disease, talk with your health care provider about the risk to you and your family. They can prescribe an antibiotic to prevent the disease. What is the best way to prevent meningococcal disease? The single best way to prevent this disease is to be vaccinated. Vaccines are available for people 6 weeks of age and older. Various vaccines offer protection against the five major strains of bacteria that cause meningococcal disease: All teenagers should receive two doses of vaccine against strains A, C, W and Y. The first dose is given at 11 to 12 years of age, and the second dose (booster) at age 16. It is very important that teens receive the booster dose at age 16 in order to protect them through the years when they are at greatest risk of meningococcal disease. Talk to your health care provider today if your teen has not received two doses of vaccine against meningococcal strains A, C, W and Y. Teens and young adults can also be vaccinated against the \"B\" strain. Talk to your health care provider about whether they recommend vaccine against the \"B\" strain. Others who should receive the vaccine include: Infants, children and adults with certain medical conditions People exposed during an outbreak Travelers to the \"meningitis belt\" of sub-Saharan Africa Military recruits Please speak with your health care provider if you may be at increased risk. What are the meningococcal vaccine requirements for school attendance? As of September 1, 2016, children entering grades 7 and 12 must be immunized against meningococcal disease strains A, C, W and Y according to the recommendations listed above. Is there an increased risk for meningococcal disease if I travel? Meningococcal disease and outbreaks occur in the United States and around the world. The disease is more common in the \"meningitis belt\" of sub-Saharan Africa. The risk is highest in people who visit these countries and who have prolonged contact with local populations during an epidemic. To reduce your risk of illness, wash your hands often, maintain healthy habits such as getting plenty of rest and try not to come into contact with people who are sick.
