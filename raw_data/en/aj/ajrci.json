J Altern Complement Integr Med 8: 301. Analysis Hepatoprotec - tion of Traditional Medicines Against Acute CCl4 and Chronic Alcohol-Induced Liver Injury in Mice. J Altern Complement Integr Med 8: 301.Chronic Alcohol-Induced Liver Injury Alcohol binge drinking is a risk factor for alcoholism. Alcoholic liver injury is the main alcohol-related disease, manifested from sim- ple steatosis to alcoholic steatohepatitis (inflammation), which can be progressed to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer with continu - ous consumption of excessive alcohol [1]. The chronic alcohol-in - duced liver injury can be reproduced by feeding mice with Lieber-De Carli liquid diet containing 5% alcohol for 28 days or longer, and liver injury was evidenced by histopathology with lipid droplet accumula - tion, elevated levels of triglyceride in the blood, and aberrant expressions, mimicking clinical steatosis [2,3]. Dendrobium nobile Lindl is listed in Pharmacopoeia of China with many beneficial pharmacological effects. At least 82 active ingredients have been isolated from Dendrobium regulate hepatic metabolism gene expression and lipid homeostasis via regulating the bile acids metabo - lism. In mice feed levels, by Oil-red O staining. Alcohol induced 787 differentially expressed genes, while DNLA only had 280 with much less extent. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) showed that DNLA ameliorated alcohol-induced oxidative stress Rosa roxburghii Tratt. fruit juice (Cili) has been shown to have numerous beneficial effects on health, including antioxidant, anti-age - ing, anti-atherosclerotic, antitumor, anti-hyperlipidemia, anti-hyper - glycemia effects against diabetes, Cili beneficial effects on gut microbiota and hepatoprotection [4]. Cili juice was from Shan- Wang-Guo Co and gavaged to alcohol-fed mice at 4 mL and 8 mL/kg/ day for 4 weeks. Cili decreased serum triglyceride levels, improved histopathology and dramatically reduced lipid droplets as compared to model mice. RNA-Seq analyses showed Cili could bring the alco - hol-induced aberrant gene pattern towards normal. The qPCR analy - sis verified that over-activation of CAR Cyp2b10 Cili were effective against chronic alcohol fat-ty liver, and the mechanisms were associated with decreased oxida-tive stress, improved lipid metabolism through modulating nuclear receptor CAR-, PXR-and Nrf2-mediated pathways [2,3]. Acute CCl4-Induced Liver Injury Carbon Tetrachloride (CCl4) is a widely used hepatotoxicant to study the mechanism of hepatoprotective compounds in traditional Chinese medicines. CCl4 is activated by cytochrome P450 enzymes, particular CYP2E1 to generate reactive toxic metabolite trichloro - methyl radical, which targets critical macromolecules to produce lipid peroxidation in membranes of mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and other critical organelles, leading to inflammation and hepatocel - lular death, either by apoptosis or by necrosis.Huang X, et al., J Med 2022, 8: 301 DOI: 10.24966/ACIM-7562/100301 HSOA Xianyu Huang1, 1Key Lab for Basic Pharmacology of Ministry of Education and Joint Inter - national Research Laboratory of Ethnomedicine, Zunyi Medical University, China 2Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University, Department of Gastroenterol - ogy, Zunyi 563000, ChinaTranscriptome Analysis of Hepatoprotection of Traditional Medicines Against Acute CCl4 and Chronic Alcohol-Induced Liver Injury in Mice Abstract Traditional medicines such Nobile have been shown to protect the hepatotoxicity of CCl4, chronic alco- hol, and others. To explore the molecular mechanisms of the protec- tion, RNA-Seq analysis was performed, followed by qPCR verification of selected genes. In acute CCl 4-induced liver injury, overexpression of genes related to mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation, LXR/VDR/RXR activation, signaling, alcohol-induced fatty livers, overactivation of CAR-, PXR- and Nrf2 genes are accompanied by increased expression of oxidative stress genes and decreased expression of metabolism genes. DNLA protected against the hepatotoxicity produced by acute CCl 4 and chronic alcohol induced liver injury, with normaliza - tion of the aberrant gene expressions. Cili juice as a nutritional food rescued chronic alcohol-induced metabolism gene downregulation and attenuated over-activated CAR-, PXR-, and Nrf2 genes. Hua-Feng-Dan produced adaptive mechanisms in the liver to render it to tolerant to CCl 4-induced oxidative stress stimuli. Thus, transcriptome analysis is a powerful tool to reveal the molecular mechanisms of hepatoprotection by traditional medicines.Citation: Huang X-Y, Yang S, Shi J-S, Wu Q (2022) Transcriptome Analysis of Hepatoprotection of Traditional Medicines Against Acute CCl4 and Chronic Alco- hol-In- duced Liver Injury in Mice. J Altern Complement Integr Med 8: 301. Page 2 of 2 J Altern Complement Integr Med ISSN: 2470-7562, Open Access Journal DOI:10.24966/ACIM-7562/100301 Volume 8 Issue 8 100301 DNLA has been demonstrated to exhibit protective effects on liver injury induced by CCl4 in wild-type mice, but not in Nrf2-null mice, and increase the expression of Nrf2 regulated proteins, indicating the activation of the Nrf2/ARE pathway as a mechanism of protection [5]. Further study demonstrated that CCl4-induced mitochondrial ox- idative stress is a critical event leading to liver injury, and DNLA im- proved mitochondrial oxygen consumption, elevated ATP production, and decreased CCl4-induced apoptosis in the WT mice, whereas the DNLA-mediated protection on mitochondrial dysfunction was dimin - ished in the Nrf2 Indicating -in- Nrf2-dependent [6]. The molecular mechanisms for DNLA to protect against CCl4 hepatotoxicity was further studied via RNA-Seq. DNLA brought the CCl4-induced aberrant gene expression pattern towards normal. GO analysis showed that CCl4 induced the activation, adhesion and proliferation of immune cells. KEGG analysis showed CCl4 induced oxidative stress, diseases and compromised adaptive responses. CCl4 induced differentially expressed genes were attenuated - uated analysis verified that CCl 4-induced DEGs were highly correlated with the GEO database of hepatotoxicity in rodents, DNLA dose-dependently attenu - ated such correlation [7]. Induction of Adaptive Mechanisms The liver is an important organ of detoxification in response to xe- nobiotics. To \"program the liver\" is an important concept in that xeno-biotics at appropriate doses could evoke adaptive responses to induce a number of molecular events to protect against toxic stimuli, which could be important in hepatoprotection by traditional medicines. Hua-Feng-Dan is such an example. Hua-Feng-Dan has over 300 years of history in the treatment of stroke and various diseases in Chi- na, including liver disorders. Hua-Feng-Dan is composed of 15 herbs, animal-based products, and minerals, and its \"Guide drug Yaomu\" is subjected to fermentation for 3 months before adding to the recipe. At least 44 volatile and 50 liposoluble components in Hua-Feng-Dan were identified through GC-MS analysis [8]. Hua-Feng-Dan and its \"Guide Drug Yaomu\" at hepatoprotective doses did not produce damage to the liver but produced gene expres- sion changes. RNA-Seq revealed 806 DEGs in Hua-FengDan-treat - ed livers compared to controls, and a low dose of Yaomu produced 235 DEGs in the same direction. GO and KEGG analyses revealed that Hua-Feng-Dan affected metabolism and signaling pathways. IPA upstream analysis pointed toward the activation of MAPK signaling pathways and induced adaptive responses by Hua-Feng-Dan. qPCR verified 10 selected DEGs. Hua-Feng-Dan-induced gene expression changes were highly correlated with the GEO database of chemi - cal-induced adaptive responses in mouse livers [8]. Thus, RNA-Seq analysis revealed Hua-Feng-Dan-induced adaptive responses as mechanisms of hepatoprotection.Summary Transcriptome analysis is a powerful tool to identify the molecular changes by traditional medicines, mostly acting as adaptive responses to render the host resistant to toxic stimuli, thus protecting against CCl 4-induced acute liver injury, or chronic alcohol-induced fatty liv- er, and so on, to provide pharmacological basis of their therapeutic effects.
