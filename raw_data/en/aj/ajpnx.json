Data from November 2020 Forecast. 3OVERVIEW OF COMMITTEE JURISDICTION | MINNESOTA HOUSE RESEARCH DEPARTMENTSubsidized Health Care Overview of Subsidized Coverage In Minnesota, persons with low to middle incomes can obtain subsidized health coverage through three main programs: MA, the state's Medicaid program, is administered by the state within broad federal guidelines. MinnesotaCare operates as a Basic Health Program under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). MNsure subsidies --premium tax credits and cost -sharing reductions for purchasing qualified health plans through the state's health insurance exchange. 4 OVERVIEW OF COMMITTEE JURISDICTION | MINNESOTA HOUSE RESEARCH DEPARTMENTSubsidized Health Care Continuum of Subsidized Coverage The programs provide a rough continuum of coverage for Minnesotans with low to middle incomes (up to 400% of the federal poverty guidelines --FPG). Adults without children/parents caretakers: 200% to 400% FPG). Covered services and enrollee costs will vary across the continuum. 5 OVERVIEW OF COMMITTEE JURISDICTION | MINNESOTA HOUSE RESEARCH DEPARTMENTMedical Assistance Overview MA is a jointly funded, federal -state program that pays for health care services provided to eligible low- income individuals. MA is the state's Medicaid program. Laws governing MA are found mainly in Chapter 256B of statute. Medicaid programs vary across states\u2014each state adopts its own operating and administrative standards, but must remain within the parameters of federal Medicaid law. 6 OVERVIEW OF COMMITTEE JURISDICTION | MINNESOTA HOUSE RESEARCH DEPARTMENTMedical Assistance Administration County agencies administer MA, under the supervision of DHS, and also determine eligibility for persons who are elderly, blind, or have disabilities using MAXIS, the state's legacy system. The Minnesota eligibility technology system (METS) is used by DHS and the counties to determine eligibility for families and children, and adults without children. 7 OVERVIEW OF COMMITTEE JURISDICTION | MINNESOTA HOUSE RESEARCH DEPARTMENTMedical Assistance Care Delivery DHS uses two systems to deliver services to MA enrollees: Under the fee- for-service system, enrollees can see any MA participating provider; DHS reimburses providers using fee schedules established by the agency; reimbursement reflects the volume of services. DHS also contracts with managed care and county -based purchasing plans, and provides these plans with a monthly capitation payment for each enrollee. Under managed care, enrollees are normally limited to seeing providers in a plan's network. 8 OVERVIEW OF COMMITTEE JURISDICTION | MINNESOTA HOUSE RESEARCH DEPARTMENTMedical Assistance Eligibility -Overview Main eligibility criteria: Belong to an eligible group Meet income and any applicable asset limits Be a US citizen, or a legal noncitizen who meets certain criteria MA also provides up to three months of retroactive coverage from the time of application, if the person would have been eligible in those months 9 OVERVIEW OF COMMITTEE JURISDICTION | MINNESOTA HOUSE RESEARCH DEPARTMENTMedical Assistance Eligibility -Major Groups Eligible MA coverage is available for all major groups of individuals: children, parents and caretakers, pregnant women, elderly, persons with disabilities, and adults without children. Adults without children with incomes up to 133% of FPG have been covered since January 1, 2014, under the ACA expansion option. 10 OVERVIEW OF COMMITTEE JURISDICTION | MINNESOTA HOUSE RESEARCH DEPARTMENTMedical Assistance Eligibility -COVID -19 MA coverage is available for uninsured individuals for testing and diagnosis of COVID -19 No income or asset requirements; individuals must be MN residents and US citizens or otherwise lawfully present 100% federal match and no copayments or deductibles Coverage applies for the duration of the federal public health emergency OVERVIEW OF COMMITTEE JURISDICTION | MINNESOTA HOUSE RESEARCH DEPARTMENT 11Medical Assistance Eligibility -Income Limits MA income limits vary by eligibility group and are set as a percentage of the federal poverty guidelines (FPG) Children under age 2: 283% FPG ($61,467 household of three) Children 2 through 18: 275% FPG ($59,730 household of three) 19 through 20: 133% Pregnant three) Aged, blind, of one) Adults without children: 133% FPG ($16,970 household of one) 12 OVERVIEW OF COMMITTEE JURISDICTION | MINNESOTA HOUSE RESEARCH DEPARTMENTMedical Assistance Eligibility -Income Methodology In determining income eligibility, the MA program excludes or disregards various types of income. The ACA requires states to use modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) for parents, children, pregnant women, and adults without children. Minnesota's existing income methodology (based on the federal Supplemental Security Income program) continues to apply to the elderly, disabled, and certain other groups. 13 OVERVIEW OF COMMITTEE JURISDICTION | MINNESOTA HOUSE RESEARCH DEPARTMENTMedical Assistance Eligibility - Spenddown Individuals with income above the program income limit can qualify by \"spending down\" \u2014by incurring medical bills in amounts equal to or greater than the amount of income in excess of the following spenddown limits: 133% FPG for families and children 81% FPG for aged, blind, and disabled (100% effective July 1, 2022) No spendddown option for adults without children 14 OVERVIEW OF COMMITTEE JURISDICTION | MINNESOTA HOUSE RESEARCH DEPARTMENTMedical Assistance Eligibility -Asset Standards Some enrollees must meet asset standards: Parents and caretakers on a spenddown: $10,000 for one and $20,000 for two or more in assets that are not excluded Elderly, blind, disabled: $3,000 for one/$6,000 for two or more in assets that are not excluded No asset limit for pregnant women, children, parents and caretakers not on a spenddown, and adults without children (ACA compliance). 15 OVERVIEW OF COMMITTEE JURISDICTION | MINNESOTA HOUSE RESEARCH DEPARTMENTMedical Assistance Covered Services MA covers all federally -mandated and most optional health care services. The MA benefit set tends to be comprehensive, compared to private sector coverage (e.g., MA usually covers a wider range of long- term care services). 16 OVERVIEW OF COMMITTEE JURISDICTION | MINNESOTA HOUSE RESEARCH DEPARTMENTMedical Assistance Enrollee Cost -sharing Cost-sharing under federal law must be \"nominal\" for most enrollees and total monthly cost- sharing cannot exceed 5% of income for persons with incomes at or below 100% of FPG. MA does not charge enrollee premiums. Certain services are subject to copayments and fee -for-service enrollees are subject to a family deductible. Children and pregnant women, and certain American Indians and Alaska natives, are among the groups exempt from cost- sharing. 17 OVERVIEW OF COMMITTEE JURISDICTION | MINNESOTA HOUSE RESEARCH DEPARTMENTMedical Assistance Financing MA is financed jointly by the state and federal government. Federal government provides a 50% match towards the cost of MA services; state general fund pays remaining 50% (there is a county- share for specified services). The federal Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) provides an enhanced match of 65% towards the cost of certain services. For newly eligible persons under the ACA Medicaid expansion (in MN, these are adults without children), 90% federal match. 18 OVERVIEW OF COMMITTEE JURISDICTION | MINNESOTA HOUSE RESEARCH DEPARTMENTMedical Assistance Financing -COVID -19 Federal Families First Coronavirus Response Act provides a 6.2 percentage point increase to each state's regular federal MA match Effective January 1, 2020, through the last day of the calendar quarter in which the federal public health emergency ends Maintenance of effort requirement tied to receipt of this federal funding OVERVIEW OF COMMITTEE JURISDICTION | MINNESOTA HOUSE RESEARCH DEPARTMENT 19Medical Assistance Managed Care --Enrollment A majority of MA enrollees receive covered services through HMOs and county -based purchasing plans. MA managed care enrollment (July 2020): 941,818 MA enrollees (July 2020): 1,119,244 Families and children, adults without children, and the elderly are required to enroll in managed care. Persons with disabilities may opt -out and remain in the fee -for-service system. 20 OVERVIEW OF COMMITTEE JURISDICTION | MINNESOTA HOUSE RESEARCH DEPARTMENTMedical Assistance Managed Care -Services and Payment Each plan must provide or arrange for most MA covered services, including up to 180 days of nursing facility services, and elderly waiver services. DHS pays each plan a capitation rate that varies with enrollee characteristics but otherwise is fixed -unlike fee -for-service, plan reimbursement does not increase as more services are provided. DHS withholds a portion of the capitation rate; some of this withhold is returned pending the plan meeting specified performance targets. Each plan determines its own provider network and sets its own provider payment rates. 21 OVERVIEW OF COMMITTEE JURISDICTION | MINNESOTA HOUSE RESEARCH DEPARTMENTMedical Assistance Managed Care --Procurement Since 2012, competitive bidding has been used in the metro -area counties to set rates for families and children and adults without children. 2016 enrollment reflects the results of the first statewide competitive bidding for this group. Rates for persons who are elderly or have disabilities are set through negotiation on an aggregate (not plan -specific) basis, based upon claims experience, trends in utilization, and other factors. DHS future plans for plan procurement are as follows: RFP issued in January 2021 to serve families and children in the metro area in 2022 RFP issued in October 2021 to serve elderly and persons with disabilities in 2023RFP issued in January 2022 to serve families and children in Greater MN in 2023 22 OVERVIEW OF COMMITTEE JURISDICTION | MINNESOTA HOUSE RESEARCH DEPARTMENTMedical Assistance Integrated Health Partnership Demonstration The IHP demonstration is a health care provider direct contracting program -DHS contracts with health care provider organizations (called integrated health partnerships) to provide services to MA and MinnesotaCare enrollees. The program operates in both the fee-for-service and managed care systems. The program uses a value -based payment model under which all IHPs receive population -based payments for care coordination. The larger, more integrated IHPs are paid under a risk/gain -sharing arrangement, under which the IHP shares in savings and losses relative to their total costs for a defined set of services, for enrollees who are attributed to the IHP . As of July 2020, 25 IHPs provided services to 428,664 state program enrollees (MA and MinnesotaCare ). 23 OVERVIEW OF COMMITTEE JURISDICTION | MINNESOTA HOUSE RESEARCH DEPARTMENTMedical Assistance Spending and Enrollment MA spending FY 2020 Total: $13.371 billion Federal: $7.817 billion State $4.710 billion MA enrollment FY 2020 1,078,321 average monthly enrollees 24 OVERVIEW OF COMMITTEE JURISDICTION | MINNESOTA HOUSE RESEARCH DEPARTMENTMA Enrollees and Expenditures 20.116.138.924.9 6.018.210.465.4 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70ElderlyAdults without ChildrenPersons with DisabilitiesChildren and Parents Share of Average Monthly Enrollment Share of Annual Expenditures Source: House Research. Data provided by DHS.FY 2020 Medical Assistance Enrollees and Expenditures by Enrollee Type 25 OVERVIEW OF COMMITTEE JURISDICTION | MINNESOTA HOUSE RESEARCH DEPARTMENTMinnesotaCare Overview MinnesotaCare is a jointly -funded, federal -state program that provides subsidized health coverage mainly to parents and caretakers and adults without children. Established by the legislature in 1992 as part of broader health care access legislation. MinnesotaCare laws are codified in Chapter 256L of Minnesota Statutes. Has operated as a basic health program under the ACA beginning January 1, 2015. 26 OVERVIEW OF COMMITTEE JURISDICTION | MINNESOTA HOUSE RESEARCH DEPARTMENTMinnesotaCare Administration Program is administered by the state through the DHS central office. DHS contracts with managed care and county- based purchasing plans to provide services to enrollees. The Minnesota Eligibility Technology System (METS)\u2014the system developed under MNsure \u2014is used to determine enrollee eligibility. 27 OVERVIEW OF COMMITTEE JURISDICTION | MINNESOTA HOUSE RESEARCH DEPARTMENTMinnesotaCare Eligibility --Overview Meet income limits No asset limit Meet requirements related to lack of access to health insurance, and not be MA eligible Be a Minnesota resident Be a citizen or legal noncitize n 28 OVERVIEW OF COMMITTEE JURISDICTION | MINNESOTA HOUSE RESEARCH DEPARTMENTMinnesotaCare Income Limits Eligibility is limited to persons with incomes greater than 133% but not exceeding 200% of FPG (the income limit for the basic health program under the ACA). Exceptions to income floor for certain groups and legal noncitizens. Those 133% FPG and under -MA coverage. Those with incomes greater than 200% FPG - may receive subsidized coverage through MNsure. 29 OVERVIEW OF COMMITTEE JURISDICTION | MINNESOTA HOUSE RESEARCH DEPARTMENTMinnesotaCare No Asset Limit Since January 1, 2014, there has been no asset limit for MinnesotaCare (ACA compliance for a basic health program). 30 OVERVIEW OF COMMITTEE JURISDICTION | MINNESOTA HOUSE RESEARCH DEPARTMENTMinnesotaCare Requirements Related to Lack of Insurance (Insurance Barriers) Since January 1, 2014, persons must not have minimum essential coverage. Since January 1, 2014, persons must not have access to subsidized coverage that is affordable (not more than 9.83% income for 2021) and provides minimum value (coverage at least 60% of medical expenses on average). 31 OVERVIEW OF COMMITTEE JURISDICTION | MINNESOTA HOUSE RESEARCH DEPARTMENTMinnesotaCare Not MA Eligible Since January 1, 2014, persons eligible for MA have not been eligible for MinnesotaCare (prior to this date, enrollees could choose either program if they were eligible). This has had the effect of shifting most children and pregnant women from MinnesotaCare to MA since the MA income limits for these groups are higher. 32 OVERVIEW OF COMMITTEE JURISDICTION | MINNESOTA HOUSE RESEARCH DEPARTMENTMinnesotaCare Covered Services The program has several benefit sets. Pregnant women and children have access to a broader range of services \u2014nearly all MA benefits \u2014 than adults who are not pregnant. Parents and adults without children are eligible for most MA services. These benefits meet the ACA requirement that a basic health program provide at least the essential health benefits. 33 OVERVIEW OF COMMITTEE JURISDICTION | MINNESOTA HOUSE RESEARCH DEPARTMENTMinnesotaCare Premiums MinnesotaCare enrollees age 21 and older pay per -person premiums based on a sliding scale; children are exempt. Persons with incomes below 35% of FPG pay no premiums. American Indians and Alaska natives are exempt. 34 OVERVIEW OF COMMITTEE JURISDICTION | MINNESOTA HOUSE RESEARCH DEPARTMENTMinnesotaCare Cost -sharing Various copayment and coinsurance requirements apply; pregnant women and children and American Indians and Alaska natives are exempt. Cost-sharing was increased effective January 1, 2016. DHS is required to adjust copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles to maintain the actuarial value at 94 percent. 35 OVERVIEW OF COMMITTEE JURISDICTION | MINNESOTA HOUSE RESEARCH DEPARTMENTMinnesotaCare Financing As a basic health program, the state receives from the federal government 95% of the value of premium tax credits and a portion of the value of cost-sharing reductions that would otherwise have been provided through MNsure . The state share is funded by a 1.8% tax on the gross revenues of health care providers and a 1% tax on nonprofit health plan premiums; money from these taxes is deposited into the Health Care Access Fund. The 2019 Legislature repealed a January 1, 2020, sunset for the provider tax, but reduced the rate from 2.0% to 1.8%. 36 OVERVIEW OF COMMITTEE JURISDICTION | MINNESOTA HOUSE RESEARCH DEPARTMENTMinnesotaCare Spending and Enrollment FY 2020 $30.8 million Average monthly enrollees: 77,832 37 OVERVIEW OF COMMITTEE JURISDICTION | MINNESOTA HOUSE RESEARCH DEPARTMENTHealth Care - MNsure Health Insurance Exchange MNsure was established as the state -run exchange by the 2013 Legislature. MNsure laws are codified in Minnesota Statutes, chapter 62V. The exchange assists individuals and families in selecting and purchasing health coverage, and also determines eligibility for premium tax credits and cost -sharing reductions. The exchange is also the common entry point for individuals to apply for health coverage from the private sector and from Medicaid and other public health care programs. 38 OVERVIEW OF COMMITTEE JURISDICTION | MINNESOTA HOUSE RESEARCH DEPARTMENTMNsure Subsidies Overview Federal government provides premium tax credits and insurers under the ACA are required to provide cost -sharing reductions for persons with low to moderate incomes who purchase coverage through MNsure, the state's health insurance exchange. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has not reimbursed health insurers for the cost of cost-sharing reduction since October 2017. 39 OVERVIEW OF COMMITTEE JURISDICTION | MINNESOTA HOUSE RESEARCH DEPARTMENTMNsure Subsidies Eligibility Meet general requirements for exchange coverage (citizen or legal noncitizen, not incarcerated). Income must be greater than 200% but not exceed 400% FPG (not exceed 250% for cost -sharing reductions). Not covered by Medicaid, Medicare, MinnesotaCare, employer coverage (unless coverage is unaffordable or provides less than 60% actuarial value), or other specified coverage. 40 OVERVIEW OF COMMITTEE JURISDICTION | MINNESOTA HOUSE RESEARCH DEPARTMENTMNsure Subsidies Essential Health Benefits Exchange plans must cover essential health benefits as defined by the ACA. The ACA requires essential health benefits to be similar to a typical employer health plan. The ACA requires the following categories to be covered: ambulatory patient services, emergency services, hospitalization, maternity and newborn care, mental health and substance abuse services, prescription drugs, rehabilitative and habilitative services, laboratory services, preventive and wellness and chronic disease management, and pediatric services (including oral and vision care). 41 OVERVIEW OF COMMITTEE JURISDICTION | MINNESOTA HOUSE RESEARCH DEPARTMENTMNsure Subsidies Premiums and Premium Tax Credits Enrollee is responsible for premiums of the policy chosen through the exchange, but may be eligible for premium tax credits. Premium tax credits: limit premium payments to a specified percentage of income, based on the cost of the second lowest cost silver plan. For 2021, premium tax credits limit enrollee premium costs to 6.52% of income (for persons with income just over 200% FPG) to 9.83% of income (at 400% FPG). 42 OVERVIEW OF COMMITTEE JURISDICTION | MINNESOTA HOUSE RESEARCH DEPARTMENTMNsure Subsidies Cost -sharing Subsidies Health insurers are required to provide cost -sharing subsidies to persons with incomes not exceeding 250% FPG, purchasing plans at the silver level only \u2014these increase the plan's actuarial value from 70% to 73% (sometimes achieved by reducing a plan's annual out -of-pocket limit). Insurers had been reimbursed by the federal government for the cost of providing cost -sharing reductions. The federal government decided in October 2017 to terminate these payments. 43 OVERVIEW OF COMMITTEE JURISDICTION | MINNESOTA HOUSE RESEARCH DEPARTMENTMNsure Subsidies Financing Federal government pays all of the cost of premium tax credits. MNsure enrollees received an estimated $220.2 million in premium tax credits for 2019 (Kaiser Foundation). Average monthly tax credit by household: $422/month (as of November 2020) 44 OVERVIEW OF COMMITTEE JURISDICTION | MINNESOTA HOUSE RESEARCH DEPARTMENTRegulation of Health Occupations Health -Related Professional Regulation Minnesota statutes provide that no occupation may be regulated by the state unless its regulation is required for the safety and well -being of Minnesotans. Health- related occupations are regulated by either MDH or one of the 17 health-related licensing boards. The state regulates at least 56 health- related occupations. Some health -related licensing boards regulate a single occupation, while others, like the Board of Medical Practice, regulate a range of related occupations. 45 OVERVIEW OF COMMITTEE JURISDICTION | MINNESOTA HOUSE RESEARCH DEPARTMENTRegulation of Health Occupations Health Licensing Boards Board of Behavioral Health and Therapy Board of Chiropractic Examiners Board of Dentistry Board of Dietetics and Nutrition Practice Emergency Medical Services Regulatory Board Board of Marriage and Family Therapy Board of Medical Practice Physicians and surgeons Acupuncturists Athletic trainers Genetic counselors Naturopathic doctors Traditional midwivesRespiratory therapists Physician assistants Board of Nursing Board of Executives for Long Term Services and Supports Board of Occupational Therapy Board of Optometry Board of Pharmacy Board of Physical Therapy Board of Podiatric Medicine Board of Psychology Board of Social Work Board of Veterinary Medicine 46 OVERVIEW OF COMMITTEE JURISDICTION | MINNESOTA HOUSE RESEARCH DEPARTMENTRegulation of Health Occupations MDH Regulated Occupations Allied Health Professionals Environmental Health ProfessionalsUnlicensed Complementary & Alternative Health Care Practitioners Speech- language pathologists Lead workers Culturally traditional healing practices Audiologists Asbestos workers Aroma therapy Body art technicians Environmental health specialists/sanitariansMeditation Mortuary science practitioners Food managers Massage therapy Doulas Water supply system operators Mind -body healing practices Nursing assistants Wells and borings contractors Acupressure Hearing instrument dispensers Pool operators 47 OVERVIEW OF COMMITTEE JURISDICTION | MINNESOTA HOUSE RESEARCH DEPARTMENT0.3%1.7%5.4%10.0%7.5%11.3%19%45.1% of Total Department Programs and Activities Source: Data from FY 2022-23 Agency Base Budget Books. 48 OVERVIEW OF COMMITTEE JURISDICTION | MINNESOTA HOUSE RESEARCH DEPARTMENTDepartment of Health Budget by Fund, FY 2022 -23 Combined Fund Balances: $1.4 BillionHealth Department Programs and Activities Three broad categories of activities: Public Health Health Care Regulation Health Care Reform 49 OVERVIEW OF COMMITTEE JURISDICTION | MINNESOTA HOUSE RESEARCH DEPARTMENTHealth Department Programs and Activities Public Health: activities to protect and promote the health of people and communities by preventing people from becoming sick or injured, promoting wellness, tracking disease outbreaks, educating people about health risks, and compiling health statistics.
