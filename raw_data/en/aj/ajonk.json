However, some of the herbal medicines are adulterated to increase their effectiveness. Some of the herbal preparations are contaminated with corticosteroids during its handling. Some topical herbal creams for example containing 0.75mg dexamethasone acetate (a corticosteroid) would lead to suppression of the adrenal glands and steroid toxicity. Adrenal glands produce most of the hormones in the body including steroid hormones, mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids and androgens. Some herbal preparations containing estrogen-like (a female hormone) substances may lead to enlarged man's breasts (gynaecomastia). Some herbal medicines containing steroids may suppress the immune system, causing recurrent infections2. In conclusion, it is important to let your dentists know that you are taking herbal medicines or any supplements. The dentists will be able to check for the drug interactions and watch for any adverse effects to your oral tissues. References - Abebe W. (2003).
