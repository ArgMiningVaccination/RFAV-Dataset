While the pandemic has dominated news headlines since early 2020, the pressing needs of other important health issues haven't stopped. Your efforts have allowed us to continue advancing the most promising research in neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, cardiology, and more. As you know, UT Southwestern health car e providers work tirelessly to treat those who come to us for help, whether impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic or by other health con- cerns. At the same time, our researchers are investigating new approaches to treating diseases beyond what's possible today. Taking on the greatest challenges in medicine is what our clinicians and scientists do best. In this second issue of Pathways, you will learn more about one of our leading strategic priorities: combating brain diseases. Under the leadership of supporter and friend Robert B. Rowling, there has been significant momentum in an ambitious effort to raise $500 million in philanthropic support for the Campaign for the Brain benefiting the Peter O'Donnell Jr. Brain Institute. UTSW also is investing $500 million in the O'Donnell Brain Institute for a $1 billion total initiative. We have surpassed our goal, thanks to the generosity of friends like you, and we are grateful for these gifts of every size that collectively are having an extraordinary impact. Also in this issue, you'll read about Nader Pouratian, M.D., Ph.D., the new Chair of Neurological Surgery, who specializes in innovative surgical care for depression, blindness, and movement disorders. Dr. Pouratian holds the Lois C.A. and Darwin E. Smith Distinguished Chair in Neurological Surgery and is among the many top specialists whom we've been able to recruit to our institution who treat both pervasive and rare diseases. With your help, our reputation as a leading academic medical center has enabled us to build upon this foundation of excellence. I also want to highlight the work of the Hematologic Malignancies and Bone Marrow Transplantation Program led by Robert H. Collins Jr., M.D., and his team. This program has developed a reputation for both exemplary patient care and groundbreaking research - including an exciting development involving CAR T-cell therapy, a type of immunotherapy that is used to treat leukemia and lymphoma. It actually enhances the ability of a patient's immune system to attack cancer cells, and UTSW was the first in Texas to offer CAR T-cell therapy to treat advanced cancer. As you can see, beyond innovative COVID-19 care and resear ch, lifesaving work continues unabated at UTSW, furthered through your commitment to accelerate our progress. UT Southwestern would not be where it is today without the generosity and philanthropic spirit of our supporters. We are grateful for each of you who work alongside us in delivering on our three-part mission as a premier academic medical center. Marc A. Nivet, Ed.D., MBA Executive Vice President for Institutional Advancement UT Southwestern Medical CenterSaving Lives in Challenging Times 8 Hope for Long-Haulers As COVID-19 continues to impact communities around the world, patients' ongoing symptoms reminded UT Southwestern physicians of another disease, sparking ideas for new research and innovative treatments.THE POWER OF PHILANTHROPY 3 PATHWAYS FALL 2021 2NEWS Around Campus New Vice Provost and Dean of Basic Research Joins UTSW On July 1, Joan Conaway, Ph.D., began her appoint- ment as the new Vice Provost and Dean of Basic Research. Dr. Conaway, who holds the Cecil H. Green Distinguished Chair in Cellular and Molecular Biology, is known for discoveries that reveal the roles of proteins that work with RNA polymerase II, the multiprotein complex that transcribes DNA into RNA precursors. Formerly with the Stowers Institute for Medical Research in Kansas City, Missouri, Dr. Conaway plans to build on UT Southwestern's legacy of research excellence, growing areas such as bioinformatics, as well as expand faculty and staff diversity at all levels of basic science. Moncrief Cancer Institute in Fort Worth Opens Clinic for Cancer Survivors UT Southwestern's Moncrief Cancer Institute is helping people get back to living through its new Primary Care Clinic for Cancer Survivors. Staffed by three UT Southwestern family medicine physicians and a certified physician assistant, the clinic helps improve the quality of life for cancer survivors by optimizing control of chronic medical conditions, providing emotional support, and addressing long-term or late effects from cancer treatment. Through the clinic's partnership with the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center, cancer survivors can access one-on-one consultations with a specialized fitness trainer, dietitian, genetic counselor, social worker, clinical psychologist, and referrals for specialty care. The overarching goal of the Primary Care Clinic team is to help survivors stay strong in their fight against the disease by providing tools to survive and thrive. UT Southwestern's Moncrief Cancer Institute (opposite) celebrated the opening of a new Primary Care Clinic for Cancer Survivors (above).Joan Conaway, Ph.D. 5 PATHWAYS 4 FALL 2021Nader Pouratian, M.D., Ph.D., a neurosurgeon known for innovative surgical care for depression, blindness, and movement disorders, joined UT Southwestern in April as Chair of Neurological Surgery. In his new role, Dr. Pouratian hopes to develop new treatment options for patients under the umbrella of the Peter O'Donnell Jr. Brain Institute. Dr. Pouratian previously served at UCLA's David Geffen School of Medicine as Professor and Vice Chair of Academic Affairs in the Department of Neurosurgery, with additional appointments and affiliations in Neu- roscience, Bioengineering, and Radiation Oncology. His clinical practice focuses on surgical treatments for movement disorders, psychiatric disease, facial pain, and chronic pain syndromes, using modern techniques such as brain and spinal cord stimulation, radiosurgery, microsurgery, and targeted ablation. Why did you decide to join UT Southwestern? Most of all it was the vision of UT Southwestern and its leadership to continue to transform and evolve as a leader in academic medicine. At the O'Donnell Brain Institute, human neuroscience is a high priority and a major area of investment. Building bridges between basic sciences and human neuroscience is a big part of the vision, which was attractive to me. What are some areas of special interest for you? My passion has been at the intersection of neurological care, engineering, and technology, with a focus on developing new therapies - including for patients whom we have not traditionally cared for with neurosurgical therapies. I am currently involved in a clinical trial treat- ing a small number of patients with complete blindness using a specially designed device that is implanted in the patient's brain. Together with a California company that I also consult for, Second Sight Medical Products Inc.,we received National Institutes of Health funding to develop and test the device. Our preliminary investiga- tions have revealed positive results, allowing people with complete blindness to see patterns of flashing lights that they are learning to interpret and decode. This trial began when I was at UCLA, and I am hoping to continue this clinical research soon at UT Southwestern as well. Another area of interest is the treatment of patients with treatment-resistant major depression. Our approach is to put stimulators in precise areas of the brain, using advanced neurosurgical techniques. By stimulating those areas of the brain that are critically related to depression, we aim to make those brain networks function more normally and help people with depression. What areas do you want to focus on as the new Chair? One of the newest and most innovative technologies we have at UT Southwestern is focused ultrasound. This technology uses precisely targeted ultrasonic energy to treat or destroy tissue inside the body without the need to make an incision. The FDA has approved this tech- nology for treating essential tremor and tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease. Beyond treating movement disor - ders, we are excited to collaborate with our partners in radiology to explore even more innovative applications. Dr. Pouratian holds the Lois C.A. and Darwin E. Smith Distinguished Chair in Neurological Surgery.LEADERSHIP Q&A LEGISLATIVE UPDATE State Approves School of Public Health, Psychiatric Hospital, and Performance- Based Funding for Research During the state's 87th Legislative Session, UT South- western advanced three priorities on behalf of the patients, students, and communities we serve. An insti- tution-specific research operations formula pilot designed to deliver performance-based funding was made permanent, providing a more predictable long-term mechanism for UTSW to secure adequate state support to continue growing our leading-edge biomedical research enterprise. In addition, the Legislature endorsed a new School of Public Health and provided $10 million in initial funding. Finally, UTSW partnered with the Texas Health & Human Services Commission to secure ap- proval and funding to develop plans and purchase land for the first state psychiatric hospital in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. The new psychiatric hospital will help meet the acute and growing need for inpatient mental health services across North Texas. UT Southwestern Graduates Celebrate Commencement In May, nearly 300 graduates of UT Southwestern's Med- ical School and Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences celebrated earning their degrees. Students returned to campus for in-person commencement ceremonies for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic caused can- cellation of on-site graduations in 2020. UTSW medical students consistently match for residencies at some of the top-ranked medical programs in the nation, while UT Southwestern is ranked among the top 20 graduate schools for biological sciences by U.S. News & World Report. In December 2020, the largest class of UTSW School of Health Professions students to date - nearly 150 - celebrated their graduation in a virtual ceremony.Academic Endowment Appointments Congratulations to UT Southwestern's newly named endowment holders for their outstanding leadership on campus and in their fields.

UT South- western remains committed to the cause, with a new School of Public Health in the works to enable scientists to pioneer more research, deploy knowledge in the field, and educate a strong pipeline of leaders with a wide range of training and specialization. \"Medicine and public health are two sides of the same coin,\" said Celette Sugg Skinner, Ph.D., Professor and Chair of the Department of Population and Data Science at UTSW and Interim Dean for the School of Public Health.\"In medicine, we teach doctors how to care for people and cure their illnesses. Public health focuses on the health of entire communities and populations and how to prevent people from getting sick in the first place through development and dissemination of programs and policies that are implemented on a broad scale. UTSW has been doing both, but with the School of Public Health, we can add faculty members, advance discovery, train more leaders to promote health and reduce disease, and have a greater impact on the rapidly growing North Texas community.\" 9 PATHWAYS 8 FALL 2021Improving the health of Texas communities UTSW has a successful history of addressing public health issues, working with local safety-net systems, community organizations, and public health departments. Our faculty transform lives, informing and influencing everything from individual habits to health care systems and government policies. Among numerous efforts, we have: Expanded effective health screening programs into more than 35 North Texas countiesDirected food referrals to people with nutrition-related conditions living in communities of food insecurityIncreased HPV vaccination among adolescents and cancer screening for adultsDeveloped a COVID-19 forecasting model\" As the first new school at UT Southwestern in more than 50 years, the School of Public Health represents an exciting chapter in the history of our institution and with the opportunity it provides to improve the health and well-being of communities of North Texas and beyond . The pandemic, as the latest in many challenges to public health, has underscored the need to develop science-based interventions as well as the need for an expanded public health work- force in Texas. In drawing on our nearly 80 years of experience in scientific discovery and research, teaching, and clinical care, we hope to help address this gap by training a new generation of public health advocates, leaders, and practitioners who are equipped to solve wide-scale health problems and respond to public health emergencies when t h e y a r i s e .\" The School, approved earlier this year by the UT Board of Regents, is set to open in two years on the Dallas campus. Plans are underway to welcome the first class of Master of Public Health students in the fall of 2023 and Ph.D. students in the fall of 2024. The state of Texas provided $10 million in startup funds to support the new School with a requirement that UT Southwestern match these funds 2:1 with private contributions. Philanthropy will be critical in enabling faculty recruitment, supporting student scholarships, and advancing promising research. Public health needs are tremendous in T exas, where there is a serious shortage of workers for this field. Public health approaches are used to address our most challenging problems - including pandemics, poverty, and failing health systems - that make it difficult for people to access affordable medical treatments and preventive care. Because public health is a broad field, graduates of the School will be able to pursue careers in areas including government, health care systems, nonprofit organizations, and private industry. \"What sets UTSW apart is our close relationship with big health systems and with community organizations that serve our areas,\" Dr. Skinner said. \"The new School will be research intensive and will generate evidence about what works with large groups of patients and what can be implemented on a large scale across systems that benefit the citizens of Dallas, the U.S., and the world.\" Dr. Podolsky holds the Philip O'Bryan Montgomery, Jr., M.D. Distinguished Presidential Chair in Academic Administration, and the Doris and Bryan Wildenthal Distinguished Chair in Medical Science. Dr. Skinner holds the Parkland Community Medicine Professorship. Celette Sugg Skinner, Ph.D. By analyzing data gathered through the DFW COVID-19 Prevalence Study and other efforts, UT Southwestern led North Texas' public health response to the pandemic. \u2014 Dr. Daniel K. Podolsky President, UT Southwestern 11 PATHWAYS 10 FALL 2021Stephen Lummus knew he was putting himself at risk when he went to New York last year to help beleaguered hospital workers during the COVID-19 surge. \"This could be the last time you see your family,\" he remembered thinking. The 58-year-old physician assistant survived his April 2020 trip to the Northeast. He also survived when, after returning to the Dallas area, he caught the virus that causes COVID-19 in December while working long hours testing patients for COVID-19 at urgent care facilities in North Texas. But in many ways, the worst began after he \"recovered\" at home fr om COVID-19. Mr. Lummus - like hundreds of others who have sought treatment at UT Southwestern - discovered symptoms can linger for months after the virus abates. Last winter, two weeks after he thought he had beaten COVID-19 by quarantining at home, a flare-up came with mental fog, shortness of breath, and unbearable fatigue that finally put him in the hospital.As researchers explore the connection between post-COVID symptoms and autonomic disorders, philanthropy is supporting the search By Carol Marie Cropper and Andrew MartonoH pefor Long-Haulers 13 PATHWAYS 12 FALL 2021Caroline Barker On March 18, 2020, Caroline Barker woke up with a burning fever, sore throat, and draining fatigue, all hall- marks of COVID-19. \"I looked totally gray. My fever lasted more than six weeks,\" she said. After recovering, her fatigue, heart rate issues, and pain persisted. She was a COVID-19 long-hauler. Seven months later, a new symp - tom emerged. Whenever she stood, her heart rate skyrocketed, making it difficult to walk. She often had to lie down to avoid fainting. At UT Southwestern Medical Center, Ms. Parker was diagnosed with POTS syndrome by Meredith Bryarly, M.D., an Assistant Professor of Neurology who specializes in neurology, neuromuscular disorders, and autonomic disorders at the Peter O'Donnell Jr. Brain Institute. POTS affects the autonomic nervous system, which regulates bodily functions people don't consciously control, such as heart rate, blood pressure, sweating, and body temperature. \"POTS worsened my other long- haul COVID symptoms of brain fog, muscle spasms, stabbing nerve pain, and digestive problems. I felt nauseous just eating,\" Ms. Barker said. \"I became bedridden. It was not fun.\" People living with POTS often have lower levels of physical fitness, and their hearts pump less blood with each heartbeat. To strengthen the heart muscle, UT Southwestern cardiologist and Professor of Internal Medicine Benjamin Levine, M.D., pioneered the Levine Protocol, a three-month exercise program spe- cifically designed for POTS patients. In addition to taking medication and wearing compression socks to improve blood circulation, Ms. Barker followed the Levine Protocol. Today, she's strong enough to com- plete 40 minutes of daily swimming, rowing, or treadmill walking. \"This therapy is so meaningful to me as I was severely limited before,\" Ms. Barker said. \"To gain some of my freedom back is enormous for me - like a gift, really. I never valued my body as much as I do now.\" Dr. Levine holds the Distinguished Professorship in Exercise Sciences. According to Surendra Barshikar, M.D., Vice Chair and Associate Professor of Physical Medicine and Rehabil- itation, who directs UTSW's COVID Recover program, perhaps 20% to 30% of COVID-19 patients experience such aftereffects - a problem referred to as \"long-haul,\" \"long,\" or post-acute COVID if symptoms linger for four weeks or more following the initial infection. The UTSW program is thought to be the first and still one of just a few such programs in North Texas. Understanding why some patients experience post- acute COVID symptoms is challenging, but physicians have noted similarities between post-COVID syndrome and the symptoms associated with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, a disorder also known as POTS. Impacting an estimated 500,000 patients nationwide, POTS affects the body's autonomic nervous system, which regulates internal organ functions such as heart rate, blood pressure, digestion, and body temperature. POTS is among the most common type of autonomic disorders affecting younger patients, particularly women between 18 and 30 years of age. \"For many patients with POTS, it can be difficult to identify the cause of their condition. But our existing research in autonomic disorders gives UT Southwestern a critical advan- tage to learn from patients recovering from COVID-19 who are experiencing 'long haul' symp- toms and may give new insights for patients strug- gling with POTS,\" said Steven Vernino, M.D., Ph.D., Professor and Vice Chair for Education & Faculty Affairs in the Department of Neurology at UT Southwestern. A recent anonymous gift of $1 million is being used to create a new endowment to support expansion of UT Southwestern's research into autonomic disorders. \"Whether it is to support the time of one of our team members, or to invest in lab equipment, philanthropy helps us improve the quality of our research output as we become a nationally recognized center of excellence in autonomic disorders,\" said Dr. Vernino, who is regard- ed as the institution's leading researcher of autonomic disorders. \"So much of our success in early stage POTS research can be traced back to the generous support of our community.\" Dr. Vernino is also the Director of the Clinical Autonomic Disor - ders Program and the Autonomic Disorders Fellowship Program. He holds the Rex Griswold Distinguished Professorship in Multi- ple System Atrophy and the Dr. Bob and Jean Smith Foundation Distinguished Chair in Neuromuscular Disease Research. Steve Vernino, M.D., Ph.D. Surendra Barshikar, M.D.Stephen Lummus works with a physical therapist at UT Southwestern while recovering from post-acute COVID. Philanthropy helps us improve the quality of our research output. After COVID-19, Taking on POTS 15 PATHWAYS 14 FALL 2021Dallas insurance broker and investor Ronnie Cathey, giving to UT Southwest- ern Medical Center is a simple act of helping others who are struggling. \"I've been blessed in so many ways. I had a pretty tough life growing up, but I wouldn't trade it for any- thing,\" he said, adding that \"God's blessings have allowed us to do this.\" Mr. Cathey understands challenges. A few years ago, he was diagnosed with kidney cancer and received treatment at UT Southwestern. As a survivor, he knows firsthand the profound anxiety that accompanies a cancer diagnosis. He also knows about the challenges of paying for cancer-related expenses such as drug treatments, doctors' visits, imaging services, and other nonmedical costs. \"Without the amazing care I got from UT Southwestern, I wouldn't be here,\" he said. \"So, my feeling was I really wanted to help others.\" While watching the news one night, Mr. Cathey found his opportunity. An emotional report on NBC 5 DFW told the story of a Southern Methodist University assistant football coach stricken by cancer who also was losing the financial battle against the disease. \"I called up the coach's wife and told her we'd be happy to help any way we could,\" Mr. Cathey said. \"Then I also called UT Southwestern to find out how I could assist their cancer patients with whatever I could offer.\" His empathy-driven generosity led to the creation of what he refers to as a Helping Hearts Fund that supports the everyday needs of cancer patients at UT Southwestern's Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center. Because he's navigated cancer treatment, Mr. Cathey understands the maze of obstacles patients face. He knows nonmedical costs pile up, from the price of high-calorie shakes needed to offset cancer-related weight loss to the expenses of living at a hotel for out-of-town patients who don't live near a treatment center. \"Those are the kind of worries you don't need when you are going through cancer treatment,\" he said. \"My goal is to take those little worries away.\" As the only National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer center in North Texas, the Simmons Cancer Center is a leader in cancer care and prevention. Mr. Cathey's gift benefits the Center's Support Services team that includes social workers, dietitians, and other care profession als who approach a cancer pa- tient's nonmed- ical care holisti- cally. In addition to providing patient services that include stress-reducing music therapy or muscle-relaxing yoga, the team helps pa- tients in need with everyday essentials such as groceries, temporary housing, or travel expenses for treatment. \"We are grateful to Mr. Cathey because he knows intimately what patients experience,\" said Alexandra Huffman, Manager of Support Services at the Simmons Cancer Center. \"To have such an empathetic donor who opens his heart in this way - frankly it's quite unique.\" Ronnie Cathey's Helping Hearts Fund aids patients facing cancer costs Alexandra Huffman Ronnie Cathey By Andrew MartonAll HeartMy goal is to take those little worries away.FOR 17 PATHWAYSThe UT Southwestern community has witnessed a tremendous spirit of giving in North Texas since launch- ing the Campaign for the Brain in 2015. Robert B. \"Bob\" Rowling, a visionary leader and loyal friend of UT South- western Medical Center and Southwestern Medical Foundation, is among those who inspire greatness in community service and has proved time and again that when people work together, anything is possible. As Chair of the Campaign for the Brain Steering Committee, Mr. Rowling led efforts to raise $500 million in philanthropic support for the Peter O'Donnell Jr. Brain Institute, which will be matched with $500 million from UT Southwestern for a total philan- thropic impact of $1 billion. Lead gifts from many area philanthropists enabled foundational investments in research infrastructure, bioinformatics, and brain imaging that have already led to exciting breakthroughs. Thanks to Mr. Rowling's leadership, the determination and dedication of the Campaign for the Brain Steering Committee members, and the incredible generosity of the philanthropic community, UT Southwestern has surpassed the campaign's $500 million goal. Bob Rowling leads Campaign for the Brain efforts CHANGING LIVES , INSPIRING HOPE By Sharon Reynolds Mr. Rowling, with his wife Terry by his side, have shown how heartfelt passion can lead to success. Their extraordinary contributions have brought life-changing breakthroughs in health care to North Texas and beyond. Their previous $5 million contribution to support the Building the Future of Medicine campaign helped build William P . Clements Jr. University Hospital, a gift they made because they knew how important the new hospital would be to advancing care in the community. Their latest gift of $25 million to Southwestern Medical Foundation (SWMF) boosted the Campaign for the Brain and set an example for others to help change the future of medicine.Supported by a generous campaign gift from Terry and Robert B. \"Bob\" Rowling, the new Brain Research Tower will expand research space for the O'Donnell Brain Institute and is scheduled to open in summer 2022. 18 FALL 2021 19 PATHW AYSFrom the outset of the Campaign for the Brain, Peter O'Donnell Jr.'s urgency was clear. \"We need discovery, and it can't be done on just wishing it's going to happen - you've got to make it happen,\" he said. Such relentless drive and clarion vision for philanthropy's transforma- tive potential were hallmarks of the O'Donnell Brain Institute's name- sake, who passed away in October at age 97. Recognizing brain injury as one of the greatest challenges of our time, Mr. O'Donnell committed $36 million in 2015 to create an institute dedicated to unraveling the brain's mysteries. The gift capped a remark- able 40-year partnership between Mr. O'Donnell and UT Southwestern. Over decades, his generosity ad- vanced key discoveries that expand- ed our understanding of nutrition's role in preventing and treating chron- ic conditions; enabled UT South- western to become one of the first institutions to implement electronic medical records for inpatient and outpatient care; and invested in the brilliant research of the institution's Nobel Laureates. Over a lifetime of inspired gener - osity, Mr. O'Donnell and his late wife, Edith, contributed more than $300 million to UT Southwestern through personal gifts and gifts from the O'Donnell Foundation, which they established. These gifts, almost all made anonymously, transformed the Medical Center into an international- ly recognized research leader. \"Excellence was a watchword for Mr. O'Donnell in everything he did and touched. He was a giant of our institution and a quiet driving force in advancing medical science,\" said Daniel K. Podolsky, M.D., President of UT Southwestern. \"The scope and depth of ways in which he advanced the work of the Medical Center is truly remarkable. He will be deeply missed.\"Campaign for the Brain Steering Committee Mary McDermott Cook Harlan R. Crow Robert H. Dedman Jr. Kathleen M. Gibson Nancy S. Halbreich Linda W. Hart Frederick B.

We all have a stake in this,\" Mr. Rowling said. \"I am honored to stand alongside so many committed leaders who share Terry's and my vision of making North Texas and the O'Donnell Brain Institute the epicenter of brain discovery.\" \"Bob has left his impact on UT Southwestern through his leadership as past Vice Chair of the UT Board of Regents and Chair of the Southwestern Medical Foun- dation - encouraging and supporting our most important initiatives so that our institution can better deliver on our mission,\" said Daniel K. Podolsky, M.D., President of UT Southwestern. \"It was no surprise that Bob didn't hesitate when asked to lead the Campaign for the Brain, knowing how important it was for the future of UT Southwestern and even more importantly, for the futures of the millions upon millions of patients suffering from diseases of the brain. Bob and Terry have led by example with their extraordinary generosity, galvanizing our efforts to ultimately achieve a brighter future through research and compassionate, innovative care.\" Investing in UTSW's future The Rowlings met while attending The University of Texas at Austin and later married. Mr. Rowling founded Dallas-based TRT Holdings in 1989, and after moving to Dallas, the couple was inspired by the kindness of a community where people showed deep concern for one another and worked to make life better for others through volunteerism and public service. They had found their perfect home - a place to do business, raise their two sons, and invest their philanthropic energies. It was through Mr. Rowling' s service on The University of Texas System Board of Regents that he learned about UTSW and was drawn to its life-changing mission. Everyone wanted to see UTSW grow and prosper, he said, which was transformational for him to watch. He joined Southwestern Medical Foundation's Board of Trustees in 2010 and completed a five-year term as Chairman. He also serves as a member of UT South- western's President's Advisory Board. \"The research happening at UT Southwestern is not just good for Dallas or Texas,\" Mr. Rowling said, \"what's coming out of here is good for the world.\" In 2013, Southwestern Medical Foundation present - ed the Rowlings with The Sprague Award, the region's most prestigious award for philanthropy in health care. The award was established in 1991 and later renamed in 1996 in honor of the late Charles Cameron Sprague, M.D., former President of UTSW and later SWMF . As a strong visionary, Mr. Rowling sees great possibili - ties in the next generation. He is a strong supporter of The Cary Council, a local young leaders' group driving broader awareness of the missions of UTSW and SWMF and raising funds in support of researchers who are in the early stages of their careers. Through his involvement, Mr. Rowling continues to encourage tomorrow's leaders to get involved now in the needs of their communities. The Rowlings' deep connection to their faith inspires them to give back. \"There are two things that drive me - to love God and to love others,\" Mr. Rowling said. \"This gift is a way for Terry and me to love others. We really see ourselves as stewards of everything we have and are always looking for the best way to use our resources to make an impact.\" Dr. Podolsky holds the Philip O'Bryan Montgomery, Jr., M.D. Distinguished Presidential Chair in Academic Administration, and the Doris and Bryan Wildenthal Distinguished Chair in Medical Science. Terry and Robert B. \"Bob\" Rowling Edith and Peter O'Donnell Jr.\" 21 PATHWAYS 20 FALL 2021CommunityPartnership andEngagementAnOpportunity to everal Southwestern Medical Foundation Trust- ees have helped to enable tremendous progress through their participation in the Campaign for the Brain Steering Committee, chaired by Robert B. \"Bob\" Rowling, immediate Past Chair of Southwestern Medical Foundation. In 2015, during the celebration of the Foundation's 75th Anniversary, the Foundation pre- sented a gift of $7.5 million to support the Campaign. Campaign leaders anticipated moving from a quiet phase to a public phase in 2020, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Steering Committee recognized the need to pause the decision to go public in light of the issues and challenges facing our community. In 2021, the Foundation met with Trustees to discuss priorities for the Peter O'Donnell Jr. Brain Institute - real- izing that a matching gift challenge would be important to broadening support from additional donors to close the gaps not yet funded. Trustees were receptive to the needs of UT Southwestern and enthusiastically approved using both the $7.5 million original campaign gift plus an additional $5 million gift for matching funds to encourage an additional $12.5 million in donor participation and gifts to complete the campaign. These collective gifts will add $25 million in value and move the community closer to meeting the important needs of the O'Donnell Brain Institute. When the late Peter and Edith O'Donnell launched the bold and worthy vision of the Peter O'Donnell Jr. Brain Institute in 2015, numerous other leaders were eager to join this new wave of generosity and assure that the O'Donnell Brain Institute's mission would become a reality. Southwestern Medical Foundation's matching gift challenge amplifies giving to Campaign for the Brain \"During the Campaign for the Brain, donors have been helping to bring tremendous talent to Dallas,\" said James R. Huffines, Chairman of Southwestern Medical Foundation. \"It is very moving to see what is being accomplished already by new collaborations, facilities, and technologies at work and as part of the O'Donnell Brain Institute.

Behind the scenes, one of the nation's top transplant programs relies on a different kind of donation to fund the research that keeps it on the leading edge. Recognized for its pioneering work and record of success, UT Southwestern Medical Center's Hemato- logic Malignancies and Bone Marrow Transplantation Program has a reputation for excellent patient care and groundbreaking research. To date, physicians affiliated with the Program have performed more than 1,800 bone marrow transplants, achieving the leading survival rate for adult bone marrow transplants in Texas. Robert H. Collins Jr., M.D., a Professor of Inter nal Medicine at UT Southwestern who directs the Program, credits the institution's community of supporters with enabling his team to make a difference in patients' lives. \"I feel a tremendous sense of gratitude to our philanthropic supporters who make it possible for us to give outstanding personalized, targeted cancer therapy,\" he said. The program is part of the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center, the only National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer center in North Texas. UT Southwestern is one of nine U.S. hospitals participating in the most advanced phases of clinical trials of using CAR T-cell therapy to treat multiple myeloma. A form of immunotherapy that can also help treat leukemia and lymphoma, CAR T-cell therapy adapts a patient's T-cells, a type of white blood cell, to bind to specific proteins on cancer cells. This reprograms the T-cells to recognize and attack the patient's cancer. Leading this research is Larry Anderson Jr ., M.D., Ph.D., a senior member of Dr. Collins' team and an Associate Professor of Internal Medicine. Dr. Anderson echoed his colleague's thoughts on the impact of philanthropy. \"We wouldn't be able to fully support our clinical trial program without this generous support,\" said Dr. Anderson, who is also Director of the Myeloma, Waldenstrom's, and Amyloidosis Program. Dr. Collins holds the Sydney and J.L. Huffines Distinguished Chair in Cancer Research in Honor of Eugene Frenkel, M.D., and the H. Lloyd and Willye V . Skaggs Professorship in Medical Research. Longtime donor Sue Siddons DuVall often thinks about the impact of UT Southwestern. But when she made her most recent gift of $250,000 to support Dr. Collins' leukemia research, she had a special group of people in mind. \"Recently, three of my friends faced the daunting challenge of a cancer diagnosis,\" said Mrs. DuVall, who gave in their honor. \"However, when I heard that they were being cared for at UT Southwestern by Dr. Collins and Dr. Anderson, I knew they were in the best of hands.\" Currently undergoing treatment at UT Southwestern, Roland Bandy and his family credited the success of his care to Dr. Anderson's blood cancer research. Through the Bandy Family Fund, the Dallas-based real estate investor and his family expressed their gratitude with $125,000 in gifts to sup - port the work that positively impacts so many lives. \"I have been a patient of Dr. Anderson's for more than 18 months, and I have come to understand that Dr. 'A' is not only a brilliant doctor, but he cares deeply for his patients,\" Mr. Bandy said.Synonymous with men's clothing, the name Haggar also represents an enduring legacy of giving to UT Southwestern. With its recent donation, the J.M. Haggar Jr. Family Foundation continued i ts generosity by supporting Dr. Anderson's multiple myeloma research. \"Dr. Anderson is a brilliant man,\" said Joe Haggar III, whose grandfather founded the name- sake clothing company. \"He is calm, positive, and always gives you hope concerning the disease for which he is treating you. We all assume multiple myeloma is undefeated, but Dr. Anderson is taking it into overtime. He has saved and prolonged many lives.\"For her friendsGiven with gratitudeA family legacy Sue Siddons DuVall Joe Haggar III Roland Bandy and his wife, Mary L.

The honorific adorns a new endowed professorship at UT Southwestern Medical Center. It's a tribute from Dr. Mize's longtime friend and founder of The Wyss Medical Foundation, Swiss philanthropist, Hansjorg Wyss. \"Throughout his career, Dr. Roby Mize - a brilliant surgeon, compassionate physician, and dedicated educator - has demonstrated the difference exemplary surgeons make in both the lives of their patients and the physicians they train,\" said Mr. Wyss. \"The Wyss Medical Foundation is proud to devote its first gift to UT Southwestern to support their Orthopaedic Trauma Education and Management Program and establish the Dr. Roby Mize Distinguished Professorship in Orthopaedic Trauma Surgery.\" The Wyss Medical Foundation's $850,000 commit- ment will establish a Distinguished Professorship to support the efforts of an exceptional trauma surgeon and will also enhance the Orthopaedic Trauma Education and Management Program by underwriting a symposium, a visiting professorship, and training opportunities for students. Dr. Mize's friendship with Mr. Wyss began during his postdoctoral fel- lowship at Oxford University, where he met Martin Allgower, M.D., then Professor and Chairman of Surgery at the University of Basel, Switzer - land's oldest university. Dr. Allgower invited Dr. Mize to join his Swiss AO surgical team in Basel, following his fellowship at Oxford University. Dr. Allgower convened a group of Swiss general and orthopedic surgeons to form the Association of the Study of Internal Fixation in 1958. Referred to as the AO Group, it developed surgical principles, instruments, and implants that revolutionized how surgeons treat fractures. Widely regarded by the global medical community, the organization is considered the international authority in the surgical treatment of trauma. The AO Group's work captivated Dr . Mize, whose reputation and impact spread across the U.S. through his work with UT Southwestern, Parkland Memorial Hospital, and Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. Decades later, these principles and techniques remain the gold standard for orthopedic trauma care. It was Dr. Allgower who introduced the American surgeon to Mr. Wyss. Dr. Mize and Mr. Wyss quickly became friends. Dr. Mize left Switzerland and returned to a career in the United States in 1977. Mr. Wyss did the same, establishing Synthes USA, a medical device manufacturer making internal screws and plates to repair broken bones. \"I feel total gratitude to The Wyss Medical Foundation for providing resident surgeons in the UT Southwestern orthopedic surgery program with advanced educational opportunities they might never have experienced,\" Dr. Mize said. \"My friendship with Hansjorg goes back almost 50 years, and to have his Foundation support the Distinguished Professorship and all these wonderful initiatives is completely gratifying.\" Longtime friend, global philanthropist honors former UTSW resident, Roby Mize, M.D. By Andrew MartonCAREER DISTINCTION The Distinguished Professorship will support the efforts of an exceptional trauma surgeon and enhance the Orthopaedic Trauma Education and Management Program.ofA Hansjorg Wyss 27 PATHWAYS 26 FALL 2021Advancing cancer care, UT Southwestern Medical Center recently opened a new addition to Radiation Oncology services. With more than 71,000 square feet, the expansion includes more patient care spaces, innovative technology, and the latest approach to radiation treatment. Called adaptive therapy, the new technique repr esents a paradigm shift for radiation oncology. Patients are scanned before treatment using real-time, high-resolution medical imaging. This allows technicians to update the treatment plan based on the patient's anatomy and tumor size on the day of treatment instead of using images that can be weeks old. The up-to-date imaging is combined with additional sensors to guide treatment, allowing health care professionals to precisely target the delivery of radiation and adjust to minor movements such as breathing. Bringing the combined space of UT Southwestern's Radiation Oncology facility to more than 130,000 square feet, the expansion houses an array of machines that enable health care professionals to treat a wide range of cancers at one convenient location. In addition to more than a dozen advanced imaging/treatment machines that include a brachytherapy suite, Xstrahl treatment ma- chine, and a GammaPod treatment machine for treating breast cancer, the building adds exam rooms, patient support rooms, two children's areas, and a cafeteria. Radiation Oncology is part of UT Southwestern's Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center - one of 51 comprehensive cancer centers designated by the National Cancer Institute that is nationally ranked among the top 25 cancer programs by U.S. News & World Report. Design that matters The main lobby of the Radiation Oncology building continues UT Southwestern's commitment to patient-centered design. Visitors are welcomed with ample natural light and an experience that streamlines their arrival as they move through valet parking and reception to their appointment.Tailor-made therapy New equipment that delivers on the facility's focus on adaptive treatment includes two Ethos machines (left) that enable technicians to scan patients each time they come for treatment using cone beam computed tomography, a kind of medical imaging that uses X-rays to visualize the inside of the body. Technicians review the images for changes in the patient's anatomy and, with the help of artificial intelligence, create an adapted treatment plan to deliver that day's dose based on the physician's intent. Equipped with a robotic arm with six degrees of motion, the Accuray Cyberknife (above) enables physicians to precisely perform radiosurgery or deliver radiation therapy from the most effective angle. Sensors on the floor, overhead, and in the treatment couch monitor the patient's position and synchronize treatment to breathing and other small movements.

The inaugural event honored the Medical Center's storied past and encouraged alumni to make a gift - of any amount - to invest in the future education and training of health care leaders. Fundraising efforts were amplified by a gift fr om alumni Linda Hughes, M.D., and Lannie Hughes, M.D. Inspired by the message of Founders Day and hoping to motivate others, the couple's gift of $25,000 was used as a matching challenge to raise additional funds for UT Southwestern Medical School student scholarships. Donations surpassed the challenge goal, more than doubling the im- pact of their gift. Organizers are already planning Founders Day ac- tivities for 2022, which will be held again on May 5. Rutledge Cancer Foundation Supported by a gift of $250,000 from the Rutledge Cancer Foundation, the Fertility Preservation Program continues the Moncrief Cancer Institute's mission of easing the burden of cancer. Created in 2016, the program educates, coordinates care, and provides financial assistance for adolescents and young adults who want to protect future possibil- ities of having children before undergoing radiation or other cancer treatments that may cause infertility. The Foundation supports adolescent and young adult cancer patients at Moncrief Cancer Institute and the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center through their adolescent and young adult patient events and Carly's Closet Program, which provides age-appropriate comfort items and resources to newly diagnosed patients.Mersina Stubbs Dallas interior designer Mersina Stubbs, whose father co-founded the chain of Pappas Restaurants, has a strong connection with UT Southwestern, serving on the Medical Center's former Board of Visitors. Last year, Mrs. Stubbs made a generous monthly recurring gift to the Peter O'Donnell Jr. Brain Institute to support the Medical Center's latest charitable initiative. When the pandemic struck, she also led a group of local philanthropists to provide more than 700 meals for front-line workers, the bulk of which she delivered personally. In the midst of her generosity, Mrs. Stubbs was diag - nosed with breast cancer. Thanks to the treatment she received at UT Southwestern, today she is cancer-free and lauds the quality of care provided by the team at the Harold C.
