Constraints to using e-services 39E-REVENUESummary & recommendationsE-REVENUE 1Summary & recommendationsIntroduction 1 The development of the internet over the last decade has opened up new opportunities for individuals and organisations to communicate electronically.The United Kingdom is one of the world's leading e-commerce markets, andsome 37 per cent of the public have internet access at home. Such electronic,or 'e', services offer Government the opportunity to improve services ininnovative ways at potentially low cost. 2 The Inland Revenue e-strategy (July 2001) sets out how the department will contribute to Government initiatives to make the United Kingdom the bestplace to do e-business and how it intends to achieve its targets that: !Fifty per cent of services will be available electronically by 31 December 2002. !All services will be available electronically by 31 December 2005. !There will be a 50 per cent take up of the Inland Revenue's electronicservices by 31 December 2005. 3 The Inland Revenue is at the forefront of the development of e-services in the public sector and their experience acts as a valuable exemplar to otherGovernment departments. Early developments focused on providing e-servicesto core customer groups, in order to meet the 50 per cent availability target by2002. To date, some 30 per cent of services are available electronically, eitherfrom the internet or by using other electronic communication systems. Keyachievements include an award winning web site for the provision of taxinformation, the provision of forms and guidance on-line, the option tocomplete and return Self Assessment forms electronically and that largeorganisations can send tax details for their employees and subcontractors acrossan electronic data interchange facility. The Inland Revenue developed one ofGovernment's first transaction based e-services in a very short space of time. Theintroduction of the internet service for Self Assessment, however, met teethingproblems, making it difficult for taxpayers to send their tax returns electronically. 2Summary & recommendationsE-REVENUE 4 The Inland Revenue has learned from its experience and we examined what progress has been made in applying these lessons. In particular, our reportfocuses on the take up of existing services and what is being done to improvethose available to business and individuals. 5 We have collated information from within the Inland Revenue and elsewhere. In addition to reviewing documents and interviewing key staff, we have soughtthe views of a panel of experts, commissioned research into the constraints tousing e-services, invited the department's Internal Audit Office to reviewstaffing issues on our behalf and examined developments with leading privatesector companies and overseas revenue authorities. Main findings and conclusions 6 Lessons learned from the Inland Revenue's experience to date are applicable to other Government departments and agencies. The annex to this summaryhighlights a number of specific good practices on how to encourage take upand improve services available. 7 The department won an award for its web site in 2000, and it contains a wealth of useful information (http://www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk) (Figure 1) . Legislative changes enable the department to rely on electronic submission via the internetas confirmation of receipt of a tax return, and the Inland Revenue is the firstcentral Government body to offer customers the opportunity to pay anyoutstanding amounts via the internet. Whilst initial achievements focused onmeeting the 50 per cent availability target by 2002, the Inland Revenuerecognises that more fundamental change will be required in future toencourage take up. 8 Particular difficulties were experienced in submitting completed returns. System records showed that nearly 4 out of 5 attempted submissions in 1999-00 did not succeed first time. The department noted that there could havebeen a number of reasons - the taxpayer may, for example, have input invalid dataor not filled in a box that needed to be completed. And there are a number ofinstances of taxpayers making numerous attempts - which distort the figures. Butit is indicative nonetheless of early problems. Many of these have been resolvedand performance has improved - although the proportion of successful attemptsfor first time submission had only reached 44 per cent on average between Apriland September 2001, it improved further to an average of 70 per cent for thequarter ending December 2001. The Inland Revenue web site1 The Inland Revenue web site is at www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk Source: Inland Revenue 3Summary & recommendationsE-REVENUE 9 The public are concerned about the security of transactions made across the internet. The Inland Revenue has addressed this issue by building appropriatemeasures into their systems and by commissioning an external evaluation of theeffectiveness of security measures for the Self Assessment internet service. Theevaluation confirmed the system is secure. Encouraging take up 10 The Inland Revenue sees its target of achieving a 50 per cent take up of e-services by the end of 2005 as a clear expression of its commitment. But thetarget is ambitious and, based on progress so far and experience elsewhere, isunlikely to be achieved. 11 The target was set at an early stage of the programme to cover all e-services and the Inland Revenue recognises that it has acted as a useful stimulus in developinginitiatives to encourage take up. The department acknowledges, however, that thetarget is a formidable challenge and levels of take up to date vary between itsdifferent customer groups. Whilst the target might be achievable for some, suchas large businesses, it is unlikely to be attained across all groups. 12 Whether or not the target is met, it remains important to encourage taxpayers to take up the Inland Revenue's e-services. A high take up is not only an indicatorof a good quality e-service, but would enable the Inland Revenue and users toachieve considerable financial savings. A company's employee tax details sentor received via the electronic data interchange service each month, for example,improves accuracy by up to 50 per cent. The greater accuracy requires lessadministrative checking and fewer queries, saving time for the businessorganisation and the Inland Revenue. Experience elsewhere suggests thatsignificant savings can be realised in successfully implementing e-services.Whilst it is difficult to predict confidently the savings achievable, the departmentestimates that when take up reaches 50 per cent across all activities, this mightenable savings of some 1,300 posts. Where savings materialise, it is likely theInland Revenue will seek to re-deploy staff into other areas of work. 13 The Inland Revenue has actively promoted public awareness of its e-services. Marketing of e-services in 2000-01 and 2001-02 cost some \u00a34.4 million andfocused on the internet service for Self Assessment. The majority of expenditurewas on the television campaign where the Inland Revenue expected theadvertisements not only to boost internet filing but also to remind peoplegenerally of the 30 September filing deadline. Other initiatives included internetand newspaper advertisements and leaflets sent with each Self Assessment form. 14 Take up of e-services has varied according to the services available. !Business interest in the electronic data interchange service for Pay As You Earn tax returns has been high. Some 660 businesses have contacted the InlandRevenue to inquire about this new service and 49 of them, which becausethey include payroll bureaux represent 5,000 employers, now send tax datafor 6 million employees electronically to the department each year. The mainconstraint on take up has been the need to deal with a large number ofrequests from companies, and the Inland Revenue has not been able toactively pursue larger companies that might not realise the service exists. !The take up of the internet service for Self Assessment, however, has beenless encouraging. Some 39,000 taxpayers used the service for the tax year1999-00 to submit returns by 5 April 2001, compared to a projection of315,000. Compared with the projection for submission of 2000-01 taxreturns by 5 April 2002 of 200,000, 50,125 people had completed theirreturns by 4 January 2002. 4E-REVENUESummary & recommendations15 High take up of the Inland Revenue's e-services depends on taxpayers finding some clear benefit for themselves in dealing with the Inland Revenue in thatway. There are already clear benefits to organisations able to send Pay As YouEarn tax data to the Inland Revenue by electronic data interchange. TheCarter Review 1, commissioned by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and published in November 2001, also noted the benefits of e-services for payrolland proposed that it should be mandatory for large employers. There are alsosome benefits for taxpayers using the Self Assessment internet service, inparticular: an assurance that the return is arithmetically correct; convenience;confirmation that the return was received; and faster processing of any taxrefunds. But taxpayers expect further added value from completing their taxreturns electronically. Internet users typically look for a time saving - such as asimplified form or being able to rely on the department completing many of thequestions from existing data on the taxpayer's behalf. 16 The Inland Revenue is actively addressing customer needs to encourage take up. The department appointed a Marketing Director from the private sector inJanuary 2001 to develop a departmental strategy which will include initiativesto promote the internet service for Self Assessment. In Spring 2001, thedepartment's Electronic Business Unit contacted those people who hadsuccessfully or unsuccessfully filed their tax return electronically by5 April 2001 to seek their views of the service. 17 Take up of the internet service for Self Assessment will only improve significantly once on-line forms offer further added value to customers. TheInland Revenue is moving from its existing arrangements for taxpayers to file atax return towards a 'portal' environment offering secure personalised services,such as the option for taxpayers to view their account as well as the facility tofile a tax return electronically. It will take time and resources to re-designexisting services. Simplification of the form would require legislative changeand drawing on data stored elsewhere in the department to complete many ofthe questions on behalf of users would require new software to link existingcomputer systems. The Inland Revenue commissioned Ezgov Inc. inSummer 2001 to examine how to increase take up of the internet service forSelf Assessment in 2002. Based on their findings a number of changes areplanned to make the service easier to use and to validate entries beforetaxpayers submit the completed form to the Inland Revenue. Improving and expanding the range of services available 18 The Inland Revenue has an ambitious programme to develop further e-services for customers. From early 2002, the Inland Revenue will begin a pilot exercisewith 20 companies to allow them to check their account details on-line with afull launch later that year. The Inland Revenue is also looking to offer thisservice to Self Assessment customers at a later date. The success of the futureprogramme rests largely on how the Inland Revenue manages the associatedrisks. Some risks, such as the scale and speed with which the public access theinternet are outside the Inland Revenue's control. Other risks, such as the likelytake up of e-services, can be addressed, to some degree, by the department. 1 'Review of Payroll Services', 2001 Pre-Budget Report by Patrick Carter5Summary & recommendationsE-REVENUE 19 E-services require a more customer orientated approach which will require changes in the way the Inland Revenue operates. The Inland Revenue set up anElectronic Business Unit in Spring 1999 to provide support to customers andthe software industry, and to encourage intermediaries, such as the ConsumersAssociation who provide a bespoke service for taxpayers that is compatiblewith the Inland Revenue's own e-services. 20 The Inland Revenue recognises that it will be difficult to achieve high take up simply by e-enabling existing tax return services. Radical changes to someprocesses will be required in order to provide services that users want andwhich offer added value, and this will require the Inland Revenue to identifyexactly what a customer wants from a service. The Inland Revenue has adoptedthis approach by fully involving all stakeholders in the development ofCorporation Tax e-services. 21 In order to remain at the forefront of the development of e-services in the public sector, the Inland Revenue recognises the need for effective and professionalproject management. Indeed, its existing processes and departmentalmethodologies already reflect many of the government wide recommendationsfrom the McCartney report 2on improving IT project management. Drawing on the good practices identified from this report, the Inland Revenue's experienceand our discussions with other organisations, we identified five importantfactors particularly relevant to e-services: !Clear and visible leadership from the top. !E projects need to be part of a wider business change. !Project risk analysis. !Skilled staff to develop and deliver each project effectively. !Monitoring the outcome of each project to learn lessons. 22 The Inland Revenue has adopted a number of good practices, such as build and learn, from the private sector on how to manage e-service projects and tominimise the risk of failure. The programme for the development of e-serviceshas been broken down into over 40 projects and each product is tested beforeit is finalised. But deciding when a product is ready to be market tested iscritical; too late and work may prove nugatory, too early and the organisation'sreputation might suffer. The Inland Revenue encountered such difficulties in thefirst year of Self Assessment internet filing and have applied the lessons learntto future projects such as the planned Corporation Tax e-service. Goodpractices we identified within the Inland Revenue included making sure keyrisks are addressed fully, progress is monitored closely and that potentialproblems are dealt with promptly. 23 The Inland Revenue, like overseas revenue authorities, has outsourced much of the work around the development of e-services. Inland Revenue staff manageeach project and operate the service once it is available to the public. TheElectronic Business Unit have successfully recruited and trained sufficient staffto date, and such efforts will continue to be a high priority in future as newservices become available and take up increases. Most staff have been in postsix months or less and the fast turnover has meant it is imperative thatindividuals are trained quickly. 2 McCartney report: Successful IT: Modernising Government in Action, Cabinet Office, 20006Summary & recommendationsE-REVENUE Recommendations 24 Based on progress so far and experience elsewhere, it is unlikely that the Inland Revenue's target to encourage 50 per cent take up of its electronicservices by the end of 2005 will be met. The department needs to build on theprogress made in developing e-services to provide a clear benefit to taxpayersto use such services in future. The Inland Revenue should: i Undertake a comprehensive programme of customer needs analyses to establish what individuals and businesses require from the department's e-services. The department has started such work for Corporation taxpayersand, to a lesser extent, for Self Assessment taxpayers. ii Review the existing target of 50 per cent take up of e-services by December 2005. One overall target does not take account of the variations incustomer interest and the range of possible financial savings across each e-service. A number of targets tailored to specific customer groups, such asbusinesses or individuals might be more appropriate. iii Target short term efforts to improve take up of the electronic data interchange service for Pay As You Earn tax data because this offers clearadded value to large businesses and efficiency savings to the department. iv Continue to re-organise existing Inland Revenue e-services to reflect more closely customer demands. This might involve further development ofcustomer facing areas, in accordance with the private sector good practicesidentified in paragraphs 3.10 to 3.13. v Build on existing progress to refine the management and development of e-services along the lines of the good practices identified in Part 3. In particular: !Test products early. !Remedy issues arising and, if necessary, be prepared to stop development or withdraw the service from users. !Carry out timely project evaluations to learn lessons and disseminate good practice. 25 Many of the Inland Revenue's good practices identified in this report are applicable across Government. Other departments and agencies should seek toemulate the good practices in the following section.7Summary & recommendationsE-REVENUE Good practices applicable to other Government departments and agencies Our examination of the Inland Revenue's e-services identified a number of good practices applicable to other Government departments and agencies. The good practices include: 1 E-services is a fast changing environment and it is important to be near the forefront of developments. This will involve taki ng well managed risks and might involve accepting that some projects will not be a success. On encouraging take up 2 Encouraging take up is not straightforward and persuading the public to use a new service takes time. This means consulting the public and other key customers to identify: what they require from the e-service; what would encourage them to use it;their concerns; and, wherever possible and cost effective, to make sure the product meets them. 3 Each new service needs to offer additional benefits to persuade potential customers to use it. Benefits might include a more convenient and easy to use service, being able to complete a transaction more quickly, being able to rely on the e-service topass relevant information on to other Government organisations, or a cash saving. Building on the research into customer viewsand needs, each e-service should offer appropriate benefits and these should be highlighted when marketing the service. On improving the e-services available 4 The successful introduction of e-services requires changes in the way an organisation works as much as technological innovation. It is vital to have the commitment of all staff, especially senior managers, as well as suppliers and other keystakeholders. Anticipating and managing the cultural changes needed is essential. 5 The e-services programme needs to be flexible to accommodate new developments in the sector and to be responsive to customer demands. Development work for the programme should be broken down into a number of smaller projects that can be prioritised.Each project should be pilot tested at an early stage to gauge customer reactions and remedy any teething problems. 6 The e-services programme should differentiate more complex projects, such as those that might offer joined up transaction based services, from more straightforward projects, such as services that offer information only. More ground breaking projectsmight meet customer needs better, but will often involve changes to an organisation's 'back office' computer systems and,therefore, will take longer to develop. 7 It is important to have the right people with the right skills to develop and operate e-services and to provide appropriate he lp desk support. Existing staff might require training and support to handle the new systems. And it might be better to encourageprivate sector organisations to develop front end software for customers to use. Such an approach enables Government tocontinue to concentrate on improving its own core activities. 8 Marketing the product only when satisfied that it is working properly and meets customer needs. To do otherwise risks destroying confidence in the product which can take considerable time and effort to recover. 9 Regularly evaluating each project and monitoring customer reactions closely. Timely project evaluations ensure lessons are lea rned and disseminated. Build opportunities into each e-service for customers to provide feedback and act on the comments received. 8part oneE-REVENUEPart 1E-REVENUE The development of electronic services 9part one1.1 The Inland Revenue is at the forefront of the development of electronic or 'e' services in the public sector. The department won an award for its web site(http://www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk) in 2000, and regularlyhas some 700,000 'hits' on its web pages each week. Itexpects to spend some \u00a3200 million between April 2001and March 2004 developing its e-services further. Moreimportantly the successful development of e-services willimpact on all Inland Revenue's customers. 1.2 The United Kingdom is one of the world's leading e-commerce markets (Figure 2) . New technologies, such as the internet, digital television and thirdgeneration mobile phones offer organisations theopportunity to provide improved e-services tocustomers. Internet access at home is constantlyincreasing and now stands at 37 per cent of allhouseholds in the United Kingdom (Figure 3) . 1.3 Government is committed to developing e-services to make the United Kingdom the best place for doing e-business and to promote 'joined up' government. In2000, the Cabinet Office asked departments to make themost of the new technologies, based on four guidingprinciples (see Figure 4) . The Inland Revenue has agreed three key targets: !Fifty per cent of services will be availableelectronically by 31 December 2002. !All services will be available electronically by 31 December 2005. !Fifty per cent take up of the Inland Revenue'selectronic services by 31 December 2005. 1.4 This part of the report examines: the Inland Revenue's strategy for developing e-services; progress made indelivering e-services; why we carried out theexamination; and, what we examined and how weundertook it.The Inland Revenue's strategy for developing e-services 1.5 The Inland Revenue's first e-strategy (October 2000) set out how the department would contribute to the widere-government objectives and, more specifically, how itintended to achieve its targets. The key features of thestrategy were: !Development of an e-channel for customers - a customer driven approach offering a range ofchannels, to meet the needs of different individualsand organisations, with cost and convenienceincentives to use e-channels. The proportion of businesses on-line The United Kingdom has a comparable proportion of businesses on-line (such as having a website, using externale-mail or using electronic data interchange services)as other leading countries2 Source: International Benchmarking Report, Department of Trade and Industry, 2001 CanadaCountry PercentageFrance Germany Italy Japan Sweden United Kingdom United States of America 0 20 40 60 80 10010part oneE-REVENUE !Repositioning of the Inland Revenue as an enabler - improved e-services to the taxpayer, thus reducingcompliance burdens on individuals and businesses. !The use of intermediaries - encouraging other organisations, such as the National Association ofCitizens Advice Bureau, the Post Office and softwaresuppliers to provide a bespoke service for customersin conjunction with the Inland Revenue. !More joined up government services - working with other departments to meet the needs of particularcustomer segments. For example, providing accessthrough both commercial and Government portals. !A long term transformation of the business and staffroles - staff will increasingly use the internet, intranet and electronic tools to support the customer. 1.6 A Cabinet Office review of departmental strategies noted that the Inland Revenue's thinking on e-serviceswas relatively well developed and much of the strategicanalysis had already been done. The review identified anumber of areas where the department might improveits strategy further, in particular that whilst the strategy recognised the need to encourage take up of e-services, it did not address the consequences for the organisation.1.7 The Inland Revenue prepared a revised strategy in July 2001. This builds on the earlier version and thebroad strategic principles remain the same. Keyadditions include: !An overarching vision. The vision sets out how the Inland Revenue might become a customer focused,e-enabled organisation in the future. This issupported by an analysis of various scenarios thatdepict what impact e-services might have on theInland Revenue's future work.The proportion of households on-line continues to increase The percentage of households in the United Kingdom with access to the internet has increased from 9 per cent in 1998 to 37 per cent in 20013 Source: Office of National Statistics, 2001Percentage Year40 30 20 development of e-services4 Source: Cabinet OfficeBuilding services around citizen'schoice Making Government and servicesmore accessible Social inclusionUsing information better11 part oneE-REVENUE !Customer Relationship Management. The scope for a more customer centred approach based on aCustomer Relationship Management philosophy. !Technical architecture. A technical framework to underpin the strategy in order to deliver services in amodular and joined up way. 1.8 In order to meet these strategic objectives, key success factors include: !By 2002, to have basic secure e-services andassociated infrastructure and to have developedplans for radical change based on e-services. !By 2004, to have significantly increased take up ofcore services and to have delivered significantbenefits from re-organising existing services. !By 2005, to have achieved significant businesstransformation, with most customer transactionsconducted electronically. Progress made in delivering e-services 1.9 The Inland Revenue established its e-services programme in Spring 1999. Overall responsibility forthe programme rests with the Board Director designatedas the department's Information Age GovernmentChampion. A new team has consequently been built upto deliver these new e-services. Figure 5 displays the high level structure put in place. The projectmanagement team work alongside the Inland Revenue'sstrategic IT partners, EDS, to develop new services andthe Electronic Business Unit manages the services thathave gone live, in particular the E-Business help desk forcustomer support, support to the private sector to develop products which can use the Inland Revenue's e-services, and marketing. 1.10 The department has made considerable progress in developing a range of e-services at a time when e-commerce has gone through a period of flux. By April 2001 some 30 per cent of the department'sservices were available electronically. Achievements todate included: !The development of internet services. Examples include providing forms and guidance on-line,individuals being able to file their Self Assessmenttax returns, employers and their agents being able tosend end of year returns and both groups being ableto pay outstanding amounts to the department acrossthe internet. !The development of electronic data interchangeservices. Such services enable organisations to send and receive large quantities of data directly to thedepartment securely and more quickly than by usingthe internet. One example, is for large employersand payroll bureaux, which are agents for a numberof employers, to transfer Pay As You Earn tax detailsfor each of their employees to the Inland Revenue. !Support services. Examples include a customer support help desk, the development of a standardtemplate, and a third party validation service toencourage private sector companies to developelectronic tax services for customers that arecompatible with the Inland Revenue's requirements. How Inland Revenue has established e-services5 The e-services Directorate liaises with the Cabinet Office and the private sector and reports to the Information Age Government Champion on the Management Board Source: NAO analysis of Inland Revenue informationInland Revenue Management Board Director of e-services Project management and delivery team Programme support team Electronic Business UnitCabinet Office E-envoy Private sector, such as EDS EzGov Girobank IntermediariesStrategic planning team Business management and development team Customers12part oneE-REVENUE 1.11 The development of the internet service for Self Assessment in April 2000 was achieved in quick time,but many customers found it difficult to use andparticular difficulties were experienced in submittingcompleted returns. In November 2000 Inland Revenuecommissioned a review by Ezgov Inc. of what theproblems had been, in order that they could considerwhat action to take. Key issues included: !During the initial system roll out many customersfound it difficult to register to use the service becausethey did not know their tax reference number. !On average nearly four out of five attempts by thepublic to submit tax forms electronically wereunsuccessful. Minor problems, such as certaincharacters, for example '/', in certain fields meantcustomers were unable to submit the completedform until the mistake was rectified. The departmentnoted that there were also a number of instances oftaxpayers making numerous attempts to submit theirreturn - which distorted the overall success rate. !The software required to run the programme wasinitially distributed by sending a CD-Rom throughthe post, necessitating re-issue of a CD-Rom or aweb site download when fixes or additional featureswere required. 1.12 The on-line forms for 2001-02 build on the lessons learnt. Although the proportion of successful attempts tosubmit a return had increased from 20 per cent toonly 44 per cent on average between April andSeptember 2001, it improved further to an average of70 per cent for the quarter ending December 2001. Why we carried out this examination 1.13 We examined the Inland Revenue's e-services programme because: !E-services are crucial to modernising governmentand to achieving the Inland Revenue's aim tobecome an enabling organisation. !The department has been at the forefront of thedevelopment of e-services and their good practicesmight be applicable elsewhere. !This report provides an in depth examination ofprogress to support our other examination of e-services across government.What we examined and how we undertook it 1.14 We examined: !Customer take up of the Inland Revenue's existing e-services - Part 2. !How the department intends to improve and expandthe range of e-services available - Part 3. 1.15 Our examination focuses on the development of e-services for all the department's tax responsibilities.The report does not cover the development of an e-service for tax credits; this is at too early a stage towarrant examination now. We focused on three specifice-services in order to draw out lessons for the widerprogramme: !Internet service for Self Assessment: enabling taxpayers to complete their tax return and send it tothe department electronically (Appendix 1). !Payments by internet: customers can use a debit card to pay the Inland Revenue outstanding amountselectronically (Appendix 2). !An electronic data interchange service: to enable employers to send large volumes of employee Pay AsYou Earn tax details to the department (Appendix 3). 1.16 During the study we were assisted by a panel of experts, including a company director responsible for e-servicesin Abbey National Plc, a partner from Ernst and Young,a private sector specialist, a Professor from BrunelUniversity and senior civil servants from the CabinetOffice and the Department for Work and Pensions(formerly Social Security). We are grateful for thevaluable help and assistance of all those whocontributed to this report. We also commissionedresearch from Lorien Consulting Ltd and ProfessorMargetts from University College London into theconstraints to the take up of e-services. Further details ofour methodology, the individuals and organisations wecontacted and members of our panel of experts are atAppendix 4. 1.17 We are undertaking a separate examination of the progress across Government in developing e-services.Part 2 13 part two2.1 This part of our report examines why the take up of e-services is important, progress made in encouragingtake up and the barriers that might deter taxpayers fromusing the Inland Revenue's e-services. Why the take up of e-services is important 2.2 A high take up is an indicator of a good quality e-service, and should also generate considerablefinancial savings. Paperless systems reduce theadministrative burden of processing tax information.Revenue authorities across the world are attempting tomeasure the potential benefits. The SingaporeGovernment has estimated that the introduction ofelectronic filing of tax returns via the internet and thetelephone saves it some \u00a320 million each year. TheInland Revenue also expects to make considerableefficiency savings: !The internet service for Self Assessment will save thedepartment \u00a33 per customer. !Encouraging large organisations to send staff Pay AsYou Earn details by electronic data interchangeimproves accuracy by up to 50 per cent and,therefore, reduces the number of queries to befollowed up. A take up of around 40 per cent wouldsave \u00a320 million by 2003-04 (Appendix 3). 2.3 The department has recognised that the greater accuracy of e-services requires less administrative checking andfewer queries, saving time for the public and theInland Revenue. Whilst it is difficult to predict preciselythe savings achievable the Inland Revenue estimatesthat when take up reaches 50 per cent across allactivities, this might enable savings of some 1,300 posts.Where savings materialise, it is likely that the InlandRevenue will seek to re-deploy staff in other work areas.Progress made in encouraging take up 2.4 The Inland Revenue sees its target of achieving a 50 per cent take up of its transaction based e-services bythe end of 2005 as a clear expression of its commitmentto electronic services. But the target is ambitious.Experience to date elsewhere suggests such levels oftake up is unlikely to be achieved. The Republic ofIreland was the only overseas revenue authority wecontacted (Appendix 6) that had a similar target. And theInland Revenue found, for example, that the CaliforniaFranchise Tax Board in the United States of America hastaken six years for its electronic tax return service toachieve a 21 per cent take up amongst its taxpayers. Andprivate sector companies, such as First Direct and AbbeyNational Plc (Appendix 5) expect their business - andthus customer take up - to grow by around 20 per centby 2005 from their existing customer base of some 1million customers each. 2.5 Early market research by the Inland Revenue indicated relatively high customer interest in e-services. A survey 3of individuals with an income over \u00a340,000 found that 60 per cent of respondents had internet access. Some 30 per cent were interested in filing their tax returns on-line. One in five customers would like to communicatewith the department via an interactive web site. 2.6 Take up of the department's e-services to date varies according to each service: !Some 39,000 individuals used the internet servicefor Self Assessment in 2000-01 to file their tax returnfor 1999-00. This compared to an original projectionof 315,000. The projection for submission of 2000-01 tax returns by 5 April 2002 is 200,000, andby 4 January 2002 only 50,125 people hadsubmitted their returns.Part 2Take up of existing servicesE-REVENUE 3 Inland Revenue Internet Filing Survey Market Research Report, Continental Research, October 199914part twoE-REVENUE !The Electronic Lodgement Service, introduced in 1997, enables tax agents (such as accountants) tofile Self Assessment annual returns electronically onbehalf of their clients using an electronic datainterchange service. Over 267,000 returns weresubmitted this way in 2000-01, equivalent to sevenper cent of the target audience. !A drive in April 2000 to raise awareness of thedepartment's electronic data interchange service forlarge organisations to send Pay As You Earn taxdetails of their employees to the Inland Revenueattracted strong interest. Some 660 businesses havecontacted the department to inquire about this newservice and 49 of them, which because they includepayroll bureaux represent 5,000 employers, nowsend tax details for 6 million employees to theInland Revenue this way.2.7 In order to encourage higher take up, the Inland Revenue has actively raised public awareness of its e-services. Initiatives included: !Television and newspaper coverage. Advertising on television and in national newspapers during 2000-01cost some \u00a31.9 million and \u00a32.5 million in 2001-02. !Internet banners. The department has used extensive internet advertising. Banners on its ownweb site (Figure 6) and other portals, such as the National Westminster Bank Plc and Sky web sites,and the Lycos Co UK site encourage individuals togo to the Self Assessment pages on the department'sweb site. !Flyers. Every Self Assessment form sent out for the tax year 2000-01 included a colour leafletexplaining how taxpayers might wish to submit theirreturn electronically (Figure 7) . 2.8 The department recognises, however, that greater public awareness of its e-services will not, of itself generatesufficient take up to meet its target. Take up of theinternet service for Self Assessment in 2000-01, forexample, represented less than two per cent of thenumbers required by the end of 2005 (Figure 8) . Improvements in the take up of the Inland Revenue's e-services depends upon taxpayers finding some furtherbenefit for themselves in dealing with the InlandRevenue in that way. The Carter Review proposed that itshould be mandatory for large employers to transactelectronically with the Inland Revenue. Constraints that might deter taxpayers from using the InlandRevenue's e-services 2.9 There are a range of factors that might discourage individuals and businesses from using the InlandRevenue's transaction based e-services. Suchconstraints include: !Access to the internet. Whilst a lack of access to the internet, the so-called 'digital divide' is often cited asa main constraint to Government services, it is lessapplicable to the Inland Revenue. Customers likelyto use the Inland Revenue's existing e-services arebusinesses and individuals earning over \u00a340,000 ofwhich over two-thirds have access to the internet. !Security. Whilst few respondents (10 per cent) to the department's 1999 survey considered security of theirtax affairs to be of concern, this percentage mightchange significantly if confidential information sentover the internet ever became public.An internet advertising banner for Inland Revenue6 Source: Inland Revenue web siteThe banner encourages internet users to visit the department's web pages on how to fill in and submit your Self Assessment tax form electronically 7 Source: Inland RevenueThe flyer encourages Self Assessment taxpayers to submit their returns electronicallyFlyer for Inland Revenue's Self Assessment internet service Ah go on.

A survey commissioned by British Telecom Plc4identified a lack of confidence in central Government services. Some 16 per cent ofrespondents had a great deal or a fair amount ofconfidence in central Government, compared to 37 per cent for banks and 59 per cent for the Post Office. !A lack of value added. Early market research conducted by the department5in 1999 concluded that the main constraint to take up was likely to be alack of any need to change rather than any concernsabout using the internet itself. The research wecommissioned (Appendix 7) confirmed that thisremains the main barrier.2.10 The increasing sophistication of attempts by some individuals to hack into an organisation's e-servicesmeans that security remains a constant issue. The InlandRevenue has complied with existing industry standardsto ensure tax data remain secure. In 2000, for example,the department commissioned an independent securitytest of its internet service for Self Assessment (Figure 9) . The department's internet services are now accessible from the Government Gateway(http://www.gateway.gov.uk), a centralised registrationservice for e-Government services that will also ensurea high level of security.Expected take up of the Self Assessment filing by internet e-service8 Take up of the e-service will need to rise sharply in the next few years to meet the department's target. The department revise d the projected figures in the light of actual take up in 2000-01.

An international review of e-Government byAccenture 6, however, established that no nation has demonstrated the level of sophistication of internetpresence which is fast becoming the norm amongstleading private sector companies. 2.12 The availability of forms and guidance on the department's web site has met the expectations of taxagents, such as accountants and other professionaladvisers. A survey of some 215 agents by the departmentin March 2001 established that over 70 per cent ofrespondents thought the web site was good. Thedifficulties encountered by individual taxpayers usingthe department's internet service for Self Assessment in2000-01, however, may have affected public perceptionof the quality of its e-services. A similar survey of thosepeople that had written to the department to complainabout the service last year found that even where theproblem had been remedied, twelve of the 67 peoplecontacted could not be persuaded to use the serviceagain the following year. 2.13 The strong business interest in using the department's electronic data interchange service to transmit Pay As YouEarn tax details for their employees, demonstrates that ane-service that offers clear added value to the user willovercome any antipathy to e-Government. At the time ofour examination, there were five account managers inthe Electronic Business Unit responsible for liasing withorganisations intending to use this service. Since itbecame widely available in April 2000, these managers have received a substantial number of enquiries. Theywere not able to initiate contact with a number of largerorganisations who may have been unaware of the service(see Appendix 3). In recognition the Inland Revenue isrestructuring its Electronic Business Unit (which has asone of its roles the responsibility for promoting andsupporting the electronic data interchange Pay As YouEarn service) to provide more resources to meet theelectronic data interchange needs of the department'slarge business segment customers. 2.14 The internet service for Self Assessment does not offer such clear benefits (Appendix 7). The Inland Revenue'sown research 7found that individuals expected the e-service to enable them to complete their return quickly,typically in less than 15 minutes. Such an approachwould require either significant simplification of theforms available or being able to rely on the departmenthaving filled in as much information as possible, perhapsfrom the data sent by employers across the electronicdata interchange or internet channels. 2.15 The Inland Revenue's work on the internet service for Self Assessment has focussed on the ability to e-enablecurrent systems. Providing a Self Assessment e-servicethat offers some added value cannot be readilyachieved. Simplification of forms would requirelegislative change and drawing on data storedelsewhere in the department to complete many of thequestions on behalf of users would require newsoftware to link existing computer systems. Suchchanges require time and resources. The InlandRevenue intends to move from its existing arrangementsfor taxpayers to file a return towards a 'portal'environment offering secure personalised services,such as the option for taxpayers to view their accountas well as the facility to file a return electronically.What is key, is that the Inland Revenue identifiesexactly what a customer wants from the service (seeAppendix 7). The department has adopted thisapproach with the development of e-services foradministering Corporation Tax. In order to establishcompany requirements, the department held a threeday workshop in April 2001 with a wide range ofcompanies or their agents, software developers andrepresentative bodies, to seek their views. Thisinformation is now being fed into the design of e-services. The outcome of this collaborative designwork has determined the type of company service theInland Revenue will provide. 6 e-Government Leadership Rhetoric vs Reality - Closing the Gap, Accenture, April 2001 7 Inland revenue Internet Filing Survey Market Research Report, Continental Research, October 1999The Inland Revenue web site proved secure9 A security test demonstrated that users are restricted to the services available and cannot access confidential information Source: Inland Revenue In April 2000, the Inland Revenue commissionedexperts at the DefenceEvaluation and ResearchAgency to test the rigourof the security around thedepartment's web site.

Based on their findings, the Inland Revenueplan to make the following changes in 2002: !Improved accessibility. The service will be easier to find on the department's web site and a simplifiedregistration and login process will save time. !The service will be easier to use. A question and answer approach at the start of each session willsimplify the form. 'Yes' or 'no' answers will identifywhich sections of the form need to be completed.There will also be a context sensitive help facility. !Additional facilities. Improvements include additional tax schedules, automatic calculation ofthe tax liability and an on-line calculator. !Quicker validation. The form will automatically check each entry and direct the taxpayer to anyfields that have been incorrectly completed.2.17 The department recruited a Marketing Director from the private sector in January 2001 to lead in thedevelopment of making the department a morecustomer focused service provider that enables as wellas regulates. A customer focused strategy has beendeveloped to assist with this. The key steps are: !Define what the organisation is about. !Define clearly the customer segments. !Understand the needs of these segments. !Meet customer needs through revising products andchannels. !Put in place the people and processes to meet those needs. !The processes deliver 'right first time' solutions. !Communicate effectively both internally andexternally. 2.18 The procurement of Customer Relationship Manage- ment systems in Summer 2002 should provide theInland Revenue with better tools to support customersand management information to complete these steps.More comprehensive and up to date information oncustomer reactions to the e-services will not only enablethe department to improve the quality of its supportservices further, but also to identify and respond tocustomer needs more precisely.18part threeE-REVENUEPart 3E-REVENUE Improving and expanding the range of services available 19 part three3.1 This part of our report examines the Inland Revenue's future e-services programme, and identifies some key good practices required to develop and deliverprojects successfully. The future e-services programme 3.2 The Inland Revenue's e-strategy (July 2001) sets out the future programme of work for 2001 to 2005. Earlyprojects focus on providing electronic versions of thoseservices with a large customer base, and there are alsoa number of projects which aim to transform the way thedepartment provides existing services and offeropportunities to become more 'joined up' with privatesector companies and other Government departments(Figure 10) . Key features of the programme include:!Consolidation of existing e-services, such as internet service for Self Assessment and theelectronic data interchange service to improve easeof use and take up. !Development of new customer services, such as external e-mail, secure messaging and a CorporationTax service. !Development of services for staff, such as the department's intranet to improve communicationand working practices. !Infrastructure and organisational changes, such as a more integrated service for businesses, greater use ofintermediaries to provide services and help deskimprovements.

This list illustrates the key projects planned and the year they should be available to customers20part threeE-REVENUE 3.3 New forms of service delivery need to be implemented in a way that minimises the risk of them failing or thequality of public services not being maintained orimproved. The risks to the successful development of theInland Revenue's e-services fall into two categories -those that are within the Inland Revenue's control andthose that are not (see Figure 11 ). 3.4 The risks outside the Inland Revenue's control are the same as those faced by any organisation aiming todevelop internet services. Large numbers of the publicdo not have access to e-services and higher levels oftake up are dependent on new technologies, such asinteractive television providing more people withaccess. And even when more people do have access,taxpayers are more likely to use the Inland Revenue's e-services if they are accustomed to using the internetfor other activities and are satisfied that personalinformation will be kept secure. The development of e-services elsewhere in Government is the subject of aseparate National Audit Office examination.3.5 There are also a number of risks that arise from how the Inland Revenue manages its e-services programme and,therefore, are within the department's control. In thepast, Government IT projects have often run overbudget, missed delivery dates or failed to fulfilrequirements. A Cabinet Office review 8concluded that a change of approach was necessary, rather than thinkof IT projects the public sector needs to think in terms ofprojects to change the way Government works. Thereport made 15 key recommendations aimed directly atGovernment departments. Many of theserecommendations are already reflected in InlandRevenue's project management methodologies and thedepartment is currently applying these to its full range ofprojects, including e-services. The main risks to the e-services programme 11 The success of the Inland Revenue's e-services programme will depend on a number of factors, some of which are outside their direct control Risks outside Inland Revenue's control !Possible delays in the development of new technologies, such as broadband access to the internet or digital television, might restrict taxpayers' access to Inland Revenue's e-services. !Possible delays in the development of a wide range of useful e-services by the private sector andGovernment might dampen public enthusiasm for e-services. !Security breaches, such as computer viruses and people hacking into web sites to access confidentialinformation dent public confidence in using any e-services. !Doubts about the legal status of transactions across the internet might deter people from using e-services. Risks within Inland Revenue's control !Inland Revenue's targets to make all services electronic by the end of 2005 might encourage the development of e-services that mirror existing non-electronic services rather than the investment ofadditional time to develop better quality e-services for taxpayers. !The e-services programme might not offer taxpayers a better quality service unless staff elsewhere inInland Revenue recognise that the development of e-services will require changes in the way thewhole organisation works. !Development work on each project might prove nugatory unless work keeps pace with the speed ofchange elsewhere to e-services. !It might be difficult to recruit sufficient and appropriate staff to develop the e-services programme. !Any technical problems or security concerns with the development of each of Inland Revenue's e-services might deter taxpayers from using the services. Source: National Audit Office 8 McCartney Report: Successful IT: Modernising Government in Action, Cabinet Office, 200021 part threeE-REVENUE 3.6 Drawing on the good practices identified from past reviews of Government IT projects9, the Inland Revenue's experience and our discussions withorganisations contacted for this report, we haveidentified five important factors necessary for thedepartment to minimise the risks to the e-services programme: !Clear, active and visible leadership from the top. !E projects need to be part of a wider business change. !Project risk analysis. !Skilled staff to develop and deliver each project effectively. !Monitoring the outcome of each project and theresultant live service to learn lessons. Clear active and visible leadership 3.7 An effective e-services programme requires strong leadership. A strong leader provides a clear strategicdirection and drives the organisational changenecessary for the success of the e-services programme.Private sector companies with a successful e-servicehave recognised this requirement. At Abbey NationalPlc, for example, one of the United Kingdom retailboard directors has sole responsibility for the company'se-services programme and takes an active involvementin each project to deal with issues as they arise. 3.8 The Inland Revenue has also recognised the importance of clear leadership. The responsibilities of one of theDeputy Chairman of the Board includes the success ofthe e-services programme. Overall management andresponsibility for the strategic direction rests with the E-Services Director, supported by a team of staff (Figure 5) and each project has a project sponsor to provide direction and monitor progress. 3.9 The department's e-strategy (July 2001) sets out an overarching vision of the way in which an e-enabled'customer-centric' Inland Revenue may operate in 2005. It envisages prime contact with customersthrough self-service web-based services or digital television, and subsequent contact through e-mail, telephone, face-to-face contact and written correspondence. E projects need to be part of a wider business change 3.10 The development of e-services will change the way Government works; it is central to the initiative tomodernise Government. The benefits of new technologycan be seen in the commercial sector in thedevelopment of new delivery channels for services tocustomers and businesses. At Abbey National Plc, forexample, the development of e-services for corebanking activities has meant that customers can makeroutine transactions over the internet and the companyintends to redirect resources to focus on higher valuetransactions (see Appendix 5). 3.11 The introduction of e-services requires a more customer orientated approach which might require changes in theway an organisation operates. In June 2000, the InlandRevenue, in conjunction with Customs and Excise, theDepartment for Education and Skills, Department of Workand Pensions, HM Treasury and the Cabinet Officeundertook a review 10of what might be the outcome of switching to new methods of e-service delivery. Thereport drew on the experiences of the private sector(Figure 12) and concluded that effective e-services will require fundamental change. First Direct, for example, isan e-oriented business and as a consequence hasstructured itself around customer needs. Each customerfacing area deals with a specific customer need, such asmortgage advice or pensions guidance and regionalstructures are not applicable. How the private sector have addressed e-services 12 Inland Revenue has examined how leading private sector companies, such as Boeing, Ford and British Airwaysaddressed e-services British AirwaysIn early 2000 the company set up a team to develop e- services. It soon became clear that the benefits of e-servicesrequired business process re-engineering and the team nowhas the remit to develop ideas that cut across the processes ofthe whole company. BoeingThe development of the myboeingfleet.com web site offered customers access to service bulletins, maintenance manualsand spares ordering. The service integrated the companybetter with customers and suppliers and fundamentallychanged the way aircraft are designed, built and maintained. FordFord has used a web based system to exchange information with suppliers, conduct business on-line and interact with thecompany's existing computer systems. The initiative improvedperformance and generated savings of \u00a3650 million a year.

Inland Revenue has also made progress in re-engineering its e-services to meet customer demands.Specific initiatives include: !Electronic Business Unit. The department set up the unit, based at Shipley, in 1999 to provide support totaxpayers and businesses using its e-services andprivate sector software companies planning todevelop products compatible with the InlandRevenue's e-services. Responsibilities include atelephone and e-mail help desk to provide customersupport, and teams to maintain the systems availableand to market the services. !Encouraging intermediaries. The Inland Revenue is fostering a market so that the private sector canprovide front-end services to customers and enablethe department to focus on its core work. It hasadopted the common internet standard, based onXML, to encourage other organisations to develop amore bespoke service for specific customer groups.The department offers a validation service to ensurecommercial software is compatible with their ownsystems. Figure 13 is a current list of internet intermediaries for 2001-02. !Developing joined up Government services. The Inland Revenue recognises that more progress isneeded in this area. The department plans toencourage other organisations, such as retailers, thePost Office or Citizen Advice Bureau to offer adviceand support to taxpayers and access to the InlandRevenue's, and associated intermediaries', e-services. Such initiatives are still at an early stageof development (Figure 14) , but the department recognises that it is critical to the wider Governmentcommitment to join up services. 3.13 Such progress is encouraging. Further organisational changes might be required as the departmentincreasingly looks to provide more bespoke services toits customers. Whilst the department's e-strategyacknowledges the scale of the challenge, such changesare not likely to be made in the next few years. Project risk analysis 3.14 The development of e-services is a fast changing dynamic environment. Methods of delivery continue tochange, for example digital television and thirdgeneration mobile phones; and an organisation's e-services on the internet have to compete with othersacross the world. Such an environment increases therisk that development work might be nugatory.3.15 Whilst it is necessary to take risks to be at the forefront in the development of e-services, such risks need to bemanaged. Effective project management remainsessential, but the traditional disciplines of long-rangeplanning and extensive trialling before a product isreleased are no longer sufficient for such e-servicesprogrammes. Our discussions with the private sectorand our panel of experts identified five good practices indeveloping e-services: !Break the work into small projects. A portfolio of smaller projects, rather than one larger project,reduces the risk of failure for the entire programme. !Avoid going back over old ground. Abbey National Plc identified three distinct phases in each project:design, development and delivery. The project teamshould minimise design changes duringdevelopment or continuing development whenarrangements are being made to make the newservice available to the public. !Monitor progress closely. Circumstances change quickly with e-services and senior staff shouldcommunicate regularly with the project teams tomonitor progress. The e-commerce director at AbbeyNational Plc, for example, meets each project teamonce a week to review progress. !Test products early. Transaction based e-services typically involve the integration of a number ofdevelopment projects and existing systems. Newservices should be tested early to identify anysoftware errors and to gauge user reactions. Lessonslearned can be used to refine the product. !Be prepared to stop project development orwithdraw the service from users. Early testing may highlight software faults or indicate that users do notfind the product helpful. It might be better to startagain rather than to continue to develop a productthat is inherently flawed or is unlikely to meetcustomer expectations. 3.16 The Inland Revenue has recognised and applied many of these good practices adopting a build and learnapproach to developing e-services as used in the privatesector. The approach involves rapid development of aseries of small projects, each of which is tested beforerelease, whilst maintaining existing paper basedservices. Lessons learned at each stage can be fed intofuture projects. The emphasis is on step by step progressrather than comprehensive long range planning. Thedevelopment of the payments by internet service(Appendix 2) is a good example of how this approachcan work. The project was designed, developed andimplemented within 4 months. Publicity was kept lowkey whilst the service was tested and some 2,500 usershave successfully used the system since its release.23 part threeE-REVENUE Inland Revenue is participating in the pilot scheme A six month pilot scheme is under way in 280 Post Offices in Leicestershire and Rutland. These offices will offer customers a o ne-stop- shop for simple information, advice and transactions and, in the larger Post Offices, touch screen kiosks for more specialist a dvice. Topics will include: !Getting the best out of retirement. How to claim appropriate support and financial assistance. !Getting the best out of work. Services and information for those looking to start or return to work. !Getting the best out of my community. Information on community facilities and services. !Internet learning and access. Practical opportunities to learn how to use the internet. The pilot will run until February 2002 and there will be a comprehensive evaluation of the results. Those taking part include t he Inland Revenue, the Employment Service, Department of Work and Pensions, Department for Education and Skills, City and County Councils , District Authorities, Age Concern, and the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureau.

The benefitsof releasing the product early to assess customerreaction before finalising the service need to beweighed against the risk that any major problems thatcome to light might discredit the service. Holding backthe release for too long, however, increases the risk thatthe product will be overtaken by developmentselsewhere on the internet and will become redundant.The department experienced this difficult question oftiming when the internet service for Self Assessment wasfirst introduced in July 2000 (see Appendix 1). Theproduct was not fully complete before it was released,yet a major publicity campaign encouraged some120,000 customers to test the service. Whilst theadvertising campaign generated public interest in theservice and the department remedied most of the errorsquickly, there was considerable adverse publicity of theinitial teething problems. 3.18 The Inland Revenue's experience in developing e-services to date and our consultation with those wecontacted during our examination indicates four keyfactors to consider when deciding whether to release anew service: !Ensure the product is what the customer wants.Seek the views of typical customers during thedesign stage and check the product developedmeets those needs. The Inland Revenue has usedworkshops, for example, to seek opinions fromsmall businesses before developing a CorporationTax e-service. Such information can be used as achecklist to confirm the final product meets their needs. !Make sure the basics are right. Whilst the product has not yet been finalised, the most fundamentalrisks, such as security issues, must be properly addressed. !Keep initial publicity to a minimum. Use the initial release to gauge customer reaction and to modifythe product accordingly. Only once the product isproven should the organisation raise publicawareness of the new service. !Make time to monitor subsequent developmentsclosely. Comments and queries from initial users will give a good indication of how the new service willfare. Whilst the project team can remedy minorfaults, managers may have to act quickly if there is amajor problem. If an unacceptably high percentageof users have difficulties using the new service, itmight be better to withdraw the product.Skilled staff to develop and deliver each project effectively 3.19 The development of e-services requires a workforce with specialist IT skills. But the IT industry predictssignificant skills shortages across the United Kingdom,perhaps as many as 300,000 unfilled posts, in the shortterm. A survey of policy managers in centralGovernment found that 89 per cent considered that alack of relevant skills among managers would be thebiggest stumbling block to developing e-services 11. And the McCartney review12found instances where departments and agencies had been left with insufficientskills and experience to challenge and validate workdone by suppliers, resulting in delay and disruption. 3.20 The Inland Revenue, like overseas revenue authorities (see Appendix 6), has outsourced much of its workaround the development of internet services. Thedepartment relies on its partnership arrangements withEDS for direct IT support in developing e-services. Thedepartment still requires staff to manage, design and testeach project and then to operate and support the serviceonce it is available to the public. There are some 40 staffresponsible for the management and development of thedepartment's e-services, and a further 120 staff workingin the Electronic Business Unit to operate and supporteach service. 3.21 To date, the department has been able to rely on its existing team of IT project managers to deliver the e-services programme. EDS had faced some difficultiesin finding staff with specialist skills to develop theservices. The company is addressing this skills gap byrecruiting staff with the requisite skills, training existingstaff and by itself out-sourcing specific requirements - inparticular designing web based forms. 3.22 Of the 120 Inland Revenue staff in the Electronic Business Unit involved in operating and supporting thelive systems, around half work on the telephone and e-mail help desks to deal with customer enquiries. Theremainder provide support for live services, includingpromoting the services, business security andmaintenance, problem resolution, and customersatisfaction. We asked the department's Internal AuditOffice to undertake a review of recruitment and trainingof Electronic Business Unit staff on our behalf, includinga staff survey, to establish what lessons could be learntfor the future. In particular: 11 e-Government: Ready or Not?, British Telecom, 2000 12 McCartney Report: Successful IT: Modernising Government in Action, Cabinet Office, 200025 part threeE-REVENUE !The E-Business help desk. Existing staff are enthusiastic and eager to provide a good qualityservice. But a number of other large organisations alsooperate call centres nearby. Whilst this ensures aready pool of individuals with the right skills, it alsocreates competition for staff. The Internal Audit Officerecognised that the potential expansion of the InlandRevenue's help desk may give rise to future difficultiesin recruiting and retaining sufficient skilled staff. As aconsequence, the department is forging stronger linkswith other local employers to compare the terms andconditions offered. And the department is revisingtraining arrangements for help desk staff to keepindividuals up to date with changes to systems andthe implementation of new services. !Service support staff. Many of these service support staff require specific skills and experience. Themajority of the staff have been in post less than six months. Whilst many have transferred fromelsewhere in the Inland Revenue and have been ableto bring relevant skills and experience to their newpost, 69 per cent felt they had not yet received thenecessary training for their particular needs. TheInland Revenue is addressing this training need. 3.23 The results of the Internal Audit Office's work demonstrate that staffing will continue to change rapidly as the rangeand take up of e-services develop. Whilst localmanagement at the Electronic Business Unit havesuccessfully recruited and trained sufficient skilled staff todate, this may become more difficult as e-servicesdevelop. The department has already started to considerthe long term possible consequences on staffing bypreparing a model that would show staffing needs basedon a range of different scenarios. The Internal Audit Officehave shared the detail of their findings with the InlandRevenue's Human Resources team preparing this model.Monitoring the outcome of each project to learn lessons 3.24 The future success of the Inland Revenue's e-services will largely depend on the implementation of the lessonslearned as the programme develops. An early lessonlearned from the first year of the internet service for SelfAssessment, for example, was that it was difficult to correctany minor software errors once the computer programmehad been transferred onto CD-Roms and distributed tocustomers. As a consequence, all future internet serviceswill rely on software that can be accessed from the internetand, therefore, can be amended and updated by thedepartment whenever necessary. 3.25 Whilst senior staff in the Inland Revenue demonstrated to us that they are aware of the key lessons learned fromtheir work to date, few formal evaluation reviews havebeen conducted. We identified two reviews that had beenundertaken. The first was on the development of magneticmedia to enable companies to send data to the InlandRevenue on PAYE taxes paid by their staff, a precursor tothe electronic data interchange service, and dates back toNovember 1997. The second was a review by EzGov Inc.(November 2000) of the first year of the internet servicefor Self Assessment. Some 13 projects had beendeveloped and delivered by the end of June 2001 whichhave not yet had a formal evaluation review. The InlandRevenue has, however, confirmed that full projectevaluation reviews will be carried out in line with theirdepartmental project management methodology onceeach online service has been fully implemented. 3.26 The pace of change and the nature of build and learn makes it difficult to adopt traditional formal reviewprocesses. But as the programme continues to develop,it will become increasingly important to ensure thatlessons learned are evaluated and disseminated.What is Self Assessment? 1 Any United Kingdom citizen who is self employed, a company director, or has more complicated tax affairs,including higher rate taxpayers, is required each year tocomplete and submit a Self Assessment tax return to theInland Revenue. Self Assessment affects more than 8 million individuals, as well as 700,000 partnershipsand 300,000 trusts. Our report 'Inland Revenue IncomeTax Self Assessment' (HC 56 Session 2000-2001)explains the process in more detail. 2 In July 2000 the Inland Revenue offered individuals the opportunity to complete and send their ownSelf Assessment tax returns electronically via the internet.Since April 2001, anyone required to complete aSelf Assessment form can either complete and return thepaper form received through the post; access the web siteto print off a blank form to complete and return by post; orcomplete the on-line tax form and submit it electronically.How to send your return via the internet 3 In order to complete the form (Figure 15) and submit the details electronically, individuals can access the InlandRevenue web site at http://www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk.The key steps in the process are: !Register to use the service. Visit the Inland Revenue web site and follow 'internet services' and then'internet services for Self Assessment'. From here youcan link to the registration web pages where youenter your name, a password of your choice, yourUnique Taxpayer Reference number and either yourNational Insurance Number or your Postcode. Youwill receive a unique User ID through the post that,together with the password that you chose earlier,will enable you to activate the service and submityour tax return electronically. !Complete the tax return on-line. Complete your return using the on-line web form on the InlandRevenue web site, or by using one of the alternativeproducts provided by other organisations, such as the Consumer's Association, which arecompatible with Inland Revenue's Self Assessmentinternet service. !Contact the Inland Revenue (via telephone or e-mail) if you need help that you can't get from theweb site. There is a central help desk with up to 40 staff available from 8.00 am to 10.00 pm Mondayto Friday and 10.00 am to 6.00 pm at weekends todeal with any enquiries you might have about this orany of the department's other e-services. If you haveany tax queries, you will be advised to contact yourlocal tax office, or the Self Assessment help desk. !Ensure you get confirmation that the form wasreceived. The Inland Revenue will notify you on-line when a return has been received successfully. There are benefits from sending tax returns electronically 4 The main benefits to the taxpayer are: !Assurance that the return is arithmetically correct. the on-line tax form highlights all the boxes requiredto be filled in, does arithmetic checks as you goalong and calculates the revised tax. 26appendix one E-REVENUE Appendix 1 Internet service for Self Assessment The Self Assessment web site 15 Source: Inland Revenue web site E-REVENUE 27appendix one!Convenience. The Inland Revenue web site is available 24 hours a day anywhere in the world. Youcan complete the return in parts, save it and comeback to it using any browser anywhere. !Confirmation that the return was received is available on-line, but not for returns sent by post. !Speed of processing. Any tax refund will be processed more quickly if the tax return is receivedelectronically instead of through the post. 5 The main benefits to the Inland Revenue are: !Improved quality of service. The Inland Revenue is committed to providing an up to date and helpfulservice to all taxpayers. !Efficiency savings. Self Assessment forms sent electronically may reduce the administrative burdenon local tax offices. The department's initialestimates were that each return might make aefficiency saving of some \u00a33 administrative costs. !Improved accuracy. Information received via the internet has been typed and checked on-line sothere is smaller risk that human error will result in ataxpayer having to pay too much or too little tax. The service has improved since it was first introduced 6 The department designed and developed the internet service for Self Assessment quickly in order to meet theChancellor of the Exchequer's commitment that theservice would be available in April 2000. A registrationservice for taxpayers was available on schedule in April 2000, and it was possible to submit returns fromJuly 2000. The department offered a \u00a310 discount totaxpayers who filed their return electronically and paidany outstanding tax electronically by 31 January 2001. 7 The service remained available during the year, confirming the reliability and robustness of theunderlying technology. But initial teething problemswith the software and the need to download additionalsoftware from the internet caused problems for users.The Inland Revenue used its build and learn approach tomake improvements. Key changes for the revised service for 2000-01 tax returns to be submitted in 2001-02 include: !The forms are now available on-line. The Inland Revenue commissioned EzGov Inc. to design anddevelop a web based form for customers to use. !The service has been extended to a wider range ofcustomers, for example MAC users. !Help desk staff are briefed to deal with any queries.Better support systems and additional training meansthat help desk staff are more able to deal withcustomer queries.!Key software issues have been addressed. Many of the early teething problems have now been fixed. !Usability of the products and information on theweb site have been improved in response tocustomer feedback. Take up 8 Take up of the new e-service in the first year for 1999-00 tax returns was not as high as the departmenthad estimated. The department had estimated 315,000people might use the service. Some 129,000 individualsregistered for the service, but only 39,000 successfullysubmitted their tax return over the internet. 9 The department revised its estimated take up figures accordingly with a projection for 200,000 to completetheir return electronically over the internet in 2001-02.By 4 January 2002, 50,125 returns had been submittedsuccessfully. Wider lessons 10 The Inland Revenue's experience in developing the on-line Self Assessment tax service has highlighted anumber of lessons which might be relevant to its ownfuture e-services programme and those of otherGovernment departments. In particular: !It is possible for the public sector to deliver a majornew e-service in a short timescale. !The internet is a fast changing environment and it isimportant for a major Government department, suchas the Inland Revenue, to be at the forefront. Otherpublic sector organisations will then be betterplaced to utilise the lessons learnt. !There are benefits in putting out a product early sothat initial customer feedback can make the producteasier to use. It is, however, important to weigh upthe risks of adverse publicity from putting out aproduct that is not sufficiently developed against thebenefits of learning lessons quickly. !It is important to be able to update and revise thesoftware for e-services quickly, as the need forchanges comes to light. It is better, therefore, to useon-line systems rather than CD-Roms ordownloadable applications. !It takes time to persuade individuals to usetransaction based e-services, and there must be realadded value in the service to generate take up. !A small financial incentive might not, by itself,provide a sufficient reason for customers to use the service.What is paying by internet? 1 Many companies and retailers now offer their customers the choice of paying for their goods or services using adebit card or credit card over the internet. Since 10 January 2001 the Inland Revenue has offeredindividuals the opportunity to pay their Self Assessmenttax bills over the internet using a debit card. This servicewas extended to businesses for Pay As You Earn paymentsin April 2001. The payment service that the InlandRevenue offer is a Girobank product known as BillPay TM. The on-line payment solution offered by the InlandRevenue utilities Girobank's BillPay TMservice. How to pay your tax using the internet service 2 In order to pay using the internet the customer enters the Girobank website at www.billpayment.co.uk (Figure 16) which can be also be accessed from the Inland Revenue's web site (www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk)via a hyperlink. 3 The key steps are: !Registration. The first time that a customer uses the service they need to register with BillPayTM, which requires the customer to enter a password and theirname and address. !Complete details of payment to be made. The customer enters the details of their debit card, theInland Revenue customer number and the paymentamount (the minimum payment to the InlandRevenue is \u00a31 and the maximum is \u00a3100,000). !Girobank process the information. Once the details of the payment have been entered on screen,Girobank process the information and authorise theamount on-line. Girobank then debit the bankaccount and credit the Inland Revenue by theamount instructed and send an electronic file to theInland Revenue, which will be used to update thetaxpayer's record. 28appendix twoE-REVENUE Appendix 2 Payments by internet Alliance and Leicester Plc E-REVENUE 29appendix twoWhat benefits are there for the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue? 4 The main benefits to the taxpayer are: !Better customer service. This service provides the facility to pay 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. !Confirmation that payment will be made. The on-line authorisation process provides assurancethat payment will be made. !Another payment channel. The service extends the range of existing electronic payment methods such asBACS, CHAPS and using your debit card over the phone. 5 The main benefits to the Inland Revenue are: !Efficiency savings. These should result from reduced handling of paper and manual intervention, whencompared with other methods of electronic payment. !Faster service. Faster 'start to finish' life cycle for processing of payments by bypassing ofclerical processes. !Reduced transaction costs. Banks charge electronic payments at a lower rate. How was the service developed? 6 The Inland Revenue originally planned to use an internet payment service that was to be part of the GovernmentGateway project. When the Government Gateway projectencountered contractual difficulties, in Autumn 2000, itbecame unclear when an internet payment service wouldbecome available through the Gateway. 7 The Inland Revenue recognised that it was important to provide an internet payment service to support the 2001Self Assessment payments peaks (from January 2001) andalso to provide another electronic payments channel.Taxpayers qualified for a \u00a310 discount if they filed andpaid any tax due electronically. Small businesses alsoqualified for a \u00a350 discount when they submitted their2000-01 Pay As You Earn end of year returns and paidany taxes due electronically. The department decided toconsider third party options which could be deployed intime for January 2001 and which would provide anintervening tactical solution until the issues around usingthe Government Gateway were resolved. 8 The department opted for BillPay TMbecause it was a cost effective solution. In particular: !It was an established service that, worked and required no further development, and provided value for money. !It could be delivered within the time frame. !Data that Girobank would need to send the InlandRevenue could be sent using existing Girobankroutes to the Inland Revenue's back end systems.Take up 9 Initially the service was introduced to a limited population. This was achieved by: !Limiting the publicity of the service to a press releaseand advertising it on the department's web page. !Initially limiting the maximum payment to \u00a31,999.This was subsequently increased to \u00a319,999 and laterto \u00a3100,000. 10 Over 2,800 payments have been made using the service, the majority from Self Assessment taxpayers(Figure 17) . These payments have brought in over \u00a33.5 million at a transactional cost of just over \u00a3700. Future plans for the service 11 BillPayTMis contracted to run for at least two years. By this time the Government Gateway should offer apayment service and the Inland Revenue are presentlyreviewing options to determine whether BillPay TM should continue to run in parallel as a separate paymentservice or whether all payments by internet should gothrough the Government Gateway. Wider lessons 12 A number of lessons arise from the development of the internet payments service that might be applicable tothe Inland Revenue's future e-services programme andthose of other Government departments. In particular: !Being able to make payments over the internet is acrucial part of a comprehensive e-service. !It is possible to deliver an internet payment servicein a very short timescale, by using or adapting anestablished service. Commercial products areavailable that can be incorporated into an e-serviceat minimal developmental cost. !Minimal publicity when the service was firstintroduced enabled the department to test and refinethe product with a small number of users. Payments by internet 17 Internet payments up to 31 December averaged over \u00a31,000 Self Assessment Employers taxpayers Transactions made 2,456 395Total value of payments \u00a33,085,000 \u00a31 received \u00a30.0002 \u00a30.000230appendix threeE-REVENUE 1 The Inland Revenue communicates with more than one million employers to administer the Pay As You Earn taxsystem. Each month employers send the department taxdetails for some 22 million employees. Before the launchof the electronic data interchange service in October 1997 communication relied on magnetic mediaand paper forms. Data communication problems meantup to 60 per cent of records would be inaccurate,generating delays and further paperwork. The projectaimed to provide a means of electronic communicationwith employers and payroll operators using an electronicdata interchange instead. Its objectives were to: !Reduce the burden on employers of compliancewith Pay As You Earn Regulations. !Reduce routine manual data processing.!Improve the quality of information transferredbetween the Inland Revenue and employers. !Improve customer service generally. What is electronic data interchange? 2 Electronic data interchange is the transfer of data from an application running on the computer of one organisationto an application running on the computer of a partnerorganisation with no manual intervention. It is a securecommunication service using an international electronicdata interchange message standard known as EDIFACT.These messages pass from and to the employer's payrollsystem over private communications systems known asValue Added Networks (Figure 18) . The service is not e-mail and does not use the internet.Appendix 3Sending Pay As You Earn tax data across anelectronic data interchange How the electronic data interchange works18 Electronic data interchange enables the exchange of documents in a structured and secure format from one organisation's computer system to another's without human intervention Source: Inland RevenueDetails are sent across Value Added Networks (VANs) The data are received by the department's gateway and translated back from EDIFACT Data are collated by EDS and transmitted to Inland RevenueEach month data are translated into EDIFACT and transmitted through the organisation's gateway Inland Revenue Business Data are sent to relevant local tax offices for processingPayroll details are put onto the organisation's payroll system3 Large organisations are familiar with the concept of electronic data interchange. Around 20,000 businessesin the United Kingdom already use such systems forcommercial operations, such as procurement and stock control. Benefits of using an electronic data interchange 4 The department's electronic data interchange offers benefits to the Inland Revenue and the organisationsusing the service: (i) Benefits to organisations using the service !Sending data electronically reduces the number ofqueries that have to be followed up. There is a highrisk of human error from manually inputting largevolumes of data onto a computer system and datasent by magnetic media can frequently becorrupted. A reduction in the typical error rate from60 per cent of records to around 10 per cent wouldmean no longer having to re-check the records ofsome 5,000 staff each month in an organisation with10,000 employees. !The organisation will be able to achieve some savings in the cost of stationery and postage required. !The immediate confirmation and acknowledgementof information sent over the electronic datainterchange means that any outstanding issues canbe dealt with at the time. As a consequence, payrollstaff in an organisation will have the relevantinformation to hand and should be able to resolveany problems more easily. (ii) Benefits to the Inland Revenue !The Inland Revenue estimated staff savings in theregion of 160 posts, amounting to some \u00a320 millionby 2003-04, based on a take up of 40 per centamongst targeted organisations. The savings wouldarise because data sent by paper form would nolonger require inputting onto a computer system andthe error rates for these and data sent by magneticmedia would fall from around 60 per cent to some10 to 15 per cent of records. !A further estimated \u00a32 million savings would arisefrom reduced stationery, and postage costs from nothaving to send out Tax Coding Instructions (Form P6)and reduced storage requirements in local taxoffices for the paper forms.5 The electronic data interchange service was first available to businesses in October 1997. Since then, afurther seven Pay As You Earn tax forms, such as a P46(new employee details), have been successfully addedto the system. The service cost \u00a31.8 million to developbetween 1998-99 and 2000-01 and once it was rolledout nationally in 1999 it is likely to cost some \u00a36.7 million to operate up to 2003-04. Take up 6 Business interest in the electronic data interchange service for Pay As You Earn tax returns has been high.Some 660 organisations have contacted the InlandRevenue to inquire about this new service and 49 areusing it. The department has noted that many of theremaining organisations that had approached the InlandRevenue had subsequently been found to be too smallto be suitable for the electronic data interchangeservice. The participating organisations represent over5,000 payroll schemes, involving some 6 milliontaxpayers. The main constraint on take up has been thatthe five account managers received a substantialnumber of enquiries. They were not able to initiatecontact with a number of other organisations who mayhave been unaware of the service. A further constraint isthe availability of electronic data interchange payrollsoftware applications. The Inland Revenue continues towork closely with Payroll Software vendors to encouragethem to include the required functionality in theirpayroll products. Wider lessons 7 A number of lessons arise from the development of an electronic data interchange service for Pay As You Earntax returns that might be applicable to the InlandRevenue's future e-services programme and those ofother Government departments: !The internet is not the only means of delivering e-services. Other systems, such as electronic datainterchange might be more appropriate for highvolume transactions. !The steady growth in the take up of the servicereflects the fact that the service offers clear benefitsto users. !Improving take up will generate significant financialbenefits to the Inland Revenue.E-REVENUE 31appendix threeWe used a variety of methods to examine e-Revenue: 1 Interviews, discussion and examination of documents We carried out interviews with key personnel involved in the development, delivery and support of the InlandRevenue's e-services. We reviewed the InlandRevenue's e-business strategy, its reported progress andother key documents. We sat with help desk staff toobserve customer inquiries and interviewed staff fromsome of the companies, such as EDS and Girobank,responsible for delivering key e-services. 2 Case studies Whilst our examination covered all the department's e-services, we reviewed three specific e-services ingreater depth to identify good practices and lessonslearned. We selected the projects to represent broadlythe range of services available, both internet and noninternet, those that were crucial to the success of thewhole programme and the payments by internet projectbecause it is the first such government service available.The three projects selected were: !Internet service for Self Assessment (Appendix 1). !Payments by internet (Appendix 2). !Electronic data interchange to enable employers tosend large volumes of employee Pay As You Earn taxdetails to the department (Appendix 3). 3 Experiences of selected private sector and overseas organisations Direct comparisons of performance between the Inland Revenue and other organisations should be treated withcaution as a range of factors will impact on deliveringelectronic services including legislative, organisational,economic, political, social and cultural differences. Wesought the views of senior representatives from twoprivate sector companies at the forefront in thedevelopment of e-services to identify good practices that might be applicable to the Inland Revenue(Appendix 5). These companies were: !Abbey National Plc. !First Direct Plc. We also drew on a range of existing research papers and contacted the Supreme Audit Institutions and respectiverevenue authorities in six countries to draw out furthergood practices in developing e-services (Appendix 6). 4 Research into the constraints to take up We commissioned Professor Helen Margetts of University College London and Lorien Consulting Ltd toundertake research on our behalf into the possibleconstraints that might deter customers from usingGovernment's and the Inland Revenue's e-services andwhat might be done to overcome such barriers.Appendix 7 summarises their work. 5 Expert panel We invited a range of experts to advise us on ourapproach, emerging findings and recommendations.The members of the panel were: !David Blair, Senior IT Architect, Department forWork and Pensions (formerly Social Security). !John Butters, Partner, Ernst & Young. !Stefan Czerniawski, Deputy Director, of the e-Envoy. !Ambrose McGinn, E-Commerce and StrategicDevelopment Director, Abbey National Muid, Head of Government BusinessChange, Methodology1 have been developing e-services for a number of years and Governmentdepartments have an opportunity to learn from theirexperiences. This appendix summarises theachievements of two companies in the United Kingdomat the forefront in developing e-services and highlights anumber of good practices that might be applicable toGovernment departments. Abbey National Plc 2 Abbey National Plc converted from a building society into a bank in July 1989. The conversion enabled the companyto realise \u00a3975 million of capital and to use some of thismoney to diversify its interests, products and services andto expand quickly. By 2000, Abbey National Plc was thefifth largest bank in the United Kingdom 13and the second largest residential mortgage lender. 3 In late 1999 Abbey National Plc had recognised that its existing e-commerce services were behind most otherfinancial service providers in the United Kingdom. Itwas primarily an 'all bricks' institution with no on-linetransaction based e-services. As a consequence, thecompany set up a separate division within the retailbank to develop its e-commerce services. The newdivision was headed by a Director of E-Commerce,Retail Banking who was reassigned a seat on the UnitedKingdom retail board. 4 The e-commerce division developed a 'clicks and bricks' strategy which aimed to integrate the electronic channelswith existing physical channels. The approach wasdesigned to give customers choice about how they dealwith the bank and increase convenience for managingtheir personal finances. Key achievements include: !November 1999 Launch of an e-service on Sky Active digital television !March 2000 Launch on T elewest digital television !May 2000 Launch of e-banking service on the internet !July 2000 Launch of service on Orange network !November 2000 Launch of service on NTL and ITV digitial television !June 2001 Launch of service on BTInternet.Take up of e-services 5 Abbey National Plc has targeted its e-services towards the needs of specific customer groups, such as middleincome families. The emphasis has been on providing e-services that offer a clear benefit to customers and thatare readily available, either on the internet or throughdigital television. The internet services, for example,offer customers full e-banking capabilities so thatpersonal finances can be managed more conveniently. 6 Take up has been encouraging, with over 1 million registrations and over 250,000 product applications.The bank recognises that take up will continue to growsteadily and anticipates growth in the use of its e-services of around 20 per cent by 2005.Abbey National Plc has not, however, set any specifictargets on the number of people it expects to use its e-services by a specific date. Improving the services available 7 A key part of Abbey National Plc's forward strategy is to continue to monitor external developments andemerging technologies. This will enable the bank tobuild on its supporting infrastructure and capabilities. 8 The physical branch network remains key to the business and is at the heart of the 'clicks and bricks'strategy. To provide the customer with an integratedservice, Abbey National Plc has begun to introduce aconvenience retailing strategy for its branch network.This involves enhancing the branch network bydeveloping superstore branches that include CostaCoffee facilities, interactive digital television, CarphoneWarehouse information and internet facilities to providean appealing environment for customers, see Figure 19 . First Direct Plc 9 First Direct Plc is a division of HSBC Bank Plc, a wholly owned subsidiary of HSBC Holdings Plc one of theworld's largest banking and financial servicesorganisations. First Direct Plc was established in 1989,and in October that year set up its telephone bankingservice with 1,000 calls taken on the first day. Thecustomer base grew steadily, and in 1994 the companyachieved break-even for the financial year for the firsttime. In 1998 personal computer banking services were added, followed in 1999 by mobile phone andinternet banking.E-REVENUE 33appendix fiveAppendix 5 Private sector experiences 13 Based on revenue income34E-REVENUEappendix fiveThe development of superstore branches by Abbey National Plc 19 Source: Abbey National Plc 10 The bank comprises a small number of divisions tasked with addressing particular customer needs. Thesecustomer facing divisions, such as CustomerManagement, Customer Services, and ElectronicServices employ around 85 per cent of the bank's 4,300 staff. The remaining divisions (such as IT, financeand people resources) provide the necessary support forthe core customer facing areas. 11 The organisation of the bank is based upon two core principles: !Knowledge of the customer base, using integrated information management systems and customerrelationship management. !People developed to fit the business needs. Staff are recruited with communications skills, but taughtbanking and company core values through acomprehensive in house training programme. Take up of e-services 12 First Direct Plc has seen a steady growth in customers over a 10 year period rising progressively to 1 millioncustomers by 2001. The current assumption is that futuregrowth will remain steady. Since the introduction ofinternet banking, the pattern of customer contacts haschanged dramatically with a growing percentage ofcustomers now using on-line facilities in preference tothe telephone. 13 Early marketing aimed at raising public awareness of the bank's e-services and was not aimed at specificcustomer groups. Recent marketing initiatives haveproved more successful by focusing on specificcustomer groups to highlight the benefits of e-services.The bank, for example, e-mailed 'dormant' customers ofits personal computer banking (people who had notused the service for 90 days) to encourage them to usethe internet banking service instead.Improving the services available 14 First Direct Plc has adopted a build and learn approach to the development of e-services. The bank hasprioritised its programme of future projects and services,taking account of the predominantly in house IT team'scapabilities. Products are pilot tested initially with asmall number of selected customers to enable the finalproduct to be refined before a high profile targetedmarketing campaign. Wider issues 15 In drawing any lessons from the experiences of Abbey National Plc and First Direct Plc it is important torecognise that there are differences in the role andresponsibilities of private sector companies andGovernment departments, such as the Inland Revenue.Nevertheless, sharing good practices is an importanttwo-way process for the public and private sectors.Generic principles and good practices relevant to theInland Revenue and other Government departments andagencies include: !Achieving rapid take up of e-services is likely to bechallenging. Our discussions indicated that bothorganisations expect take up to increase by around20 per cent by 2005, although neither organisationhas set specific targets. !E-services need to be focused around customers'needs. Customer research enabled bothorganisations to design services and re-organisework around these needs. !The successful development of e-services involvestaking risks and minimising the impact on theorganisation if things go wrong. A high profile failurewould damage customer confidence in theorganisation's e-services and affect future take uplevels. Both organisations broke development workinto a number of small discrete projects and pilottested each one before encouraging customers touse the service.E-REVENUE 35appendix fiveappendix six 36E-REVENUE 1 Many national governments are developing e-services and are facing similar risks and challenges as the InlandRevenue. The Inland Revenue has developed a network ofcontacts in many countries to compare progress and offeradvice where applicable. The Canadian Customs andRevenue Agency noted, for example, that it often looks tothe Inland Revenue for its leadership and experience inthe development of e-services. 2 Direct comparisons between countries should be treated with caution. Differences in legislative requirements andtaxation policies will impact on progress in developing e-services. In Australia, for example, taxpayers have anincentive to submit returns electronically as the majority oftaxpayers are usually due a refund from the AustralianTaxation Office each year and the electronic service is thequickest way of getting it. Against this background, thisappendix summarises developments elsewhere andhighlights a number of good practices that might beapplicable to Government departments and agencies inthe United Kingdom. 3 Different countries have developed their own approach and set their own targets for developing e-services. A report by Accenture in April 2001 14examined progress made in 22 countries and concluded that all had madeprogress, albeit at different rates and different levels ofsophistication. Cabinet Office comparisons of progress in14 leading countries 15demonstrated that national government targets have focussed on making e-servicesavailable to the public. The Singapore Government, hasestimated that the introduction of electronic filing of taxreturns via the internet and the telephone saves it some\u00a320 million a year. 4 World wide progress in developing electronic tax services follows a similar pattern. A survey of 15 leading countriesby the Organisation for Economic Co-operation andDevelopment (OECD) in September 2000 16found that all revenue authorities had their own web site and werefocussing efforts on making existing services availableelectronically to their taxpayers. The Inland Revenue hasbeen keen to take on board best practice from elsewhereand to share its own good practices and developmentalideas. The department actively participates in the OECD and has developed a network of contacts in manyof these countries.5 The OECD report concluded that the revenue authorities in the 15 countries recognised that newtechnologies provided an opportunity to improvetaxpayer services and reduce administrative costs. A number of the authorities already used electronic data interchange services to communicate with largebusinesses. Eleven countries offered the facility fortaxpayers to prepare their tax returns on-line and toaccept electronic filing of the completed forms. 6 We wrote to the revenue authorities in a number of countries to examine progress made since the OECDreport and to draw out good practices that might beapplicable to the Inland Revenue and other Governmentdepartments and agencies in the United Kingdom. Progress made Australia 7 The Australian Tax Office launched its web site (www.ato.gov.au) in 1995. The site provides a range ofinformation, forms and tax calculators. Since 1991, theTax Office has offered taxpayers an opportunity to transact electronically. Services available in 2001 include: !E-Tax - taxpayers can use the service to prepare and lodge income tax returns via the internet. The servicewas introduced in 1998 and aimed at the 3 millionindividuals that prepare their own tax returns eachyear. The software takes users through an on-screeninterview and automatically completes the tax returnbased on the answers to the questions. There were27,000 lodgements in 1998-99, and this rose to 117,000 in 1999-00 and some 280,000 in 2000-01. !Electronic Lodgement Service enables tax agents to lodge their client's tax returns and other tax formselectronically via a modem. Whilst a paper based taxlodgement could take up to seven weeks to process,the e-service has a ten day turnaround. The Tax Officeprocesses some 9 million taxpayer returns each yearand 75 per cent are lodged using this service. 14 'Rhetoric vs Reality - Closing the Gap', Accenture, April 2001 15 'e-Government: Benchmarking Electronic Service Delivery', Office of the e-Envoy, July 2000 and July 200116 'Survey of Taxpayer Service Initiatives Using New Technology', OECD, September 2000E-REVENUE Appendix 6 Overseas experiencesappendix sixCanada 8 The Canadian Customs and Revenue Agency launched its web site (www.ccra-adrc.gc.ac) in 1995. The siteprovides a wide range of information for taxpayers. In2000, the Agency offered individuals the opportunity tofile directly to the Agency over the internet and currentservices include: !Electronic filing of income tax returns. Taxpayers can file income tax returns by telephone (the'telefile' service), across the internet (the 'netfile'service) or since 1990 through agents using the 'e-file' service. Over 34 per cent of the targetpopulation used one of these methods in 2000-01,of which 6 per cent of the target population use theinternet service. !Electronic services for business. A number of services, such as electronic data interchangeservices, existed before 1999. The Agency plans tointroduce an internet service for businesses in May 2002. !Tax information phone system (TIPS). This is an automated telephone service that provides generaland personal tax advice. Japan 9 The National Tax Agency has a web site (www.nta.go.jp) that contains information for taxpayers and businesses.There were some 800,000 hits on the web site in 1999.Whilst Japanese taxpayers cannot yet submit their taxreturns electronically, the Agency's web site offers taxreturn and application forms, and a handbook toexplain how to fill them in. The Agency is currentlydeveloping an on-line service. Netherlands 10 The Dutch revenue service launched its web site (www.belastingdienst.nl) in 1999. The site is broadlystructured according to the needs of different customergroups, such as the young and older people. The site offers information on tax, downloadable softwareand electronic forms. The e-services available include: !Electronic submission of tax returns. Taxpayers can complete and submit their tax returns electronically.Some 1.3 million taxpayers submitted electronicreturns in 1999, 580,000 via a modem and 720,000on a diskette. This represents some 18 per cent of the7.2 million taxpayers required to submit returns. !E-mail enquiries. Taxpayers can e-mail the Dutch revenue service for guidance. Internet users canraise questions on an internet form which is thenhandled by their relevant tax office. The softwareenables frequently asked questions to be dealt withby a standard reply and for tax officers to deal withmore complicated questions. Norway 11 A range of downloadable software and publications are available from the Norwegian Revenue web site(www.skatteetat.no). The services available include: !Submission of tax returns. Taxpayers can submit their returns electronically, either by telephone oracross the internet. Some 20 per cent of taxpayerssubmitted their returns electronically in 2000-01. !Payment of taxes. Citizens and businesses can pay income, property and sales taxes on-line. Republic of Ireland 12 The Irish Revenue's web site (www.revenue.ie), launched in 1996, contains some 10,000 pages ofinformation, leaflets and returns. It currently receivesover 800,000 hits a month. In September 2000 theRevenue-on-Line Service (www.ros.ie) was launchedand enabled businesses (both individuals andcompanies) to electronically file and make on-linepayments, through an internet link. Large taxpayerswere targeted in order to maximise impact, inconjunction with this a low key advertising campaignsought to highlight the benefits of the service to thegeneral customer base. This approach enabled anysoftware glitches to be rectified without any adverse publicity. 13 In the first year of operation total receipts for electronic payments totalled 1.5 billion. Wider lessons 14 A number of lessons arise from the experiences of the six countries that might be applicable to Governmentdepartments' and agencies' future e-services programmes: On improving take up !Better take up of existing services will benefit therevenue authorities. However none of the authoritieswe contacted were able to quantify the benefits of e-services, they confirmed that improved take upwould generate efficiency savings. !Encouraging taxpayers to use e-services is notstraightforward. Many of the countries we contactedrecognised that there were a range of factors thatmight deter the public from using such e-services. Examples included security concerns andwhether there was sufficient customer support.None of the countries we contacted had specifictargets on future levels of take up, except theRepublic of Ireland's Revenue Commissioners whohave set a target of having 50 per cent of businessreturns filed electronically by 2005.E-REVENUE 37appendix six!A number of countries recognised the need to demonstrate the benefits of e-services in order toencourage the public to change their attitudes toGovernment e-services. Marketing should addressissues of concern to taxpayers, and offer some sort ofincentive to use the service. The Canadian Customsand Revenue Agency, for example, conductedextensive market research to establish what thepublic wanted from its e-services, and used this datato inform policy and service development. On improving the services available !There must be a shared corporate vision of what e-services can achieve. The development of e-servicesis not just a technological issue, it will change the waythe organisation works. It is vital to have commitmentfrom all staff, especially senior managers, as well assuppliers and other key stakeholders. !E-services should be orientated around the needs ofcustomers. The Dutch revenue agency's web site forexample is, like the Inland Revenue's site, structuredaround the needs of specific user groups. And mostof the tax authorities, like the Inland Revenue, hadtelephone and e-mail help desks to provide supportfor their e-services, answer queries, offer informationon tax matters and invite feedback. !The development of e-services might focus on keyactivities in the shorter term but there needs to be alonger term plan to modernise 'back office' systems.Tax authorities recognise the importance of joined upGovernment services to encourage take up andgenerate efficiency savings. Such integration requiresimprovements in 'back office' computer systems toenable better communication of information.!E-services should be pilot tested with selectedcustomers. Pilot testing enables a tax authority toidentify any major software errors and to gaugecustomer reaction before a new service is marketedand made available to its customers. A number ofthe countries we contacted highlighted theimportance of this stage and how they had modifiedservices in response to early customer feedback inthe pilot stage. !It is important to have sufficient staff with the rightskills to develop and operate e-services. Skilled e-service software developers continue to be indemand and, as a consequence, most of the taxauthorities we contacted had contracted out thesetasks. Skilled in-house staff are also critical to runninge-services successfully and it might be necessary toprovide support and training to help them to adjust tothe organisational and cultural changes required. TheAustralian Tax Office, for example, recognises that e-business requires changes to existing ways of staffworking and thinking and, as a consequence, hasdeveloped a Cultural Change initiative to support itse-services strategy. 38E-REVENUEappendix sevenE-REVENUE 391 This appendix examines what factors might deter the public from using the Inland Revenue's e-services,and identifies what might be done to overcome such constraints. 2 We commissioned two pieces of research: !A review of the general obstacles to the development of e-Government by Professor Margettsfrom University College London, in conjunctionwith our separate examination of the progress acrossGovernment in developing e-services. !An examination by Lorien Consulting Ltd of thefactors that might constrain public take up of theInland Revenue's e-services. Constraints to using e-services 3 We have drawn on the general obstacles identified by Professor Margetts and the work done by Lorien Consulting Ltd to identify five factors that mightinfluence public attitudes to the take up of the InlandRevenue's e-services. This is a complex issue and werecognise the factors might differ for each customergroup. Further research needs to be done to determine themagnitude of each factor for each group. The factors are: i Citizen demand. Use of the internet is driven by customer demand for the services offered, and e-services should offer something that the public require.Low usage might indicate that the particular e-servicedoes not meet public needs. The most significantconstraint to take up of the Inland Revenue's existing e-services is that the public might perceive that there arefew incentives to use these services. Some taxpayersmight have opted to use the internet service for SelfAssessment the first year it was introduced, for example,because the novelty of the service appealed to'innovators' - people who regularly search the internetand like to trial new services. Take up will only improveif the Inland Revenue demonstrates that the e-serviceoffers other clear benefits to users. The Inland Revenuerecognises this issue and are drawing up plans toenhance the Self Assessment service for 2002 and thedepartment is considering other ways of making the e-service more attractive.ii Transaction costs. The cost to a member of the public of changing to electronic methods of communication mightbe high. The perceived inconvenience of changing anestablished way of doing something might deter peoplefrom investing the time and effort required to start usinge-services instead. Potential users of the InlandRevenue's e-services, such as the internet service for SelfAssessment, are likely to be 'cash rich' and 'time poor'.As a consequence, the cost of using e-services, such astelephone call charges, is relatively low for high ratetaxpayers, and unlikely to deter people from using theInland Revenue's e-services. Whereas the time requiredto log on to the internet and to learn how to complete theforms electronically might be a deterrent. iii Security. Concerns that others could access data sent electronically might deter people. Transactions withGovernment departments should be secure and shouldbe seen to be secure. There is a diverse range of opinionon the importance of security to users. The internet ischaracterised by an inherently high level of perceivedrisk and some users considered it to be a very real issue.Other users commented that such concerns evaporateonce users gain experience with the internet andsuccessfully complete internet based transactions. Wewere satisfied that the Inland Revenue's securitystandards matched best practice. iv Social exclusion. This is caused by the problem of unequal access to the internet. Social exclusion is lessrelevant to the Inland Revenue's existing services than itis for other departments. Higher rate taxpayers requiredto complete Self Assessment tax returns each year andbusiness customers are more likely to have access to theinternet than other social groups. The Inland Revenue isconsidering ways of working with intermediaries, suchas the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureau,as an alternative way for e-services to be accessed. v Formality. The internet and web-based technologies are often associated with fun or enjoyment. The publicmight perceive communication by electronic means asinappropriate for some matters, such as personal tax.However, this concern can largely be addressed by overcoming worries about the security of such transactions. The Inland Revenue has alreadyestablished a secure system.E-REVENUE Appendix 7 Constraints to using e-servicesappendix seven 40E-REVENUE What might be done to overcome such constraints 4 The Inland Revenue is addressing many of the above issues. We believe that focusing further effort as follows,will enable the department to improve take up: Step 1: Understand customer needs 5 Potential users of the Inland Revenue's e-services have different customer needs and expectations. The needsand expectations of higher rate taxpayers and the selfemployed will differ from those of companies orcharities. It is important to communicate regularly witheach customer group to ensure future services meetthese needs and expectations 6 The Inland Revenue has made progress in establishing what e-services the public might require. The InlandRevenue hosted consultative meetings with businessleaders in April 2001 to establish what the privatesector might require from the planned e-service forCorporation Tax. Other initiatives have includedcontacting taxpayers in Spring 2001 who had used theinternet service for Self Assessment for their views andthe introduction of a feedback mechanism on theInland Revenue's web site in Spring 2001. Suchinitiatives will assist in developing and improving futuree-services, although further work is required to developmore detailed needs analysis for each customer group. Step 2: Have a clear strategy to encourage take up 7 The take up strategy should address the appropriate needs of each customer group identified in step 1 andwhat can be done to overcome the associated factorsthat might deter each group from using the InlandRevenue's e-services. 8 The Inland Revenue has developed a departmental marketing strategy. The strategy needs to set out moreclearly what needs to be done to encourage take up ofe-services. Recent initiatives, for example, focussed onpublicising the Self Assessment internet service andhave not covered other services, such as the electronicdata interchange Pay As You Earn service. Step 3: Develop services that add more value 9 E-services should offer customers some benefit. There are already clear benefits to organisations that can sendPay As You Earn tax data across an electronic datainterchange to the Inland Revenue (see Appendix 3).Whilst there are also benefits to taxpayers using the SelfAssessment internet service (see Appendix 1), progressso far in encouraging take up suggests more needs to bedone. In particular, initiatives to make the form easier tocomplete, such as reducing the number of questions tobe answered and providing data already known, forexample copies of completed tax forms from previousyears, would encourage more people to use this e-service. The Inland Revenue is taking forward theseinitiatives as part of its development of a revised SelfAssessment internet service. "}
