Role of the committee The Herbal Medicines Advisory Committee's (HMAC) terms of reference are to: To give advice on safety, quality and efficacy in relation to human use, of: - a) herbal medicinal products eligible for registration under the simplified traditional use registration procedure set out in Part 7 of the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 - b) unlicensed herbal medicinal products (unless it is subject to an application for a marketing authorisation, product licence or a homeopathic certificate of registration) The role of the Committee will concern primarily issues relating to safety and quality, since there is not a requirement for efficacy to be separately demonstrated in relation to registered traditional herbal medicines or unlicensed products. However, efficacy is still relevant - under the traditional herbal registration scheme, the pharmacological effects or efficacy of the medicinal product must be plausible on the basis of longstanding use and experience. The Code of Practice Code of Practice on conflicts of interest applies to chairs, members, co-opted members and invited and patient experts of all our scientific advisory committees. See [Code of Practice](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1103036/2022.09.07_The_Code.pdf). The principles in the Code also apply to observers and invited experts who are asked to contribute written advice and do not attend committee meetings.
