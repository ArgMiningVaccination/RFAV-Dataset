The University was founded in 1818 and is the oldest university west of the Mississippi River. Saint Louis University began when Louis William DuBourg, bishop of Louisiana, opened St. Louis Academy in a one -story house. DuBourg offered land to the Society of Jesus for a Native American School which became chartered as Saint Louis University in 1832. The U.S. campus moved to its present site on Grand Boulevard in 1888. The University's mission is the pursuit of truth for the greater glory of God and for the service of humanity . The University is governed by a Board of Trustees and administered by a pre sident who is the chief executive officer. About 9 8% of the full -time tenured and tenure track faculty at the University hold the highest degree in their field. The University is classified as a Research University/High Research Activity by the Carnegie Foundation. The Five Dimensions of the Saint Louis University Experience The Five Dimensions of the Saint Louis University Experience challenge all members of our community to strive for excellence, become men and women for others, integrate classroom a nd out - of-classroom learning, develop their talents through discovery and reflection, and be concerned for each person ( cura personalis ). All members of the University community are expected to contribute to the development and sustainability of community through word and action. Our community is characterized by respect for the dignity of others, honesty, and the pursuit of truth. These Dimensions are created to ensure the right and privileges of all and to preserve the integrity of our learning community. Scholarship and Knowledge By developing a well -rounded educational foundation which incorporates learning through experience, becoming scholars in their chosen fields, and dedicating themselves to the advancement of knowledge, students are prepared for a dvanced study, their careers, and lifelong learning. Intellectual Inquiry and Communication By developing intellectual inquiry and communication, students are able to learn effectively, express ideas and concepts clearly, and apply their knowledge to new situations they encounter. 8 Community Building By welcoming and working with others, regardless of race, color, ethnicity, national origin, ancestry, religion, gender, disability, age, sexual orientation, marital status, military status, pregnancy, or an y other characteristic protected by law, students build an inclusive community which leads to respect and compassion for human life and the dignity of each person. Leadership and Service By serving others and by promoting social justice, students become m en and women for others who lead by their example. Spirituality and Values By developing their spirituality, values, and openness to the transcendent, students determine principles to guide their actions and their relationships with others. The Mission of Graduate Education at Saint Louis University The Mission of Saint Louis University's Graduate Education is to advance the frontiers of knowledge and technical expertise and to prepare students to make their own contributions to such advances in their di sciplines and professions by helping them carry out their responsibilities in an ethical and professional manner. In realizing this mission, Graduate Education at Saint Louis University is committed to specific goals and objectives: To articulate a visio n of excellence for the post -baccalaureate community To bring an institution -wide perspective to all post -baccalaureate endeavors To maintain high academic standards across all academic disciplines To promote the ideals of a Catholic, Jesuit education To promote the research mission of the University To enhance the community of scholars among both post -baccalaureate students and faculty To develop strategies for post -baccalaureate education that contribute to and enhance undergraduate education To se rve as an advocate for post -baccalaureate education To emphasize the institution -wide importance of educating future college, university and high school teachers, and professionals in a variety of fields To serve as an advocate for issues and constituenc ies critical to the success of post -baccalaureate education To support and further the non -academic interests and needs of post -baccalaureate students Taken from the Saint Louis University Cat alog: Graduate Education 2016 -2017, pg 4. http://www.slu.edu/services/registrar/catalog/20162017.html See Graduate Education website: http://www.slu.edu/academics/graduate 9 Saint Louis University School of Nursing The School of Nursing has achieved a national recognition and has been a leader in nursing education since it was founded in 1928 .

Approval body: General Faculty Assembly , Reviewed and revised: November 18, 2013 11 Philosophy The Sc hool of Nursing, as an integral compon ent of Saint Lou is University, upho lds the Jud aeo- Christian philosophy and mission of the University to pursue truth for the greater Glory of God and for the service of humanity . The faculty of the School of Nursing believes that all pers ons are creat ed by God and possess intrinsic worth and dignity. We believe the very origin of nursing lies in the fundamental capacity to care for those in need. Recognition of cura personalis requires that acc eptance, comp assion and respect erize relati onships a mong faculty, staff, admin istrators, and students in the School, and relat ionsh ips with individuals, families, and communities and other health care professio nals in nursing practice settings. The Sc hool of provides a co llegial enviro nment of aca demic freedom in w hich students develop knowledge, i nsight, values, accountability, and prof essional compet ence. Study of the liberal arts provides an essential foundat ion for the de velopm ent of an ed ucated person. Such an ed ucation assists stud ents to devel op great er knowledge of sel f, of God, of other peop le, and of the world in which they live. Attr ibutes, s uch as intel lectual i nsights, collaboration, communication, logical and analytical skills, and the e xercise of in dependent judgment, are acquired through study of the humaniti es and the biol ogical, phys ical, behavi oral, and social sciences. Th is foundati on also facilitates the study and practice of professional nursing. Nursi ng as a profession and as a d iscipline is c oncerned with the promotion a nd mainten ance of health, prev ention of illness, c are and rehabilitation of sick and d isabled p ersons, and com passionate care of the dying.

All ed ucatio nal experie nces are des igned to help stu dents develop as critically ref lective and s ocially responsible perso ns who are ca pable of making infor med, prudent ethical decisions. The faculty enc ourages stud ent self - assessment and eval uation, thereby preparing graduates f or con tinuing personal and prof essional develop ment.

Saint Louis University is a Catholic Jesuit institution with a distinctive educational mission and philosophy emphasizing Christian humanism, human dignity, and the developm ent of the total human being. These core values are manifested in the University's commitment to foster a workplace and learning environment that is free from any form of harassment because of sex, race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, disabil ity, age, sexual orientation, marital status, military status, veteran's status, or any other characteristics protected by law. Saint Louis University affirms that harassment because of sex. Race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, disability, a ge, sexual orientation, marital status, military status, veteran's status, pregnancy, or any other protected classification is detrimental to its mission and values. The University endeavors to take steps reasonably necessary to prevent such behavior from occurring, including providing education and training to faculty, staff, and students as to their rights and responsibilities, informing person of the appropriate procedures for reporting inappropriate behavior, promptly investigating complaints, and impo sing appropriate sanctions. 18 The University's Harassment Policy may be obtained from -home/office -of-institutional -equity -and-diversity/harassment The this website: http://www.slu.edu/diversity/about -diversity -at-slu/diversity -defined Academic Integrity/Ethical Behavior Saint Louis University Academic Integrity Policy Preamble Saint Louis University is a community of learning in which integrity and mutual trust are vital. Since the mission of the University i s \"the pursuit of truth for the greater glory of God and for the service of humanity,\" acts of falsehood violate its very reason for existence. They also demean and compromise the activities of teaching, research, health care and community service that are its primary mission. Since the University seeks to prepare students and faculty for lives of integrity and occupations of trust, it regards all acts of academic dishonesty as matters of serious concern. Such dishonesty also undermines the academic asse ssment process, which in turn impairs the ability of the University to certify to the outside world the skills and attainments of its graduates. Such dishonesty allows those who engage in it to take unfair advantage of their peers and undermines moral char acter and self-respect. The Academic Integrity Policy detailed below sets out principles that are implicit in the ethos of the University but that call for explicit formulation to guide the practice of the entire institution. In establishing necessary de finitions and minimal procedures to be followed in adjudicating violations, it also allows academic units to set forth the details of their own honesty policies in ways appropriate to their disciplines. The Policy and Its Scope The Policy on Academic I ntegrity set forth here is designed to promote ethical conduct within the University community by: 1) Defining the responsibilities of various members of the University community; Academic integrity is honest, truthful, and responsible conduct in all academic endeavors. 19 2) Defining violations of academic integrity; 3) Setting minimum stand ards for reporting and adjudicating violations of academic integrity; 4) Establishing procedures for appeals to the Office of the Provost ; and 5) Establishing standards and procedures for maintaining records. The Office of the Provost, in collaborati on with Deans and D irectors of academic units, has the responsibility for integrating concepts of academic integrity into student programs and curricula. To comply with the University policy, academic units are expected to amend their own academic integ rity policies to align with University definitions and minimum standards. Such units are also responsible for acquainting their students with professional requirements beyond those minimal standards as relevant to particular discipline s (NOTE: The use of t he term \"academic unit\" refers to colleges, schools, centers, and the department or program level. The term is used inclusively because the process of investigating violations of academic integrity may begin at the departmental level in some cases or at th e level of the college or school in others). 1. Responsibilities of Members of the Community To create a learning environment in which high standards of academic integrity are prized requires the efforts of everyone in the University community. Faculty are responsible for adhering to high standards of academic integrity in their own research and professional conduct ; for laying out relevant parts of the policy on their syllabi and assignments ; explaining key terms to students and follow ing procedures fo r reporting and adjudicating possible violations both in and out of their academic unit . Furthermore, faculty are encouraged to creat e assignments that minimize the possibility of academic dishonesty through clear expectations and to help to create an envi ronment in which academic integrity is uppermost. Students are responsible for adhering to University standards of academic integrity , helping to create an environment in which academic integrity is respected , and reporting violations of the policy to in structors, department chairs, or administrators, as appropriate . Staff are responsible for calling the attention of their supervisors to possible violations of academic integrity, for modeling high standards of academic integrity in their own professional conduct and research and for otherwise supporting a community of academic honesty and trust. Academic administrators such as Deans, Chairs and Directors are responsible for addressing and managing cases of academic dishonesty in accordance with Universi ty policies and those of their academic units. One exception is that alleged violations of academic integrity in scientific research will be addressed in accordance with the Research Integrity Policy of the University. Administrators in academic units are also responsible for providing students or others charged with violations of academic integrity appropriate notice of the charges and the opportunity to respond in ways laid out in unit and University policies. 2. Violations of Academic Integrity Definitions to guide academic units in setting and applying their academic integrity policies are as follows (more than one violation may apply) : 20 Falsification entails misrepresentations of fact for academic gain. Instances include : 1. Lying to or deceiving a n instructor about academic work ; 2. Fabricating or misrepresenting documentation or the data involved in carrying out assignments; 3. Fabricating, misrepresenting, or altering in unauthorized ways information in academic records belonging to an instructor or to any academic department or administrative unit in the University. Plagiarism involves the representation of someone else's thoughts , words , and/or data as if they were one's own or \"self -plagiarism\" which is the use of material prepared for one class and submitted to another without proper citation and without the permission of the instructor . Instances include: 1. Quoting directly from someone else's written, artistic or spoken work without using quotation marks or indented quotations and without giving proper credit to the author or artist; for example, cutting and pasting text from the internet and making it appear to be your own work . 2. Paraphrasing or incorporating someone else's ideas, concepts, arguments, observations, images, objects, music, or sta tements without giving proper credit; 3. Submitting as one's own work a paper or other assignment/project that has been prepared, either wholly or in part, by another person, group, or commercial firm without citation or acknowledgment. Cheating involves th e use of unauthorized assistance to gain an advantage over other s. Instances include : 1. Copying from another student's examination or u sing unauthorized assistance , aids, technological resources such as cell phones , calculators , translation software or Inte rnet based applications in taking quizzes or examinations; 2. Using resources beyond those authorized by the instructor to complete assignments such as writing papers, preparing reports, giving oral presentations, making models, multi -media projects, sound r ecordings, creating visual materials such as drawings, videos, or photographs or presenting material on the internet; 3. Acquiring, di sseminating, or using tests or any o ther academic forms of assessment belonging to an instructor or a member of the staff through any means (including social media) without prior approval; 4. Influencing, or attempting to influence, any University employee in order to affect a grade or evaluation; 5. Hiring or otherwise engaging someone to impersonate another person in taking a qu iz or examination or in fulfilling other academic requirements. Sabotage entails disrupting or seeking to prevent the academic pursuits of others. It includes: 1. Interfering with work or undermining the academic success of others in the university commun ity in an intentional way for the purpose of negatively impacting that person's academic performance; 2. Modifying, stealing, or destroying intellectual property such as computer files, library materials, artwork, personal books or papers. 3. Performing any act ion that would impact research outcomes such as lab tampering, falsification of data, or destruction of research resources. 21 Collusion involves unauthorized collaboration with another person or persons for the purpose of giving or gaining an academic adva ntage in such activities as completion of assignments or examinations without explicit permission of the instructor. Collusion may include any or all of the other violations of academic integrity as defined above. For example, if two students developed a plan that enabled them to improve their performance on an assignment that was supposed to be completed independently, they would be guilty of collusion. Concealment entails failing to call to the attention of a faculty member or administrator violations of academic integrity that an academic unit requires be reported. Graduate Education, Date Approved: June, 2015 For more information about Reporting and Adjudicating Violations of Academic Integrity , Submitting and Conducting an Appeal to the Office of th e Provost , and Confidentiality see the full version of the Academic Integrity Policy at https://www.slu.edu/Docum ents/provost/academic_affairs/University - wide%20Academic%20Integrity%20Policy%20FINAL%20%206 -26-15.pdf Additional Statement for Saint Louis University School of Nursing I. Purpose Common to the health care professions are expectations of integrity, honest y, and truthfulness which are tantamount to the standards of ethical conduct for the professional. These basic expectations are in accord with those held within the academic community. Students in the School of Nursing programs are therefore expected to be honest in their academic professional work. The School of Nursing seeks to provide an atmosphere conducive to academic and professional honesty. II. Policy A. Policy Statement Saint Louis University supports an environment of trust and integrity. Faculty an d students share responsibility for upholding academic integrity. Violating academic integrity is not consistent with such an environment. Violations of academic integrity include but are not limited to cheating, plagiarism, and falsifying , or fabricating facts. Professional integrity is violated by any dishonesty in meeting the responsibilities inherent in clinical practice. Sanctions for a violation of academic or professional integrity may include but are not limited to disciplinary probation, suspensi on, and dismissal from the University. The Academic and Professional Integrity Policy is consistent with the University's Academic Integrity Statement. B. Breaches of academic integrity include but are not limited to: 1. copying from another student's test paper or allowing another student to copy one's work ; 2. submi tting material authored by another person but represented as the student's own work whether draft or final submission; 3. copying a passage or text directly from a book, journal, or electronic source , or using extensive paraphrasing without indicating the source or without using a recognized style for citing sources ; 22 4. taking a test or writing a paper for another student ; 5. submitting an assignment or paper as new work when this same assignment had been completed for a prior course ; 6. using non -approved technology during a class; 7. collaborating with another person to commit breaches of academic integrity . C. Breaches of professional integrity include but are not limited to: 1. falsifying information and data 2. viola ting confidential information 3. violating professional code of ethics D. Sanctions for Academic Misconduct 1. Sanctions should be selected and imposed with three goals in mind: a. To assist in the education of the student responsible for the academic misconduct b. To encourage, in keeping with the University's mission, an honest intellectual environment c. To maintain the integrity of the academic program and the rights of all individuals 2. Sanctions deemed appropriate for the Admissions, Progression, and Graduation Committe e and Dean of the School of Nursing are: a. Warning A formal written warning b. Professional Probation for Academic Misconduct Probationary status imposed with or without restrictions for a definite period of time not to exceed one calendar year. A student is s ubject to immediate suspension or dismissal if involved in any act of misconduct, including violations of terms of probation, while on professional probation for academic misconduct. c. Suspension Involuntary separation of the student from the School of Nursi ng or University for a definite period of time after which the student is eligible to return. The length of time for the suspension will be determined by the Admissions, Progression, and Graduation Committee and stated in the report to the Dean of the Sch ool of Nursing. The disciplinary sanction of suspension is not recorded on the student's permanent academic record. The student is subject to immediate dismissal if involved in any act of misconduct after the suspension has been lifted. d. Dismissal Involun tary separation of the student from the School of Nursing or University without provision for a return in the future. In accordance with the University -wide code of student's rights and responsibilities, the disciplinary sanction of dismissal is required to be recorded on the student's permanent academic record. Approved 5/7/07 Revised: 7/24/08 , (Modified for Ph.D. nursing students 6/6/2013) Additional Statement for the Ph.D. Nursing Program The University is a community of learning where students and f aculty share the responsibility for maintain ing academic, professional , and research integrity (SLU Office of Academic Affairs, 2004). Consistent with its Catholic Jesuit mission, the University is committed to a community and environment that supports in clusion and diversity. This includes respect for individuals with social identities similar to and different from one's own ( SLU , nd). 23 Academic integrity is characterized by \"honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility\" (Center for Academic Int egrity, 1999). Examples of academic dishonesty include: cheating, falsification, interfering with the work of another, working with another to promote dishonest behaviors, and plagiarism. Plagiarism consists of \"claiming credit for the words, ideas and co ncepts of others\" (APA, 2009, p. 170). This may occur if text is copied from a source without adequate paraphrasing or if author recognition is not provided in a recognized format. Other examples of dishonesty are listed in the School of Nursing SLU Gradu ate Education Catalog (see current catalog). Professional integrity is demonstrated by behaviors that reflect honesty, respect, and responsibility within the clinical and research environments. Civil behavior is expected in the classroom and through all forms of discourse and communication including course and university email. Responsible behavior is also expected through the use of social media: use of one's personal email when expressing personal views and business rather than university email, use o f wording that does not imply discrimination, and not posting confidential university information (i.e. lectures or other materials; SLU Marketing and Communications Web Services, nd). Examples of behaviors that do not reflect integrity include: use of ce ll phones or texting during class, violation of research participant confidentiality, and behaviors that are not consistent with nursing standards (Fowler, 2008). Research integrity promotes the ethical principles of justice, respect, beneficence, autonom y, and protection of vulnerable populations. Examples of research misconduct include: data fabrication, falsification, plagiarism, not addressing conflict of interests, and inappropriate authorship (USDHHS, Office of Research Integrity, 2011). Possible c onsequences for a violation of academic, professional, or research integrity include grade reduction, failure in a class, disciplinary actions, dismissal from the program, and other actions (see current Graduate Education Catalog ).

With communities numbering in the hundreds of millions of members, social med ia sites have become important venues where individuals or groups can share their knowledge and opinions, express creativity, connect , and collaborate with others who have similar interests and are readily accessible. Examples of social media include but a re not limited to: Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube and web -logs or \"blogs.\" Many organizations, including Saint Louis University, have their own social media sites and actively participate in social media on a corporate o r organizational level. Primum non nocere (first do no harm): think, before posting. There is no such thing as a \"private\" social media site. Search engines can turn up posts and pictures years after publication. Do not post information that may harm the University , colleagues, or clas smates. Avoid posting while feeling emotional about a subject - wait until you are calm and clear -headed. Admit mistakes. Be upfront and be quick with your correction. If posting to a blog, modify earlier posts when necessary and clearly indicate the chang e. Keep in mind that your parents, siblings, roommates, internship site supervisors , and future employers will read your blog or social media posts, as well as prospective students, their parents, alumni, professors and University administrators. The tone and content of all electronic conversations should remain professional. Respect among colleagues and co -workers must occur in an inter -professional environment. Posts should contain only factual information. Be judicious. All statements must be true and no t misleading and all claims must be substantiated and approved. Do not comment on anything related to legal matters, litigation, or any parties that are in litigation. Individual s are respon sible for the content of their Internet and social media blogs/pos ts, pictures, etc. including but not limited to any legal liability incurred (defamation, harassment, obscenity, privacy issues regarding students or patients, etc). Do not post any content that is inappropriate. Inappropriate content includes, but is not limited to, material that is obscene, defamatory, profane, libelous, threatening, harassing, abusive, hateful, or embarrassing to another person or entity. Medical advice on a social networking site should never be provided. Be mindful of the copyright a nd intellectual property rights of others when posting. Unlawful use of another's mark or intellectual property is not acceptable merely because that use occurs on social media . Respect copyright and fair use laws from SLU. If you are ever in doubt, pleas e refer to the University's Copyright Policy or contact the Office of the General Counsel for guidance. Maintain Confidentiality: Do not post confidential or proprietary information about Saint Louis University, its students, professors, or employees. Do not post any class content or information on any social media sites. Do not use SLU's logo or image for any endorsements or on any social media sites. Use good ethical judgment and follow University policies and federal requirements, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA ), and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, (FERPA ). All material posted on the Internet via email, social media, or otherwise, is considered public and permanent; published information can be reco vered. Be aware that your relationship to SLU and the School of Nursing can be discovered on the Internet. Infractions to this policy will be addressed as a violation of Academic Integrity and handled per that policy. 25 Statement of Rights and Responsibil ities All student members of the Saint Louis University community have certain rights and are asked to assume significant responsibility by contributing their skills and talents to the University community.

Curriculum The Ph.D. program consists of a total of 69 graduate credit hours: 57 graduate credit hours of course work and 12 credit hours of dissertation research. Up to 18* graduate credit hours of course work from a master's degree program in nursing may be accepted and applied without charge toward the total 69 credit hours required. Thus, the re are 39 PhD level course work credits (57 - 18 = 39). Course descriptions and sample study plans are in Appendices A and B.

There are two methods of participation. Students may attend class on-campus or from a distance. Whether on -campus or at a distance, students participate with faculty in a live, real -time classroom using advanced audiovisua l technologies. Most doctoral nursing courses are offered on Fridays and require real -time (synchronous) participation by all students . Distance students must have a computer, headset, webcam, reliable Internet, and private space for class participation. Students are typically admitted to begin course work in the fall semester. Spring semester admission is possible with some constraints in course scheduling and availability due, in part, to course prerequisites. International students begin in the summ er, based on their level of English proficiency. Program Pre - or Co-requisite Completion of a graduate course in advanced statistics, NURS 6 805 Applied Univariate Statistics in Nursing Research (or equivalent), within the last five years is a prerequisi te to NURS 6 806 Multivariate/Multivariable Statistics in Nursing Research which is a required course in the program. Ideally, the prerequisite should be completed successfully by the start of the program; however, it may be completed prior to enrolling in the advanced statistics courses. Students who receive a course grade of \"C\" or lower in the program prerequisite course will be asked to repeat the course. Students complete 39 credits of Ph.D. course work exclusive of the pre - or co -requisite. Several c ourses at Saint Louis University satisfy the NURS 6 805 prerequisite: ORES 501 0 Introduction to Biostatistics for Health outcomes Research (Fall online) PSY 5 790 Applied Univariate Statistics (Fall onsite, typically limited to psychology students) BST 50 00 Principles of Biostatistics (Fall onsite & online, Spring onsite) SOC 5050 Quantitative I: Applied Inferential Statistics (Fall onsite) Semesters may change, so please check before planning. 31 Academic Advising On admission to the program , each PhD nursi ng student is assigned a faculty academic advisor . Students are matched to faculty based on similarity of interests as suggested in the student's goal statement in the application materials. As a student's scholarly focus develops, another faculty member m ay be seen as a more appropriate match as mentor who will then become the academic advisor . The student may request a change to a different faculty member as mentor by discussing with the program director. The academic advisor provides guidance with res pect to program planning, course selection and enrollment, scholarly development, and other issues related to the student's academic and professional development, as appropriate. The Student Academic Record (see Appendix C) program plan documents some of the joint advisor -student planning of the student's progress through the program. The Research and Scholarly Competencies document (see Appendix D) serves as a starting point for the advisor and/or another faculty mentor to whom the student is assigned as research/graduate assistant to assist the student in planning the development of specific scholarly competencies through course and non -course -related experiences. Registration Registration for Courses Registration for scheduled courses is available on line through SLU Banner Self Service after consultation with the academic advisor. The link can be found in mySLU ( http://myslu.slu.edu ). Prior to the initial registration you should contact your advisor to develop a curriculum plan . Then you can register yourself.

Specifically, check out the following policies: Academic Appeals Also see the School of Nursing Academic Appeal Policy below Academic Integrity/Ethical Behavior Academic Progress/Ordinary Tim e Periods to Degree Annual Reviews In addition to the Graduate Education Catalog , all Ph.D. students at Saint Louis University School of Nurs ing will participate in an annual evaluation of their academic progress . The purpose of this review is to assess each studen t's academic progression, and scholarly achievements; this allows for direction and recommendations. Students are expected to complete the annual review process with their academic advisors by mid -October. New students need to be review ed at the end of their first semester of study and can be reviewed a second time at the end of the spring semester. If a student does not participate in the required annual review process, future scholarship eligibility and assistantships will be at risk. An annual meeting will include the student and academic advisor/dissertation chair. The student review includes feedback on progress in the program , for example: academic work at the B+ level; cumulative GPA; timely completion of coursework (including incomplete or no grades), written exams and dissertation; achievement of skill acquisition and scholarly development. Students will submit a dossier (e.g., Annual Review Form, Student Self - Assessment, and a curr ent plan of study ) describing th eir progress . The dossier will be submitted to the faculty no later than two weeks before the formal review meeting is held in January. The committee will evaluate the student's progress and provide feedback. Students who are making successful progress toward their degree will be given a satisfactory rating with recommendations that will help them to continue advancing through the program. Students who are not meeting all expectations will be given a rating of satisfactory with Snippet from Graduate Education Catalog (2016 -17, p 17) 34 reservations and recommendations to improve their performance . If a student is not making satisfactory progress, a rating of unsatisfactory will be given and an additional review will be scheduled in the following semester. The student, the advisor/dissertation chair, and the director of t he Ph.D. program should sign the annual review. (An e -mail acknowledgement from students from a distance may be acceptable.) The student's signature indicates only that the student has seen the review and not necessarily that he or she agrees with it. C opy of the student's self -report and the feedback will be given to the student. The first two pages will be sent to the Dean (or designee) and the Associate Provost for Academic Affairs . See Appendix N for the Annual Self -Report and Evaluation Form. See the Graduate Catalog at http://www.slu.edu/services/registrar/catalog/20162017.html for the topics below: Change of Grade Course Extension (Incomplete Course) Snippet from Graduate Education Catalog (2016 -17, p 17) Snippet from Graduate Education Catalog (2016 -17, p 18) 35 Good Academic Standing and Academic Probation Repeating Courses In addition to the Graduate Education Catalog policy , a limited number of credit hours in which the grade of \"C\" is earned may or may not be accepted toward a graduate degree in the Ph.D. N ursing Program . On the recommendation/advice of the director or program committee , a Ph.D. nursing student may repeat a required course (or its equivalent at Saint Louis University) only one time. If the required grade is not achieved after repeating the course, the student will be dismissed from the program. The classified Ph.D. nursing student's cumulative GPA in academic work presented to fulfill degree requirements must be at least 3.0. Suspension/Dismissal One addition to the policy found in the Grad uate Education Catalog : If a Ph.D. nursing student receives a failing grade in one (1) graduate course, the student will be dismissed from the program. Transfer of Credit http://www.slu.edu/academics/graduate/pdfs/ge_transfer_of_credit_fillable.pdf Found here: http://www.slu.edu/academics/graduate/info rmation -for-current -students.php School of Nursing Academic Appeal Policy Admission, Progression, and Graduation Committee (AP&G) . Admission, Progression and Graduation Policy can be found in the respective Saint Louis University School of Nursing pr ogram handbooks and University Catalogs. Appeal of an Academic Decision: (e.g. Course grade, clinical probation, etc. ) Snippet from Graduate Education Catalog (2016 -17, p 18) 36 A grade may be appealed only if there is evidence of capricious or arbitrary grading, abuse of discretion or lack of due process. An a ppeal gives the student the opportunity to present evidence that the assigned grade was capricious and/or arbitrary; there was abuse of discretion; or there was a lack of due process. If a student believes the above is true, the student must: 1. Appeal to t he faculty member who assigned the grade. 2. Appeal beyond the faculty member is to be made to the course coordinator. The student meets with the course coordinator with supporting evidence. 3. If a resolution is not obtained, the student contacts the option c oordinator. 4. If a resolution is not obtained, the student contacts the appropriate SON administrator: Associate Dean of Undergraduate and Prelicensure Education; Associate Dean of Graduate Education; Program Director, Ph.D. 5. If resolution is not obtaine d, the student can appeal to the Admissions, Progression and Graduation Committee (APG). See below for specific procedures. It is the responsibility of the APG committee Chair to communicate the Committee's appeal decision to the student. The option coor dinator, faculty mentor/advisor, and the appropriate administrator of the student's program are also informed of the decision and are responsible for follow up. Appeal of a Program Dismissal: A student has the right to appeal a program dismissal. The ap peal process gives the student the opportunity to explain extenuating circumstances or conditions which adversely affected their behavior or academic performance. Thu student must present plans for preventing future problems if the requested reinstatement is granted. The appeal is heard by the School of Nursing AP&G Committee. The Committee makes the decision to grant or deny the student's appeal. It is the responsibility of the Chair of the APG Committee to communicate the Committee's decision to the stu dent. The Director/Option Coordinator of the student's program is also promptly informed of the committee's decision on the student's appeal and is responsible for follow -up with the student. Admission, Progression, and Graduation Committee Procedures: Following posting of course grades, the appropriate SON administrator identifies those students who have not met all curricular and academic requirements as described in the respective program student handbook and/or catalog. The appropriate SON administr ator communicates in writing to the student(s) notifying them concerning their status in the School of Nursing. The letter will explain the specific issue and the appeal process. A copy of the letter is sent to the student's mentor and/or advisor and the A PG chairperson. The student must acknowledge receipt of the notification in writing. When a student chooses to appeal, a request must be made in writing to the appropriate APG Committee Chairperson. The request must be made within 10 business days follow ing receipt of written notification communicating the academic issue. The appeal letter should, at a minimum, include the following: 37 1. A concise statement of the purpose of the appeal; 2. A description of the relevant circumstances that may have influenced the student's academic performance; 3. The student's plan for future success. A hearing is scheduled based on the availability of a majority of the committee members. The administrator of the student's program will not be a voting member of the hearing com mittee. If a committee member(s) believes they cannot fairly review the evidence and render a decision, the committee member should recuse themselves from the meeting. The student is provided with a list of the committee members prior to the scheduled app eal. At the student's request, the APG Committee Chairperson will make a substitution of one committee member, which may include the APG Committee Chairperson, if the student believes that the committee member may not render an impartial decision. The st udent is encouraged to attend the hearing meeting of the APG Committee. If the student is unable to attend the meeting in person, the student may arrange to have a conference phone meeting with the committee. The student is responsible for informing the AP G Committee Chairperson whether she/he is attending the meeting in person, meeting via a telephone conference call, or not attending the meeting at all. If the student will be attending the meeting either in person or via a conference call, the Committee C hairperson will discuss the hearing process with the student prior to the hearing. A student may submit a written request to the APG Committee Chairperson that he/she be accompanied by one person at the hearing. The person may attend the meeting and spea k to the petitioner, but is not allowed to address the committee. If the designated person is an attorney, disclosure must be provided. The designated person may not be a student in the same academic program. Recording of the committee hearing is not permi tted. Prior to the APG Committee hearing, the Committee Chairperson will contact the student's faculty mentor and /or advisor and the faculty involved in courses pertinent to the appeal inviting them to provide germane information regarding the student's appeal. Information from the mentor and faculty must be submitted to the APG Committee Chairperson in writing prior to the hearing. No later than the day of the hearing, the Committee members are provided with a copy of the student's appeal letter and t he completed APG Committee Summary form. The appropriate SON administrator may provide information related to any previous academic issues. The hearing will proceed as follows: 1. APG Committee Chairperson describes the academic eligibility issue including a review of the applicable policy and pertinent background information. 2. Faculty member(s) may be invited to provide information to the committee. 3. The student joins the hearing and an introduction is made of all those present. 4. The student will make a st atement to the committee. 5. The committee members will ask the student questions germane to the issue. 6. The student will make a final statement to the committee, and then be excused from the meeting room. 38 7. The committee will discuss the issue in a private s ession and make a majority decision regarding the appeal. The Committee Chairperson will vote only in case of a split decision. 8. If the appeal is granted, the committee will make recommendation(s) regarding progression. The recommendation of the committee will be documented on the confidential Progression Committee Summary Form. This form will be kept in an APG Committee file in the appropriate Associate Dean's office until the student graduates or three years from the date of appeal. Minutes of each meeti ng will be maintained. The decision regarding the student's appeal will be communicated to the student by the APG Chairperson via the student's SLU e -mail within 24 hours of the Committee meeting. Within five business days, a letter will be sent to the s tudent using traceable mail. If the appeal is granted, the decision will be stated, as appropriate, in the letter. A copy of the letter will be sent to the appropriate SON administrators and the appropriate University department(s). A copy of the letter wi ll be placed in the student's file. If the appeal is denied, the student can file an academic grievance with the Dean of the School of Nursing. At the APG Committee meeting toward the end of the academic year, the appropriate SON administrators will repo rt on the students who were granted an appeal granted in the past year. An assessment will be made determining whether the student has met the recommendation(s) of the appeal conditions.

The section number will be that of the director for the Ph.D. nursing program. Students may enroll in NURS 695 9 a maximum of two times for \"0\" credit. Thi s registration automatically qualifies the student for full -time status. The allowable grades for the registration are \"Satisfactory (S)\" (only allowed if the student takes and passes the examination in the semester), \"In Progress (IP)\" if the student does not complete the examination requirement in the semester, or \"Unsatisfactory (U)\" if the student fails the examination. The Graduate Education may approve a third registration unde r extraordinary circumstances.

Zero (0) Credit All graduate students, including those who are registered for \"0\" credit, will be assessed the student activity fee and the Busch Student Center fee with the exception that students enrolled in courses outside the metropolitan area will not be charged the Busch Student Center fee. Full-time Status Full time stat us for a graduate student is defined as 6 or more semester credits in formal courses (fall/spring semesters), 3 or more semester credits (summer total), and/or the following criteria for establishing status: o Full-time: All graduate students holding full ap pointments as Fellows, Trainees, or Graduate Assistants. o Full-time: All graduate students registered for NURS 695 9 Special Study for Examinations. o Full-time: All graduate students registered for NURS 699 9 Dissertation Research , even if for zero credits . Students must be enrolled in at least one hour of dissertation credit upon completion of coursework or achievement of doctoral candidacy until completion of 12 hours. After completing 12 hours students may enroll in zero credits unless otherwise directed (e.g. additional credits while on extensions). A student may not register for more than 6 credits of NURS 699 9 Dissertation Research in one semester . Also see the policy on Full-time status under General Policies in the current Graduate Education Catalog at http://www.slu.edu/services/registrar/catalog/20162017.html 41 Area of Concentration (Cognate Courses). Cognate courses are elective courses chosen with the assistance of the a dvisor /mentor that individually and collectively enhance the depth of understanding of the student's chosen area of concentration. These courses may be chosen from other schools or departments at the University; however a very limited number of courses are offered online /distance learning . The areas include health care ethics, public health, psychology, sociology, education, public policy, business, and other relevant disciplines. The student should be aware of pre -requisite courses in these departments. Fo r more course information, see the Graduate Education Catalog website (see http://www.slu.edu/services/registrar/catalog/20162017.html ). Many distance students select the nurse educator courses as their area of concentration because they are offered online asynchronously through the School . Other online courses for an area of concentration may be bio -security and healthcare ethics. Students may enroll in Research Topics (NURS 697 9) and/or Graduate Reading /Independent Study (NURS 698 9) courses guided by t he faculty; these courses may be used as part of area of concentration . With faculty's permission to register, student complete an \"application\" form describing the course title, number of credit hours, objectives, content, and evaluation methods. This form must be approved by the supervising faculty member and by the Ph.D. nursing program director prior to the student's registering for the course (see Appendix E including the Title Change From ). Typically, only two of these courses may be used for the ar ea of concentration. Nurse Educator Courses (as Cognate Courses). A set of cognate courses is available for students to achieve competencies in academic settings as faculty . Students who select the Nurse Educator courses will c omplete 9 credit hours of nursing education courses. The nursing education courses are available online only (usually asynchronous learning) . If students receive funds from the federal Nurse Faculty Loan Program (NFLP) , certain conditions apply especially if the student's master's degree focused on nursing education. Contact the director of the Ph.D. Nursing Program for details. Students whose master's specialty/ concentration/track was nursing education or who have advanced degrees in education cannot enroll in the 500 level cour ses. Students who have advanced degree s in education but not in nursing may need to verify whether they are eligible for NFLP funds.

The student initiates a petition to Ph.D. Nursing Program to enroll in 15 credit hours of course work in the non -nursing discipline. Permission from the discipline's department chairperson is required. See Writ ten and Oral Preliminary Examinations for more information about the declared minor. 42 Consortiums Inter -University Exchange Midwest Catholic Graduate School Consortium Snippet from Graduate Education Catalog (2016 -17, p 32) 43 Midwest Nursing Research Society (MNRS) Annual Conference Attendance at the Midwest Nursing Research Society's annual conference is required for the first academic year.

The qualifying examination for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing is designed to test the depth, comprehension, integration, and synthesis of knowledge that students ac hieve after completing all required course work. The qualifying examination may also be known as \"comps\" and \"prelims\" because the examination is comprehensive and preliminary to advancing to doctoral candidacy. The format is in two consecutive parts: fi rst, a written exam and then, an oral exam. Success on both written and oral exams is necessary to pass the qualifying examination. Failure on the written exam precludes progression to the oral exam (Approved: Ph.D. Committee April 4, 2013 ). Doctoral Ca ndidate status will be given to the student after the passage of the comprehensive oral exam regardless of whether it includes the dissertation proposal (Approved by Graduate Academic Affairs Committee and Council of Academic Deans and Directors) . Qualifying Examination: W ritten s The purpose of the written examination is to assess a student's comprehensive knowledge, understanding, and ability to reason in writing on a range of topics related to nursing as a scientific discipline. The written exa mination is a formal assessment of a student's potential to qualify, in part, as a doctoral candidate in the Ph.D. program in nursing. Students must enroll in NURS 695 9 for 0 credit hours under the program director's section number (e.g., -27) during the fall or spring semester in which the qualifying examination will be offered. The written part of the qualifying examination is in the form of a take -home examination. Students will be given four questions. One question will be required for everyone. A student has the choice of responding to two of the three remaining questions. Each of the responses to the three questions should Snippet from Graduate Education Catalog (2016 -17, p 29-30) 47 not exceed 10 double -spaced text pages (Times New Roman, 12 pts. font size with one inch margins). The examination questions are distributed to students' SLU email address ordinarily on a Monday morning, and the responses are due Friday afternoon of the same week. Students will submit their responses to the director of the program using University e -mail as a Microsoft Word att achment (or a format readily compatible with Word). Students are responsible for the delivery of the responses by the deadline. The written portion of the qualifying examination is ordinarily offered to a group of students twice in each academic year, in early fall and spring semesters. It is not of fered during the summer session . Students will indicate to the Ph.D. program director, at least one month in advance of the start of the semester that they are eligible and wish to register for the written exa m. See Appendix F in this handbook for the student academic record and Written Qualifying Examination Application Form . Three members of the graduate faculty, designated as readers , will independently evaluate the students' responses that are blinded to identity. Two positive ( pass) faculty evaluations from the three readers on each response are required to pass. The criteria for evaluation include (a) relevance of the content as a response to the question; (b) accuracy of the content; (c) clarity of exp ression; (d) evidence of logical thinking; (e) evidence of knowledge integration; (f) use of appropriate references; and (g) proper grammar, spelling, punctuation, and reference citation format. If a student does not pass, the student fails the written part of the qualifying examination. When a student fails the written exam, it is the responsibility of the student to consult with the academic advisor to prepare and reschedule a second exam. The student may opt to retake the exam within the current se mester but no later than the following semester's offering of the written exam. If the student does not retake the written exam in the same semester, but delays to the next semester's offering of it, the student must complete a Petition for Course Extensi on form and submit it to the PhD director. The student will be given a second attempt to re -write only the number of questions failed. Subsequently, if a student fails one or more of the questions on the second attempt by a vote of 2 out of 3 graduate f aculty readers, the Ph.D. Nursing Program Committee will be convened to discuss the results and decide on the student's academic status. If a student who failed the written exam has exceeded the limit for time to degree, a petition to extend the time per iod to repeat a failed qualifying examination will ordinarily not be approved. For students who have declared a formal minor, an additional part of the qualifying examination may be required. Students should contact the minor's department chairperson or program director to understand the scheduling, format, and procedure of the examination. Success on the formal minor's exam is determined by that department's policies. Students may appeal an academic decision. See the School of Nursing Academic Appea l Policy above . 48 Qualifying Examination: Oral s The oral examination is intended to provide an opportunity for students to demonstrate their academic preparation and ability to engage in a thoughtful and open -ended dialogue. The examination will typically include both questions intended to explore the breadth and the depth of a student's knowledge and questions designed to test a student's ability to synthesize information from course work and professional experience. It may also cover a student 's responses to the written portion of the qualifying examination that need clarification or amplification, the student's research that may be preparatory to the dissertation, the likely dissertation research focus, and other relevant topics not necessaril y restricted to course work. The specific content of the examination is determined by members of the committee. Taking the lead for guiding the oral exam, the committee chairperson is either the student's academic advisor and/or presumptive chair of the dissertation committee. The Doctoral Oral Examination Form must be submitted to the Graduate Education office at least two weeks prior to the proposed exam date. Therefore, to allow time for the required signatures, please submit this to the Ph.D. Prog ram Director at least three weeks prior to the exam date. The most current form can be found at: http://www.slu.edu/academics/graduate/information -for-current -studen ts.php The oral examination is conducted by a committee of five faculty members holding graduate faculty status (one member may have graduate instruction status), all from the School of Nursing. The student's academic advisor , and/or presumptive chairp erson of the dissertation , chairs the oral examination committee. The Ph.D. nursing program director ordinarily serves as one member of the committee. The committee chairperson and student collaborate on the selection of the remaining members of the comm ittee. If the student has completed a formal minor in another department, a representative from the minor field will serve in place of one of the five faculty members from the School of Nursing but will not replace the committee ch airperson or program dir ector. Snippet from Graduate Education Catalog (2016 -17, p 30) 49 The oral examination should be scheduled to allow at least a two hour examination period. At the conclusion of the examination, the student will be asked to leave the room while the members of the committee vote privately (on forms sent by Graduate Education) , without discussion, to pass with great distinction, pass with distinction, pass, or fail the student. If two of the five members of the committee vote to fail, the student fails the qualifying exam. After voting and discussion with t he other committee members, the chairperson notifies the student of the results. Official notification comes from the Associate Provost for Academic Affairs . The criteria for evaluation include (a) depth and breadth of knowledge in subject areas, (b) i ntegration of knowledge across course work, nursing practice, and experience, (c) evidence of logical and critical thinking, (d) completeness and comprehensiveness of responses, and (e) confidence and clarity in verbal communication skills. If a student f ails the oral exam, the committee members of the oral exam will recommend a course of action. The student may opt to retake the exam within the current semester but no later than the following semester. If the student does not retake the oral exam in the same semester, but delays to the next semester's offering of the exam, a Petition for Course Extension form will be submit ted to the program director . The same committee members will re -examine the student unless members have left the University or are un available; in which case, the committee chairperson and the student will choose the replacement(s). If a student fails the second attempt of the oral exam, the Ph.D. Nursing Program Committee will be convened to discuss the results and decide on the stude nt's academic status. A third exam is rarely approved. Students may appeal an academic decision. The School of Nursing Academic Appeals Policy should be followed (See above) . Doctoral Candidate status will be given to the student after the passage of t he comprehensive oral exam regardless of whether it inc ludes the dissertation proposal .

Mento rs will register students for NURS 699 9 during any given semester after successfully completing the qualifying examination. A grade of \"In Progress (IP)\" will be submitted at the end of the semester if the student is making satisfactory progress . An \"Uns atisfactory (U)\" if satisfactory progress has not been made in a given semester. Credit hours taken in association with a grade of \"U\" will not be credited toward the total of 12 hours in NURS 699 9 required for graduation. Students can also petition for Course Extensions if needed (see Petitions and Forms above ). The grade of \"Satisfactory (S)\" will only be assigned when the student has successfully defended the dissertation and the dissertation committee has fully accepted the document (i.e., their fina l registration). Students should confer with their dissertation chairperson as mentor to plan how the 12 credit hours of dissertation research (NURS 699 9) should be allotted for the anticipated time frame for the research. 53 Each semester, students should review with their mentors how many credit hours to take that semester. All graduate students registered for 1 or more hours of dissertation research are considered full -time. Zero credit hour registration for NURS 699 9 is not allowed until the student has successfully completed 12 hours of NURS 699 9. Dissertation Chairperson and Committee Members Students are encouraged to interview faculty for a potential chairperson of the dissertation committee by discussing mutual research interests. The choice of a chairperson is by mutual agreement between the faculty member and the student. The ideal arrangement is that the student will conduct the dissertation research in an area similar to the research experience of the selected chairperson in order to receiv e mentoring in the area. Circumstances may arise in which the ideal is not possible. Nevertheless, no member of the faculty is compelled to chair a dissertation committee or serve on a committee. This may be due to a student conducting research in an un related area, research of no interest to the faculty, or the time commitment exceeds the faculty's workload. The dissertation chairperson shall have primary, secondary, or joint appointment at the School of Nursing and hold Graduate Faculty with Ph.D. Mentor status at the School of Nursing. Ordinarily, the chairperson shall be tenured and have a full -time appointment at the University. After the chairperson has been determined, the dissertation committee is proposed by the student in consultat ion and agreement with the student's dissertation chairperson. The dissertation committee shall have at least three members, two of whom should be full -time graduate faculty at the School of Nursing. External members need approval from the program direct or and Associate Dean for Graduate Education. If desirable, a co -chairperson who holds Graduate Faculty status in a University school, college, or department may be appointed as one of the three members. A chairperson who holds a joint appointment will n ame a co -chairperson at the School of Nursing. Additional members can be appointed to the dissertation committee, as needed. These additional members may include research scientists from outside Saint Louis University provided their expertise and scholar ly record are appropriate and are approved for such service by the program director and Associate Dean for Graduate Education. The student may request and/or the chairperson may recommend an additional Students are encouraged to interview faculty for a potential chairperson of the dissertation committee by discussing mutual research interests. The choice of a chairperson is by mutual agreement between the faculty member and the student. Snippet from Graduate Education Catalog (2016 -17, p 30) 54 consultant(s) on the research. However, a consultant is advisory only and will not have responsibility or authority to approve the dissertation research. The chairperson of the dissertation committee is the primary mentor and advisor of the student throughout the research process. However, members of th e dissertation committee have the responsibility to advise the student throughout the research process. The committee has the authority and responsibility to require high quality research including requiring portions of the dissertation to be rewritten . All committee members have equal voting rights to approve the proposed research and the final document (including the oral defense). The anticipated chairperson and the presumptive committee are to review dissertation plans as early as practical in the st udent's program. All students, regardless of dissertation format, will have formal defense of the dissertation research proposal to their dissertation committee . This may be done via FuzeMeeting. This meeting will include group discussion to strengthen the proposal. The student and the committee will complete the dissertation proposal approval form for everyone's records. It is the student's responsibility to initiate contacts with the chairperson and provide ongoing reports on the progress of the research. It is the chairperson's responsibility to provide a mentored experience to the student by defining the scope of the project, giving ongoing guidance and evaluative feedback on the contextual, methodological, and intellectual development of the d issertation research. It is the responsibility of the entire committee to establish an expectancy of high achievement from the student and to provide timely feedback to the student at the appropriate stage of the dissertation process. When a dissertatio n committee member leaves the University, the member must be replaced unless the dissertation is nearly complete or the member has an essential role on the committee. In the latter case, approval from the program director and Associate Dean for Graduate E ducation will be obtained. When the chairperson of a committee leaves and cannot be readily replaced, a new chairperson must be appointed from within the committee or from the School of Nursing graduate faculty (see the qualifications for appointment to a chairperson). If there is a chairperson and co -chairperson, and the chairperson leaves the University, the co -chairperson automatically assumes the chair position; the former chairperson may remain on the committee. If the oral defense takes place within a few months of the chairperson's departure, the requirement of the new chair may be waived. The University's Office of Graduate Education will be notified of all changes of a committee. A retired faculty member with emeritus status may remain as a memb er or chair of a committee if easily accessible by real -time communication and is still professionally active. Retired faculty who may not be accessible and/or do not remain professionally active should be replaced on committees and the revised committee approved by the program director and the Associate Dean for Graduate Education. Disputes between the student and one or more committee members or among committee members that cannot be resolved will be brought to the attention of the program director and/ or the Associate Dean The formation of a presumptive committee does not presume or guar antee a student's successful completion of the qualifying examination and advancement to candidacy. 55 for Graduate Education. Members of the committee may be changed only when necessary or appropriate and with the approval of the program director and Associate Dean for Graduate Education. Traditional and Non -traditional Aca demic Dissertation Format Students may choose either a traditional or a non -tradition al academic dissertation format. Both formats require a dissertation committee, a dissertation research proposal meeting, completion of at least 12 hours of dissertation credits, and a dissertation document as a final product. Ordinarily, students initiate their dissertation research after completing the qualifying examination and advancing to doctoral candidacy. A student (or candidate) may change the dissertation form at once. Structure of the Traditional Dissertation. The traditional dissertation format ordinarily includes at least five chapters; however, the research method and results may require additional chapters. The five chapters may be ordered in this manner : (a) a statement of the problem, its background and significance, the research question(s) or hypothesis(es) to be tested; (b) an analytic literature review that argues for the significance of the project by critiquing what is known, not known, the quali ty of what known, and explaining how this research fills an identified gap in the literature; (c) a detailed presentation and justification of the design and the research methods and analytic procedures that were used to conduct that investigation; (d) the results of the research study in considerable detail; and (e) a discussion of the implications of the results that includes drawing the appropriate conclusions, and laying out an agenda for future research on the issues addressed in the dissertation. Ordinarily, the chairperson of the committee for the traditional dissertation works most closely with the student during the dissertation process. The dissertation committee chairperson reviews student drafts and provides detailed feedback to the student, ide ntifying those elements of the chapters that need revision. When the dissertation committee chairperson has approved them, drafts are circulated to the committee members as needed. When the dissertation committee chairperson approves all of the chapters, the complete draft is then circulated to the other members of the dissertation committee for timely feedback to the student in advance of the oral defense of the dissertation. The date for the oral Snippet from Graduate Education Catalog (2016 -17, p 30) 56 defense will be set by the chairperson after the dissertat ion committee has reviewed and approved the dissertation and agreed on a date. It is also permissible for the chapters to be circulated to the other members of the committee as the committee chair approves each chapter. (See the section on Dissertation D efense.) Structure of the Nontraditional Dissertation. The nontraditional dissertation format is somewhat different. The body of the nontraditional format consists of at least three thematically related, original, article -length manuscripts. Because subs tantial evidence of scholarship is expected for the Ph.D. degree, a student will ordinarily be the sole or first author of each manuscript. However, multiple authorships may be negotiated with justification in the memorandum of agreement (see below) with the presumptive committee. Students and the committee should consider the complexity reflected by additional authors. The student must be the first (or sole) author on at least two of these manuscripts, but may be the second author on one manuscript. Howev er, the student must be first (or sole) author on a manuscript that is research -based analysis of primary or secondary data (or meta -analysis) using appropriate methodology and reporting. Two of the manuscripts must have been fully accepted for publication in scholarly journals described below, and the third manuscript must be deemed to be ready for submission in a journal by the committee before the dissertation defense can be scheduled. Journals targeted for possible publication of the manuscripts shoul d be of high quality, scholarly, and respected in the academic/clinical community. There is no single means of identifying the impact of journals in nursing or in some related areas in which students may publish their work since few nursing journals appea r in either the Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) or the Science Citation Index (SCI). Targeted journals shall have the full support of the dissertation committee chairperson and committee members. If there is a question as to the quality of a journal, students should seek advice from their committee chairperson and a University librarian. Ordinarily, the chairperson of the dissertation committee for the non -traditional dissertation works most closely with the student during the dissertation process. A fter the student has drafted each manuscript, the dissertation chairperson reviews it. The chairperson will provide timely, detailed feedback to the student, identifying those elements that need revision. When the chairperson has approved the manuscript, t he draft is then circulated to the other members of the committee for feedback to the student. The date for the oral defense will be set by the chairperson after the dissertation committee has reviewed and approved the dissertation and agreed on a date. ( See the section on Dissertation Defense.) Memorandum of Agreement for the Nontraditional Dissertation \"A 3 -paper model is allowed as an alternative to the traditional dissertation. This model permit s the doctoral candidate the option of compiling thre e (or more) related articles that have been published or approved for publication in one or more peer -review scholarly journals. The articles are related to a central theme. Each article becomes a chapter within the dissertation. Not all doctoral programs allow the 3 -paper model of dissertation\" [Approved by Graduate Academic Affairs Committee and Council of Academic Deans and Directors]. 57 The memorandum of agreement (MOA) shall be completed by students who choose the non - traditional dissertation and submi tted to the presumptive chairperson and committee for approval. The MOA may be completed during course work prior to the qualifying exam. The chairperson and committee members are considered presumed until they are officially approved in the process of advancing to doctoral candidacy. In the MOA, students shall delineate the nature, structure, and content of the three anticipated manuscripts. No presumption of approval of dissertation plans is appropriate until the MOA is negotiated and signed by all memb ers of the presumed committee and the Ph.D. nursing program director. Papers submitted as assignments in courses may be considered as possible manuscripts in draft form that will need full committee approval to be part of the nontraditional dissertation. Ordinarily, none of the manuscripts for the nontraditional, three -article dissertation can be submitted for publication until the MOA has been officially approved. Approval of the Nontraditional Dissertation All of the members of the graduate faculty on th e presumptive dissertation committee and the Ph.D. nursing program director must approve and sign the nontraditional dissertation memorandum of agreement before it can be accepted. The oral defense of the nontraditional dissertation cannot occur until the minimum of two manuscripts have been fully accepted for publication in approved journals, and the third manuscript is ready for submission, subject to the full approval of the dissertation committee. In addition, the oral defense of the nontraditional diss ertation cannot occur until the student has advanced to Ph.D. candidacy and registered for at least 12 credit hours of NURS 699 9 Dissertation Research. The nontraditional dissertation format ordinarily includes at least five chapters. The first chapter provides a statement of the problem, its background and significance, the research questions or hypotheses to be tested, the rationale and justification for how the three manuscripts are thematically related, and an overview of the remaining chapters. Chapte rs two, three, and four are the article - length manuscripts themselves. Chapter five discusses the implications of those results, draws the appropriate conclusions, and lays out an agenda for future research on the issues addressed in the dissertation. Authorship of Copyrighted Manuscripts in the Nontraditional Dissertation and Those Submitted Derived from the Traditional Dissertation Ordinarily, the author(s) of a manuscript submitted to a journal transfers copyright to the journal. (Exceptions may be open source or open access journals.) Even though the student and/or faculty member(s) have authored a published article, permission to use it must be secured by the student from the owner of the copyright for its inclusion in the dissertation document. Th e journal may have information about the usage of copyrighted material on its website. Additional information on using copyrighted material as part of the dissertation may be found in the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, 6th e dition. The Doctoral Candidacy advisor at the Office of Graduate Education may also provide valuable assistance. The formation of a presumptive committee does not presume or guarantee a student's successful comp letion of the qualifying examination and advancement to candidacy. 58 Dissertation Defense A public, oral defense of the dissertation is required of Ph.D. nursing students in partial fulfillment of the doctoral degree. After all chapters have been reviewed by the committee members and they have provided feedback in sufficient time for students to make additions, corrections, and clarifications, an oral defense of the dissertation will be scheduled. Notification (application) of readiness for the public oral presentation of the Ph.D. dissertation shall be submitted to the Office of Graduate Education at least two weeks prior to the anticipated date. Because signatures are required for this form, please submit this completed form, with the Chairperson's signature, at least three weeks in advance. The form can be found on the Graduate Education website: http://www.slu.edu/academics/graduate/information -for-current -students.php The oral defense will be announced publically to the School of Nursing faculty and students at least three weeks in advance. The announcement will be made by email and/or posted flyers in the School of Nursing building. The event typically consists of a 30 -minute presentation of the disse rtation by the candidate, followed by questioning from committee members, and questioning from the audience before the committee retires to decide on the acceptability of the dissertation and its defense. The questions may pertain to the methodology, find ings, implications, or future research that the candidate anticipates. All of the members of the dissertation committee must approve and sign the ballot before the dissertation can be accepted. The program director and the University's Office of Graduate Education are notified of the results. The oral defense may be delayed if insufficient time has been given to students to consider all feedback. Members of the dissertation committee conduct the oral defense and determine whether the dissertati on research and document make a contribution to nursing science and practice. The oral defense is led by the chairperson of the dissertation committee. Ordinarily, students shall be on -campus at the School of Nursing for the public defense of the disse rtation. Exceptions may be granted under extraordinary conditions with permission from the program director. When feasible, the oral presentation of the defense may be video recorded for students at a distance and possible later viewing by University fac ulty and students. Consent to video record students and the committee is implied as part of the process of the dissertation defense; written permission is not needed. Exception to the implied consent for video recording must be submitted in writing to th e program director.

Also, write a brief summary related to the course objectives before filing the notebook. These ti ps will help when you are ready to study for comps. Make sure you keep up with the readings. Read everything assigned. Don't get behind! It is very beneficial to have an area of interest that is developed further with each nursing course. This allows you t o narrow your focus with each class and prepares you for your dissertation. Use every course to build your knowledge base. Stay Focused! Do literature searches early in the semester. Be organized and prepared. Use EndNote for storing information about jour nal articles and other literature sources. http://www.slu.edu/its/software -downloads EndNote is free to SLU Students and is available on computers in the Ph.D. Student room. Helpful Tips for Graduate Assistants Negotiate research load s so that the ne eds of the school and your needs are mutually identified. Keep an up -to-date calendar and write down all appointments. As graduate assistants, you may have more opportunities to meet faculty members. Take full advantage of this to find mentors who can help you through the next few years. Find out who the other graduate assistants are and get to know them. This will be mutually beneficial. Information for Graduate Assistants Responsibilities and Privileges of Graduate Assistants (Research/Teaching) in the School of Nursing The School of Nursing assistantships for Ph.D. nursing students (restricted to full -time students) provide a monthly stipend for 9 months (possibly summer ); tuition scholarship for 18 credits per academic year (9 fall, 9 spring [ 3 summ er]); and health insurance for 9 or 11 months for 20 hours service per week at the School of Nursing. There are contractual requirements and school expectations for Ph.D. graduate assistants. Please check the Graduate Assistant Manual at http://www.slu.edu/academics/graduate/ga_manual_july_2017.pdf Contractual Requirements Twenty (20) hours per week for assigned faculty during weeks that SLU is in session for the period of time defined in the student's contract. Take course work or actively engage in other academic work (e.g., dissertation) consistent with full-time student status. Do not work for pay outside the University/School unless this has been approved in advance by the program director and/or associate dean for graduate education. It is rarely approved. Refer to the Graduate Assistantship Manual for further information http://www.slu.edu/academics/graduate/ga_manual_july_2017.pdf 72 School Expectations There is a mandator y orientation for first -time graduate assistants. Mandatory mean just that. The graduate/research assistant will be actively involved in acquiring research competencies, teaching competencies, or other skills as appropriate to the faculty's expectations a nd graduate assistant's role aspirations. To foster this development and to encourage the graduate/research assistant's participation in a developing community of scholars, the graduate/research assistant will be expected to attend and participate actively in regularly scheduled School of Nursing monthly research events and, if a teaching assistant, special instructional events consistent with developing teaching expertise. Three hours per month of the graduate/research assistant's contracted time may be al located to participation in these events. The graduate/research assistant is expected to develop role competencies appropriate to a future academic or clinical research position. Participation in governance through the committee structure of the School is an important part of this role development, and the active participation of Ph.D. students on a variety of School of Nursing committees is welcomed and valued. Two hours per month of the graduate/research assistant's contracted time may be allocated to par ticipation in School of Nursing committee work. The two provisions above allow for a maximum of 5 hours per month of the graduate/research assistant's contracted assistantship time (approximately 6.2% of that time to be used for role development activities ). In addition, graduate/research assistants are strongly encouraged to participate in regional and national presentations of their work. A maximum of 3 work days per academic year (i.e., the equivalent of 3 x 4 = 12 hours of assistantship time) may be dev oted to regional and national presentations of the assistant's work (either work related to the assistantship or other scholarly work done by the student). First year Ph.D. students may use a maximum of 2 work days per academic year (i.e., the equivalent o f 2 x 4 = 8 hours of assistantship time) to attend a regional or national research or scholarly meeting. Funding from the Research Committee is available to help defray the expenses of presenters (maximum of $500 for one presentation per academic year). Fu nding must be requested and approved prior to travel . Graduate/research assistants working for the School of Nursing will be allowed to use School of Nursing materials and supplies for their personal academic work at a reimbursement rate that compensates t he School of Nursing at cost. A schedule of the reimbursement rate for various supplies and services (e.g., use of the color printer to print copies on 28# stock) will be reviewed, updated, and made available in early fall of each academic year by the Fina ncial Coordinator. If a large scale use of supplies or services is planned, the Ph.D. student should clear this in advance with the Ph.D. nursing program director to be sure that supplies are not suddenly depleted or instructional work is not disrupted. Graduate/research assistants will be asked to post time cards on their office doors, indicating their probable hours of use of their shared offices. This will allow greater sharing of not -in-use computers by doctoral assistants. Graduate/research assistants will be required to submit a Work Activity Sheet to the Ph.D. nursing program director every two weeks signed by the faculty member(s) with whom they work. Stipend Paychecks All pay is deposited electronically to your bank. Pay stubs can be access ed on Self -Service Banner. Contact the School of Nursing business manager, Lisa Roach , in room 221 or email roachla@slu.edu if you have questions. 73 You need to sign forms (W -2 forms etc.) in the Human Resources Departmen t at the Wool Center on Frost campus before you can begin receiving your checks. It is also where you sign up for electronic deposit. Desk Space Research and Teaching Assistants share offices which will be designated. See the Dean's secretary for your office keys (Room #226, phone 314 -977-8909). Tuition Credit Support There may also be Tuition Credit Support (TCS) available. Students who need tuition can provide 2 hours of service per week to the School of Nursing for every credit of tuition forgiven that semester. Check with the Director of the PhD Program in Nursing to see if you are eligible. Copying for Faculty Members Consult with your designated faculty member regarding payment of copies obtained from journals or books at the library. Copy mac hines in the School of Nursing can be used by assistants to do approved copying for faculty. 74 Appendices 75 Appendix A : Course Descriptions NURS 6 800 Theory Development in Nursing (3) Study of theory development in nursing from his torical and philosophical perspectives.
