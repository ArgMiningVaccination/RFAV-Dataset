When chosen appropriately, and used wisely, aromatic power can pack a powerful therapeutic punch. I formulate products for clients to use at home following a 1-2-1 consultation. Consultations take place either at my treatment room in Twickenham or on-line. Experience has shown me that these consultations, and the bespoke blends created as a result, work brilliantly on-line! The type of products I create depend on individual client need and preferences. They may include cooling aloe vera gels, creamy body butters, self-massage oils and very popular inhalation sticks. All products are created with carefully chosen essential, herbal and vegetable oils (as appropriate). I use high quality products, certified organic where possible. Important Note: aromatherapy / essential oils should not be used as an alternative to allopathic medicine. Always seek advice from your GP or other medical professional when needed, including if symptoms persist. In some instances I may advise you to seek medical advice before seeking aromatherapy support. The consultation plus an aromatherapy inhaler, or equivalently priced product, are included in the cost below. All product options will be discussed in the consultation, or you are welcome to email me questions in "}
