Each season since 2004-05, CDC has estimated the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccine in preventing medi- cally attended acute respiratory illness (ARI) associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza. This season, early estimates of influenza vaccine effectiveness are possible because of wide- spread, early circulation of influenza viruses. By January 3, 2015, 46 states were experiencing widespread flu ac tivity, with predominance of influenza A (H3N2) viruses ( 2). This report presents an initial estimate of seasonal inf luenza vaccine effectiveness at preventing laboratory-confirmed inf luenza virus infection associated with medically attended ARI based on data from 2,321 children and adults enrolled in the U.S. Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (Flu VE) du ring November 10, 2014-January 2, 2015. During this peri od, overall vaccine effectiveness (VE) (adjusted for st udy site, age, sex, race/ethnicity, self-rated health, and days from illness onset to enrollment) against laboratory-confirmed influenza associated with medically attended ARI was 23% (95% con- fidence interval [CI] = 8%-36%). Most influenza infections were due to A (H3N2) viruses. This interim VE estimate is relatively low compared with previous seasons when circulat- ing viruses and vaccine viruses were well-matched and likely reflects the fact that more than two-thirds of circ ulating A (H3N2) viruses are antigenically and genetically different (drifted) from the A (H3N2) vaccine component of 2014-15 Northern Hemisphere seasonal influenza vaccines ( 2). These early, low VE estimates underscore the need for ong oing influenza prevention and treatment measures. CDC co ntinues to recommend influenza vaccination because the vaccine can still prevent some infections with the currently ci rculating A (H3N2) viruses as well as other viruses that might circulate later in the season, including influenza B viruses. Even when VE is reduced, vaccination still prevents some illness and seri- ous influenza-related complications, including thousands of hospitalizations and deaths ( 3). Persons aged 6 months who have not yet been vaccinated this season should be vaccinated, including persons who might already have been ill with influ- enza this season.CDC always recommends antiviral medications as an a djunct to vaccination, and their potential public health b enefit is magnified in the context of reduced vaccine effectiveness. All hospitalized patients and all outpatients at high r isk for serious complications from influenza should be treated as s oon as pos- sible with a neuraminidase inhibitor medication if influenza is suspected. A CDC health update from January 9, 2015, regarding treatment with antiviral medications is a vailable at http://emergency.cdc.gov/han/han00375.asp. Physi cians should not wait for confirmatory influenza laboratory testing, and the decision to use an antiviral medication should not be influenced by patient vaccination status ( 4). Clinicians should be aware that influenza activity is widespread and influenza should be considered as a possible diagnosis in all patients with acute respiratory illness. Flu VE methods have been published previously ( 5). Patients aged 6 months were enrolled when seeking out- patient medical care for an ARI with cough at study sites in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin.* Study enrollment began once laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza were identified through local surveillance. T rained study staff members reviewed appointment schedules and chief complaints to identify patients with ARI. Patients were eligible for enrollment if they 1) were aged 6 months on Se ptember 1, 2014, and thus eligible for vaccination; 2) reporte d an ARI with cough and onset 7 days earlier; and 3) had not yet been treated with influenza antiviral medication (e.g., oseltamivir) during this illness. Consenting participants completed an enrollment interview. Nasal and oropharyngeal swabs were collected from each patient and placed together in a single cryovial with viral Early Estimates of Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness \u2014 United States, January 2015 Brendan Flannery, PhD 1, Jessie Clippard, MPH1, Richard K.

Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report MMWR / January 16, 2015 / Vol. 64 / No. 1 11 transport medium. Only nasal swabs were collected f or patients aged <2 years. Specimens were tested at Flu VE laboratories using CDC's real-time reverse transcription-polymer ase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) protocol for detection and identification of influenza viruses. Participants were considered vaccinated if they receiv ed 1 dose of any seasonal influenza vaccine 14 days before illness onset, according to medical records and registries (at the Wisconsin site) or medical records and self-report (at the Michigan, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Washington s ites). Vaccine effectiveness was estimated as 100% x (1 - odds ratio [ratio of odds of being vaccinated among outpatient s with influenza-positive test results to the odds of being vaccinated among outpatients with influenza-negative test results]); odds ratios were estimated using logistic regression. Estimates were adjusted for study site, age, sex, race/ethnicity, self-rated health, and days from illness onset to enrollment. These early interim VE estimates for the 2014-15 season were based on patients enrolled through January 2, 2015. Of the 2,321 children and adults with ARI enrolled at the five study sites, 950 (41%) tested positive for influenza virus by rRT-PCR; 916 (96%) of these viruses were influen za A, and 35 (4%) were influenza B (Table 1). The proportion of patients with influenza differed by study site, age, race/ethnicity, and interval from onset to enrollment (Table 1). The proportion vaccinated ranged from 46% to 66% across sites and also dif- fered by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and self-rated health status. The proportion vaccinated with 2014-15 seasonal inf luenza vaccine was 49% among patients with influenza compared with 56% among influenza-negative controls (Table 2). After adjusting for study site, age, sex, race/ethnicity, self-rated health, and days from illness onset to enrollment, VE against medically attended ARI attributable to influenza A and B virus infections was 23% (CI = 8%-36%). Among the 916 infections with influenza A viruses, 842 (92%) viruses were subtyped; 100% of those were influenza A (H3N2) viruses (Table 1). Overall, 24 influenza A (H3N2) v iruses from patients enrolled in Flu VE were characterized; eight (33%) were antigenically similar to A/Texas/50/2012, and 16 (67%) were antigenically drifted. The drifted viruses had reduced titers with antiserum produced against A/Texas/50/2012 and were similar to the A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 (H3N2) virus. The adjusted VE for all ages against medically attended ARI caused by influenza A (H3N2) virus infection was 22% (CI = 5%-35%). The adjusted, age-stratified VE point esti- mates were 26% for persons aged 6 months-17 years, 12% for persons aged 18-49 years, and 14% for persons aged 50 years (Table 2). Statistically significant VE was observed only among persons aged 6 months-17 years.Discussion The early onset of the 2014-15 influenza season offered an opportunity to provide an early VE estimate. Ove rall, the estimate suggests that the 2014-15 influenza va ccine has low effectiveness against circulating influenza A (H3N2) viruses. These early findings are consistent with l aboratory data demonstrating that most influenza A (H3N2) vir uses circulating in the community are antigenically and genetically different from A/Texas/50/2012, the A (H3N2) component of the 2014-15 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine. The predominant A (H3N2) viruses detected through survei l- lance during the 2014-15 season have been similar t o the A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 (H3N2) virus, the H3N2 v irus selected for the 2015 Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine (2). CDC will continue to closely monitor vaccine eff ectiveness this season, and these estimates might be updated a s more data become available. CDC continues to recommend influenza vaccination even when there are drifted viruses cir culating because the vaccine can still prevent some infections with the circulating A (H3N2) viruses and might also prevent serious complications requiring hospitalization. Also, vaccine might protect against other influenza viruses that can circulate later. As of early November, 2014, fewer than half of U.S. residents had reported receiving influenza vaccine this season . Influenza vaccination, even when effectiveness is reduced, can prevent thousands of hospitalizations ( 3). The severity and timing of influenza activity durin g the 2014-15 season has so far been similar to the moder ately severe 2012-13 season, the last season when influenza A (H3N2) viruses predominated. Rates of influenza-associated hospital- ization so far this season are similar to rates during 2012-13, with highest hospitalization rates among persons ag ed 65 years (2). CDC surveillance through January 3, 2015, shows that the percentage of patient visits to doctors for influenza-like- illness (ILI) this season was almost the same as at the peak of the 2012-13 season ( 2). For the past 13 seasons, influenza seasons have ranged in duration, with an average of 13 weeks of increased ILI activity. This season, as of the week ending January 3, 2015, influenza activity has been elevated for 7 consecutive weeks, suggesting that the current infl uenza season might continue for several weeks. Influenza activit y might continue to increase, especially in parts of the cou ntry that have seen more recent increases in activity and parts of the country that have yet to experience significant influenza activity. Influenza vaccination coverage estimates for the 2014-15 season are available at http://www.cdc.gov/flu/fluvaxview/index.htm.Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 12 MMWR / January 16, 2015 / Vol. 64 / No. 1 These early VE estimates underscore the need for additiona l influenza prevention and treatment measures, especi ally among persons aged 65 years, young children, and other persons at higher risk for serious influenza associated compli cations. \u00a7 Influenza antiviral medications should be used as r ecom- mended \u00b6 for treatment in patients, regardless of their vac - cination status. Antiviral treatment can reduce the duration of illness and reduce complications associated with influenza (4). Antiviral treatment should be used for any patient with suspected or confirmed influenza who is hospitalize d, has severe or progressive illness, or is at high risk for complications from influenza, even if the illness seems mild. Persons at high risk include young children (especially children aged <2 years), pregnant women, persons with chronic medical condit ions like asthma, diabetes, or heart disease, and adults aged 65 years. Ideally, antiviral treatment should be initiated wi thin 48 hours of symptom onset, when treatment is most effective (4). However, antiviral treatment initiated later than 48 hours after illness onset can still be beneficial for som e patients. Observational studies of hospitalized patients suggest some benefit when treatment was initiated up to 4 or 5 days after symptom onset ( 4). Also, a randomized placebo-controlled study suggested clinical benefit when oseltamivir was initi- ated 72 hours after illness onset among febrile children with uncomplicated influenza ( 6). Clinical judgment, on the basis of the patient's disease severity and progression, age, under- lying medical conditions, likelihood of influenza, and time since onset of symptoms, is important when making antiviral treatment decisions for outpatients. The decision to initiate antiviral treatment should not be delayed pending laboratory confirmation of influenza, especially if performed by insensi- tive assays, such as rapid influenza diagnostic tes ts. Health care providers should advise patients at high risk to call promptly if they get symptoms of influenza. Also, clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for influenza while influenza activ- ity is widespread. Alternative strategies, such as health care provider-operated telephone triage, might enable patients at high risk to discuss symptoms over the phone and facilitate early initiation of treatment. Although antigenic match influences vaccine effectiveness, randomized studies of influenza vaccines have reported vari- able vaccine efficacy during seasons when antigenic ally drifted viruses predominated ( 7). Since October 1, 2014, drifted influenza A (H3N2) viruses have accounted for an increasing proportion of antigenically characterized A (H3N2) isolates relative to A/T exas/20/2012-like viruses ( 8). Drifted A (H3N2) viruses were first identified in a small proportion of surveil- lance specimens in late March 2014, after the World Health Organizations had selected the strains for inclusio n in the 2014-15 Northern Hemisphere vaccine. These antigenically drifted viruses were detected with increasing frequency from July to September 2014, when they had become common among A (H3N2) viruses in the United States and abroad ( 9). As of January 3, 2015, 68% of A (H3N2) viruses isolated in the United States since October 1, 2014, were antigenically or genetically different from the A (H3N2) vaccine vir us compo- nent (2); characterization of a limited number of A (H3N2) viruses from US Flu VE network enrollees had similar find- ings. Modeling conducted by CDC suggested that a VE of only 10% in older adults could prevent approximately 13,000 \u00a7 Groups at higher risk for influenza complications include 1) children aged <5 years (especially those aged <2 years); 2) adults aged 65 years; 3) persons with chronic pulmonary conditions (including asthma); cardiovascular disease (except hypertension alone); renal, hepatic, or hematologic (including sickle cell) disease; metabolic disorders (including diabetes mellitus); or neurologic and neurodevelopmental conditions (including disorders of the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerve, and muscle, such as cerebral palsy, epilepsy [seizure disorders], stroke, intellectual disability [mental retardation], moderate to severe developmental delay, muscular dystrophy, and spinal cord injury); 4) persons with immunosuppression, including that caused by medications or by human immunodeficiency virus infection; 5) women who are pregnant or postpartum (within 2 weeks of delivery); 6) persons aged 18 years who are receiving long- term aspirin therapy; 7) American Indians/Alaska Natives; 8) persons who are morbidly obese (i.e., body mass index 40); and 9) residents of nursing homes and other chronic care facilities. \u00b6 A complete summary of guidance for antiviral use is available at http://www. cdc.gov/flu/professionals/antivirals/summary-clinicians.htm. What is already known on this topic? Effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccine can vary and depends in part on the match between vaccine viruses and circulating influenza viruses. However, influenza vaccination, even with low effectiveness, prevents thousands of hospitalizations. What is added by this report? So far this season, more than two thirds of influenza A (H3N2) viruses are different from the H3N2 component of 2014-15 influenza vaccine. Based on data from 2,321 children and adults with acute respiratory illness enrolled during November 10, 2014-January 2, 2015, at five study sites with outpatient medical facilities in the United States, the overall estimated effectiveness of the 2014-15 seasonal influenza vaccine for preventing medically attended, laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection was 23%. What are the implications for public health practice? Early estimates indicate that influenza vaccines pr ovide limited protection against influenza viruses circulating so far during 2014-15 season, which were mainly influenza A (H3N2 ) viruses. Although vaccination should continue as long as inf luenza viruses are circulating, treatment with influenza a ntiviral medications is more important than usual. All hospi talized patients and all outpatients at high risk for serio us complications should be treated as soon as possible with one of t hree available influenza antiviral medications if influenza is sus pected. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report MMWR / January 16, 2015 / Vol. 64 / No. 1 13 influenza-associated hospitalizations in adults aged 65 years in the United States during a moderately severe inf luenza season such as the 2012-13 influenza season ( 3). Vaccination is particularly important for persons at high risk for serious influenza-related complications and their close contacts. The findings in this report are subject to at least four limita- tions. First, these early VE estimates are imprecise for persons aged 18 years, limiting ability to detect statisti cally significant protection against influenza illness resulting in visits to health care providers; larger numbers of enrollees are req uired to detect significant protection when VE is low. Second, the VE esti- mates in this report are limited to the prevention of outpatient medical visits, rather than more severe illness outcomes, such as hospitalization or death; studies are being cond ucted during the 2014-15 season to estimate VE against more severe illness outcomes. Third, vaccination status included self-r eport at four of five sites, and dates of vaccination and vaccine formulation were available only for persons with documented vaccination TABLE 1.

Finally, future interim estimates and end-of-season VE esti- mates could differ from current estimates as additi onal patient data become available or if there is a change in circulating viruses late in the season. Although influenza vaccines are the best tool for prevention of influenza currently available, more effective va ccines are needed. Other practices that can help decrease the spread of influenza include respiratory hygiene, cough etiquette, social distancing (e.g., staying home from work and school when ill or staying away from persons who are ill) and hand wash- ing. Antiviral medications are an important adjunct in the treatment and control of influenza for the 2014-15 season and should be used as recommended, regardless of pa tient vaccination status.
