Overview of Disease Typhoid fever is an infection of the gut and bloodstream caused by bacteria. It is spread from person to person, usually from eating food or drinking water that has been contaminated with the bacteria from an infected person, which is passed out of their body in their poo or (less commonly) their pee. Typhoid can be found throughout the world but it is more common in countries that have limited access to clean water or toilets. Countries at highest risk include India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, but you may also be at risk if you visit countries in others parts of Asia, Africa, the Pacific and South and Central America. The Illness It can take 1 to 3 weeks after becoming infected for you to feel ill, so symptoms can start when you have returned home. The main symptoms of typhoid are similar to a general upset tummy and may include: - a high temperature (fever) - a headache - general aches and pains As the infection progresses, you may begin to feel sick (nausea), lose your appetite, older children or adults may feel constipated, young children may experience diarrhoea, and some people may develop a rash. If typhoid fever isn't treated, symptoms can progressively get worse and serious, life threatening complications may develop. Treatment Typhoid can be treated with antibiotics. If the infection is diagnosed early, you can usually be treated at home with tablets. People who develop complications need to be admitted to hospital. You should seek medical attention if you develop a high temperature (fever) and any of the above symptoms, and you are travelling (or have recently travelled) abroad. You should mention to the doctor or nurses where you have been travelling. "}
