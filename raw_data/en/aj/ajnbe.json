Many struggled to explain the situation to troubled kids, The measles lawsuit that halted Rockland County's emergency declaration included a diverse mix of parents who cited academic, financial and religious hardships connected to keeping unvaccinated children at home. Newly reported details include some parents' reasons for not vaccinating children, as well as fallout from County Executive Ed Day's order barring them from schools and many public places, court records show. Some parents set up a makeshift home-school in their basement. Others had tutors to keep children on track academically. Many described struggling to explain the situation to emotionally distraught children. Identities of parents and children weren't disclosed in court records. One parent's affidavit involved a 14-year-old boy getting tutored during the ban, and Rockland's prior measles-related exclusions from schools with low vaccination rates stemming from the outbreak that started last fall. Like the dozens of other children in the lawsuit, the boy attended Green Meadow Waldorf School in Chestnut Ridge, and its affiliated schools. \"This morning I watched my son's face as I had to tell him that his math tutoring was canceled,\" the parent said. \"As (he) held back the tears. I died inside, and cried. He and I were crushed.\" [ORDER: Rockland emergency declaration halted by judge amid measles outbreak](https://www.lohud.com/story/news/local/rockland/2019/04/05/measles-rockland-emergency-order-halted-judge/3369683002/) [HOSPITAL: Nyack Hospital contacts dozens of people after measles exposure](https://www.lohud.com/story/news/local/rockland/2019/04/05/measles-nyack-hospital-exposures-announced/3376312002/) [COURT: What's next after judge halts Rockland's emergency declaration?](https://www.lohud.com/story/news/local/rockland/2019/04/06/measles-whats-next-after-judge-halts-rockland-emergency-declaration/3385858002/) The parent also explained the choice to obtain a religious exemption from vaccinating the child. \"We are NOT against vaccinations. We believe that GOD created the body, and it should remain untainted by man,\" the parent stated, attributing it to deeply held religious beliefs without disclosing a specific denomination. What follows are the stories of struggle from parents cited in the lawsuit, which resulted in acting state Supreme Court Judge Rolf Thorsen issuing a temporary injunction halting the emergency declaration. Waldorf school and parenting One parent described moving to Chestnut Ridge specifically to educate two children at Green Meadow Waldorf School. \"We believe in the principals of Waldorf Education including the education of the whole child \u2014 physical, social, emotional, and mental/academic,\" the parent said. Green Meadow, which educates about 300 children in nursery school through grade 12, adheres to Rudolf Steiner's teachings of anthroposophy, which is \"the belief that humanity has the wisdom to transform itself and the world, through one's own spiritual development,\" [according to the Association of Waldorf Schools of North America](https://www.lohud.com/story/news/local/rockland/chestnut-ridge/2019/03/12/waldorf-schools-whats-vaccination-policy/3140543002/). The parent who relocated to be near the school also temporarily taught nine unvaccinated students in a makeshift homeschooling arrangement during the measles exclusion, court records show. \"We created a physical space for schooling the children in our home, put up a chalkboard, and reorganized our basement,\" the parent said. \"We incurred expenses in order to do so.\" The home-schooling attempt, however, proved insufficient as the exclusion orders stretched, the parent said. \"While I tried to piece together some lessons for my 5th grade son, I am not a trained teacher,\" the parent said. \"He was not getting the education he needs and deserves. He was suffering on a mental/academic level.\" The Waldorf schools association has stated its educational objectives do not include avoidance of, or resistance to, childhood immunization. The association also noted it encourages parents to consider their civic responsibility regarding immunizations, but ultimately the decision is one made by parents in consultation with their physician. \"The health, safety, and well-being of children are our forefront concerns,\" the association said.

At least 36 students at Asheville Waldorf School contracted the varicella virus, known to most as chickenpox. The school has one of the highest vaccination religious exemption rates in North Carolina. 'Coerced' vaccination During the Rockland exclusion, the temporary homeschooling parent's 9th grade daughter was taking classes digitally through an internet streaming program. But the girl's grades started to slip and the parent eventually got her vaccinated, despite a prior religious exemption, court records show. \"While I accept our choice to get the vaccination, it felt like we were coerced into making that decision,\" the parent said. \"It did not come of our own free will.\" The parent continued; \"Indeed, this decision violated my beliefs about vaccinations which are personal and specific to my children. I believe in my freedom of choice and well-informed consent around any medical intervention. I always research multiple sides and get various expert opinions on any issue, especially medical.\" [NATION: Large study adds to proof that measles vaccine doesn't cause autism](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2019/03/05/vaccines-autism-measles-shots-dont-increase-risk-study/3064073002/) The 5th grade boy, however, has been enrolled in a Connecticut school that accepted the unspecified religious exemption, court records show. \"That exemption reflects our belief that vaccinations are against the maker's will and introduce impure substances into his body,\" the parent said. \"That will always informed our behavior until we were forced to vaccinate our daughter to avoid even greater harm to her.\" Another parent, whose husband is a faculty member at the school, described being overwhelmed by the emotional and logistical burdens of having two children barred from school due to a religious exemption to vaccination. The weight of the situation led the family to vaccinate the oldest son, court records show. \"Deciding between our religious rights and our children's right to an education is not a choice one should have to make,\" the woman said. After outlining the agonizing decision to vaccinate, the parent told of great-grandparents who immigrated to the U.S. in 1910. \"These relatives of mine were Jewish and while treatment of Jews in Russia at that time was appalling, what finally made my brave and bold great-grandmother say 'enough is enough' is when the government decreed that Jewish kids could no longer attend school,\" the woman said, describing New York as a beacon of religious tolerance at the time. \"Now, 109 years later, the government of New York is telling me my children cannot go to school because of our religious beliefs,\" she said, referring to Rockland's orders. \"And now the time has come for this mother to stand up and say 'enough is enough.' \" Reasons for not vaccinating Another parent of two children, ages 7 and 9, described missing work and losing wages in order to care for them during the school exclusion, as well as concerns about vaccination demands. \"The pressure to have my children vaccinated has taken its toll on my family's health,\" the parent said, citing how the once happy children now cry easily due to the anxiety, depression and fear. The parent also addressed other families' decisions to vaccinate children to get them back to school, despite violating their beliefs. \"As for my family, this choice between the two evils is not an option,\" the parent said. \"Under the constitution, nobody should lose their freedom and be forced to suffer this way.\" The religious exemption described by this parent is unspecified and referred to as an understanding of God's will. \"We are honest, kind, helpful, hardworking people. Our vegetarian diet keeps us healthy without doing harm to other living beings,\" the parent said. \"Since for us the blood is the carrier of the soul, injections of vaccine-substances, often animal or embryo derived, are strictly forbidden.\" [NEW YORK: Lawmakers push ending religious exemptions for vaccinations](https://www.lohud.com/story/news/2019/04/04/measles-outbreak-officials-back-end-vaccination-religious-exemptions/3363092002/) Another parent described the family's reason for not vaccinating two girls, ages 5 and 8. \"We carry strong spiritual beliefs that the body is more than physical matter to be manipulated and that illness is a mode of transformation for the body if it naturally responds to illness,\" the parent said, adding they would not adhere to vaccination by coercion. Some of the parents explained they're living on the Waldorf campus as faculty or workers there. One couple described having three children excluded for being unvaccinated due to Buddhism and religious beliefs. The woman involved was raised in the Shinto religion of Japan. She described working long hours as a teacher at the schools to help coordinate exclusion-related staffing. \"In the begging of the exclusion, I stayed up until midnight almost every day to manage the teachers' schedules so that they could visit/tutor our excluded students,\" she said, adding it ruined her health. \"I feel I'm always running in between my children and my students and cannot function very well any more,\" she added.
