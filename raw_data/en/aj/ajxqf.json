C o m p l e t e d b y D a t e RTOG 0915 11.0 INTRODUCTION 1.1 Lung Cancer and the Medically Inoperable Patient Lung Cancer is the most frequent ca use of cancer death in the Unit ed States. Cancer statistics for 2008 estimated 215,020 new cases and 161,840 deaths due to lung cancer, making it the leading cause of cancer mortality in both men and women (Jemal 2008). Eighty percent of lung cancers are non-small cell (NSCLC) in histol ogy. Approximately 15-20% of NSCLC patients present with early localized disease (Jemal 2008). Standard therapy for stage I NSCLC is surgical resection, consisting of either lobectomy or pneu monectomy, with 5-year overall survival (OS) ranging from 50% to 70%. A significant proport ion of NSCLC patients present with impaired cardiopulmonary reserve, placing them at increa sed risk of perioperative complications and long- term disability with standard anatomic resections. Sublobar resections (wedge resections and segmentectomies) historically have been offered to compromised patients to mitigate the loss of lung parenchyma, but a randomized study has dem onstrated that compared with lobectomy, limited pulmonary resection does not confer improved perioperative mo rbidity, mortality, or late postoperative pulmonary function and is associat ed with a higher death rate and locoregional recurrence rate (Ginsberg 1995). In effect, early stage NSCLC patients with impaired lung function are generally deemed to be medi cally inoperable (Zierhut 2001). Historically, medically inoperable early stage NSCLC patients have been offered external beam radiotherapy (RT) alone using conventional tech niques as Dorosetz 1992) although treatment results have been consistently inferior to the results of surgery alone. Sibley, et al. (1998) reported on 141 patients with clinical stage I NSCLC treated wi th radiotherapy alone using modern techniques and staging. The median RT dose delivered was 64 Gy (range: 48 Gy to 80 Gy). The overall survival at 2 and 5 years were 39% and 13%, respectively (median 18 months), while the progression-free survival was 48% and 28% at 2 an d 5 years, respectively. Forty-nine percent of patients had local failure as part of their relapse pattern. In a review of 18 studies published from 1988 to 2000 on conventional RT for stage I NSCLC, Qiao, et al. (2003) reported local recurrence to be the most common cause of failure with such treatment, with a wide range of failure rates reported, ranging from 6% to 70%. Many factors likely explain the discrepancy in outcomes for patients treated with RT compared to surgery. Clinically based staging alone in medically inoperable patients likely underestimates the dis ease extent (Zierhut 2001). Comorbidities significantly impact survivals; thus, cause spec ific survivals are 10-20% higher than overall survivals in medically inoperable patients due to mortality from competing causes (Sibley 1998; Dosoretz 1992; Slotman to 85% biopsy proven (Le Chevalier 1994), have continued to be a problem following curative radiation. The high rates of local failure seen with convent ional RT have prompted trials in dose escalation with conventional fractionation. Several have shown improved outcomes with higher doses (Sibley 1998; Zhang 1989; Kaskowitz 1993; Chen 2006; Cox 1990; Kong 2006). However, not all series have shown improved survival with highe r doses (Slotman 1994; Sandler 1990). Use of alternate fractionation over conventional fractionat ion schemes also have been investigated as a means of improving radiation outcomes (Perez 1987; Saunders 1997). However, such alternate fractionation schemes employing conventional tr eatment margins have significantly increased toxicity, especially pulmonary toxicity (Saunders 1997). These efforts to increase the dose per fraction to the tumor while limiting the dose to surrounding normal tissues were among the motivating factors which prompted the developme nt and introduction of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) as a novel modality in the management of medically inoperable early stage NSCLC. 1.2 SBRT in Medically Inoperable NSCLC SBRT has been increasingly employed in the m anagement of early stage medically inoperable NSCLC because it involves highly precise delivery of short courses (few fractions) of very high- dose (hyprofractionated) RT to accurately deli neated, size-restricted malignant targets in which motion has been accounted for during the deliv ery process. For chest malignancies, tumor movement due to respiration is managed through a variety of approaches, including tumor tracking, gating delivery of treatment, and/or employing breath control techniques. SBRT administration achieves avoidance of normal tiss ue exposure to radiation during the planning process, by providing for sharp fall-off dos e gradients outside the ta 2An increasing number of reports in SBRT for lung cancer, and particularly those from prospective clinical trials, are establishing the feasibility, safe ty, and efficacy of this treatment modality in this reports suggest high rates of local contro l and improved overall survival with remarkably few high grade toxicities in what is otherwise a generally fragile patient population. To date, published data generally reflect single institution experiences and explains to some degree variations among institutions with respect to tota l dose, fractionation schedules, overall treatment time, and techniques of dose delivery. These di fferences have made it challenging to standardize dosimetric specifications in the administration of SBRT (Matsuo 2007). Nonetheless, reported rates from a range of series suggest at least 80% local control at a minimum of 3 years (Song 2004; Timmerman 2007). In North America, final results from a recently completed RTOG phase II protocol in SBRT, RTOG 0236, should facilitate comparison across institut ions by yielding results from a standardized treatment regimen (only preliminary toxicity data have been presented) [Timmerman 2007b]. In this study, 60 Gy was administered in 3 fraction s over a period or 8 to 14 days. Currently in Japan, where experience with lung SBRT is extens ive, a single arm phase II study is being run by the Japanese Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG 0403) as a dose exploration study consisting of 48 Gy in 4 fractions delivered over 4 to 8 days, with a planned accrual of 165 patients (Hiraoka 2008). In view of these mutually confirmatory reports on feasibility, efficacy, and early safety, ongoing areas of interest in lung SBRT now include lo ng term assessment of outcomes and further rationalization of treatment regimens, with a tr end towards decreased number of fractions and increased dose per fraction. 1.2.1 Multiple Fraction SBRT (8/19/10) The majority of SBRT published studies document th e feasibility and safety of multiple fraction therapy for medically inoperable lung cancer. Sele cted U.S. and Japanese reports of interest are presented below. The most comprehensive prospective U.S. SBRT se ries has come from investigators at Indiana University who conducted a found ational phase I study among 47 patients with Stage IA or IB NSCLC. The study began at a dose of 8Gy in 3 frac tions and escalated to a dose of 24 Gy in 3 fractions. Significantly decreased rates of local recurrence (LR) [only 1 of 9] were noted among patients receiving >16 Gy per fraction. No signif icant toxicities were reported at 20 Gy per fraction. The maximum tolerated dose was realized at 72 Gy for tumors larger than 5 cm. Dose-limiting toxicity Subsequently, Timmerman, et al. (2006) carried out a prospective, phase II, 70 patient trial using stereotactic body r adiation therapy (SBRT) to doses of 60 to 66 Gy in three fractions during 1 to 2 weeks. Wi th a median follow up of 17.5 months, the 3-month major response rate was 60%. Kaplan-Meier lo cal control at 2 years was 95%. Grade 3 to 5 toxicity occurred in a total of 14 patients. Si x patients died as a consequence of treatment- related toxicity. Median overall survival was 32 .6 months, and 2-year overall survival was 54.7%. Among patients experiencing toxicity, the median time to observation was 10.5 months. Tumors with GTV volume of more than 10 mL had an eight-fold risk of high grade toxicity compared with smaller tumors (P = .017). Patient s treated for tumors in the peripheral lung had 2-year freedom from severe toxicity of 83% compared with only 54% for patients with central tumors. Based on the early experience from Indiana University (Timmerman 2003), the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) initiated a prospective phase I/II (RTOG 0236) in medically inoperable NSCLC. This study went on to enroll 52 medically inoperable patients with peripherally located, node negative NSCLC measuring 5cm. Patients received three 20 Gy fractions (without heterogeneity corrections) over 10-14 days. The trial was closed to accrual in October 2006. Early results in abstract form show 15% grade 3-4 toxicity. Specifically, with median follow up of 8.7 months, there was 1 (2%) grade 4 and 7 (13%) grade 3 pulmonary/upper respiratory adverse events report ed as related to protocol treatment. Two of RTOG 0915 3the 7 patients demonstrated decreased pulmonar y function, and there was 1 patient was reported as having cough/dyspnea, 1 with hypoxia, 1 with pneumonitis, 1 patient with cough/forced expiratory volume, and 1 reported pneumothorax. There was also a grade 3 dermatitis and a grade 3 syncope reported as related to protocol treatment. Unpublished review of RTOG 0236 indicates that primary tumor control has been maintained with longer follow up (estimated 93% actuarial at 2 years); however , grade 3 and 4 treatment-related toxicity is moderately high at 28% of analyzed patients. No treatment-related deaths have been reported (Timmerman 2009). As the median time to toxicity was previously reported in the previous Timmerman publication (2006) was 10.5 months, th e observed toxicity reported in this RTOG abstract (with 8.7 months of follow up) can be expected to rise. Also in the U.S., Chang, et al. (2008) at MD Anderson Cancer Center recently published their experience with a regimen of 50 Gy in 4 frac tions. With a median follow up of 17 months (range, 6-40 months) for 27 patients, the crude lo cal control at the treated site was 100% using 50 Gy. However, 3 of 7 patients had local recurrences when treated using 40 Gy. Of the patients with Stage I disease, 1 (7.7%) an d 2 (15.4%) developed mediastinal lymph node metastasis and distant metastases, respectively . Of the patients with recurrent disease, 3 (21.4%) and 5 (35.7%) developed mediastinal lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis, respectively. Four patients (28.6%) with re current disease but none with Stage I disease developed Grade 2 pneumonitis. Three patients (11.1%) developed Grade 2-3 dermatitis and chest wall pain. One patient developed brachial plexus neuropathy. No esophagitis was noted in any patient. In Japan, Uematsu, et al. (2001) have been pioneers in lung SBRT with some of the first publications of long term experience in stage I NSCLC. Their first report provided 5-year results for 50 patients with pathologi cally proven NSCLC treated in t he early 1990s with SBRT. Of these, 21 patients were medically inoperable and the remainder were medically operable but refused surgery. In most patients, SBRT was give n in 5-10 fractions for 1-2 weeks for a total of 50-60 Gy. With a median follow up period of 36 months (range 22-66), local progression had not been observed on follow-up CT scans in 47 (9 4%) of 50 patients, with a 3-year overall survival rate of 66% for 50 pat ients and 86% in the 29 medically operable patients. The 3-year cause-specific survival rate of all 50 patients was 88%. No definite adverse events related to SBRT were noted, except for 2 patients with a minor bone fracture and 6 patients with temporary pleural pain. Nagata, et al. (2005) have reported on 45 early stage NSCLS patients treated with 4 fractions of 12 Gy over 5-13 (median = 12) days. At a median 30 months follow up, no grade 3 pulmonary toxicities were noted. For stage IA lu ng cancer, the disease- free survival and overall survival rates at 3 years were 72%, and 83%, respectively, and for stage IB lung cancer, 71% and 72%, respectively. In one of the most mature retrospective series published in lung SBRT, Onishi, et al. (2007) reported outcomes among 257 patients treated with SBRT in 14 Japanese centers using a variety of dosing schemes (1-22 fractions at 3-12 Gy per fraction). Total dose ranged from 18 to 75 Gy. With 38 months median follow up, the local, regional nodal, and distant recurrence rates were 14.0%, 11.3%, and 19.8%, respectively. The overall 3- and 5-year survival rates for all patients a biologically equivalent dose (BED) of > 100 Gy experienced fewer local recurrences than those patients rece iving < 100 Gy BED (42.9 vs. 8.1%, p<0.001). Similarly, survival was significantly improved with higher BED doses (70.8 vs. 30.2% (p<0.05). Grade 3 or higher toxicity was observed in 5.4% of patients. Of note, t he irradiation method and results for the 3 major institutions enrolled in this study were compared, and the local control and 3-year survival rates were almost identical. As evident from the aforementioned reports, there are currently diverse practices and fractionation schedules used in the setting of SBRT for medically inoperable early stage NSCLC documenting the feasibility and safety of mult iple fraction therapy; therefore, selecting a multiple-fraction schedule for further testing in a collaborative group setting is a pragmatic question. A recent practice survey from Japan (Nagata 2006) is informative in making such a RTOG 0915 4selection. This survey noted that the majority (52%) of practitioners were employing a 48 Gy/4fx schedule, This schedule appears to fit with anecd otal reports of U.S. non-trial based clinical practice. In that regard, this schedule has been chosen for further assessment in the RTOG. 1.2.2 Single Fraction SBRT Data also has been published supporting the feasibility, safety, and efficacy for single fraction SBRT in the management of medically inoperable NSCLC. Wulf, et al. (2004) described SBRT for primary lung cancer and pulmonary metastases using a variety of treatment regimens including single fraction therapy of 26 Gy. One of 20 NSCLC patients and 25 of 51 metastatic patients were tr eated with that fraction ation. They reported no toxicity associated with the 26 Gy treatment and no local failure after median follow up of 11 months for the NSCLC patients. Hof, et al. (2007) reported outcomes for 42 patie nts with stage I or II NSCLC treated with single dose SBRT (dose range 19-30 Gy.) With a medi an follow up of 15 months, overall survival and disease-free survival at 36 mont hs were 37.4% and 49.1%, respectively. Local tumor control at 3 years was 67.9% at the same time points. Loc al tumor control was significantly improved in those patients receiving 26-30 Gy (n=32) versus lower doses (p=0.032). With respect to toxicity, no CTCAE grade 3 or 4 toxicities were noted. Follow-up CT scan of normal tissue changes (including pneumonitic changes and fibrosis) were noted in the treatment area in 64.3% of patients but were not c linically relevant. Minor cough and slightly increased dyspnea were the only clinical toxicities observed. Fritz, et al. (2206) reported on outcomes for 33 patients with stage I NSCLC treated with a single dose of 30 Gy. With a median follow up of 18 months, local tumor control was 83% and overall survival was 39% at 4 years. There were no grade 3 or higher toxicities reported. In 8 NSCLC patients (24%), CT scans revealed r adiographic changes consistent with pneumonitis but these were not associated with any clinical symptoms. Whyte, et al. (2003) reported on the preliminar y Stanford phase I experience of single-fraction SBRT in 23 patients (of which 15 had primary NSCLC) using a robotic, frameless radiosurgery system (CyberKnife\u00ae). Treatment consisted of 15 Gy in a single fraction. There were no grade 3 or higher toxicities noted for a median follow up of 7 months. These authors then reported on their subsequent dose escalation experience in single-fraction treatment (Le 2006). In this study, 33 three patients were reported on, of which 21 had NSCLC and 23 patients were from the phase I report. The authors f ound that at 25 Gy, pulmonary toxicity was noted in patients with a history of prior pulmonary irradiation and in those with treatment volumes greater than 50 cc; therefore, dose escalation to 30 Gy was a pplied only to unirradiated patients and treatment volume less than 50 cc. Treatment-related complications were noted for doses greater than 25 Gy and included four cases of grade 2-3 pneumonitis, 1 pleural effusion, and 3 possible treatment-related deaths. The 1-year freedom from local progression was 91% for doses greater than 20 Gy and 54% for doses less than 20 Gy in NSCLC (p = 0.03). Hara, et al. (2006) reported outcomes for 59 pat ients with malignant lung tumors < 4cm in maximal dimension (11 primary lung tumors, 48 me tastases) who were treated for primary or metastatic disease to the lung using doses ranging from 26 to 34 Gy in a single fraction. Median follow up was 12 months (range 2-42 m onths). The authors noted 1- and 2-year local progression-free rates of 93% and 78%. Improv ed local control was seen for patients receiving > 30 Gy versus 26-30 Gy (9 patie nts.) Local regrowth of the irr adiated tumor was a direct cause of death in two patients. Only the minimal radiat ion dose to the reference target volume tended to have an influence on the local progression failure rate (LPFR) [P = 0.068]. Grade 3 respiratory symptoms were noted in 1 patient. Over all survival for the whole cohort at 2 years was 41%. Since the results of Hara, et al. (2006) with a maximal dose of 34 Gy in one fraction stand as the most currently reported schedule demonstra ting feasibility, safety, and efficacy, this fractionation scheme becomes worthy of fu rther testing in a cooperative setting. RTOG 0915 51.2.3 Radiobiological Considerations in SBRT Schedules Conventionally fractionated RT involves daily deliv ery of small doses of radiation (e.g., 1.8 Gy-3 Gy per fraction) over many weeks and reflects radiobiological concepts favoring normal tissue protection; that is, dividing a total planned dose into a number of fractions permits normal tissues to repair sublethal damage from ionizing radiation more effectively than tumor tissues (Park 2008). In contrast, SBRT implies delivery of large ablative doses of radiation (e.g., 12-30 Gy in single fractions) and was derived from r adiosurgery experience with similar schedules used for intracranial tumors (Park 2008). Ablati ve therapy usually is valid for small lesions for which normal tissue constraints are not a determini ng limitation. Given the differences in total dose, fractionation, and overall treatment time between conventionally fractionated treatments and SBRT, direct comparisons between schedules is not feasible (Song 2004). The linear quadratic (LQ) equation has been the generally accepted method for comparing different RT fractionation schemes. Use of this equation yiel ds a biologically effective dose (BED) for a given schedule against which the potency another can be compared. Thus, where dose, d, represents individual fraction size in Gy, n the number of individual doses of radiation, and and are intrinsic properties of the tumor cells (Kavanagh 2006). For comparison purposes, an / ratio of 10 is assumed fo r tumor killing effects and was used for calculations by Kavanagh and Timmerman in the following table comparing BEDs for different radiation schedules (adapted from Kavanagh 2006). Parameter BED, Gy Conventional radiation dose schedule 60 Gy, 30 fractions 72 70 Gy, 35 fractions 84 SBRT dose schedule 48 Gy, 3 fractions 125 60 Gy, 5 fractions 132 60 Gy, 3 fractions 180 There have been reports that relate the clinical e fficacy of SBRT over different fractionations to a BED cutoff. Thus, Onishi, et al. (2007) reported that improved local c ontrol and survival are associated with SBRT regimens whose BED is >100 Gy. Park, et al. (2008), however, have questioned t he validity of the LQ model for describing the radiation effects of SBRT. They note that t he biological model underpinning the LQ model deviates from measured data for high-dose-per-fr action regimens (>8 Gy per fraction). In its stead, they have developed an alternative met hod to analyze SBRT effects using a universal survival curve (USC) derived from the LQ model and another radiobiological model, the multitarget method. This has yielded two equivale nce functions, the BED and the single fraction equivalent dose (SFED) allowing for more appropriate comparison of conventional and stereotactic radiation schedules. The following t able adapted from that paper is illustrative of this.

It also may allow for predictions on differences between different schedules with res pect to toxicity and tumor control. From this model and using single and multiple fraction data that have been published, one could predict, for example, that 34 Gy in 1 fraction may be a less toxic but a less ablative schedule than the RTOG 0236 reference regimen (Timmerman, 2009). As Park and colleagues (2008) note, the only way to appropriately assess different fracti onation schemes is through prospective clinical trials. 1.2.4 Rationale for Current Study Design (8/19/10) Results from the range of clinical studies in SBRT suggest that both single fraction and multiple fraction SBRT regimens are feasible and yield ex cellent primary tumor control, with minimal toxicity for the follow-up intervals reported. That said, most clinicians in the U.S. have employed SBRT regimens involving multiple (3-10) fractions. Given apparent equivalency in primary tumor control rates between single and multiple fractionated regimens over reported follow-up intervals, we propose that primary tumor control becomes a secondary measure of distinguishing efficacy between different SBR T regimens for a population of patients whose outcomes would then become predomin antly affected by competing co-morbidities. Thus, in the present study, a comparison of 1 fraction versus multiple fractions is proposed within the setting of a clinical trial for medically inoperable pati ents to determine an optimized dose schedule for SBRT of the lung yielding the least chance of gr ade 3 or higher toxicity for equivalent cancer related control. Chang, et al. (2008) noted no grade 3 or higher toxicities at < 3 months, and Timmerman, et al (2006, 2009) noted that the medi an time to toxicity is > 6 months, Given that high-grade toxicities may not be recorded for many months, the individual arms will be assessed at 1 year after treatment de livery to compare toxicity rates. RTOG 0915 7 Additional benefits from a prospective clinical trial will include correlating clinical outcomes against standardized and uniform delivery of SBRT. It should be noted that the SBRT prescription practice reported in Japanese studies involves dose prescribed to an isocenter. In comparison, in U.S. studies, dose is typically prescribed as a PTV coverage. In the current study, therefore, we are electing to adopt U.S. practice such that pres criptions will be to PTV coverage and also will employ heterogeneity correction. The present study will further characterize the relationship, if any, between tumor size, outcomes, and dose. Nagata, et al. (2005) showed no relationship between T1 versus T2 and toxicity, primary tumor control, and survival. McCammon, et al. (2009) found no statistically significant relationship between GTV size and primary tumor control on multivariate analysis. The prospective nature of the tr ial and the uniformity in treat ment administration also will facilitate assessment of toxicity, outcomes, cost, patient comfort, and radiobiologic and dosimetric comparisons. This study also will provide a m eans for further prospe ctive assessment of the role of FDG-PET imaging in the setting of SBRT for medically inoperable lung cancer. Hoopes, et al. (2007) investigated the utility of PET for 58 patients with medically inoperable stage I NSCLC who participated in prospective phase I and II trials of SBRT. They found that 1) pre-SBRT FDG- PET SUV did not predict 3-year overall survival or primary tumor control but more critically, 2) that moderate post-SBRT PET hypermetabolic acti vity may persist 2 years following treatment without definite evidence of recurrence. This latter observation has provided clinicians with a means of interpreting post-treatment imaging for the presence or absence of primary tumor failure when biopsying has proved to be not feas ible. A further update on Hoopes, et al. (2007) suggests that since a substantial proportion of patients may have moderately elevated FDG- PET SUV(max) at 12 months without evidence of primary tumor failure on further follow up, likely those post-SBRT PET SUVs equal or abov e the pretreatment values should be further investigated (Henderson, et al. 2009). In a retros pective review of 74 patients, Burdick, et al. (2008) found that pre-treatment PET SUVs did not predict for primary tumor control, nodal failure, distant metastatic failure, or overall survival. The current study design is, ther efore, a randomized phase II comparison of 34 Gy in a single fraction selected as the most currently docum ented feasible single-fraction dose, versus a schedule based on the best reported and most ac tively utilized multi-fraction experience in Japan and the U.S., 48 Gy in 4 fractions. The goals for this randomized phase II study are to select the most favorable regimen on the basis of the least severe toxicity recorded at a defined interval of 1 year, with primary tumor contro l acting as a secondary endpoint and for that regimen then to be us ed as a comparison arm in a phase III trial against the current RTOG standard set by RTOG 0236. If both arms should prove equivalent with respect to adverse events, control, and survival, t he presumption would be that the shortest schedule would be the most feasible for patients. 1.3 Translational Research 1.3.1 Proposed Primary Translational Study (8/19/10) Probably one of the most important dose modificati on factors for radiation therapy is hypoxia, the condition of low oxygen level in the tumo r (Hockel 2001; Brown 1998). Mechanistically, the presence of oxygen greatly enhances the effici ency of chromosomal radiation damage by chemically stabilizing radiation-in duced free radical production in DNA. Thus, the radiation dose required to kill a given proportion of hypoxic ce lls is 2.5-3 times greater than that for an aerobic cell population, especially when radiation is de livered in a large single fraction as proposed for one of the arms in the current study (Hockel 2 001). Fractionation can result in re-oxygenation; hence, mitigating the adverse effect of hypoxia on radiation sensitivit y (Brown 1998). Hypoxia also has been shown to promote aggressive tumor phenotype, including a predisposition to metastasis via activation of several molecular pathways, the best known of which is the pathway regulated by the hypoxia inducible factor 1(HIF-1) [Yun 2003]. Several proteins and microRNA have been shown to be induced by hypoxia, and their levels can be readily measured in the blood. High levels of these markers also have been shown to correlate with poorer prognosis in patients with solid tumors treated with conventional therapy. These include osteopontin, VEGF (vascular part of the correlative studies in this study, we propose to measure the levels of these putative circulating markers for hypoxia prior to SBRT and 6 weeks after SBRT. Our primary hypothesis is that the level of these markers should have a greater decline afte r treatment with fractionated SBRT than with single fraction SBRT and that their pretreatment levels also should be more prognostic for primary tumor control in the single arm as compared to the fractionated arm. Primary Aim: 1. To determine whether radiation fractiona tion would influence the change in the pre- and post-SBRT circulating levels of several secreted hypoxia markers, including osteopontin, VEGF, IL8, LDH5, and MiR210. We will measure pre- and post-SBRT (6 weeks after completion of all RT) levels of osteopontin, VEGF, IL8, LDH5, and MiR210 and correlate the change in these levels to the 2 treatment arms. 2. To determine whether pretreatment levels of these circulating hypoxia markers are more predictive of primary tumor failure in the single-fraction arm as compared to the fractionated arm. We will correl ate pretreatment levels of the above circul ating hypoxia markers to the rate of primary tumor control for each treatment arm. 1.3.2 Exploratory Translational Studies (8/19/10) Gene polymorphism in peripheral lymphocytes of core DNA repair proteins and the levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines before and after SBRT may reflect the individual's intrinsic radiation sensitivity and tumor response. We hy pothesize that baseline DNA polymorphism of DNA repair genes and levels of the circulating cytokines before and after SBRT may be used as biomarkers to predict clinical outcome, in cluding local regional recurrence, survival, and treatment-related toxicity, specifically pulmonary toxicity. In the future, these markers may help to classify patients for their probability to benefit from the therapeutic regimens, particularly dose escalated radiotherapy. The current plan is to subject the pretreatment samples to DNA polymorphism analysis using restriction fragment length polymorphism-pol ymerase chain reaction. Pre- and post-SBRT circulating cytokine also will be measured usi microarray analysis (RayBio human cytokine array; RayBiotech) that measures levels of 174 cytokines and growth factors implicated in human diseases. Although the assa ys yield relative quantification, it is adequate for the initial exploratory analysis because tw o groups of patients and samples from the same individuals before and after treatment will be comp ared. It is quite possible that any or all of these assays could be outdated by the time accrua l to the study is complete and the data are analyzable with respect to clinical outcome. Therefor e, if other methods are 'state of the art' at that time, these methods will be substituted. The following is the list of potentia l biomarkers that will be studie d for this exploratory analysis. It can, however, be subject to change based on information that is unknown at this time. 1. DNA repairing gene polymorphism such as p53, XRCC1, analyses for these genes and correlate them to both the rate of grade 2 or higher radiation pneumonitis and primary tumor control. 2. Radiation-induced symptom related cytokines such as TGF-Beta, IL-1 and IL-6; we will measure pre- and post-treatment of these cytokines and correlate them to the radiation of grade 2 or higher radiation pneumonitis. 2.0 OBJECTIVES 2.1 Primary Objective The rate of 1-year grade 3 or higher adverse events definitely, probably, or possibly related to treatment (see Section 13.1 fo r specific adverse events) 2.2 Secondary Objectives (8/19/10) 2.2.1 1-year primary tumor control disease-free survival rate; 2.2.3 Assessment of FDG PET SUV changes as a measure of treatment response and outcomes; 2.2.4 Pulmonary function changes by treatment arm and response; RTOG 0915 92.2.5 Association between biomarkers and primary tumo r control and/or grade 2 or higher radiation pneumonitis. 3.0 PATIENT SELECTION NOTE: PER NCI GUIDELINES, EXCEPTIONS TO ELIGIBILITY ARE NOT PERMITTED 3.1 Conditions for Patient Eligibility (8/19/10) 3.1.1 Histological confirmation (by biop sy or cell lung cancer (NSCLC) prior to treatment; the following primary cancer types are eligible: squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma, large ce ll neuroendocrine, or non-small cell carcinoma not otherwise specified; Note : although bronchioloalveolar cell carcinoma is a subtype of NSCLC, patients with the pure type of this ma lignancy are excluded from this study because the spread of this cancer between adjacent airways is difficult to target on CT. 3.1.2 Stage M0, (AJCC Staging, 6th Ed.), based upon the following minimum diagnostic workup: 3.1.3.1 History/physical examination, including wei ght and assessment of Zubrod performance status, within 4 weeks prior to registration; 3.1.3.2 Evaluation by an experienced thoracic cancer clinician (a thoracic surgeon, medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, or pulmonologis t) within 8 weeks prior to registration; 3.1.3.3 CT scan with intravenous contrast (unless medica lly contraindicated) within 8 weeks prior to registration of the entirety of both lungs and the mediastinum, liver, and adrenal glands; the primary tumor dimension will be measured on the CT. PET evaluation of the liver and adrenal glands also is permitted. In addition, if the enrolling institution has a combined PET/CT scanner and both aspects are of diagnostic quality and read by a trained radiologist, the PET/CT will meet the staging requirements for both CT and PET. 3.1.3.4 Whole body or wide field FDG-PET within 8 weeks prior to registration with adequate visualization of the primary tumor and draining lymph node basins in the hilar and mediastinal regions and adrenal glands; in the event of lung consolidation, atelectasis, inflammation or other confounding features, PET -based imaging correlated with CT imaging will establish the maximal tumor dimensions. Note : PET data will be used for the analysis of a secondary endpoint (see Section 2.2.2). SUV must be measured on PET. To be included in this analysis, the patient's PET studies mu st be performed with a dedicated BGO, LSO, or GSO PET or PET/CT scanner. PET scanners with sodium iodide (Nal) detectors are not acceptable. If the baseline PET study is performed at the treating instit ution (or its affiliated PET facility), it is recommended that the reas sessment PET scans (see Section 11.1.4) be performed at the same site. 3.1.3.5 Pulmonary function tests (PFTs): Routine spir ometry, lung volumes, and diffusion capacity, within 8 weeks prior to registration; arterial blood gases are optional. Note : All patients enrolled in this study must hav e these pulmonary assessments wh ether or not the reason for their medical inoperability is pulmonary based, since the objective assessment of pulmonary factors is a component of the out comes assessment for this study. 3.1.4 Patients with hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes 1cm and no abnormal hilar or mediastinal uptake on PET will be considered N0. Patients with > 1 cm hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes on CT or abnormal PET (including suspicious but non-diagnostic uptake) ma y still be eligible if directed tissue biopsy of all abnormally i dentified areas are negative for cancer. 3.1.5 The patient's resectable NSCLC must be cons idered medically inoperable by an experienced thoracic cancer clinician (a thoracic surgeon, medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, or pulmonologist) or a standard lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node dissection/sampling procedure. The patient may have underlying physiol ogical medical problems that would prohibit a surgery due to a low probability of tolerating general anesthesia, the operation, the postoperative recovery period, or the removal of adjacent functioning lung. These types of patients with severe underlying health problem s are deemed \"medically inoperable.\" Standard justification for deeming a patient medically inoperable based on pulmonary function for surgical resection of NSCLC may include any of the hypoxemia and/or hypercapnia; Exercise oxygen consumption < 50% predicted; Severe pulmonary hypertension; RTOG 0915 10 Diabetes mellitus with severe end organ damage; Severe cerebral, cardiac, or peripheral vascular disease; Severe chronic heart disease. If the patient has resectable disease but declines surgery after consulting with a thoracic surgeon, he/she will be considered eligible. 3.1.6 The patient must have measurable disease. 3.1.7 Zubrod Performance Status 0-2; 3.1.8 Age 18; 3.1.9 Negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to registration for women of childbearing potential; 3.1.10 Women of childbearing potential and male participan ts must agree to use a medically effective means of birth control, such as condom/diaph ragm and spermicidal foam, intrauterine device (IUD), or prescription birth cont rol pills, throughout their participation in the treatment phase of the study 3.1.11 The patient must provide study specific informed consent prior to study entry. 3.2 Conditions for Patient Ineligibility 3.2.1 Patients with T2 primary tumors > 5 cm or involv ing the central plural and/or structures of the mediastinum; 3.2.2 The primary tumor of any T-stage within or touching the zone of the proximal bronchial tree (see figure below), defined as a volume 2 cm in all directions around the proximal bronchial tree (carina, right and left main bronchi, right lower lobe Direct evidence of regional or distant meta stases after appropriate staging studies, or synchronous primary malignancy or prior malignancy in the past 2 years except for invasive malignancy that has been treated definitively and the patient remains disease free for > 3 years with life expectancy of > 3 years or carcinoma in situ or early stage skin cancers that have been treated definitively; 3.2.4 Previous radiotherapy to the lung or mediastinum; 3.2.5 Previous chemotherapy for this lung or medias tinum tumor; chemotherapy for another invasive malignancy is permitted if it has been treated definitively and the patient has remained disease free for > 3 years. 3.2.6 Previous surgery for this lung or mediastinum tumor; 3.2.7 Plans for the patient to receive other antineoplastic therapy (including standard fractionated radiotherapy, chemotherapy, biol ogical therapy, vaccine therapy, and surgery) while on this protocol except at disease progression; 3.2.8 Patients with active systemic, pulmonary, or pericardial infection; 3.2.9 Pregnant or lactating women, as treatment involves unforeseeable risks to the embryo or fetus. RTOG 0915 114.0 PRETREATMENT EVALUATIONS/MANAGEMENT within 2 weeks prio r to registration on study, with adequate bone marrow function defined as follows: 4.1.1.1 Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 1,800 4.1.1.3 Hemoglobin 8.0 g/dl (Note: The use of transfusi on or other intervention to achieve Hgb 8.0 g/dl is acceptable.); 4.1.2 Documentation of measurable disease (tumor size in cm) on the I1 case report form (see Section 12.1). 5.0 REGISTRATION PROCEDURES 5.1 Regulatory Pre-Registration Requirements (8/19/10) 5.1.1 U.S. and Canadian institutions must fax copies of the documentation below to the CTSU Regulatory Office (215-569-0206), along with the completed CTSU-IRB/REB Certification Form, http://www.rtog.org/pdf_file2.html?pdf _document=CTSU-IRBCertifForm.pdf , prior to IRB/REB approval letter; (English language versions*) *Note : Institutions must provide certific ation of RTOG 5.1.2 Pre-Registration Requirements FOR NON-CANADIAN INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS 5.1.2.1 For institutions that do not have an approved LOI for this protocol: International sites must receive written approval of submitted LOI forms from RTOG Headquarters prior to submitting documents to their local ethics committee for approval. See http://www.rtog.org/pdf_forms.html?members/forms=Intl_LOI_Form.doc 5.1.2.2 For institutions that have an approved LOI for this protocol: All requirements indicated in your LOI Approval Notification must be fulfilled prior to enrolling patients to this study. 5.2 Pre-Registration Requirements for SBRT Treatment Approach All participating institutions must use the supe rposition/convolution or Monte Carlo based dose calculation algorithms. Credentialing for stereot actic body radiation therapy and heterogeneity corrections by the Advanced Technology Consortium (ATC) is necessary prior to enrolling patients on this study. Institutions wishing to submit IMRT plans must also be credentialed for intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) by the Advanced Technology Consortium (ATC) prior to enrolling patients on this study. Instructions for completing these requirements or determining if they already have been met are available on the Radiological Physics Center (RPC) web site. Visit http://rpc.mdanderson.org/rpc and select \"Credentialing\" and \"Credentialing Status Inquiry\". As it pertains to this study, the ATC incl udes the Image-Guided Therapy Center (ITC) at Washington University, St. Louis; the Radiological Physics Center (RPC) at MD Anderson Cancer Center; and the RTOG Quality Assurance Center. Credentialing includes the 5 steps outlined in Sect ions 5.2.2.1 to 5.2.2. 5. Centers previously credentialed for some of the technologies/procedures involved may not have to be re-credentialed. However, institutions (not using superposition/convolution algorithms) previously credentialed to use Clarkson or pencil beam algorithms for SBRT on RTOG 0236 by the ATC will be required to be re-credentialed for heterogeneity co rrections. In addition, institutions that have changed the technology/procedures previously credentialed (i.e., fundamentally change methods like changing from tracking to abdominal compression for motion control) must be re-credentialed with their new systems. Instit utions that have changed from standard IMRT to Tomotherapy, CyberKnife\u00ae or volume arc IMRT re-credential. 5.2.2 SBRT Credentialing Process 5.2.2.1 Facility Questionnaire: Each participating institution must complete a Facility Questionnaire available on the ATC web site, http://atc.wustl.edu . Information in a previous Facility Questionnaire can be extended to meet this requirement by simply adding data that is RTOG 0915 12specific to this SBRT protoc ol. Each institution must submit the completed Facility Questionnaire by e-mail, fax, or mail to RTOG Headquarters. All questions in the Facility Questionnaire pertaini ng to IMRT (if this treatment modality is to be used), heterogeneity corrections, respiratory movement control, and IGRT must be answered. 5.2.2.2 IGRT Verification Study: Each institution must perform a verification study demonstrating their ability to reproducibly register daily IG RT information with a planning CT dataset (i.e., the gross tumor volume falls within the CT simulation defined PTV). The patient used for this verification procedure must have a target in the lung that is similar to the lesions that will be treated for patients entered on this study. The information submitted must include 3 IGRT datasets (from 3 different fractions) for a si ngle anonymized patient and must employ the method that will be used for respiratory control for patients entered from a particular institution. This information with a spreads heet (the spreadsheet is available on the ATC web site, http://itc.wustl.edu ) will be reviewed by the Medical Physics Co-Chair, William Parker, MSc. Upon approval of the images and spreadsheet by Mr. Parker, RTOG Headquarters will notify t he institution that it is credentialed. Similar information must be sent for the first patient treated on this protocol before a second patient is treated. This process also must be followed for the second patient entered on the protocol. If either of these patients is treated with a single fraction, the IGRT information before and after repositioning must be sent. 5.2.2.3 (3/4/10) Electronic Submission: Each participating institution must contact the ITC (itc@.wustl.edu ) and request an SFTP account for digital data submission. (The ITC is now using Secure FTP [SFTP]) and this should now be the term used in all cases of electronic submission to the ITC.) 5.2.2.4 Phantom Irradiation: Each participating institution must irradiate a standardized phantom provided by the Radiological Physics Cent er (RPC) at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Instructions for requesting and irradiating the phantom are av ailable at the RPC web site, http://rpc.mdanderson.org/rpc/ by selecting \"Credentialing\" and \"RTOG.\" The phantom simulates a lung tumor within lung tissue equivalent material. The treatment plan for irradiation of the phantom must be submitted elec tronically to the ITC (see Section 5.2.2.3). This trial allows IMRT techniques (including CyberKnife\u00ae and Tomotherapy), and the phantom irradiation requirements vary accordin g to the combination of delivery technique and respiratory control methodology. In general, institutions using conformal techniques and abdominal compression for respiratory motion control together with the recommended margins (see Section 6.4.1) will irradiat e the stationary version of the phantom. The exception is for institutions intending to use ei ther tracking or gating techniques when lesions do not remain within the stated margins. These institutions will be required to irradiate the moving phantom for credentialing. Additiona lly, institutions using CyberKnife\u00ae or Tomotherapy delivery will be required to irradiate the moving phantom for all methods of respiratory control. 5.2.2.5 Dry Run Submission and Rapid Review Process: Each participating institution must successfully complete and submit a protocol-s pecific Dry-Run Test to demonstrate its ability to digitally transfer data to the ITC. If the institution has credentialed previously for another SBRT protocol and its treatment planning has not changed, this step can be skipped. However, independent of any previous credentia ling, the treatment plan for the first patient on each arm to be treated at the institution on this protocol must be submitted to the ITC for review PRIOR TO DELIVERING ANY PROTOCOL TREATMENT. The plan will be reviewed centrally by the PIs, and suggestions regarding protocol compliance will be forwarded to the participating institution. The tr eatment plan for subsequent patients enrolled at a site will not be required to be centrally reviewed prior to treatment, but will be reviewed for protocol compliance at a later date. 5.3 Registration 5.3.1 Online Registration Patients can be registered only after eligibility criteria are met. Each individual user must have an RTOG user name and password to register patients on the RTOG web site. To get a user name and password: RTOG 0915 13\u0083 The investigator and research staff must have completed Human Subjects Training and been issued a certific ate (Training is available via http://phrp.nihtraining.com/users/login.php ). \u0083 A representative from the institution must complete the Password Authorization Form at www.rtog.org/members/webreg.html (bottom right corner of the screen), and fax it to 215-923-1737. RTOG Headquar ters requires 3-4 days to process requests and issue user names/p asswords to institutions. An institution can register the patie nt by logging onto the RTOG web site ( http://www.rtog.org ), going to \"Data Center Login\" and selecting the lin k for new patient registrations. The system triggers a program to verify that all regulat ory requirements (OHRP assurance, IRB approval) have been met by the institution. The registration screens begin by asking for the date on which the eligibility checklist was completed, the i dentification of the person who completed the checklist, whether the patient was found to be eligible on the basis of the checklist, and the date the study-specific informed consent form was signed. Once the system has verified that the patient is eligible and that the institution has met regulatory requirements, it assigns a patient-spe cific case number. The system then moves to a screen that confirms that t he patient has been successfully enrolled. This screen can be printed so that the registering site will have a c opy of the registration fo r the patient's record. Two e-mails are generated and sent to the regist ering site: the Confirmation of Eligibility and the patient-specific calendar. The system creates a case file in the study's database at the DMC (Data Management Center) and generates a data submission calendar listing all data forms, images, and reports and the dates on which they are due. If the patient is ineligible or the instituti on has not met regulatory requirements, the system switches to a screen that includes a brief explanat ion for the failure to register the patient. This screen can be printed. Institutions can contact RTOG web supp ort for assistance with web registration: websupport@acr-arrs.org . In the event that the RTOG w eb registration site is not accessible, participating sites can register a patient by calling RTOG Headquarters, at (215) 574-3191, Monday through Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. ET. The registrar will as k for the site's user name and password. This information is required to assure that mechani sms usually triggered by web registration (e.g., drug shipment, confirmation of registrati on, and patient-specific calendar) will occur. 6.0 RADIATION THERAPY NOTE : 3-D conformal and intensity modulated radiati on therapy (IMRT) are allowed with proper credentialing (see Section 5.0) Protocol treatment must begin within 4 weeks after registration/randomization. 6.1 Dose Specifications 6.1.1 Stereotactic Targeting and Treatment SBRT has now been formally defined and describe d in a published guideline from the American College of Radiology and American Society for Th erapeutic Radiology and Oncology (Potters 2004). This protocol will respect that guideline. Th e term stereotactic, for the purposes of this protocol, implies the targeting, planning, and di recting of therapy using beams of radiation along any trajectory in 3-D space toward a tar get of known 3-D coordi nates. The coordinate system is defined by reliable \"fiduc ial\" markers. This differs from conventional radiation therapy, in which therapy is directed toward less-than-re liable skin marks or bony landmarks that are indirectly referenced to the tumor (surrogates). This protocol will require treatments to be conducted with the use of a fixed 3-D coordina te system defined by fiducials. The coordinate system defined by the fiducials should be directly related to the radiation-producing device in a reproducible and secure fashion. Capability should exist to define the position of targets within the patient according to this same 3-D coordinat e system. As such, the patient is set up for RTOG 0915 14each treatment with the intention of directing th e radiation toward a target according to the known 3-D coordinates as determined in the proc ess of treatment planning. The nature of the fiducials themselves may include radiopaque markers or rods placed at known locations in a frame or fixed structure adjacent to the patient as well as use of the tumor itself as a fiducial (e.g., acquiring tomographic views of the tumor simultaneously with the treatment). Metallic \"seeds\" placed within the tumor will be allowed to constitute a fiducial so long as the methods are validated and a plan is in place to identif y seed migration (e.g., redundant seeds placed). 6.1.2 Dose Fractionation Arm 1 patients will receive 34 Gy in 1 fraction to the prescription line at the edge of the PTV (see Section 6.4.2.1 for more prescription details). Arm 2 patients will receive 4 fractions, 12 Gy pe r fraction, to a total dose of 48 Gy to the prescription line at the edge of the PTV. Treat ments should be given on 4 consecutive days. The time between fractions is at the discretion of the investigator, but a minimum of 18 hours is required. 6.1.3 Premedications Although not mandatory, it is recommended that pat ients receive corticosteroid premedication (e.g., Dexamethasone, 4 mg, p.o. in a single dose, or equivalent) 15-60 minutes before each SBRT treatment for the intended purpose of modulating immediate pulmonary inflammatory effects. Analgesic premedication to avoid gene ral discomfort during long treatment durations also is recommended when appropriate. 6.2 Technical Factors 6.2.1 Physical Factors Only photon (x-ray) beams prod uced by linear accelerators, betatrons, or microtron accelerators with photon energies of 4-10 MV w ill be allowed. Cobalt-60 and charged particle beams (including electrons, protons, and heavier ions) are not allowed. Photon beam energies > 10 MV but not > 15 MV will be a llowed only for a limited number ( 2) beams that must travel more than a cumulative distance of 10 cm throug h soft tissue (not lung) to reach the target . 6.2.2 Minimum Field Aperture (Field Size) Dimension Because of uncertainties in beam commissioning resulting from el ectronic disequilibrium within small beam apertures, a minimum field dimension of 3.5 cm is required for any field used for treatment delivery for sites using standard 3- D conformal techniques where nearly all of the PTV is encompassed for each beam. It is underst ood that this may exceed the technical requirements listed in Section 6.4 for small lesions (< 2.5 cm axial GTV dimension or < 1.5 cm craniocaudal GTV dimension). In such cases, the prescription do se is still prescribed to the edge of the defined PTV. This minimum field dimension does not apply to centers using IMRT with a standard multileaf collimator or Tomo therapy or for the Cybe rKnife\u00ae unit where by design the entire PTV is not encompassed for each beam. 6.2.3 Dose Verification at Treatment In-vivo dosimeter measurements (e.g., diode, TLD) may be obtained for surface dose verification for accessible beams as per institutio nal preference. This information is not required by the protocol. 6.2.4 Treatment Platforms The trial allows most commercially availabl e photon producing treatment units except the exclusion of units described in Section 6.2.1 (e.g., cobalt units and charge particle accelerators). As such, conventional linear acce lerators, specialized linear accelerators with image guidance (e.g., Novalis, Trilogy, Synergy, Arti ste) are allowed. These units can be used with conformal dose delivery or IMRT. Other sp ecialized accelerators (e.g., the CyberKnife\u00ae or Tomotherapy) are allowed as long as they me et the technical specific ations of the protocol and are used in a fashion that passes the accr editation tests required by the protocol. 6.3 Localization, Simulation, and Immobilization 6.3.1 Patient Positioning Patients will be positioned in a stable position. For Arm 2 patients, this position should be capable of allowing accurate r eproducibility of the ta rget position from treatment to treatment. Positions uncomfortable for the patient shou ld be avoided so as to prevent uncontrolled movement during treatments. A variety of i mmobilization systems may be used, including stereotactic frames that surround the pati ent on three sides and large rigid pillows (conforming to patients' external contours) with reference to the stereotactic coordinate system (see Section 6.1). All positioning systems must be vali dated and accredited by the Study Committee RTOG 0915 15(Principal Investigator and Co-Investigators) bef ore enrolling or treating patients on this trial. Patient immobilization must be reliable enough to insure that in combination with the techniques used to inhibit target motion (described in Section 6.2.3), the gross tumor volume (GTV) does not deviate beyond the confines of the planning treatment volume (PTV) as defined in Section 6.4 with any significant probability. 6.3.2 Inhibition of Effects of Internal Organ Motion Special considerations must be made to account for the effect of internal organ motion (e.g., breathing) on target positioning and reproduc ibility. Acceptable maneuvers include reliable abdominal compression, accelerator beam gating wi th the respiratory cycle, tumor tracking, and active breath-holding techniques. All systems used to account for internal organ motion must be validated and accredited by the Study Commi ttee (Principal Investigator and Co- Investigators) before enrolling or treating patient s on this trial. Internal organ inhibition maneuvers must be reliable enough to insure that the GTV does not deviate beyond the confines of the PTV as defined in Section 6.4 with any significant probability (i.e., < 5%). 6.3.3 Localization Isocenter or reference point port localization images should be obtained on the treatment unit immediately before treatment to ensure proper alignment of the geometric center (i.e., isocenter) of the simulated fields. These IGRT images can be obtained with planar kV imaging devices, EPID imaging. In all cases, the RTOG Image Guidance Guidelines must be followed. For treatment systems that use kV imaging bu t also allow EPID imaging using the treatment beam, orthogonal images verifying the isocenter also should be obtained. For institutions using equipment that does not allow this double-chec k capability, agreement between the treatment unit isocenter or reference point in space must be carefully checked for agreement with the imaging isocenter. For Arm 2 of this study, after treatment verification CT scans or verification planar images may be taken at the discretion of the participatin g institution but are not required for protocol participation. For Arm 1, where a single fraction is used, after treatment verification imaging must be used. The localization images will be su bmitted for quality assu rance (QA) purposes to the ITC. When possible, these images must be sent using the DICOM format. When this is not possible, jPeg images must be sent. 6.4 Treatment Planning/Target Volumes 6.4.1 Image Acquisition (3/4/10) Computed tomography will be the primary image pl atform for targeting and treatment planning. The planning CT scans must allow simultaneo us view of the patient anatomy and fiducial system for stereotactic targeting. Intravenous (i.v .) contrast during the planning CT is optional provided a diagnostic chest CT was done with contrast to delineate the major blood vessels within 8 weeks of registration on the trial. If not, i.v. contrast should be given during the planning CT; i.v. contrast at simulation may be omi tted even in this case if contraindicated (e.g. allergy or renal insufficiency. Contrast will allow better distinction between tumor and adjacent vessels or atelectasis. Axial acquisitions with gantry 0 degrees will be required with spacing 3.0 mm between scans. Images will be transferre d to the treatment planning computers via direct lines, disc, or tape. The target lesion will be outlined by an appr opriately trained physician and designated the gross tumor volume (GTV). The target will generally be drawn using CT pulmonary windows; however, soft tissue windows with contrast may be used to avoid inclusion of adjacent vessels, atelectasis, or mediastinal or chest wall stru 4-dimensional CT image guided GTV delineation to take tumor motion into consideration will be allowed. This target will not be enlarged whatsoever for prophylactic treatment (including no \"margin\" for presumed microscopic extension); rather, include only abnormal CT signal consistent with gross tumor (i.e., the GTV and the clinical target volume [CTV] are identical) . There are 2 acceptable methods to define t he PTV depending on the method of CT simulation: a. Conventional CT-simulation (non-4D CT): The PTV will include the GTV plus an additional 0.5 cm margin in the axial plane a nd 1.0 cm margin in the longitudinal plane (craniocaudal). RTOG 0915 16 b. 4D CT-simulation: An internal target vo lume (ITV) around the GTV, accounting for tumor motion may be defined from the 4D CT dataset. The PTV will include the ITV plus an additional 0.5 cm margin uniformly applied to the ITV. These margins will be used at all in stitutions, even if a particular institution uses equipment or techniques felt to be more accurate. 6.4.2 Dosimetry Three-dimensional coplanar or non-coplanar beam arrangements will be custom desi gned for each case to deliver highly conformal pre scription dose distributions. Non-opposing, non- coplanar beams are preferable. Typically, 10 beams of radiation will be used with roughly equal weighting. Generally, more beams are used fo r larger lesion sizes. When static beams are used, a minimum of 7 non-opposing beams should be used. For arc rotation techniques, a minimum of 340 degrees (cumulative for all beams) should be utilized. For arc rotation techniques, a minimum of 340 degrees (cumulative fo r all beams) should be utilized. In order to obtain acceptable coverage, field aperture size and shape should correspond nearly identically to the projection of the PTV along a beam's eye view (i.e., no additional \"margin\" for dose buildup at the edges of the blocks or MLC ja ws beyond the PTV). The only exception should be when observing the minimum field dimension of 3.5 cm when treating small lesions (see above). As such, prescription lines covering the PTV will typically be the 60-90% line (where the maximum dose is 100%); however, higher isodoses (hotspots) must be manipulated to occur within the target and not in adjacent nor mal tissue. The treatment isocenter or setup point in stereotactic coordinat es will be determined from system fiducials (and can be adjusted pre-treatment depending on the results from loca lization imaging studies) and translated to the treatment record. For purposes of dose planning and calculation of monitor units for actual treatment, this protocol will require tissue density heterogeneity corrections. The particular algorithm used for such correction must be approved by the RTOG Physics Committee in advance. 6.4.2.1 Prescription Dose Constraints for Treatment Planning Successful treatment planning w ill require accomplishment of all of the following criteria: 1. Maximum dose : The treatment plan should be creat ed such that 100% corresponds to the maximum dose delivered to the patient. Th is point must exist within the PTV. 2. Prescription isodose : The prescription isodose surface must be 60% and < 90% of the maximum dose. 3. Prescription Isodose Surface Coverage: The prescription isodose surface will be chosen such that 95% of the target volu me (PTV) is conformally covered by the prescription isodose surface (PTV V 95%RX = 100%) and 99% of the target volume (PTV) receives a minimum of 90% of the prescription dose (PTV V 90%RX > 99%). 4. High Dose Spillage : The cumulative volume of all tissue outside the PTV receiving a dose > 105% of prescription dose should be no more than 15% of the PTV volume. Conformality of PTV coverage will be judged such that the ratio of the volume of the prescription isodose meeting criteria 1 through 4 to the volume of the PTV is ideally < 1.2 (see table below). These criteria will not be required to be met in treating very small tumors (< 2.5 cm axial GTV dimension or < 1.5 cm craniocaudal GTV dimension) in which the required minimum field size of 3.5 cm (see Section 6.2) resu lts in the inability to meet a conformality ratio of 1.2. The \"None\" and \"Minor\" entries in this table define the Per Protocol, Variation Acceptable and Deviati on Unacceptable Compliance Criteria (see Section 6.7). 5. Intermediate Dose Spillage The falloff gradient beyond the PTV extending in to normal tissue structures must be rapid in all directions and meet the following criteria: a. Location The maximum total dose over all fractions in Gray (Gy) to any point 2 cm or greater away from the PTV in any direction must be no greater than D 2CM where D 2CM is given by the table below. RTOG 0915 17b. Volume The ratio of the volume of the 34 or 12 Gy isodose volume to the volume of the PTV must be no greater than R 50% where R 50% is given by the table below. This table is used for all prescription require ments in Section 6.4.2 irrespective of calculation algorithm and total treatment dose. Table 1: Conformality of Prescribed Dose for Calculations Based on Deposition of Photon Beam Energy in Heterogeneous Tissue Ratio of Prescription Isodose Volume to the PTV Volume Ratio of 50% Prescription Isodose Volume to the PTV Volume, R 50% Maximum Dose (in % of dose prescribed) @ 2 cm from PTV in Any Direction, D 2cm (Gy) Percent of Lung Receiving 20 Gy Total or More, V20 (%) Deviation Deviation Deviation Deviation PTV Volume (cc) None Minor None Minor None Minor of PTV dimension or volume not specified, linear interpolation between table entries is required. Note 2: Protocol deviations gr eater than listed here as \"minor\" will be classified as \"major\" for protocol compliance (see Section 6.7). 6.5 Critical Structures 6.5.1 Critical Organ Dose-Volume Limits (3/4/10) The following table lists maximum dose limits to a point or volume within several critical organs. Except for the rib, these are absolute limits, and treatment delivery that ex ceeds these limits will constitute a protocol violation (See Section 6. 7). The dose is listed as total delivered. These limits were formulated with the approval of t he study committee (Princip al Investigators and Co- Chairs) using tolerance data, historical data as listed in section 1 with special weighting to the RTOG experience (in reference to the 34 Gy dose) and that of Chang, et al. from MD Anderson (in reference to the 12 Gy times 4 fractions arm). RTOG 0915 18 Arm 1: One Fraction (34 Gy) Serial Tissue Volume Volume Max (Gy) Max Point Dose (Gy) Endpoint ( Gy ulceration/fistula Parallel Tissue Volume (cc) Critical Volume Dose Max (Gy) Endpoint ( Grade 3) Lung (Right & Left) 1500 cc 7 Gy Basic Lung Function Lung (Right & Left) 1000 cc 7.4 Gy Pneumonitis Arm 2: Four Fractions (12 x 4 Gy) Serial Tissue Volume Volume Max (Gy) Max Point Dose (Gy) Endpoint (6.8 Gy/fx) ulceration/fistula Parallel Tissue Critical Volume (cc) Critical Volume Dose Max (Gy) Endpoint ( Grade 3) Lung (Right & Left) 1500 cc 11.6 Gy (2.9 Gy/fx) Basic Lung Function Lung (Right & Left) 1000 cc 12.4 Gy (3.1 Gy/fx) Pneumonitis *Avoid circumferential irradiation **Rib limit may be exceeded if rib structure lies within PTV; see Section 6.5.1.1 below. 6.5.1.1 The Rib/Chest Wall As Critical Structures As follow-up intervals following SBRT becom e longer with increased patient survival, delayed morbidity from therapy is becoming in creasingly recognized. In particular, recent reports have highlighted that the rib and ches t wall in proximity to the treated lesion may represent an organ at risk for complication. Factors associated with increasing chest wall toxicity are currently active areas of investi gation. It also is evident that tumor location, especially peripheral lesions as in this prot ocol, will enhance the potential for any such risk. Therefore, in this protocol, it is the intent of the investigators to pros pectively document dose RTOG 0915 19to ribs. The goal of any plan will be to optimize target treatment parame ters per this protocol, be mindful of rib dosing (as low as reasonably achievable [ALARA]), but in no way compromise target coverage or restrict potent ial delivery parameters for the sake of rib dosing. Rib \"limits' provided in the table above may in that respect be exceeded for an otherwise excellent plan. This w ill not be considered a violation. Participating centers are encour aged to observe prudent treatment planning principles in avoiding unnecessary radiation exposure to crit ical normal structures irrespective of these limits. In order to verify each of these limits, the orga ns must be contoured such that appropriate dose volume histograms can be generated. Instructio ns for the contouring of these organs are as follows in Section 6.5.2. 6.5.2 Contouring of Normal Tissue Structures All structures listed in Secti ons 6.5.2.1 through 6.5.2.9 should be contoured in every patient irrespective of the location of the PTV. T he structures listed in Sections 6.5.2.10 through 6.5.2.11 are only required if the named stru cture lies within 5 cm of the PTV. 6.5.2.1 Spinal Cord The spinal cord will be contoured based on the bon y limits of the spinal canal. The spinal cord should be contoured starting at least 10 cm above the superior extent of the PTV and continuing on every CT slice to at least 10 below the inferior extent of the PTV. 6.5.2.2 Esophagus The esophagus will be contoured using on CT to correspond to the mucosal, submucosa, and all muscular laye rs out to the fatty adventitia. The esophagus should be contoured starting at least 10 cm above the superior extent of the PTV and continuing on every CT slice to at least 10 below the inferior extent of the PTV. 6.5.2.3 Brachial Plexus The defined ipsilateral brachial plexus originates from the spinal nerves exiting the neuroforamina on the involved side from around C5 to T2. However, for the purposes of this protocol, only the major trunks of the brachial plexus will be contoured using the subclavian and axillary vessels as a surrogate for identifying the location of the brachial plexus. This neurovascular complex will be the bifurcation of the brachiocephalic trunk into the jugular/subclavian veins (or carotid/subclavian arteries) and following along the route of the subclavian vein to the axillary vein ending after the neurovascular structures cross the second rib. 6.5.2.4 Heart The heart will be contoured along with the pericardial sac. The superior aspect (or base) for purposes of contouring will begin at the level of the inferior aspect of the aortic arch (aorto- pulmonary window) and extend inferiorly to the apex of the heart. 6.5.2.5 Bronchial trachea and proximal bronchial tree will be contoured as two separate structures using mediastinal windows on CT to correspond to the mucosal, submucosa and cartilage rings and airway channels associated with these structures. For this purpose, the trachea will be divided into two sections: the proximal trachea a nd the distal trachea. The proximal trachea will be contoured as one structure, and the di stal 2 cm of trachea will be included in the structure identified as proxim al bronchial tree. Differentiating these structures in this fashion will facilitate the eligib ility requirement for excluding pati ents with tumors within 2 cm of the proximal bronchial tr ee (see Section of the proximal trachea should begi n at least 10 cm superior to the extent of the PTV or 5 cm superior to the carina (whic hever is more superior) and continue inferiorly to the superior aspect of the proximal bronc hial tree (see the diagram in Section 3.2.2 and the definitions below). 6.5.2.5.2 Proximal Bronchial Tree The proximal bronchial tree will include the mo st inferior 2 cm of distal trachea and the proximal airways on both sides as indicated in the diagram in Section 3.2.2. The following airways will be included according to standard an atomic relationships: the distal 2 cm of trachea, the carina, the right and left main stem bronchi, the right and left upper lobe bronchi, the Contouring of the lobar bronchi will end immediately at the site of a segmental bifurcation. 6.5.2.6 Whole Lung Both the right and left lungs should be contou red as one structure. Contouring should be carried out using pulmonary windows. All in flated and collapsed lung should be contoured; however, gross tumor (GTV) and trachea/ipsila teral bronchus as defined above should not be included in this structure. 6.5.2.7 PTV Plus 2 cm As part of the QA requirements for \"low dose spillage\" listed in Section 6.4, a maximum dose to any point 2 cm away in any direction is to be determi ned. To facilitate this QA requirement, an artificial structure 2 cm larger in all directions from the PTV is required. Most treatment planning systems have automatic co ntouring features that will generate this structure without prohibitive effort at the time of treatment planning. 6.5.2.8 Proximal Bronchial Tree Plus 2 cm As part of adhering to the ineligibility requireme nts for not enrolling patients with tumors in the zone of the proximal bronchial tree listed in 3.2.2 above, it is convenient to define an artificial structure 2 cm larger in all directio ns from the proximal bronchial tree. If the GTV falls within this artificial structure, the patient should not be treated with the protocol therapy. Most treatment planning systems have automatic contouring features that will generate this structure without prohibitive effort at the time of treatment planning. This structure is not required by the protocol, but its construction is suggested to facilitate appropriateness of patient selection. Alternately, participating site s may use ruler tools in the treatment planning software to ensure protocol compliance. 6.5.2.9 Skin The skin will be defined as the outer 0.5 cm of the body surface. As such it is a rind of uniform thickness (0.5 cm) which envelopes the entire body in the axial planes. The cranial and caudal surface of the superior and inferi or limits of the planning CT should not be contoured as skin unless skin is actually present in these locations (e.g., the scalp on the top of the head). 6.5.2.10 Rib Ribs within 5 cm of the PTV should be co ntoured by outlining the bone and marrow. Typically, several portions of adjacent ribs will be contoured as one struct ure. Adjacent ribs, however, should not be contoured in a contiguous fashion (i.e., do not include the inter- costal space as pa rt of the ribs). 6.5.2.11 Great Vessels (8/19/10) The great vessels (aorta and vena cava, not t he pulmonary artery or vein) will be contoured using mediastinal windowing on CT to correspond to the vascular wall and all muscular layers out to the fatty adventitia. The great ve ssel should be contoured starting at least 10 cm above the superior extent of the PTV and co ntinuing on every CT slice to at least 10 cm below the inferior extent of the PTV. For righ t sided tumors, the vena cava will be contoured, and for left sided tumors, the aorta will be contoured. 6.5.2.12 Other Structures The constraints tables above c ontain other structures. These are required if the treated lesion is within 5 cm of the PTV. 6.6 Documentation Requirements In general, treatment interruptions should be avoided by preventative medical measures and nutritional, psychological, and emotional counseling. Treatment breaks, including indications, must be clearly documented on the treatment record. 6.7 Compliance Criteria 6.7.1 Dosimetry Compliance Section 6.4.2.1, Table 1 describes appropriate conduct for treatment planning dosimetry for target coverage and the dose falloff. The Prin cipal Investigators will evaluate plans as described in Section 6.8. Criteria for both Per Protocol (listed in the table as \"None\") and Variations Acceptable (listed under the heading of \"Minor\") are given in this table. Deviations Unacceptable occur when the stated Minor limit s are exceeded. The table in Section 6.5 lists dose volume limits for specific organs and struct ures. Exceeding these dose limits by more than 2.5% constitutes a Variation Acceptable. Howeve r, exceeding these dose limits by more than 5% constitutes a Deviation Unacceptable. RTOG 0915 21 6.7.2 Treatment Delivery Compliance Setup films will be compared to digitally reconstr ucted radiographs from the same beam's eye view. Deviations of less than 0.5 cm in the tr ansverse plane and 1.0 cm in the craniocaudal plane will be considered compliant. Deviations from 0.5-1.0 cm in the transverse plane and 1.0- 1.25 cm in the craniocaudal plane will be considered as Variation Acceptable. Deviations greater than those listed as minor will be considered as Deviations Unacceptable. 6.8 R.T. Quality Assurance Reviews Treatment planning images and dosimetry planning information in accepted format will be submitted to the Image-Guided Therapy Center (I TC), Washington University, St. Louis, MO, for QA purposes in all cases. See Section 12.1 for data submission. The Principal Investigator, Dr. Videtic and his Co-Investigators, Drs. Singh and Chang, will perform an RT Quality Assurance Remote Review after complete data for the first 20 cases enrolled have been received at ITC. Drs. Videtic, Singh, and Chang will perform the next review after complete data for the nex t 20 cases have been re ceived. The final cases will be reviewed within 3 months after this study has reached the ta rget accrual or as soon as complete data for all cases enrolled have been received at ITC, whichever occurs first. 6.9 Radiation Therapy Adverse Events 6.9.1 Central Airway/Bronchial Injury (7/26/10) This bronchial injury with subsequent focal collapse of lung may impair overall pulmonary status. It also makes further assessment of tumo r response more difficult as the collapsed lung approximates the treated tumor. Because atel ectatic lung and tumor have similar imaging characteristics, radiology reports often will desc ribe the overall process as progressive disease while the actual tumor may be stable or shrinking. Investigators are referred to the strict criteria for progressive disease in Section 11.0 to avoid such mis-characterization. The consequences of bronchial toxicity, e.g., cough, dyspnea, hypoxia, impairment of pulmonary function test parameters , pleural effusion or pleuritic pain (associated with collapse), should all be graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), v. 4; MedDRA, v. 12.0. 6.9.2 Lung Injury Radiation pneumonitis is a subacute (weeks to months from treatment) inflammation of the end bronchioles and alveoli. Radiation fibrosis is a late manifestation of radiation injury to the irradiated lung. Given the small amount of l ung that is typically included in the SBRT portals, lung toxicity has not been as dose-limiting as in conventionally fractionated large field RT, but it is nevertheless seen, can be symptomatic, and may be confused with other causes of respiratory deterioration, including infections, and tumor recurrence. It is very important that a Radiation On cologist participate in the care of the patient, as the clinical picture may be very simi lar to acute bacterial pneumonia, with fatigue, fever, shortness of breath, nonpro ductive cough, and a pulmonary infiltrate on chest x-ray. The infiltrate on chest x-ray should include the area treated to high dose but may extend outside of these regions. The infiltrates may be charac teristically \"geometric\" corresponding to the radiation portal, but may also be ill defined. Patients reporting symptoms as above will be promptly evaluated and treated. Mild radiation pneumonitis may be treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents or steroid inhalers. More significant pneumonitis will be treated wi th systemic steroids , bronchodilators, and pulmonary toilet. Supra- and concurrent infe ctions should be treated with antibiotics. Consideration of prophylaxis of opportunistic infections should be considered in immunocompromised patients. 6.9.3 Changes in Pulmonary Function Tests (7/26/10) Patients enrolled to this study are allowed to have some degree of impaired pulmonary function as measured by pulmonary func tion tests (PFTs), including Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1), Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), and Diffusing Capacity for Carbon Monoxide (DLCO). The Common Toxicity Criteria (CTCAE), v. 4 includes specified criteria for grading adverse events related to these PFT param eters under the system organ class of Investigations. The grading criteria for thes e PFT changes use the \"per cent predicted\" values from 0-100% which are recorded on the patient 's PFT report. A percent predicted of 90% RTOG 0915 22conveys that the patient is able to perform the PFT test to a result that is 90% of what would be expected for the normal general population of the same height, age, and sex. The CTCAE version 4 specified grading criteria for PFTs assumes that all patients have normal baseline pulmonary function. This assumption is not appr opriate for this protocol enrolling patients with abnormal baseline function. As a remedy to monitor treatment effects on PF Ts, we will define a protocol specific toxicity classification for PFTs that adjus ts for baseline abnormalities. Changes that occur after therapy will be referenced to the baseline for a given pati ent, which will be abnorma l for most patients. We have defined a proportional decline from the baseline. Grade 1 toxicity will be a decline from baseline to a level 0.90 times the baseline, grade 2 will be a decline to a level 0.75 of baseline, grade 3 will be a decline to a level 0.5 of baseline, grade 4 will be a decline to a level 0.25 of baseline, and grade 5 will be death. Th is scheme is depicted in the table below and graphically represented in the figure below. As an example, a patient who enters the study with a percent predicted DLCO of 55% who experiences a post-treatment decline to a perc ent predicted DLCO of 40% would have a grade 3 event in the original CTCAE, v. 4 criteria; however, under this modified PFT toxicity classification for patients with abnormal baselin e, his decline would constitute a decrease to 0.72 of the baseline value which is be tween 0.75 and 0.5 or a grade 2 event. RTOG 0915 23 The SBRT Pulmonary Toxicity Scale Grade Adverse Event 1 2 3 4 5 FEV-1 Decline 0.90-0.75 times the patient's baseline value <0.75-0.50 times the patient's baseline value <0.50-0.25 times the patient's baseline value <0.25 times the patient's baseline value Death Forced Vital Capacity Decline 0.90-0.75 times the patient's baseline value <0.75-0.50 times the patient's baseline value <0.50-0.25 times the patient's baseline value <0.25 times the patient's baseline value Death DLCO Decline 0.90-0.75 times the patient's baseline value <0.75-0.50 times the patient's baseline value <0.50-0.25 times the patient's baseline value <0.25 times the patient's baseline value Death 6.9.4 Other Significant Toxicity If other severe toxicity resulting in withhol ding therapy is encountered, the details will be documented. 6.10 Radiation Adverse Event Reporting 6.10.1 Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) Reporting Requirements Adverse events (AEs) as defined in the tables below and all serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reported to the Cancer The rapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) via the Adverse Event Expedited Reporting System (AdEERS) application as directed in this section. Definition of an AE : Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associ ated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure regardless of whether it is considered related to the medical treatment or procedure (attribution of unrelated, unlikely, possible, pr obable, or Guidelines: PFT(FEV-1, FVC, DLCO) Decline 0255075100Percent PredictedBaseline Grade 3 Grade 4 RTOG 0915 24Adverse Event Reporting Requirements. January 2005; http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/adeers.html ] Definition of an SAE : Any adverse experience occurring duri ng any part of protocol treatment and 30 days after that results in any of the following outcomes: Death; A life-threatening adverse experience; Inpatient hospitalization or A persistent or significant disability/incapacity; A congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that do not result in death, are not life threatening, or do not require hospitalization may be considered an SAE, w hen, based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition. Any pregnancy occurring on study must be reported via AdEERS as a medically significant event. Pharmaceutically supported studies will require additional reporting over and above that which is required by CTEP. SAEs (more than 30 days after last treatment) attr ibuted to the protocol treatment (possible, probable, or definite) should be reported via AdEERS. Note: All deaths on study require both routine and expedited reporting regardless of causality. Attribution to treatment or other cause must be provided. \"On study\" is defined as during or within 30 days of completing protocol treatment. AdEERS REPORTING REQUIREMENTS (7/26/10) AdEERS provides a radiation therapy (RT)-only pathway for events experienced involving RT only, both with and without a drug component arm. Events that occur on the RT-only arm of a study with a drug component must be reported fo r purposes of comparison. Events that occur on an RT-only study without a drug component also must be reported. Ev ents involving RT-only must be reported via the AdEERS RT-only pathway. As of October 1, 2010, this study will utiliz e the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4, MedDRA version 12.0 fo r grading of all adverse events. A copy of the CTCAE v. 4 can be downloaded from the Ca ncer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) home page ( the RTOG web site (http://www.rtog.org/memb ers/toxicity/main.html ). Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) that meet the criteria defined above experienced by patients accrued to this protocol must be reported to CTEP as indicated in the following tables using the AdEERS application. AdEERS can be accessed via the CTEP web (https://webapps.ctep.nci.nih.gov/op enapps/plsql/gadeer s_main$.startup ). Use the patient's case number without any leading zeros as the pat ient ID when reporting via AdEERS. In order to ensure consistent data capture, AEs and SAEs reported using AdEERS must also be reported to RTOG on the AE case report form (see Section 12.1). In addition, sites must submit CRFs in a timely manner after AdEERS submissions. Certain SAEs as outlined below will require t he use of the 24 Hour AdEERS Notification: Phase II & III Studies : All unexpected potentially related SAEs Phase I Studies: All unexpected hospitalizations and all grade 4 and 5 SAEs regardless of relationship RTOG 0915 25 Any event that meets the above outlined criteria for an SAE but is assessed by the AdEERS System as \"expedited reporting NOT required\" must still be reported for safety reasons. Sites must bypass the \"NOT Required\" assessment and complete and submit the report. The AdEERS System allows submission of all reports regardless of the results of the assessment.

Any medical event equivalent to CTCAE, v. 4 grade 3, 4, or 5 that precip itates hospitalization (or prolongation of existing hospitalization) must be r eported regardless of attribution and designation as expected or unexpected with the exc eption of any events identified as protocol-specific expedited adverse event reporting exclusions. Any event that results in persistent or significant disabilities/incapacities, congenital anomalies, or birth defects must be reported via AdEERS if the event o ccurs following protocol treatment or procedure. Use the NCI protocol number and the protocol-speci fic patient ID assigned during trial registration on all reports. RTOG REPORTING REQUIREMENTS (7/26/10) AdEERS provides a radiation therapy (RT)-only pathwa y for events experienced involving RT only, both with and without a drug component ar m. Events that occur on the RT- only arm of a study with a drug component must be reported for purposes of compar ison. Events that occur on an RT-only study without a drug component also must be reported. Events in volving RT-only must be reported via the AdEERS RT-only pathway. As of October 1, 2010, this study will utilize t he Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4, MedDRA, version 12.0, for grading of all adverse events. A copy of the CTCAE v. 4 can be downloaded from the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) home page (http://ctep.info.nih.gov ) RTOG 0915 26 Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) that meet the criteria defined above experienced by patients accrued to this protocol must be reported via AdEERS. SAEs must be reported within 24 hours of discovery of the even t. Contact the CTEP Help Desk if assistance is required. All supporting source documentation being faxed to NCI, must be properly labeled with the RTOG study/case numbers and the date of the adverse event and must be faxed to the RTOG dedicated AE/SAE FAX, 215-717-0990, before the 5- or 10- calendar-day deadline. All forms submitted to RTOG Headquarters also must include the RTOG study/ case numbers; non-RTOG intergroup study and case numbers must be included , when applicable. AdEERS Reports are forwarded to RTOG electronically via the AdEERS system. Use the patient's case number as the patient ID when reporting via AdEERS.

RTOG Headquarters AML/MDS Report 1818 Market Street, Suite 1600 Philadelphia, PA 19103 7.0 DRUG THERAPY Not applicable to this study. 8.0 SURGERY Not applicable to this study. 9.0 OTHER THERAPY 9.1 Permitted Supportive Therapy All supportive therapy for optimal medical ca re will be given during the study period at the discretion of the attending physician(s) within th e parameters of the protocol and documented on each site's source documents as concomitant medication. Additional adjuvant treatment is not recommended but is permitted at the discretion of the treating physician. 9.2 Non-permitted Supportive Therapy Concurrent antineoplastic therapy while on study is not permitted. 10.0 TISSUE/SPECIMEN SUBMISSION For patients who have consented to participate in the tissue/blood component of the study (See Appendix I). NOTE : Patients must be offered the opportunity to participate in the tissue/specimen submission component of the study. If the patient consents to participate in the tissue/specimen component of the study, the site is required to submit the patient's specimens as RTOG 0915 27specified in Section 10.0 of the protocol. Sites are not permitted to delete the tissue/specimen component from the protocol or from the sample consent. 10.1 Tissue/Specimen Submission The RTOG Biospecimen Resource at the Univer sity of California San Francisco acquires and maintains high quality specimens from RTOG trials . Tissue from each block is preserved through careful block storage and processing. The RTOG enco urages participants in protocol studies to consent to the banking of their tissue. The RTOG Biospecimen Resource provides tissue specimens to investigators for translational research studies. Translational research studies integrate the newest research findings into current protocols to investigate important biologic questions. The RTOG Biospecimen Resource al so collects tissue for Central Review of pathology. Central Review of tissue can be for eligibility and/or analysis. In this study, tissue will be submitted to t he RTOG Biospecime n Resource for the purpose of tissue banking and serum, lymphocytes, and plasma will be collected for translational research. 10.2 Specimen Collection for Tissue Banking (Highly recommended but not required) The following must be provided in order for the case to be evaluable for the Biospecimen Resource: 10.2.1 One H&E stained (8/19/10) A paraffin-embedded tissue block of the tumo r or a 2 mm diameter core of tissue, punched from the tissue block containing the tumor with a punch tool and submitted in a plastic tube labeled with the surgical pathology numbe r. NOTE: A kit with the punch, tube, and instructions can be obtained free of charge from the Biospecimen Resource. Block or core must be clearly labeled with the pathology identificati on number that corresponds to the Pathology Report. 10.2.3 A Pathology Report documenting that the submi tted block or core contains tumor. The report must include the RTOG protocol number and pati ent's case number. The patient's name and/or other identifying information should be removed from the report. The surgical pathology numbers and information must NOT be removed from the report. 10.2.4 A Specimen Transmittal Form clearly stating that tissue is being submitted for the RTOG Biospecimen Resource; if for translational research, this should be stated on the form. The form must include the RTOG protocol number and patient's case number. 10.3 Serum, Plasma, and Lymphocyte Collection for Translational Research (Highly recommended but not required) See Appendix V for blood kit contents and detailed collection instructions. Baseline levels of the RNA, proteins, and/or ch anges of the levels after SBRT may be used as biomarkers to predict clinical outcome includi ng survival, local regional recurrence, distant metastasis, and treatment related toxicity. These ma rkers may help us in th e future to classify patients for their probability to benefit from the th erapeutic regimens, particularly dose escalated radiotherapy. One of the critical issues in st udying biomarkers is the availab ility of biological materials. For patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), repeated biopsies from tumors are difficult and cannot be performed routinely. Serum circulating in the body and carrying proteins or peptides from tumors and their surrounding environment may be a candidate surrogate tissue that provides important information about the indi vidual's intrinsic genetic background and its response to the disease in the lungs. It may be informative in assessing response and toxicity following treatment. Furthermore, an individual's serum is relatively stable in volume, and therefore more reliable for quantitative analyse s. A major advantage of using serum is its accessibility as it can be obtained easily without invasive procedures, particularly if only a small volume is required. In fact, associations between levels of certain serum proteins and responses to chemotherapeutic regimens have been reporte d. Blood lymphocytes are cellular components easily accessible from patients. Al though they are not cancer cells, their response to treatment may reflect their genomic background. Inform ation obtained from these cells might provide additional information about treatment response and toxicity if the genomic background indeed plays a role. 10.3.1 Blood Sample Preparation RTOG 0915 28 20 ml peripheral blood (one 10 ml EDTA t ube and one 10ml Red-top tube) will be taken from each individual before treatment and 6 weeks afte r completion of SBRT.

RTOG 0915 3011.0 PATIENT ASSESSMENTS 11.1 Study Parameters : See Appendix II for a summary of asse ssments. See details and exceptions in Sections 11.1.1-11.1.4 below: 11.1.1 Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) include spirom etry, lung volumes, and diffusion capacity. Arterial blood gases are optional. Subsequent to the follow-up visit 12 weeks post-SBRT, PFTs should be done every 6 months for 5 years. 11.1.2 Alternate chest x-ray and CT scan with contrast in follow-up visits, with initial chest x-ray at 6 weeks post-SBRT and the initial CT scan with c ontrast at 12 weeks po st-SBRT. Continue alternating the studies in follow-up visits. 11.1.3 With the chest x-ray at 6 weeks post-SBRT, m onitor for signs of radiation pneumonitis (see Section 6.9). 11.1.4 FDG-PET is recommended but not required at 12 weeks post-SBRT and at 1 year post-SBRT as a measure of response. Note: FDG PET data will be used for the analysis of a secondary endpoint (see Section 2.2.2). To be included in this analysis, the patient's PET studies must be performed with a dedicated BGO, LSO, or GSO PET or PET/CT scanner. PET scanners with sodium iodide (Nal) detectors are not acceptable. If the baseline PET study is performed at the treating institution (or its affiliated PET facility), it is recommended that the reassessment PET scans be performed at the same site. FDG PET studies should be conducted according the institutional policies and quality assurance measures of each treating institution and should reflect the standards of practice as delineated in reports such as Shankar, et al. (2006). 11.2 Measurement of Response 11.2.1 Response Determination (8/19/10) Response to SBRT will be evaluated in this study using the international criteria proposed in the Revised Response Evaluation Criteria in So lid Tumors (RECIST) Guideline version 1.1 [ Eur J Cancer . 2009;45:228-247.] See http://ctep.info.nih.gov/protocolD evelopment/docs/recist_guideline.pdf for further details. Additional definitions beyond the RECIST guidelines specific to this protocol are incorporated to define primary tumor control as described below. 11.2.2 Baseline Documentation of \"T arget\" and \"Non-Target\" Lesions Patients enrolled to this protocol should have clinical stage I (T1 or T2, N0, M0) [T < 5 cm] NSCLC. At time of treatment, they should have only one site of gr oss disease in the lung, with no metastases. The primary lung tumor should be identified as the target lesion and recorded and measured at baseline and with each follow-up imaging evaluation. The longest diameter (LD) for the target lesion will be calculated from the treatment planning CT scan using pulmonary windowing an d reported as the baseline LD. The baseline LD will be used as a reference by which to characterize the objective tumor. For follow-up assessment, diagnostic CT scans performed using a 5 mm contiguous reconstruction algorithm using pulmonary windowing taken as part of scheduled protocol follow-up are preferred as the method of evaluation for response. When CT scans are not available, chest x-ray determination will be allowed as long as the target lesion is clearly visible. Changes in serum tumor markers will not be allo wed for assessment of either local tumor progression or metastatic progression. Local treatment effects in the vicinity of t he tumor target may make determination of tumor dimensions difficult. For example, bronchial or bronchiolar damage may cause patchy consolidation around the tumor that over time may coalesce with the residual tumor. In cases in which it is indeterminate whether consolidati on represents residual tumor or treatment effect, it should be assumed that abnormalities are residual tumor. In order to make the assessment more objective, a central radiology review for CT response evaluation will be required for this protocol. All other lesions (or sites of disease) that appear after treatment (e.g., regional lymph nodes and distant metastases) should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at the point of their appearance and with each follow-up. Non-target lesions should RTOG 0915 31constitute measurable disease, which by defin ition requires having an appearance suspicious for carcinoma and having a dimension of at leas t 1.0 cm. Assessment of regional lymphatic or metastatic progression will be made in comparison to the required pretr eatment staging studies or any other pretreatment imaging evaluations available. Only non-target lesions appearing at the margin of the PTV (i.e., within 1. 0 cm) will have recorded measurements (see Marginal Failure in the table below). Recorded measurem ents of all other non-target lesions are not required, but the presence or absence of each should be noted throughout follow-up. 11.2.3 Response Criteria (8/19/10) Evaluation of Target and Involved Lobe Lesions Complete Response (CR) Disappearance of the target lesion; ideall y, this determination will be made based on CT image evaluation. Partial Response (PR) At least a 30% decrease in the LD of t he target lesion, taking as reference the baseline LD; ideally, this determination will be made based on CT image evaluation. Stable Disease (SD) Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for CR/PR above nor sufficient increase to qualify for LE below, taking as reference t he smallest LD since the treatment started Local Enlargement (LE) At least a 20% increase in the LD of target lesion, taking as reference the smallest LD recorded since the treatment started; Ideally, this determination will be made based on CT image evaluation. Primary Tumor Failure (PTF) Refers to the primary treated tumor after protocol therapy and corresponds to meeting both of the following two criteria: 1) Increase in tumor dimension of 20% as defined above for local enlargement (LE); 2) The measurable tumor with criteria meeting LE should be avid on Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging with uptake of a similar intensity as the pret reatment staging PET, OR the measurable tumor should be biopsied confirming viable carcinoma. For outcome analysis, Marginal Failures (MF; see below) will also be counted as PTF; however, they should be distinguished specifically as MF , not PTF, on all report forms. The EORTC criteria for post-treatment PET evaluation will be used as a basis for evaluation in cases more difficult to assi gn as to whether the uptake is pathological for cancer recurrence vs. inflammation. 46 Marginal Failure (MF) Refers to the appearance after protocol therapy of a measurable tumor appearing since treatment within 1.0 cm of the trea ted PTV (see Section 6.4) and meeting the following two criteria: 1) Enlarging tumor dimensions corresponding to a 20% increase in the longest diameter compared to initial appearance on imaging evaluation. Ideally, this determination will be made based on CT image evaluation; 2) The measurable tumor within 1.0 cm of the treated PTV should be avid on Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging wi th uptake of a similar intensity as the pre-treatment staging PET, OR t he measurable tumor should be biopsied confirming viable carcinoma. Primary Tumor Control (PTC) The absence of Primary Tumor Failure. Involved Lobe Failure Refers to the appearance of lung cancer after protocol therapy within the anatomical boundaries of the lobe in which the primary tumor arose (involved lobe). The measurable tumor apart from the primary tumor but within the involved lobe should meet criteria for LE, should be avid on Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging with uptake highly suspici ous for cancer (e.g., SUV>3-5), OR the measurable tumor should be biopsied confirmin g viable carcinoma. Failure outside of the involved lobe (uninvolved lobes) will be considered metastatic disseminated (distant) failures. Local Failure Refers to either primary tumor failure or involved lobe failure or both. Local Control (LC) The absence of Local Failure RTOG 0915 32 Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions Regional Failure (RF) Refers to the appearance after protocol therapy of measurable tumor within lymph nodes along the natural lymphatic drainage ty pical for the location of the treated primary disease only with dimension of at least 1.0 cm on imaging studies (preferably CT scans) within the lung, bronchial hilum, or the mediastinum. Equivocally appearing enlarged lymph nodes should be positive on PET imaging or biopsied to confirm involvement with carcinoma. Metastatic Dissemination (MD) Refers to the appearance after protocol t herapy of cancer deposits characteristic of metastatic dissemination from non- small cell lung cancer. Appropriate evaluations for making this determina tion include physical examination and imaging studies. PET scan OR biopsy to confirm MD is encouraged but not required. 11.3 Criteria for Discontinuation of Protocol Treatment Disease progression at any time during treatment or in the follow-up period; the patient should be restaged and sites of recurrenc e and/or progression should be documented. Rebiopsy is strongly encouraged. \u0083 Development of intercurrent, noncancer relat ed illnesses that prevent the continuation of treatment or protocol-specified follow up. \u0083 Unacceptable toxicity; \u0083 The patient may elect to withdraw from st udy treatment at any time for any reason. If protocol treatment is discontinued, follow up and data collection will continue as specified in the protocol. 12.0 DATA COLLECTION Data should be submitted to: RTOG Headquarters* 1818 Market Street, Suite 1600 Philadelphia, PA 19103 *If a data form is available for web entr y, it must be submitted electronically.

The treatment allocation scheme described by Zelen (1974) will be used because it balances patient factors other t han institution. Additionally, patie nts will be stratified by Zubrod Performance Status (0 vs. 1. vs. 2) and T Stage (T1 vs. T2). RTOG 0915 3513.4 Sample Size The goals for this randomized phase II study are to select the most favorable treatment regimen on the basis of the grade 3 or higher adverse event s at 1 year and for that regimen to be used then as a comparison (experimental) arm in a phase III trial against t he current RT OG standard SBRT treatment set by RTOG 0236. Based on the results of previous studies (Har a 2006, Onishi 2007, Timmerman 2007), we expect that at most 5% of patients will experi ence a grade 3 or higher adverse event. We will not investigate further any regimen in this study that yields > 17% grade 3 or higher adverse events by 1 year. We consider any regimen in this study that yields 5% grade 3 or higher adverse events by 1 year to be a treatment regimen to investigate further. For each arm, the null hypothesis (H 0) is that the regimen is not safe versus the alternative hypothesis (H A) that the regimen is safe. Let p denote the proportion of patients who have not experienced a grade 3 or higher adverse event by the end of year 1 am ong all analyzable patients (eligible patients who received any protocol treatment) in each arm. The hypotheses for each arm are: H0: p < 0.83 vs. H A: p 0.95 Based on the hypotheses above, the sample size wa s calculated with Fleming's Multiple Testing Procedure (1982), specifically two-stage te sting, at a significance level of 0.1 and 90% statistical power. At these type I and II erro r rates, 41 patients will be needed for each arm. This sample size will yield an actual significance level of 0. 06 and an actual statistical power of 83%. Adjusting the number of cases for ineligible or unanalyz able cases by 7%, 44 patients are needed for each arm; a maximum of 88 patients is required for this study. 13.5 Patient Accrual Based on patient accrual in previous RTOG studies , the initial 6 months accrual will be negligible while institutions are obtaining IRB approval. Based upon patient accrual in previous RTOG NSCLC studies, the patient accrual is projected to be 2 patients per month. Assuming a similar accrual rate of 2 per month for this study, we expe ct to complete accrual for this study in 4.5 (> 4.3) years. If the accrual rate is higher than the projected date, we will amend the protocol to reflect the actual accrual rate. If the accrual rate is too lo w, the feasibility of completing the study will be discussed with the Study Chairs, the RTOG Lung Cancer Committee Chair, and the RTOG Executive Committee. 13.6 Analysis Plans The analysis for reporting the in itial results of treatme nt will be undertaken when each pat ient has been potentially followed for a minimum of 1 year from the end of protoc ol specified treatment. Only patients that meet the eligibility requirements of this protocol and start protocol treatment will be included. Analyzable patients are defined as eligible patients who received any protocol treatment. 13.6.1 Analysis of the Primary Endpoint (8/19/10) The NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adve rse Events (CTCAE, v. 4) for scoring the treatment-related adverse events will be used. The adverse events of interest in this study are listed in Section 13.1. The rates of grade 3 or higher adverse events at 1 year will be calculated as the proportion of patients who have any adverse event of intere st by the end of year 1 among the total analyzable patients in each arm. These rates will be reported by T stage (T1 versus T2). The stopping and continuation rules in Table 1 will be applied for the interim analyses for each arm separately. At any stage, we will report t he results when the results from both arms are available. If at any stage, we st op and reject the null hypothesis (H 0), we would conclude that this regimen is safe, stop the accrual to this arm, and continue to accrue patients to the other arm (if applicable). If we stop and reje ct the alternative hypothesis (H A) at any stage, we would conclude that the regimen is not safe, stop the accrual to this arm, and continue to accrue patients to the other arm (if applicable). If we c ontinue until the last stage, we will conclude that the regimen is safe or not safe. RTOG 0915 36 Based on a number of studies of SBRT, we assume similar high rates of primary tumor control rate for single and multiple fraction doses. However, we will monitor the primary tumor control rate for both arms. 1. If the primary tumor control rate at 1 ye ar of both arms are higher than 90% and the adverse event rate for both arms is 17%, then both arms will be strongly considered as a potential arm in a subsequent phas e III study, assuming treatment delivery is acceptable. If both arms meet these criteria , then the treatment arm that has lower adverse event rate at 1 year will be chosen. 2. If the primary tumor control rate at 1 year of both arms is less than 90% and the adverse event rate for both arms is 17%, then the Study Chairs will reassess the validity of either fractionation as a potent ial comparator arm for a phase III comparison with the RTOG 0236 standard treatment. 3. If any of the arms have more than 17% grade 3 or higher adverse events by 1 year, then we will conclude that the experimental regimen is not promising for further investigation regardless of primary tumor control rates at 1 year. 4. If only 1 of the arms has a higher than 90% primary tumor control rate at 1 year, with the adverse event rate for both arms being 17%, then the treatment arm that has a primary tumor control rate higher than 90% will be chosen. Table 1: Number of Patients Having Grade 3 or Higher Adverse Events at 1 Year for Stopping and Continuation Rules Number of analyzable patients* Stop and conclude that this regimen is safe Continue Accrual Stop and conclude that this regimen is not safer 21 0 1-3 4 41 4 N/A 5 *Analyzable patients are defined as eligible patient s who received any protocol treatment with at least 1 year of follow-up beginning from the start of SBRT. If a grade 5 adverse event definitely, probably, or possibly related to treatment is reported at any time, it will be reviewed by the Study Chairs , the Study Statistician, the RTOG Lung Cancer Committee chair, and the RTOG Executive Comm ittee. Case report forms (CRFs), source documentation, and a statistical r eport summarizing the study data will be reviewed as soon as possible. During this review, accrual will be suspended (if applicable). Following this review, the Study Chairs, the Study Statistician, the RTOG Lung Cancer Committee chair, and the RTOG Executive Committee will discuss the finding s and make a decision about amending and/or continuing the study. In each arm, logistic regression (Agresti 1996) will be used to model the distribution of grade 3 adverse events. Both unadjusted and adjusted odd ratios and the respective 90% confidence interval will be computed. The following will be reported at the time of primary endpoint analysis: Tabulation of all cases entered, and any pati ents excluded from the analysis with reasons for exclusion; Patient accrual rate; Institutional accrual; Distribution of important prognostic ba seline and other pretreatment variables; Frequency and severity of adverse events; Compliance rates of treatment delivery wi th respect to the protocol prescription. RTOG 0915 37 13.6.2 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints 13.6.2.1 Survival Outcomes (8/19/10) The survival endpoints for this trial are primar y tumor control, overall survival, and disease- free survival at 1 year. The failure event for overall survival is a death due to any cause. Survival time is measured from the date of randomization to the date of death or last follow up. The failure event for disease-free survival is defined as death due to any cause, local failure, marginal failure, involved node failure, regional failure, distant metastasis, or second primary. Time to disease-free survival is measured from the date of randomization to the earliest event or to the date of most recent follow- up if no event occurred. Primary tumor control is defined as the absence of local progression as defined in Section 11.2.3. Marginal failures will be considered events for primary tumor failure. The primary tumor control rate at 1 year will be calculated as the number of pat ients who do not have a local progression event by the total number of analyzable patients in each arm at 1 year. The Kaplan-Meier method (1958) will be used to estimate overall surv ival and disease-free survival at 1 year. Time to overall survival and disease-free survival will be modeled by Cox (1972) proportional hazards regression. Unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios and the respective 90% confidence intervals will be co mputed. Logistic regression (Agresti 1996) will be used to model the distribution of the primary tumor control rate. Both unadjusted and adjusted odd ratios and the respective 90% c onfidence interval will be computed. At the least, Zubrod performan ce status, and T-stage (and other factors as appropriate) will be adjusted in these models. No statistical comparison will be made bet ween the 2 arms. Further subgroup analyses will be undertaken if the sample sizes involved in each subgroup are adequate to support such analyses. 13.6.2.2 Assessment of FDG PET SUV Changes as a Measure of Treatment Response and Outcomes Whole body FDG-PET scan will be done within 8 weeks prior to registration (required), and 12 weeks and 12 months post-SBRT (recomme nded but not required). The peak standard uptake value (SUV), normalized SUV (peak SU V of regions of interest/mean SUV of the aortic arch), and the change of SUV and nor malized SUV (subtracting SUV and normalized SUV at reassessment from bas eline data respectively) will be used as PET scan data. The grade 3 or higher adverse event, overall surv ival, and disease-free survival will be the outcomes. The distribution of the peak SU V and normalized SUV will be reported for each time point, respectively. The distribution of change of SUV and normalized SUV will be reported. 13.6.2.3 Descriptive Pulmonary Function by Treatment Arm and Response The descriptive statistics of changes of FEV1 and diffusion capacity before and after treatment will be reported in each arm (at least mean, standard deviation, median, and range). These data will be reported by 4 loca l response categories (complete response; partial response; stable enlargement) in each arm. 13.6.2.4 Translational Research: Biomarkers for Primary Tumor Control and Grade 2 or Higher Radiation Pneumonitis (8/19/10) At the time of data maturity of this study, we will propose specific details of the markers to be investigated. However, we propose the follo wing list of potential biomarkers, subject to change based on information that is unknown at this time: Radiation treatment-related hypoxia markers (such as TGF-Beta, IL-1 and IL). We will address the assays that will be used and a list of s pecific correlative aims with appropriate statistical considerations. The followi ng is a general guideline of the statistical consideration for this analysis. This analysis w ill be done in each arm separately to test the prognostic value of ea ch biomarker. The pat ients with biomarkers will be compared with the patients without a value for that biomarker to determine if there are any differences with RTOG 0915 38respect to distribution of baseline. A k-fold cross validation method with k 2 (which will be decided at the time of analysis) will be used to validate the results of the following analyses. It is entirely possible that factors and biomarkers shown to be statistically significant in other published series may not be found here. 13.6.2.4.1 Primary Endpoint of Translational Research (8/19/10) We hypothesize markers (Osteopontin, VEGF, IL8, LDH5, and microRAN 210) a greater decl ine after treatment with fractionated SBRT (Arm 2) than with single fraction SBRT (Arm 1). The change of each putative hypoxia circulating marker from baseline to 6 weeks after SBRT is calculated in each arm. Two- sided t-test statistics (if normal distribution assumption is met) or Wilcox rank sum test statistics (if normal distribution assumption is not met) are calculated and tested at the significance level =0.05 for each marker. We will test to see if the baseline level of eac h hypoxia circulating marker is a statistically significant factor for primary tumor control ra te at 1 year for each arm using logistic regression (Agresti 1996) in each arm. The 95% confidence interval of odds ratio (OR) of each marker in each arm and OR will be calculated. No testing will be done between the two arms. 13.6.2.4.2 Secondary Endpoints of Translational Research (8/19/10) Exploratory analysis for the correlation of DNA repairing gene polymorphism (such as p53, XRCC1, ERCC1, XPA, XPC, XPD, XPF, XPG) and both the rate of grade 2 or higher radiation pneumonitis and pr imary tumor control will be performed. Single Nuclear Polymorphism (SNP) data from these DNA repairing genes will be correlated to the rate of grade 2 or higher radiation pneumonitis and prim ary tumor control at 1 year using logistic regressions. The Hardy Wei nberg Equilibrium (HWE) assumption will be checked for each SNP by Fisher's Exact test to test the null hypothesis that HWE law holds. The multiple testing problem will be addressed using such as the adjust p-value controlling false discovery rate (Benjamini 1995) or false positive rate (Story 2004). All two-sided testing using an adjusted p-value is done at a significance level of 0.05. Multiple logistic regression models are utilized to see the genoty pe effects of each SNP adjusted for other covariates. The 3 possible factors, 1) the change betwe en pre-and post-SBRT; 2) pre-SBRT level; as TGF-Beta, IL-1 and IL-6), will be correlated to the rate of grade 2 or higher radiation pn eumonitis separately. The logistic regression will be used in each arm for each factor. 13.6.3 Clinical Data Update System (CDUS) Monitoring This study will be monitored by the Clinic al Data Update System (CDUS) version 3.0. Cumulative CDUS data will be submitted quarterl y by electronic means. Reports are due January 31, April 30, July 31, and October 31. 13.7 Gender and Minorities In conformance with the National Institute of H ealth Revitalization Act of 1993 with regard to inclusion of women and minorities in clinical research, we have also considered the possible interaction between race and treatments. Some investigators have shown gender to be a prognostic factor in NSCLC. However, the RTOG did not show this to be the case in a recent analysis {ref 9}. Furthermore, an analysis of race did not indicate an association with outcome {ref 10}. The projected gender and minority accruals are provided in the table below.

Y our study doctor will explain t he clinical trial to you. Clinical trials include only people who choose to take part. Please ta ke your time to make your decision about taking part. You may discuss your decision with your friends and family. You can also discuss it with your health care team. If you have any questions, you can ask your study doctor for more explanation. You are being asked to take part in this study because you have early stage lung cancer and cannot or are not willing to have surgery. Why is this study being done? Early stage lung cancer is cancer that is limited to the lung and has not spread to the chest lymph nodes or other parts of the body. Standard treatment for early stage lung cancer is surgery to remove the cancer-bearing lung. Patients like you cannot have surgery because of other serious health problems such as emphysema, diabetes, or heart disease. These patients often receive radiation therapy. Standard radiation therapy can involve da ily treatment for several weeks and may not be as effective as surgery at getting rid of the cancer. Standard radiation also may lead to a large amount of scarring of the normal lung surrounding the tumor, which may make other serious health problems worse. A new radiation therapy called stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is now being offered to patients with early stage lung cancer who cannot have surgery. The goal of SBRT is to get rid of the lung tumor and spare the lung. SBRT gives fewer but higher doses of radiation than standard radiation. It uses special equipment to position the patient and guide focused x-ray beams toward the cancer and away from normal lung tissue. Research so far suggests that SBRT can reduce the size or eventually eliminate lung tumors effectively and is relatively safe for lungs. There are a number of different approaches and timefram es used in giving SBRT for early stage lung cancers. The purpose of this study is to compare two previously studied methods of delivering high dose radiation to the lung to see if one treatment is better. In this stud y, you will receive a single SBRT treatment OR 4 SBRT treatments over 4 days. How many people will t ake part in the study? About 88 people will take part in this study What will happen if I take part in this research study? You will be \"randomized\" into one of the study groups des cribed below. Randomization means that you are put into a group by chance. A computer program will place you in one of the study groups. Neither you nor your study doctor can choose the group you will be in. You will have an equal chan ce of being placed in either group. If you are in Group 1 (often called \"Arm 1\"), you will receive one SBRT treatme nt of 34 Gy (Gy is a measure of radiation dosage). RTOG 0915 46If you are in Group 2 (often called \"A rm 2\"), you will receive 4 SBRT treat ments, 1 each day for 4 consecutive days, for 48 Gy. Before you begin the study (8/19/10) You will need to have the following exams, tests or proced ures to find out if you can be in the study. These exams, tests or procedures are part of regular cancer care and may be done even if you do not join the study. If you have had some of them recently, they may not need to be repeated. This will be up to your study doctor. Physical examinations by several doctors Checking your weight Evaluation of your ability to carry out daily activities A CT (Computed Tomography) scan of your lungs an d abdomen with contrast: a CT scan is a study using x-rays to look at one part of your body. Contrast means that dye is injected into your vein to increase the differences between normal and abnormal tissue. A PET (Positron Emission Tomography) scan of your body: A small amount of radioactive material is injected into your vein, and a scanner makes a detailed picture of areas inside your body Blood tests, including a blood test to find out how mu ch oxygen is delivered to the tissues beyond your lung, if recommended by your doctor (about 1-2 teaspoons of your blood will be taken) Tests of your breathing and lung function For women who are able to have children, a test to see that they are not pregnant During the study If the exams, tests and procedures show that you can be in the study, and you choose to take part, then you will need these tests and procedures that are part of regular cancer care. They are being done more often because you are in this study. A physical exam Checking your weight Evaluation of your ability to carry out daily activities Evaluation of any side effects fr om treatment you may be having Before SBRT begins , you will have a treatment planning session. You will lie in a specif ic position, possibly within a frame device or on a large plastic bag filled with tiny foam balls similar to a bean bag. The purpose of the frame or bag is to hold your body as still as possible for pl anning and treatment. After you are positioned, doctors will check your breathing and see how your organs move. The doct ors will try to limit the effect of that movement on the position of your tumor by timing your breathing. They may use a device to control the depth of your breathing or one to monitor the rate and pattern of your breathing so that they will be able to deliver the radiation to the tumor while accounting for the effect of breathing. Radiation Treatment: Usually 7-10 days after the radiation planning session, you will return to the radiation medicine department for your radiation treatment. For your treatment, you will lie in the device that was used for your planning session. You will lie as still as possible and breathe normally while your radiation is delivered. It will take approximately one to two hours to deliver the radiat ion. During the process of radiation, participants can become claustrophobic. Medications can be given to make you feel more comfortable should this happen. Also, your doctor may give you pain medication before each treatment to decrease any discomfort you may have due to laying on a hard surface and/or due to laying with your arms held above your head during the treatment. You will need these tests and procedures in follow-up visits : At 6 weeks after the SBRT: A physical examination Checking your weight Evaluation of your ability to carry out daily activities Blood tests A chest x-ray Evaluation of any side effects from treatment you may be having RTOG 0915 47 At 12 weeks after the SBRT: A physical examination Checking your weight Evaluation of your ability to carry out daily activities Tests of your breathing and lung function A CT scan with contrast Blood tests Evaluation of any side effects from treatment you may be having If recommended by your doctor, a PET scan to find out the effect of SBRT on your tumor Every 3 months in years 1-2, every 6 m onths in years 3-4 and then once a year: (8/19/10) A physical examination Checking your weight Evaluation of your ability to carry out daily activities Tests of your breathing and lung function every 6 months for 5 years Beginning at 6 months in year 1, a chest x-ray; in the next follow-up visit (at 12 months), a CT scan with contrast: Your doctor will continue to alte rnate these studies in follow-up visits. If recommended by your doctor, a PET scan at 1 year from SBRT to find out the effect of SBRT on your tumor Blood tests Evaluation of any side effects from treatment you may be having Study Plan Another way to find out what will happen to you during the study is to read the chart below. Start reading at the top and read down the list, following the lines and arrows. Randomize (You will be in one Group or the other) Group 2 SBRT treatment daily for 4 days 48 Gy Group 1 1 SBRT treatment 34 Gy Treatment Planning Session RTOG 0915 48How long will I be in the study? You will receive either 1 SBRT treatment or 4 SBRT treatments in 4 days. Afte r your treatment is completed, you will be seen in follow-up visits with your doctor at 6 and 12 weeks after SBRT, every 3 months in years 1-2, every 6 months in years 3-4 and then on ce a year for your lifetime. Can I stop being in the study? Yes. You can decide to stop at any time. Tell the study doctor if you are thinking about stopping or decide to stop. He or she will tell you how to stop safely. It is important to tell the study doctor if you are thinking about stopping so any risks from the SBRT can be evaluated by him/her. Another reason to tell your study doc tor that you are thinking about stopping is to discuss what follow-up care and testing could be most helpful for you. The study doctor may stop you from taking part in this study at any time if he/she believes it is in your best interest; if you do not follow the study rules; or if the study is stopped. What side effects or risks can I expect from being in the study? You may have side effects while on the study. Everyone taking part in the study will be watched carefully for any side effects. However, researchers don't know all the side effects that may happen. Side effects may be mild or very serious. Your health care team may give you medi cines to help lessen side effects. Many side effects go away soon after you stop taking the SBRT. In some cases, side effects can be serious, long lasting, or may never go away. There also is a risk of death. Risks and side effects related to the SBRT Likely Damage to surrounding normal lung and/or collapse of a portion of treated lung Changes in the lungs as the tumor shrinks; these ch anges will be recognized by your radiation doctor on your x-rays or scans as expected \" scarring\" that is developing. In mo st patients, no noticeable symptoms will result from this lung damage. Fatigue Redness of irritation of the skin in the treatment Hair loss in the treatment area (chest hair) Some soreness of the ribs with an increased risk of rib fracture. Treatment fo r such symptoms usually consists of rest, heat, and pain medication. Less Likely Cough Increased phlegm production Difficulty breathing Fever Rare but Serious . Some patients can have the following symptoms asso ciated with lung scarring: shortness of breath, cough, fever, and/or pain in the chest wall. T hese patients may require oxygen for a short time or permanently. Lung damage can be life threatening. Damage to the lining of the heart, which can cause fluid accumulation around the heart and chest pain, shortness of breath, and/or irregular or rapid heart beat Damage to the heart muscle, which can cause heart attack, heart failure, or death Damage to the spinal cord, which can cause numbness, weakness, tingling, and/or inability to use the arms and/or legs Damage to the esophagus, which can cause problems with swallowing RTOG 0915 49 Damage to the large blood vessels surrounding the heart, which could cause coughing up of blood and possibly death Severe pain or skin damage leading to an open wound During the process of treatment planning and radiation, you will lie in a specific position, possibly within a frame device, and some patients can become claustrophobic. Medications can be given to make you feel more comfortable should this happen. Also, your doctor ma y give you pain medication before each treatment to decrease any discomfort you may have due to laying on a har d surface and/or due to laying with your arms held above your head during the treatment.

[* Only applies to sites using the CIRB.] Please note: This section of the informed consent form is about additional research that is being done with people who are taking part in the main study. You may take part in this additional research if you want to. You can still be a part of the main study even if you say 'no' to taking part in this additional research. You can say \"yes\" or \"no\" to [each of] the following study[ies]. Below, please mark your choice [for each study]. Consent Form for Use of Tissue for Research About Using Tissue and Blood for Research You are going to have or have had a biopsy to see if y ou have cancer. Your doctor will remove or has removed some body tissue to do some tests. The results of these tests will be given to you by your doctor and will be used to plan your care. We would like to keep some of the tissue that is left over for future research. If you agr ee, this tissue will be kept and may be used in research to learn more about cancer and other diseases. Please read the information sheet called \"How is Tissue Used for Resear ch\" to learn more about tissue research. This information sheet is available to all at the following web site: http://www.rtog.org/tissue% 20for%20research_patient.pdf In addition to the tumor tissue, we would like to collec t some blood for research. You will be asked to provide about 4 teaspoons of blood at each of the following time points: before SBRT and at 6 weeks after SBRT, at the same time you are having other tests requi red in the main part of this study. Your tissue and blood may be helpful for research whether you do or do not have cancer. The research that may be done with your tissue and blood is not designed specific ally to help you. It might help people who have cancer and other diseases in the future. Reports about research done with your tissue an d blood will not be given to you or your doctor. These reports will not be put in your health record. The resear ch will not have an effect on your care. Things to Think About The choice to let us keep the left over tissue and blood for future research is up to you. No matter what you decide to do, it will not affect your care or y our participation in the main part of the study. If you decide now that your tissue a nd blood can be kept for research, you can change your mind at any time. Just contact us and let us know that you do not want us to use your tissue and blood. Then any tissue that remains will no longer be used for research and will be re turned to the institution t hat submitted it and the blood will be destroyed. In the future, people who do research may need to know mo re about your health. While the doctor/institution may give them reports about your health, it will not give them your name, address, phone number, or any other information that will let the re searchers know who you are. Sometimes tissue and blood is used for genetic research (a bout diseases that are passed on in families). Even if your tissue is used for this kind of research, the result s will not be put in your healt h records. Your tissue and blood will be used only for research and will not be sold. The research done with your tissue and blood may help to develop new treatments for cancer in the future. Benefits The benefits of research using tissue and blood inclu de learning more about what causes cancer and other diseases, how to prevent them, and how to treat them. RTOG 0915 52 Risks The greatest risk to you is the release of information from your health records. We will do our best to make sure that your personal information will be kept private. The chance that this information will be given to someone else is very small. Making Your Choice Please read each sentence below and think about your choice . After reading each sentence, circle \"Yes\" or \"No\".
