The association between hepatitis B vaccination of male neonatesand parental report of autism diagnosis was determined. This cross-sectional study used weighted probability samples obtained from National Health Interview Survey 1997-2002 data sets. Vaccination status was determined from the vaccination record. Logistic regres-sion was used to estimate the odds for autism diagnosis associated with neonatal hepatitis B vaccination among boys age 3-17 years, born before 1999, adjusted for race, maternal edu- cation, and two-parent household. Boys vaccinated as neonates had threefold greater oddsfor autism diagnosis compared to boys never vaccinated or vaccinated after the rst month of life. Non-Hispanic white boys were 64% less likely to have autism diagnosis relative to nonwhite boys. Findings suggest that U.S. male neonates vaccinated with the hepatitis B vac-cine prior to 1999 (from vaccination record) had a threefold higher risk for parental report of autism diagnosis compared to boys not vaccinated as neonates during that same time period. Nonwhite boys bore a greater risk. Universal newborn immunization with the hepatitis B vaccination was recommendedin 1991 (CDC, 1991). A recent narrativereview concluded that hepatitis B vaccinesavailable since 1982 are safe and effective(Demirjian & Levy, 2009); however, safetyndings from individual studies are mixed.In Vaccine Safety Datalink studies, Lewis et al.(2001) reported no evidence of a signicantassociation between vaccination at birth andfever or neurological adverse events, Nalewayet al. (2009) found an elevated, althoughnot statistically signicant, risk of immunehemolytic anemia in children vaccinated with hepatitis B vaccine, and Price et al.

(2007) found no associationbetween time of hepatitis B vaccination, i.e.,within 24 hrs versus 2-4 days postnatally, and neurodevelopment delays at 6 months of age. In contrast, increased risk for central nervoussystem inflammatory demyelination in child-hood were associated with hepatitis B vaccina-tion (Mikaeloff et al., 2009). Further, hepatitisB vaccination has been associated with acuteear infection and pharyngitis, chronic arthritis(Fisher et al., 2001), and liver problems, suchas jaundice (Fisher & Eklund, [Goodman, Melody] At: 19:01 10 November 2010 1666 C. M. GALLAGHER AND M. S. GOODMAN elevated risk for receipt of early intervention or special education services (EIS) (Gallagher &Goodman, 2008), in population-representativesamples of U.S. children. Children with autismspectrum disorder (ASD) comprise a growingcaseload for EIS in the United States (Riceet al., 2004; Cavagnaro, 2009). A study ofincident ASD cases in California from 1990through 2006 identied an increase from 6.2to 42.5 per 10,000 births: a rise only par-tially explained by decreasing age at diagnosisand inclusion of milder cases (Hertz-Picciotto &Delwiche, 2009). Recurrent ear infections and pharyngi- tis were reported by parents of childrenwith developmental regression following eitherviral infection or immunization; the lattershowed abnormal proinflammatory responses (Jyonouchi et al., 2001). Data suggested that aberrant innate immune responses of autis-tic children might enhance susceptibility toadverse reactions to vaccines (Jyonouchi et al.,2001). During the rst 6 mo of life, theimmature innate immune response developsa balance between T helper (Th) 1 and Th2cytokines (Marodi, 2002). Th1-Th2 imbalanceswere also reported in autistic children (Guptaet al., 1998; Ashwood et al., 2006). Skewedcytokine production may result in or exac-erbate autoimmune disease (Hemdan et al.,2007). Studies reported circulating anti-brainautoantibodies in 30 to 70% of autism sub-jects (Ashwood & Van de Water, 2004). Singh(2009) cited evidence of brain myelin basicprotein autoantibodies in children with autismand suggested autoimmune autistic disorder(AAD) as a major subset of autism. Li et al.(2009) reported signicantly increased proin-flammatory cytokines with elevated Th1 /Th2 ratio in the brain tissue of patients with autism (Li et al., 2009). In vitro ndings showedincreased proinflammatory cytokine responsesin children with autism compared dysfunctional innate immune responsemight alter long-term neuroimmune develop-ment and contribute to autism pathophysiology(Enstrom et al., 2009). Boys have more than a fourfold risk for autism compared to girls (Fombonne, 2003).In previous studies, black race has been shown to be associated with increased risk for autism(Bhasin & Schendel, 2007; Croen et al., 2002;Hillman et al., 2000). In contrast, a recentnational study found that nonwhite childrenshowed decreased risk for autism diagnosis(Kogan et al., 2009). Black race has also beenassociated with later autism diagnosis (Mandellet al., 2009); thus, autism prevalence may havebeen underreported in younger black children.Higher maternal education level has been asso-ciated with greater likelihood of autism diagno-sis (Croen et al., 2002). Absence of one parentwas shown to be a risk factor for delay in vac-cination (Dombkowski et al., 2004), as wellas decreased risk for autism diagnosis (Koganet al., 2009). The relationship between hepatitis B vacci- nation during the rst month of life and autism, typically diagnosed at 3 years of age (Filipeket al., 2000), has not been evaluated using aprobability sample of U.S. children. The objec-tive of the current study was (1) to evaluatethe association between hepatitis B vaccinationof male neonates and autism diagnosis amongboys age 3 to 17 years of age born before 1999,and (2) to adjust for potentially confoundinginfluences of race /ethnicity, maternal educa- tion, and number of parents in household. Therationale for birth year restriction is to controlfor variations in exposures to vaccine mer-cury (Hg) content. In July 1999, the AmericanAcademy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the U.S.Public Health Service (USPHS) called for vac-cine manufacturers to eliminate or reduce theHg content of vaccines (AAP & USPHS, 1999).This action was, in large part, a response to theFood and Drug Administration (FDA) assess-ment that U.S. infants fully vaccinated during the rst 6 mo of life may have been exposed to cumulative Hg at levels exceeding U.S. EPAsafety recommendations (Ball et al., 2001). TheU.S. EPA recommended limit for methyl-Hgdietary intake is 0.1 \u00b5g/kg body weight /d (Ball et al., 2001). Applying this formula to a new-born with a normal birth weight of 3.0 kg,the safe Hg limit would be computed as 0.1\u00b5g/kg/d\u00d73.0 kg \u00d71d=0.3\u00b5g. The FDA November VACCINE, MALE NEONATES, AND AUTISM DIAGNOSIS 1667 thimerosal-containing hepatitis B vaccine (Ball et al., 2001). For a 1-day-old baby weighing 3.0kg, this represents more than 40 times the safelimit for dietary Hg intake. In the current study,it was postulated that among boys born before1999, there is a difference in the risk for autismdiagnosis among boys vaccinated with the hep-atitis B vaccination during the rst month of lifecompared to later- or never-vaccinated boys. METHODS The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) uses a complex sample design thatentails stratication, clustering, and multistagesampling methods and sampling weights togenerate a probability sample that is rep-resentative of the U.S. population (NCHS,2002a). Data were obtained from NHIS elec-tronic immunization and sample child les for1997 through 2002. Observations were lim-ited to children included in the immunizationle whose responsible household memberswere interviewed in their homes by trainedNHIS survey interviewers. and 13,611 in 2002. In order to conduct statistical analysis on the relevant subsamples in accordance with thecomplex survey design, SAS version 9.2 soft-ware was used to create domains stratied by gender, age group, and availability of the vac- cination record. The resulting domain, or sub-sample, of primary interest included boys ages3 through 17 years with a vaccination recordavailable; this domain was further restrictedto birth prior to 1999. Vaccination with thehepatitis B vaccine during the rst month oflife was determined by subtracting birth monthand year from the rst hepatitis B vaccina-tion month and year. Birth month and yearwas equal to vaccination month and year forobservations identied as having been vacci-nated as neonates. A dual blank for monthand year of vaccination was coded as no vac-cination if the NHIS interviewer counted atotal of zero hepatitis B vaccinations for thatindividual. Refusals to answer or responses of \"don't know,\" values not ascertained, or onlymonth or year but not both indicated werecoded as missing data. Either trained NHISinterviewers transcribed the vaccination datesdirectly from the vaccination record or thechild's responsible household member readfrom the record in a face-to-face interview withNHIS staff (NCHS, 2002b). Subjects vaccinatedduring the rst month of life were comparedto subjects never vaccinated with the hepati-tis B vaccine or vaccinated after the rst monthof life. The outcome variable was a dichotomous (yes/no) variable created in response to the following survey question and presentation ofa card with a choice of diagnoses: \"Lookingat this list, has a doctor or other professional ever told you that [sample child's name] had any of these conditions ... autism)?\" Refusals to answer, responses of \"don't know,\"and missing values were counted as missingdata. Non-Hispanic white race was dened bysurvey respondent reports of white race andnon-Hispanic ethnicity; all others were cat-egorized as nonwhite. T wo-parent householdwas also a dichotomous variable represent-ing survey respondent report of both parentsin the household; answers refused, unknown,or not ascertained were coded as missing;all other responses were coded as non-two-parent household. Maternal education was adichotomous variable representing respondentreport that the child's mother's educationalattainment was at least a high school diploma.Answers not known, refused, or not ascertainedwere coded as missing; all other responseswere coded as maternal education less thanhigh school completion. SAS version 9.2 was used to conduct multi- variable logistic regression analysis using NHISimmunization sample weights and Taylor serieslinearization methods, as recommended by theNational Center for Health Statistics for hypoth-esis testing of complex sample designs (NCHS,2002a). Analysis by domains yielded resultsstratied by gender. Values of pwere calcu- lated by SAS for the Wald chi-square At: 19:01 10 November 2010 1668 C. M. GALLAGHER AND M. S. GOODMAN RESULTS Unadjusted Findings There were in total 193 children with autism diagnosis and 79,690 without autismdiagnosis included in the parent sample, or arate of 2.42 per 1000 children (Table 1). Theratio of autistic boys to autistic girls was 5.43:1.In the total sample, 97% of children with anautism diagnosis were age 3 years and older.Sixty-one percent of children with an autismdiagnosis were non-Hispanic white, comparedto 60% of children without an autism diag-nosis; this difference in unweighted propor- tions was not statistically signicant. Sixty-one percent of children with an autism diagnosisand 68% of children without an autism diag-nosis lived in a two-parent household; thisdifference in proportions was statistically signi-cant. Among children with an autism diagnosis,85% of mothers were high school educated orhigher, compared to 79% of children withoutan autism diagnosis; this was also a statisticallysignicant difference. In the subsample limited to boys 3 to 17 years of age with a vaccination record,and whose rst vaccinations were receivedbefore 1999, autism prevalence was greater,4.32 per 1000 boys (Table 2a). There wereno statistically signicant differences betweenthe unweighted proportions of boys withand without autism diagnosis, by race, two-parent household, or maternal education. Boysvaccinated with the hepatitis B vaccine dur- ing the rst month of life comprised 29%of children with autism diagnosis (9 of 31),and 17% of children without autism diag-nosis (1258 of 7368). whitechildren comprised 48% of children withautism diagnosis and 59% of children with-out autism diagnosis. Of the nine children withautism diagnosis who were vaccinated dur-ing the rst month of life, four were white,three were black, one was American Indian,and one was of other /multiple ethnic origin; none were Asian (Table 2b). Fifty-eight per-cent of children with autism diagnosis livedin a two-parent household, compared to 71%of children without autism. The proportionsof children of mothers with at least a highschool education were similar between sub- groups with (75%) and without (78%) autism diagnosis. Univariate logistic regression using sample weights showed that boys who received therst hepatitis B dose during the rst monthof life had 2.82-fold greater odds for autismdiagnosis (Table 2a). Non-Hispanic white boyswere at 59% lower odds for autism diagnosiscompared to nonwhite boys. Boys from two-parent households were at 66% lower odds forautism diagnosis relative to boys from house-holds without two parents. Having a motherwith at least a high school education was notstatistically associated with odds for autismdiagnosis. TABLE 1.

The conver- gence criterion was satised for all models, thusproviding no indication to question the validityof model t. DISCUSSION Results support the hypothesis that, among boys born before 1999, there is a differ-ence in the OR for autism diagnosis in boysvaccinated with the hepatitis B vaccinationduring the rst month of life compared tolater- or never-vaccinated boys. Our nding ofincreased risk for autism diagnosis among maleneonates vaccinated with the hepatitis B vac-cine is novel. It was previously shown, however,that vaccination with the triple series hep-atitis B vaccine was associated with elevatedrisk of developmental disability, using receiptof early intervention or special education ser-vices (EIS) as a surrogate measure (Gallagher& Goodman, 2008). Of note, both of these U.S. probability sample-based studies demon- strated a paradoxically protective effect amonggirls. In the current study, however, there wereonly nine observations with autism diagnosiswho were female\u2014a likely contributing fac-tor to the insignicant results, and results wereborderline signicant. In light of this paradoxand small sample size, larger epidemiologicalstudies stratied by gender are merited. In response to previously reported ndings of an association between hepatitis B vac-cination and liver problems using the NHISdatabase (Fisher & Eklund 1999), Evans and London (1999) suggested testing for speci-city of exposure-disease association. In otherwords, might hepatitis-B vaccinated childrenalso show greater OR for health problemsother than autism? Similarly, van Damme et al.(2000) suggested that selection bias might playa role because parents of children diagnosedwith a medical condition would be more likelyto seek medical advice and preventive carefor their child. First, to test for disease speci- city of the outcome affected by the expo- sure, parental report of any one or more ofa group of outcomes with no known rela-tion to autism, autoimmunity, or vaccines\u2014i.e., congenital heart for autism diagnosis in the multi-variate logistic regression model; null effectswere found. Specicity of the exposure wasalso tested by separately substituting the vari-cella and measles-mumps-rubella vaccinationsfor the neonatal hepatitis B vaccination in themodel for autism; again, signicant associationswere absent. Further, absence of a two-parenthousehold was reported as a risk factor fordelayed vaccination (Dombkowski et al. 2004).Therefore, to address potential confoundingbias attributable to the possibility that chil-dren in two-parent households would be morelikely to seek and receive both early vaccinationand developmental evaluation, multivariable analysis adjusted for this factor. In the cur- rent however, a two-parent householdDownloaded By: [Goodman, Melody] 19:01 10 November B VACCINE, MALE NEONATES, AND AUTISM DIAGNOSIS 1671 was protective against autism diagnosis. These ndings provide evidence against selectionbias associated with medical attention-seekingbehavior. Because the current study's sample repre- sents infants born prior to the manufacture ofthimerosal-free vaccines, questions are raisedregarding the possible adverse affects of thevaccine preservative thimerosal. Of note, therelationship between neonatal hepatitis B vac-cination and autism diagnosis among boys wasalso examined without restricting birth yearto before 1999, and it was found that theassociation became marginally signicant, andattenuated. There was one observation withautism diagnosis born in the later period, andthis single observation was unvaccinated duringthe neonatal period. Thus, there is insufcient sample size to evaluate vaccination exposure before and after the availability of thimerosal-free vaccines. There are contradictory ndings reported in the literature regarding associations betweenHg exposure and autism. Although an autismcase-control study examined Hg-inducedautoimmunity, as indicated by antibodies tometallothionein, a metal-detoxifying protein,and found no signicant difference (Singh &Hanson 2006), a prospective study of U.S.children aged 2 to 16 years found associationsbetween autism and biomarkers of Hg toxi-city, i.e., urinary porphyrins (Geier & Geier,2007). Young et al. found associationsbetween neurodevelopmental disorders andincreased exposures to thimerosal-containingvaccines (TCV), yet this study was limited by itsecological design. On the other hand, a recentVaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) study reportedno association between TCV , including the hepatitis birth dose, and autism (Price et al., 2010), supporting the ndings of an earlierVSD study (Verstraeten et al., 2003). ThePrice et al. (2010) study assumed clerical errorfor records with the same vaccinations givenwithin 15 days of the rst hepatitis B dosereceived during the 1st month of life andwithin 30 days of Hib, DTP , DTaP vaccinereceipt, and so, excluded duplicate exposures(Price et al., 2009). Mell et al. (2005), however,found that 11.6% of VSD children had an extra immunization and, in a study using the1997 NHIS, Feikema et al. (2000) reported anextraimmunization rate of 21% of U.S. chil-dren, with a rate of 4.9% for extraimmunizationwith the hepatitis B vaccine. Additionally, theauthors of the earlier VSD study acknowledgedthat neonatal hepatitis B vaccination dosemight have been incompletely ascertained(Verstraeten et al., 2003). Therefore, it ispossible, although uncertain, that exposuremisclassication might have biased results ofboth VSD studies toward the null. The Instituteof Medicine (IOM, 2004) concluded that thereis no causal association between TCV andautism based upon reviews of the Verstraetenet al. (2003) study, as well as cohort studiesfrom the United Kingdom, Denmark, and Sweden, countries without recommendations for universal newborn hepatitis B vaccination(EUVAC.net, 2010). Each of the previousstudies has a unique set of advantages andlimitations. A major limitation of the currentstudy is that, due to study design, it was notpossible to test specic hypotheses regardingthe risk attributable to specic vaccine com-ponent exposures (e.g., thimerosal, aluminumadjuvant, yeast protein, or the vaccine antigenitself). Our nding suggests an association;however, a large-scale, case-control study oftwo U.S. birth cohorts, i.e., one of childrenborn before 1999, and the other of childrenborn during or after 2003, when the last lot ofTCV expired (CDC 2009), would be necessaryto compare birth cohorts with and withoutthimerosal-containing hepatitis B vaccineexposure. Another notable nding is the decreased OR for autism diagnosis among non-Hispanic white children compared to nonwhite children. Although consistent with ndings in California(Croen et al., 2002), Atlanta, GA (Bhasin &Schendel 2007), and Missouri (Hillman et al.,2000), this racial disparity was not found inour previous study (Gallagher & Goodman,2008), likely due to issues of access to EISamong some nonwhite populations (Baileyet al., 2004). Further, Kogan et autism Melody] At: 19:01 10 November 2010 1672 M. GALLAGHER AND M. S. GOODMAN among nonwhite children; however, results were not limited to boys. African-Americanmale neonates are at increased risk for glucose-6-phosphate hyperbilirubinemia (Kaplan et al.,2004), and hyperbilirubinemia has been asso-ciated with an almost fourfold risk of infan-tile autism (Maimburg et al. 2008); however,the relation between G-6-PD deciency andautism is uncertain and merits further research.Because greater hepatitis B surface antigenprevalence was found among pregnant Asianwomen in the United States compared toother race /ethnic groups (Euler et al. 2003), it is plausible that Asian neonates are morelikely to have been vaccinated at birth; how-ever, in this U.S. probability sample, none ofthe male children of Asian ethnicity vacci- nated as neonates reported an autism diagnosis (Table 2b). A limitation is that data were not avail- able on emerging autism risk factors, e.g.,familial history of an autoimmune disorder(Sweeten et al., 2003; Molloy et al., 2006);aberrant metabolic function, e.g., impairedmethylation (James et al., 2004), porphyrinbiomarkers of metal inhibition of the hemesynthesis pathway (Austin & Shandley, 2008;Nataf et al., 2006; Geier & Geier, 2007), earlyantibiotic use (Adams et al., 2007); geneticvariants among subjects of ancestry(Wang 2008). Epidemiological asso-ciations may reflect common susceptibilitiesrather than causation; however, research thatinvestigates the relationships between theserisk factors, hepatitis B vaccination, and autism may increase our understanding of the etiology of this otherwise idiopathic disorder. Further,a review of the evidence suggests that inter-actions among multiple factors may result inpostnatal neuronal damage and autism in sus-ceptible children (Kern & Jones, 2006), ratherthan any one single factor. In the current study, analysis was limited to children with a vaccination record in orderto minimize parent recall bias, as the vac- cination record is more reliable than parentrecall for individual vaccines (Bolton et al.,1998). On the other hand, parent report ofautism diagnosis may be subject to case ascer-tainment bias, as diagnosis was not medicallyconrmed. Consequently, no data was avail-able to differentiate specic autism spectrumdiagnoses such as Asperger syndrome fromlow-functioning autism, or phenotypes suchas autoimmune autistic disorder (Singh 2009),delays-plus-regression autism (Ozonoff et al.2005), and autism-epilepsy (Tuchman et al.2009). The autism diagnosis prevalence rate of2.42 per 1000 children in the NHIS immuniza-tion sample is less than the Morbidity Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR ) surveillance summary reported average rate for ASD among 8-year- olds in 2000: 6.7 per 1000 per children, with a range of 4.5 to 9.9, for 6 sites in the UnitedStates; sites included metropolitan areas (Rice,2007) where children may have had greateraccess to autism diagnostic evaluation services.Differences between parental report of autismdiagnosis versus records abstraction, sampleage ranges, and use of a national probabil-ity versus a multisite sample likely contributeto this discrepancy. Further, the MMWR cited recent \"best estimates\" of between 2.0 and 6.0autism cases per 1000 children (Rice, 2007),and the NHIS immunization le rate is withinthis range, as is the autism diagnosis rate amongthis study's subsample of boys 3 to 17 yearsof age (4.32 per 1000 boys). In the currentstudy, a greater proportion of children with-out autism diagnosis had vaccination records.Because observations without a vaccinationrecord were excluded, autism diagnosis preva-lence may be underestimated. The percentage of mothers with at least a high school diploma dropped from 85% in the autism subgroup ofthe parent NHIS immunization sample to 75%in the subsample. Lower maternal educationlevel has been associated with greater likeli-hood of having a vaccination record at home(Suarez et al., 1997); thus, the effect of mater-nal education may have been underestimated.Incomplete and missing data may introduceDownloaded By: [Goodman, Melody] At: 19:01 10 November 2010 HEPATITIS B VACCINE, MALE NEONATES, AND AUTISM DIAGNOSIS 1673 bias in the analysis and is a notable limita- tion of the current study. Further, there may beunmeasured confounders associated with miss-ing vaccination data or possible cohort effects,such as birth prior to /after universal hepatitis B recommendation; small sample size, however,precluded further stratied assessments. The ratio of ASD boys to ASD girls in the NHIS sample was 5.43:1, quantitatively higherthan a previously reported estimate of 4.3:1(Fombonne, 2003). Most children with a diag-nosis of ASD were older than 3 years of age\u2014anding consistent with the literature (Filipeket al., 2000). Overall, our descriptive ndingsshow consistencies with previous reports. As with all cross-sectional secondary data analyses, causality cannot be determined, andthis study is subject to bias from unmeasured or uncontrolled confounding factors. Despite these limitations, the results of the study indi-cate that U.S. male neonates vaccinated withthe hepatitis B vaccine prior to 1999 incurreda threefold greater risk for autism diagnosis.Nonwhite boys bore a disproportionate bur-den. In light of the dearth of large-scale studiesthat evaluate the long-term risks of neona-tal hepatitis B vaccination, and recent ndingsof uncertain long-term protection against thehepatitis B virus among children vaccinatedat birth (Giambi et al., 2008; Bialek et al.,2008), risk-benet analysis may shed additionalinsights. Our ndings do not suggest that therisks of autism outweigh the benets of vacci-nation; however, future research into hepatitisB vaccination scheduling is warranted.
