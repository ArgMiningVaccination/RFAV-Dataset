Some of my newer patients have some misunderstandings about what traditional chiropractic is. However, because of its powerful relieving and healing qualities, it is often a highly recommended protocol in my clinic. In fact, once you discover the powerful relief and renewed strength you recur or from a gentle and professional chiropractic adjustment, I am certain you will make it a cornerstone of your health care approach. Once my patients realize the approach I take to adjusting, two things happen: first, they cannot believe how simple, painless, and relieving the adjustment is. Second, they go through the next several days or weeks in far less pain, discovering that the chiropractic adjustment is exactly what they need for greater energy and flexibility in every area of their lives. Primarily, my style of adjustment is gentle. New patients often comment that I use zero force. My focus is to hold your spine in a pose that you would consider to be a gentle and natural stretch. Then, with seemingly zero force, I direct your pose to an angle at which the fixated joint may be relieved. Joints which you would never be able to open and relieve on your own are opened with little to zero pressure. I use appropriate poses and light pressures to open your spine. I can't say it enough. The relief from traditional chiropractic is often the greatest relief a patient can find. Often a traditional chiropractic adjustment changes lives. "}
