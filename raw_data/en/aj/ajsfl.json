The impact of the industrial revolution on European cities is also discussed. Cities are examined as sites of social conflict - whether in the form of contestation from below, in the form of revolution, or efforts to control the population from above - through urban planning, reform, and policing. Different efforts to re-imagine cities as places devoid of social conflict are compared. We dwell in particular on the Modernist model which became particularly widespread after the Second World War, in connection with the postwar economic boom. The Cold War also left its mark on the European urban landscape: urban planning problems and strategies in various Eastern Bloc states are considered, as is the divided city of Berlin.
