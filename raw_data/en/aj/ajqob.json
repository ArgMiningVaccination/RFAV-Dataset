Throughout the workshop, you will be laying down comfortably, and Jenny will guide you through active breathwork, followed by sound healing. The sound frequencies of your breath, and the sound vibrations of various instruments will resonate in your physical body, working on a molecular level to heal and calm you, physically, mentally, and emotionally.This is an experience where you get to fully relax, de-stress, and allow your own breath, and the sound frequencies to help you balance your Chakras, and reach higher states of consciousness. The frequencies of the sound vibrations will interact with your mind and body on a cellular level bringing back balance to your mind, body, and soul.This sound healing can be described as a musically meditative experience where you will bathe in the ancient sounds of the Gong, Crystal Singing Bowls, Tibetan bowls, Koshi Chimes, rattles, and other instruments, plus some light projectors.
