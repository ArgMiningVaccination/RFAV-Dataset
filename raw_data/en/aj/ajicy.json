Situation becomes more complex by the fact that around 70% of Indian population lives in rural areas known for limited access to healthcare. The primary providers of healthcare in these areas are private clinics and hospitals, though there is a presence of Government funded public health services. While government has undertaken multiple initiatives to address the concern for service delivery and access to healthcare, there are still substantial gaps to be addressed for better healthcare infrastructure, access and its equity based distribution. At this outset, government realizes that effective health resource management, allocation and monitoring based on evidence for timely achievements of goals. There is need of comprehensive picture of Indian healthcare sector to address aforesaid challenges and provide accessible, acceptable, affordable, equity based and patient centered quality healthcare services for the community. There are constraints on public health resources therefore, it is essential to allocate resources based on real world data and do regular monitoring and impact assessment of the allocated resources. Recognizing the role of private health sector in Indian settings and its potential to supplement government initiatives and planning for public health resources, it has been felt to obtain reliable information on private sector healthcare resource deployment. This will also underpin government strategies to hitherto unreached segments of the population, where public health resources are constrained, potential to tie up with private sector can be explored for better service delivery. For resource constraint country such as India, having comprehensive information on both public and private health sector is prerequisite for planning resource allocation. Generation and adoption of such evidence will help in driving judicious health resource planning and allocation to reduce the disparities and inequities in all three dimensions to achieve the Universal Health Coverage. CBHI is committed to build an integrated health informatics platform which can provide reliable, accurate and relevant national health information and enable evidence based policy formulation and decision making. In line with the core strategies of generating evidence to facilitate rational planning and resource allocation, CBHI has embarked on an ambitious project to exhaustively map the healthcare establishments from both public and private sector, as one of its key initiatives. CBHI now envisages setting up of consolidated platform of healthcare resource information named National Health Resource Repository (NHRR) to fulfill its core objective & intends to develop a single source of healthcare resource information that contains information on healthcare resources of both public and private sector in the country. Acknowledging the relevance of evidence based health resource planning, CBHI in consultation with DGHS conducted a pilot study of the concept in 2014 to test the feasibility of the concept called NHRR. A street-by- street census was conducted to collect and comprehensively map 2098 public and private health facilities across four districts on 22nd September, 2015, recognizing the relevance of data as a navigating module for planning public health services, Shri.J P Nadda, Hon'ble Union Minister of Health & FW, announced the nation wise roll out of National Health Resource Repository. Vision Creating a robust, standardized and secured information technology enabled repository of country's healthcare resources befitting as a building block into country's long term strategy of digitalizing healthcare to strengthen evidence based decision making.292 National Health Profile 2018Goal NHRR envisages creating a single gateway of authentic, standardized, updated public and private healthcare resource intelligence and develop user friendly system with utility to serve as a decision making tool for varied categories of health system stakeholders.ObjectivesIt has been mandated to achieve the following objectives Promote evidence based planning and decision making in healthcare sector through provision of comprehensive data on healthcare resources (both public and private sector) in the country. Provide visibility of private sector healthcare resources to facilitate public private partnership initiatives for improve access and availability of health services Provide technology based solutions to improve efficiency of health systems by improving planning, provisioning of healthcare resources Improve informed decision making and community awareness by allowing access to holistic information on healthcare resources. Promote meaningful use of data collection and exchange services for better healthcare management by providing a common platform for sharing information. Promote convergence between similar programmes by providing interoperability Enhance effectiveness of programme planning and implementation at centre, state and district level by providing updated healthcare resource status. Provide a platform for managing emergencies effectively by providing information on all the healthcare resources (public & private) in the designated geography. Furnish standardized data, distribution of resources and trends on the global platform, using regularly updated health status indicators. Rationale from NHRR Stakeholders and users perspectivesDecision making in the healthcare sector is highly complex and have different levels ranges from single patient to country's policy makers at large. Stakeholders in health system range from single patient, community, providers, professional bodies, health Councils, various professional bodies, State, Central government and various development agencies etc It was comprehended that envisaged NHRR should be able to cater the requirements of all stakeholders. Considering relevance and classification of data to be captured under NHRR, all stakeholders can be divided into four categories- Policy Makers, National & State Programme Managers, community and Private Providers. NHRR aims to support decision making of all these stakeholders by providing reliable information, thereby, catering to the unmet needs of these stakeholders. Needs of Policy Makers: It is important that larger policy decisions are taken based on latest and reliable information on the available healthcare resources, their deployment and trends that can address entrenched problem of health system with real time solutions. To aid this, health policy and system planning must be demand-driven, and satisfy the needs of modern healthcare systems utilizing up-do-date information on country's healthcare resources. 293 National Health Profile 2018Needs of National and State Programme Managers Program planning involves identifying and projecting most critical needs of the different programme and community and by analyzing their existing ability to address those requirements. National and State Programme Managers draw their implementation plan keeping in consideration the gap analysis and priorities, presenting the case to higher -ups, executing the plan and evaluating the outcome of the efforts, and reporting that outcome back to partners, stakeholders, and to policy makers. Needs of Community: Community is a major stakeholder in the healthcare system where all the planning, decisions, services and provisions get concentrated, and eventually are the beneficiary of healthcare services and related interventions. In the current scenario, it is widely advocated that role of the community should not only be limited to recipient of services but it should also have community participation in decision making. Community decision making primarily involves decision making at two level; individual level and community at large. Information on availability, and affordability of health services influence access to health services. Needs of Private Providers: Private providers constitute a significant part of the health system in India which ranges from single providers to corporate hospitals. Private provider behavior is influenced by the interplay of policy-makers who set policy, enact legislation and enforce regulations. Similarly, it is also affected by purchasing power of populations and providers' experience, skills and motivations to deal with patient, government and their competitor. However, focusing on coverage, quality, cost, along with policy-makers, providers and people, serves as a helpful aide-memoire for private providers to organize their service better and eventually leading to service improvement. Data Variables Over 850 variables have been identified from extensive literature review of Indian Public Health Standard Guidelines (IPHS), individual national programme operational guidelines And National Quality Asuurance Guidelines for public health facilities. A Census at national level for health resource enumeration will be carried out to obtain data from all public and private health facilities of 29 States and 7 Union Territories, concurrently, and mapping all healthcare establishments in all the districts across the country. All the public health facilities including District Hospitals, Sub-Divisional Hospital, Taluka-Community Health Centre, Primary Health Centre, Sub Centre, other government hospitals and private hospitals , private doctors, diagnostic labs and chemists present nationwide shall be covered in the Census.294 National Health Profile 2018WHO Collaborating Centers for the Family of International Classifications (ICD-10, ICF & ICHI) In the World and India WHO works with a network of Collaborating Centers to develop, disseminate, implement and update the WHO Family of International Classifications to support national and international health information systems, statistics and evidence. The Collaborating Centers have been established to assist WHO and users with the development and implementation of WHO-Family of International Classifications.
