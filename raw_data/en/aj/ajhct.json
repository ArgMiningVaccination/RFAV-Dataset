[[1]](#1) They recommended physicians providing care for young children and women of childbearing age to inquire as to the frequency and species of fish consumed, and to measure blood mercury in individuals at risk of elevated blood mercury. There is a recent report of acute generalized dermatitis, abnormal liver function, and elevated blood mercury level (187 nmol/L) associated with Chinese herbal medicine used for rheumatism by an 80-year-old Chinese patient. [[2]](#2) The elevated blood mercury level returned to normal range upon discontinuation of Chinese herbal medicine, while his diet remained unchanged. In the traditional Chinese medicine, Chinese herbal medicine, besides herbs, contains animal products and minerals. [[3]](#3) The minerals include two mercurials, Zhu-Sha/Cinnabar (red mercuric bring longevity, to various poisonous conditions. [[4]](#4) Mercury as adulterant or contaminant in Chinese patent medicines of herbal origin has been well documented. [[4-6]](#4) The BC Medical Journal [[1]](#1) and a review article [[7]](#7) listed the various sources of mercury. They do not include Chinese herbal medicine or Chinese patent medicines of herbal origin. About 12% of the US population used herbal medicine in 1997, a 380% increase from 1990. [[8]](#8) Chinese herbal medicine and Chinese patent medicine, purchased in local Chinese herbal shops, are used increasingly by Chinese and other Asians, and by Caucasians as well. [[9]](#9) Allergic and adverse reactions have been reported in both Chinese and Caucasian patients seen locally. [[2,10-13]](#2) It is important for physicians to ask all patients about their use of complementary and alternative medicine. Blood mercury measurements should be considered in patients with dermatological, neurological, or renal abnormality [[2]](#2) who are taking Chinese herbal medicine or Chinese patent medicine. \u2014H.C.

Above is the information needed to cite this article in your paper or presentation. The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) recommends the following citation style, which is the now nearly universally accepted citation style for scientific papers: Halpern SD, Ubel PA, Caplan AL, Marion DW, Palmer AM, Schiding JK, et al. Solid-organ transplantation in HIV-infected patients. N Engl J Med. 2002;347:284-7. About the ICMJE and citation styles The ICMJE is small group of editors of general medical journals who first met informally in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 1978 to establish guidelines for the format of manuscripts submitted to their journals. The group became known as the Vancouver Group. Its requirements for manuscripts, including formats for bibliographic references developed by the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM), were first published in 1979. The Vancouver Group expanded and evolved into the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), which meets annually. The ICMJE created the [Recommendations for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing, and Publication of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals ](http://www.icmje.org) to help authors and editors create and distribute accurate, clear, easily accessible reports of biomedical studies. An alternate version of ICMJE style is to additionally list the month an issue number, but since most journals use continuous pagination, the shorter form provides sufficient information to locate the reference. The NLM now lists all authors. BCMJ standard citation style is a slight modification of the ICMJE/NLM style, as follows: - Only the first three authors are listed, followed by \"et al.\" - There is no period after the journal name. - Page numbers are not abbreviated.
