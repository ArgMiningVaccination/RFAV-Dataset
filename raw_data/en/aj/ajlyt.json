Robert Galvin, MD, MPH, MBA Commissioner, Connecticut Department of Public Health Hartford, Connecticut Autism: Myth, Legend & Science Leo Kanner: 1943 paper \"Autistic Disturbances of Affective Contact\" Modern Study of Autism Hans Asperger: 1944 paper \"Autistic Psychopathy\" What is Autism? Autism is a complex developmental disability that causes problems with social interaction and communication. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention Different people with autism can have very different symptoms. Symptoms usually start before age three and can cause delays or problems in many different skills that develop from infancy to adulthood. Health care providers think of autism as a \"spectrum\" disorder, a group of disorders with similar features. For example, one person may exhibit mild symptoms, while another may show more serious symptoms. But they both have an autism spectrum disorder. Autism: Just the facts Autism affects one in every 150 newborns. University of Arizona, 2010 By 2015, an estimated 500,000 U. S. residents will be affected. Males predominate classic autism by 4:3 ratio. Males predominate the spectrum by up to a 14:1 ratio. Every person diagnosed with an Autism Spectrum Disease is different. Is disease without an obvious cause, creating wild and bizarre speculation. Autism may be treated , but not cured . Burell Autism Center What is \"the spectrum?\" Symptoms of autism The main signs and symptoms of autism involve problems in the following areas: Centers for Disease Control & Prevention Routines or repetitive behaviors (also called stereotyped behaviors) - such as repeating words or actions, obsessively following routines or schedules, and playing in repetitive ways Social - such as sharing emotions, understanding how others think and feel, and holding a conversation Communication - both verbal (spoken) and non-verbal (unspoken, such as pointing, eye contact, and smiling) Ends of the spectrum: Classic autism Rain Man (1988) Ends of the spectrum: Asperger's Syndrome Parenthood (2010) Successful people on the spectrum Nobel Prize Laureate Vernon Smith, Ph.D. Actress Daryl Hannah Pokemon creator Satoshi Tajiri Comedian/Actor Dan Aykroyd Academy Award winning director/producer Steven Spielberg Legend: Some historic figures exhibited behaviors consistent with autistic spectrum Lumrix.net/medial/autism Sir Isaac Newton Emily Dickenson Andy Warhol Albert Einstein W. B Yeats Charles Darwin Diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders (including Asperger's Syndrome) Is both clinical and syndromic. National Institute for Mental Health STAGE 2: Comprehensive Diagnostic Evaluation with a multidisciplinary team. Neurologic and genetic assessment, along with in-depth cognitive and language testing. Measures developed specifically for diagnosing autism are often used. STAGE 1: Developmental screenings begin with well- child checkups. More sensitive diagnostic screenings may be recommended, such as CHAT, M-CHAT, STAT, or SCQ. Protocol only recently codified, despite increasing numbers of people seeking treatment since 1960. Before the dawn of modern science... Coping with what humans could not understand often meant placing blame for unsociable behavior on: Beware of crackpots promising cure-alls, and spouting conspiracy theories... Even in an advanced scientific environment... Such behavior resulted in social marginalization, or perhaps death. Displeased god(s) Witchcraft or demonic possession Unsubstantiated cause of autism: cold parenting (refrigerator mother) Postulated by Kanner, popularized by Bruno Bettelheim. Expressed the belief that parents should not be involved with the therapy of autistic children as it would lead to parental guilt. Theory debunked by the work of Dr. Bernard Rimland and others. Lumrix.net/medial/autism By the mid-1970's, the \"refrigerator mother\" fell out of fashion. Unsubstantiated cause of autism: vaccines 1998 article in The Lancet by Dr. Andrew Wakefield postulated that MMR vaccines caused higher rates of autism. Anti-vaccination groups formed, including one lead by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., have claimed a government cover-up of vaccine induced autism. Created worldwide panic about the mercury-based preservative thimerisol (never in MMR vaccine). Study could not be replicated, encompassed just 12 children and was financed by lawyers intending to file lawsuits against vaccine manufacturers. Unsubstantiated cause of autism: vaccines In February 2010, the British Medical Council ruled that Wakefield acted \"dishonestly and irresponsibly.\" \"(Wakefield's) improbable sequences of cause and effect were outclassed in every request by the impressive assembly of true experts in their respective field,\" said Legal Special Master Denise Vowell. Wakefield was forced to resign from his U. S. Institute that was the vehicle for promoting his disproved theories. Editors of The Lancet retracted the paper. Scientifically unsupported treatments for autism Secretin More scientific studies required for these treatments: Hyperbaric oxygen therapy Gluten-free/casein-free diet (not recommended by AAP) Association for Science in Autism Treatment Vitamin & supplemental therapy Iridology Vision therapy Chelation therapy Treatment plans for autism should be individualized in consultation with a multidisciplinary team of family members and licensed, experienced care providers and educators, making use of scientifically proven methods for improvement of the condition. The Science of Autism National Institutes of Health So what REALLY causes autism? No single cause has been identified. Autism Society of America No single \"trigger\" that causes autism to develop. Finding the cause of autism must be based upon scientifically valid investigation and research. May be a series of events. Among the causes being investigated: Viral infections Environmental Metabolic disorders, such a PKU Genetics Genetics & Genomics Genetics is the study of inheritance, or the way traits are passed down from one generation to another. Genes carry the instructions for making proteins, which in turn direct the activities of cells and functions of the body that influence traits such as hair and eye color. Genomics is a newer term that describes the study of all the genes in a person, as well as interactions of those genes with each other and with that person's environment. Key advances in genomic technologies are transforming all areas of human genetics. Genetics and genomics are both considered opportunities (and challenges) for autism research. What is a gene? A gene is a DNA sequence that contains the coding for making a particular protein. Introduction to Genomics: The Human Genome, Sharon Kardia, Ph.D., University of Michigan, 2004 Some of the DNA sequence of a gene helps regulate the expression of the gene in our cells. The average gene is ~3000 bases long. Genes are located on Chromosomes There are 45 bands on Chromosome 5 Chromosome 5 contains 1005 genes Chromosome 5 is ~181,000,000 bases long Genes are referred to by their chromosomal location The MCC gene is located at 5q21 MCC is a tumor suppressor gene for colon cancer Introduction to Genomics: The Human Genome, Sharon Kardia, Ph.D., University of Michigan, 2004 Chromosomes are highly condensed DNA A chromosome is a single, very long piece of DNA Each chromosome is replicated and supercoils before cell division Introduction to Genomics: The Human Genome, Sharon Kardia, Ph.D., University of Michigan, 2004 Autism: The genetics Genetic architecture of autism is complex, and not yet fully known. No single gene has been identified as the \"autism\" gene. Strongest finding for a genetic basis for autism: Identical twins: If one is diagnosed autistic, the other has a 70%-90% chance of also being autistic. Fraternal twins: Less than a 10% chance of the second twin being diagnosed with autism. (www.autismgenome.org) Large-scale, collaborative genetics research project that aims to identify autism susceptibility genes. The Autism Genome Project The identification of autism risk factors requires large samples of well characterized individuals, and strong scientific cooperation between clinical and laboratory researchers. Includes researchers from the US, Canada, UK, Portugal, Italy, Ireland, France and Germany. Autism & Schizophrenia: Genetically Linked? Medicalnewstoday.com, March 2010 Shute, Mary, U. S. News & World Report, March 2008 University of Leeds : Genetic studies so far are suggesting a common cause for both schizophrenia and autism (2010). National Institute of Mental Health : brains of children with early-onset schizophrenia are much larger than normal in the first few years of life, for instance. Children with autism also have an unusual amount of brain growth before age 3. NIMH found two places where variations in genes tended to cluster in people with schizophrenia were also more common in people with autism (2008). - Karl Taro Greenfield, Boy Alone: A Brother's Memoir , HarperCollins, 2009 \"A boy sits by himself on a stained white carpet, the corner of a frayed blanket stuffed into his mouth, his head bobbing, the fingers of both hands twiddling at ear level. He seems neither to miss company nor show any eagerness to seek it. If you say hello, he will not look at you nor turn in the direction of your voice. If you take up position in his line of sight, he will look away.\" J.
