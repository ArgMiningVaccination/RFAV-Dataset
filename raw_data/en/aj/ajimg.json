Roll Call/Minutes Approval/Staff Report The meeting was called to order at 8:30 am and roll was called. Minutes from the March 10, 2016 VbBS meeting were reviewed and approved . Smits introduced the May er rata; there were no discussion . It was announced that t he implementation of the new back l ines will take place July 1, 201 6. Saboe gave comments regarding chiropractic providers having rehabilitative services within their scope of practice. Taray has communicated this with H ealth System s Division (HSD) as this is not a Prioritized List issue, but is an administrative /credentialing issue. Gingerich and Peck provided a demonstration of t he Searchable Prioritized List, which is currently avail able at the HERC website. Any input from users and the public about errors or ways to improve this product are welcome and should be sent to HERC staff. Nathan Roberts from HSD provided a demonstration of how to search the \"other\" lists at HSD, such as di agnostic services, non -covered services, etc. This allows providers and plans and the public to find ICD -10 and CPT codes which are not included on the Prioritized List. To get to the page, search for \"Oregon Health Plan Medical Surgical Lists.\" Value -based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes , 5/19/2016 Page 4 Coffman asked Susan Williams if she was willing to serve as Vice Chair , since she has essentially been serving in that role recently in Kevin Olson's absence .

CARRIES 6-0. Topic: Biennial Review , Tension and Migraine Headaches Discussion: Smits presented the summary document regarding prioritization of tension headaches. There was no discussion, and the subcommittee agreed with the staff recommendation to make no change. Recommended Actions: 1) No changes to the migraine or tension headach e line prioritization MOTION: To recommend no changes . CARRIES 6-0. Value -based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes , 5/19/2016 Page 7 Topic: Biennial Review , Severe Insomnia in Young Children Discussion: Smits introduced the summary document on this topic. Hodges requested clarification that staff do not recommend medications for treatment of young children with insomnia; Smits stated this was true. Testimony was heard from four members of the Early Childhood Advisory Committee of HSD. Laurie Theodorou testified to the barrier seen with lack of access to care for families with severe sleep disorders. She requested coverage of insomnia for children 6 months through 3-years old. She testified that severe infant/toddler sleep disorders affects bonding with parents, learning, daily functioning and raises the risk of ab use. She stated that there was a large body of research on what is a normal, he althy amount of sleep by age. She noted that e ffective interventions are available for this condition . Sherry Aldermann, MD, a child development pediatrician , testified that sleep issues disturb brain development in early childhood. Sleep problems cause parental emotional withdrawal, other parenting problems and , at times , physical abuse and neglect. Effective interventions exist that can allow healthy social emotional development . Sandra Raven, parent and member of Children's System Advisory Committee , gave testimony about her own experience with severe sleep problems in h er child. Karie Drynen , mental health provider , gave testimony about her own experience with a sleep disturbed child. She noted the b ehavior al issues due to lack of sleep and the h igh risk of child abuse in these children . Parental depression, suicidal beh avior, and even psychosis can result from parental lack of sleep. The subcommittee discussed whether there was any evidence that intervention s to improve the sleep issues could reduce the risk of the child eventually developing behavioral or psychiatric conditions. Smits and the experts noted that the literature shows a correlation between ADHD, autism, developmental delay, depression and anxiety being diagnosed later in these children; however, no evidence was identified about whether treatment reduces the risk of developing these conditions. The experts will attempt to find literature that addresses this question. The subcommittee discussed whether medications should be used in this group. Smits and Alderman indicated that the evidence and expert recom mendations do not recommend use of medications for sleep in children 3 and under. Subcommittee members requested that the proposed guideline have wording added explicitly stating that medications were not covered on the proposed new line. The scoring of the proposed new line was discussed. Pollack asked that outside experts be consulted on the scoring. There was discussion that if the scoring results in the new line still falling below the funding line, this result would result in no treatment being avail able. There was discussion about whether the vulnerable population score should be increased; Coffman reviewed that this score was to allow higher prioritization for populations that are Value -based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes , 5/19/2016 Page 8 routinely discriminated against, such as racial minorities. Sleep di sorders occur in children of all races. Staff suggested increasing the tertiary prevention score, as treatment of childhood sleep disorder may reduce the risk of abuse and neglect, and evidence was being sought to see if treatment of the sleep disorder red uces risk of later psychiatric and behavioral diagnoses. There was discussion about whether to limit inclusion on the new line to children 3 and under, or whether to consider including children up to age 12. It was noted that older children will frequent ly be diagnosed with a mental health or developmental disorder which allows treatment of insomnia under the comorbidity rule. Children aged 3 and younger normally cannot be diagnosed with these types of conditions due to age. The experts pointed out that t he new line would have higher tertiary prevention scores due to the effects on development and reduced abuse and neglect, which is unique to this early developmental st age and not to older ages. The decision was to have staff consider two versions of the proposed new line, one for children 3 and under and one for children 12 and younger and see how their scoring varies. There was discussion about how severe the sleep disorder would need to be to be included on this new line. Staff was directed to review guidelines or studies which might help determine the number of sleep hours and longest sleep duration which is seen in t he worse 5% of children, the most extreme types of sleep disorder. Recommended Actions: 1) Staff will work with experts and advocates to rework the line scoring for the new line and to revise the proposed guideline note wording . Staff will mock up the proposed new line under 2 scenarios \u20143 and under and 12 and under. Topic: Pediatric urology Discussion: Three summary documents were reviewed: hypospadias, retractile testicles, and congenital urologic conditions. There was no discussion regarding the proposed coding changes or the suggested new guideline for these topics . Recommended Actions: 1) Remove ICD -10 Q54.9 ) from line AND EPISPADIAS and leave on line 662 GENITOURINARY CONDITIONS WITH NO OR MINIMALLY EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS OR NO TREATMENT NECESSARY 2) Add ICD-10 Q55.22 (retractile testicle) to line 98 UNDESCENDED TESTICLE and on line 662 GENITOURINARY CONDITIONS WITH NO OR MINIMALLY EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS OR NO TREATMENT NECESSARY 3) Add Q60.3 hypo Q62.62 Value -based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes , 5/19/2016 Page 9 (Displacement of ureter), and Q63 (Other congenital malformations of kidney) to line 91 CONGENITAL ANOMALIES OF GENITOURINARY SYSTEM and keep on line 662 GENITOURINARY CONDITIONS WITH NO OR MINIMALLY EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS OR NO TREATMENT NECESSARY 4) Adopt a new guideline as shown in Appendix B MOTION: To recommend the code and guideline note changes as presented . CARR IES 6-0. Topic: Physical therapy modalities Discussion: Smits introduced a series of summary documents . Susan Bamburger PT, representing the OR PT association , and Dr. Alejandro Perez testified regarding vasopneumatic therapy. Both testified that vasopneumatic therapy is an important comp onent of lymphedema therapy. Dr. Perez provided literature supporting the utility of vasopneumatic devices for the treatment of lymphedema [Karaca -Mandic et et al 2014] . Dr. Perez testified that these articles showed the clinical utility and cost effectiveness of this therapy, with reductions in hospitalizations and number of PT visits required for lymphedema patients. Ms. Bamburger noted that it was second line therapy, used when compression garments and lymphatic drainage massage was not effective. Neither expert felt that this therapy was appropriately used for treatment of back or neck conditions. Neither could identify non-lymphedema uses that were commonly done in practice. Gi ngerich noted that no billing was found with the diagnosis for lymphedema for this modality. The subcommittee felt that the placement of vaopneumatic therapy should be limited to treatment of lymphedema, where the evidence supported its use. Ms. Bamburge r testified that whirlpool therapy is no longer used. Smits pointed out that its use is not recommended by the CDC due to risk of infection. The subcommittee decided that this therapy should be on the Services Recommended for Non -Coverage Table and removed from all lines on the Prioritized List rathe r than just removed from the specific lines recommended by staff. Recommended Actions: 1) Remove CPT 97024 (Application of a modality to 1 or (eg, microwave) ) from lines 471 BRACHIAL PLEXUS LESIONS and 512 PERIPHERAL NERVE DISORDERS and a dd 97024 to the Services Recommended for Non -Coverage Table due to lack of evidence of effectiveness 2) Add CPT 97028 ( Application of a modality to 1 or more areas; ultraviolet ) to the Services Recommended for Non -Coverage Table due to lack of evidence of effectiveness a. Advise HSD to remove 97028 from the Ancillary Procedures File 3) Add CPT 97034 ( Application of a modality to 1 or more areas; contrast baths, each 15 minutes ) to the Se rvices Recommended for Non -Coverage Table due to lack of evidence of effectiveness Value -based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes , 5/19/2016 Page 10 a.

Note: removal of CPT 97022 from back conditions lines is effective July 1, 2016 MOTION: To recommend the code and guideline note changes as amend ed. CARRIES 6 -0 Topic : Implantable cardiac loop recorders Discussion: This topic was tabled until the August, 2016 VBBS meeting . Topic: Electric tumor treatment fields for initial treatment of glioblastoma Discussion: This topic was tabled until the August, 2016 VBBS meeting . Note: testimony was heard on this topic at the May 19, 2016 HERC meeting. Value -based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes , 5/19/2016 Page 11 Topic: Incontinentia pigmenti Discussion: Smits introduced the summary document. Allen noted that these children have dental problems which were not pointed out in the staff summary. Recommended Actions: 1) Add Q82.3 ( CRYOSURGERY and remove from line 660 DERMATOLOGICAL CONDITIONS WITH NO OR MINIMALLY EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS OR NO TREATMENT NECESSARY MOTION: To approve the code changes as presented . CARRIES 6-0. Topic: Sacroiliac joint fusion Discussion: This topic was tabled until the August, 2016 VBBS meeting . Topic : Low frequency ultrasound for wound healing Discussion: Smits reviewed the summary document. Testimony was heard from Dr. Alejandro Perez, regional medical director for Providence for wound care and acting president of Columbia Wound Care Consortium. Dr. Perez highlighted two more recent randomized controlled trials: Gibbons 2015, a study of 112 patients showing significant reduction in wound size; and, an Iranian study from August 2013 showing a significant difference in edema, pain and wo und size reduction. Dr. Perez testified that low frequency ultrasound was not currently being used in physician wound care systems in Oregon, mainly due to lack of coverage by private insurers. He did not e that he was aware of one n urse -run wound care cli nic using this technology. Derrick Sutherland, the director of reimbursement f or Alliqua, provided testimony next. He described the technology. Mr. Sutherland testified that low frequency ultrasound for wound healing was c overe d by Medicare in most sta tes and was u sed in Oregon in many locations. He noted that the C ochrane studies used very old studies, many prior to MIST therapy being availab le. He does not feel that the Cochrane meta -analyses using pre -MIST therapy can apply to MIST. One of the met a-analyses used an entirely different thermal technology, and so he felt it also was not applicable to the discussion . Pettigrew responded that the other Cochrane review did include studies utilizing this technology. Sutherland addressed some of the staff identified issues with the current literature. MIST is only indicated for non -healing wounds, so studies are designed to provide 4 weeks of standard care and include only those patients for MIST therapy that do not respond to this standard care. Wound car e studies tend to have small patient populations, and it is difficult to have wound care clin ics follow study protocols. Mr. Sutherland recommended including deep tis sue injury as an indication, Value -based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes , 5/19/2016 Page 12 which was excluded in the staff review . AHRQ national guidel ine lists use for lower extremity ulcers and wounds, and gives the technology a rating of \" level B class 2 evidence. \" He noted that the NICE meta -analysis is being followed by a NICE -conducted trial, which stated that MIST was promising, but the study was underpowered. He addressed the staff concern that the majority of studies had industry sponsorship \u2014Alliqua gives an unrestricted grant, and does not try to control study design or interpretati on. He noted that NICE was currently redoing its review, which should be available in the next year or two . In summary, Mr. Sutherland a rgued that MIST is cost -effective, and reduces more severe ul cerations and the cost of the care of such complicated wo unds. He indicated that he and/or Alliqua w ill submit the various articles discussed to staff for evaluation and possible distribution to Commission members . Olson asked for the anticipated date for the NICE re -review; Sutherland indicated that he did n ot know. Pettigrew noted that AHRQ is in proce ss of review of treatments of lower extremity ulcers, which should be available in the next year or two. The subcommittee members generally felt that the current level of evidence was not sufficient to add th is treatment to the Prioritized List. The decision was made to not add this procedure until more compelling evidence of the efficacy of this technology is brought forward. When the new AHRQ/NICE/other studies are published, staff will review them and bring this topic back if the new evidence is sufficient to support the use of this technology. Recommended Actions: 1) Staff will bring this topic back to a future meeting once additional evidence supporting its use is published Topic: Posterior tibialis tendinopathy/flatfoot Discussion: This topic was tabled until VBBS meeting . Topic: Revisions to GN6 Rehabilitative Therapie s Discussion: Smits reviewed the summary document. Testimony was heard from Paul Terdal , an advocate for children with autism and the state policy chair of Autism Speaks. Mr. Terdal argued against delaying the implementation of the child changes until January 1, 2017, as this delay will result in a significant cost to families. These change s are meant to bring the guideline into compliance with existing laws, which also argues against delayed implementation. He noted that a delay will make administrative hearings difficult if the law and the guideline are in conflict until January. He enco uraged making all changes effective as soon as possible . Gingerich responded that the final federal rule states that OHA will need to demonstrate compliance by October 2, 2017, well after the proposed implementation date of January 1, 2017. Value -based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes , 5/19/2016 Page 13 Mr. Terdal also had comments regarding age limits on ABA in the ABA guideline. He requested a review of the ABA guideline to make sure it is in compliance . Coffman indicated that HERC staff have given this question to the Oregon Department of Justice and are curren tly awaiting a response. Once the DOJ provides HERC staff with a response on ABA, staff will bring this topic to the HERC. Pollack commented on the importance of mental health parity to the psychiatric community. He noted that there are quantitative is sues, such as difference s in number of visits, copays, etc. There are also qualitative issues, such as many health plans avoiding intent of the law by narrowing provider network s or other actions . Hodges raised concerns about the staff proposal to delet e cardiac and vascular rehabilitation from the GN6, without another suggested guideline note or amendments to GN6 to provide limits for these services. She recommended either creating a new guideline note for these services or adding a line to the current guideline about the intent for coverage of cardiac and vascular rehabilitation ( e.g., the first 3 months after an event?). The deletions of cardiac and vascular rehabilitation were not accepted. Staff was directed to research further and bring back suggest ed guideline note wording about limits for these services to a future meeting. Recommended Actions: 1) Accept the modified GN 6 REHABILITATIVE THERAPIES as shown in Appendix A a) Note: GN6 changes are effective January 1, 2017, except for the addition of wording for habilitative services , which is effective October 1, 2016 MOTION: To recommend the guideline note changes as amended . CARRIES 6-0. Topic: Opioids for back condition s Discussion: Smits reviewed the summary document. Testimony was heard from a variety of stakeholders. Laura Etherton submitted written testimony and verbally testified, representing the Oregon Primary Care Association (OPCA), a group of community health center s and FQHCs. The OPCA generally supports Guideline Note 60 and its intent. She noted that the CDC guideline reco mmend individualized taper plans, and recommended that the guideline reflect this. She testified that access is inadequate to taper the entire population of back pain patients off opioids by end of 2016, and this raises concern for an increase in heroin or illicit opioid use. The OPCA suggests adoption of an individualized taper plan with the goal to taper off with no fixed end date. Value -based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes , 5/19/2016 Page 14 Paul Coehlo, MD ( by phone) testified as a member of the Oregon Pain Management Commission (OPMC) and a pain specialist. He reviewed that there are three populations of patients: opioid na\u00efve, opioid chronic, and opioid high dose chronic (\"the lost generation\"). He testified that there is no way to ever get a high dose chronic opioid patient to zero narcotic dose; rather the tr eatment goal becomes harm reduction. Such high dose chronic patients may be switched to buprenorphine, which is still a partial opioid agonist. Subcommittee members asked if there was a way to identify a group of patients who will never be able to be weane d off opioids. Dr. Coehlo indicated that 240 morphine equivalent dose a day is a useful threshold \u2014patients receiving this amount of opioids or higher can never be weaned off opioids or even successfully tapered down. Livingston pointed out opioid use dis orde r would have availability of treatment on line 4, including buprenorphine. Therefore, patients with very high opioid dosages will no longer fall under GN60, but rather be treated as opioid dependent on line 4. She also noted that there is n o evidence t hat opioids are helpful for back conditions, while there is plenty of evidence that they are harmful. Coehlo question ed whether patients with no aberrant behaviors should be diagnosed with an abuse diagnosis. Saboe stressed the utility of non -pharmacologi c treatments for back conditions and noted the need for better access to chiropractic services. The subcommittee discussed that there was no way to completely satisfy all patient situations in the guideline. There was general support for an individualized taper plan. Etherton suggested removing the 10% taper requirement as some patients need a faster taper. Other subcommittee members noted that some patients required a longer taper. It was felt that the 10% taper requirement was not consistent with an individualized taper plan and should be removed. The group discussed whether to include some type of firm end date for the opioid taper . Etherton noted that there is an argument to allow some patients who are getting significant functional improvement from opioids to continue using them past a firm end date. There was also a concern that a firm end date would increase heroin usage. There was discussion that a firm end date would assist providers in treating patients and provide a strong message about the lack of benefits of opioids for these conditions . A longer time frame before a required taper end date would allow plans to make arrangements for access to alternative therapies and would prevent addictions specialists from being overwhelmed with requests for assistance in tapering patients off opioids. Olson identified that there has not been any discussi on specific to , or consideration of , the \"legacy patients\". Smits acknowledged that the task force identified that there are those patients that will never be able to get off medications , but that the guideline note was to identify that this was the direct ion that they wanted to go. Taray added clarification about the input from the OPMC as to the language of the guideline note as more of a \"negotiation\" and attempt to work with what was already there. Olson suggest ed the original intent did not take into a ccount those patients on high doses of opioid medications and that by extending the timeline for an end date as a continued impetus for stakeholders to come to the committee with a better idea. Value -based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes , 5/19/2016 Page 15 The final decision was to require a n individualized taper to be put in place by January 1, 2017 , which must include non -medication based additional therapies. The taper plan must include a quit date no later than January 1, 2018. The subcommittee acknowledged that the back coverage changes were not intended to require CCOs to cover previously denied medications for back conditions. Rather, it is an attempt to increase the types of care available to patients with back conditions. Recommended Actions: 1) Accept the modified guideline note 60 OPIOID PRESCRIBING F OR CONDITIONS OF THE BACK AND SPINE as shown in Appendix A MOTION: To recommend the guideline note changes as amend ed. CARRIES 6-0. Topic: Tobacco cessation and elective surgery Discussion: This topic was tabled until the August, 2016 VBBS meeting . Topic: Acupuncture for tobacco cessation Discussion: Pettigrew reviewed the summary for this topic. The subcommittee was generally in agreement that limits should be put in place for the use of acupuncture for tobacco cessation. Laura Ocker, the acupunct urist consulted on this topic, had suggested a limit of 18 visits. The subcommittee members felt that 12 visits was more consist ant with other conditions included in the guideline . There was some discussion about whether this would have any issues with the ACA requirement for coverage of tobacco cessation; it was felt that this would not be an issue. Recommended Actions: 1) Amend GN 92 ACUPUNCTURE as shown in Appendix A MOTION: To recommend the guideline note changes as amend ed. CARRIES 6-0. Topic: Hyperbaric oxygen Discussion: Smits reviewed the summary document. Dr. Alejandro Perez testified; he stated that the ICD -10 conversion caused a lot of confusion with hyperbaric oxygen therapy coverage, leading to denials of therapy. Specifically, the ICD -10 codes for radiation injuries are much more specific than the old er ICD -9 codes and many insurers have been denying Value -based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes , 5/19/2016 Page 16 coverage. Smits indicated that the inclusion of the correct ICD -10 codes for various radiation therapy injuries could be determined by staff working with him and other hyperbaric oxygen specialists and bro ught back as a straightforward item for August. Recommended Actions: 1) Adopt the modified GN 107 HYPERBARIC OXYGEN as shown in Appendix A 2) HERC staff to work with experts to identify ICD -10 codes for radiation therapy injuries to add to the hyperbaric oxyg en line and possibl y put into the guideline MOTION: To recommend the guideline note changes as presented. CARRIES 6-0. Topic: Disorders of bilirubin metabolism Discussion: Smits reviewed the summary document. There was no discussion. Recommended Actions: 1) Remove ICD-10 E80.4 -E80.8 from line 64 2) Add E80.4 (Gilbert syndrome ), E80.6 (Other disorders of bilirubin ), and E80.7 (Disorders of bilirubin metabolism, unspecified ) to line 656 ENDOCRINE AND ME TABOLIC CONDITIONS WITH NO OR MINIMALLY EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS OR NO TREATMENT NECESSARY 3) Add ICD-10 E80.5 (Crigler -Najjar syndrome) to line 106 HEMOLYTIC DISEASE DUE TO ISOIMMUNIZATION, ANEMIA DUE TO TRANSPLACENTAL HEMORRHAGE, AND FETAL AND NEONATAL JAUNDICE and to line 246 ACUTE AND SUBACUTE NECROSIS OF LIVER; SPECIFIED INBORN ERRORS OF METABOLISM (EG. MAPLE SYRUP URINE DISEASE, TYROSINEMIA) Treatment: LIVER TRANSPLANT MOTION: To recommend the code changes Pectus excavatum and pectus carinatum Discussion: Smits reviewed the staff recommendations in the summary document as well as summarized the March, 2016 VBBS deliberations on this topic. Dr. Zollen, a pediatric surgeon, testified. He felt t hat inclusion of the objective Haller index requirement added cost, but acknowledged that private insurance generally include this requirement as well. He noted that there can be other chest deformities which can affect the calculation of the Haller index. He recommended considering adding a clause that the Haller index was not required in unusual cases; however , Hodges felt that this could be dealt with as an exception. Williams asked how often a person could have a Haller index >3.25 and not have pulmonar y or cardiac issues. Zollen stated that this does occur, but could not give a clear number of patients or percent of cases. Value -based Benefits Subcommittee Minutes , 5/19/2016 Page 17 Zollen testified that he agreed with the elimination of paradoxical chest wall motion, noting that this type of case can be argued on a case by case basis as an exception. He and Dr. Ruscher (by phone) expressed c oncern for the requirement of having pediatric cardiology and/or pulmonology concur with surgery. In m any cases , kids will need to travel to Portland for such a consultation, which adds to the cost and creates a barrier for rural children. He noted that private insurers do not require such a consultation. Pollack asked if this consult could be a teleconsult. Zollen replied that telemedicine is not widespread or easily available in many rural areas. The subcommittee felt elimination of the requirement was acceptable. Zollen argued in favor of including body image issues as a criteria, noting that these children are at risk for depression. Hodges asked if there was some way to quantify what was meant by severe body image distortion. An evaluation by a mental health professional was considered as one possible criteria. Coffman noted that there are many other congenital deformities below the line that have body image issues, and argued against inclusion of this criteria in order to keep consisten cy in the Prioritized List. It was decided that body image distortion could be dealt with as an exception if it was severe enou gh. There was discussion about the requirement for the surgery being reasonably likely to fix the cardiac or pulmonary issue. Williams noted that there may be situations in which other conditions are present, such as other congenital issues, which would not be relieved by fixing the pectus excavation; she recommended keeping in this requirement. Recommended Actions: 1) Keep Q67.7 ( pectus carinatum) on line 665 MISCELLANEOUS CONDITIONS WITH NO OR MINIMALLY EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS OR NO TREATMENT NECESSARY 2) Rem ove Q67.6 ( pectus excavatum) from line 665 MISCELLANEOUS CONDITIONS WITH NO OR MINIMALLY EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS OR NO TREATMENT NECESSARY and add to lines 406 BENIGN CONDITIONS OF BONE AND JOINTS AT HIGH RISK FOR COMPLICATIONS and 530 DEFORMITIES OF UPPER BODY AND ALL LIMBS 3) Add CPT 21740 -21743 (Nuss procedure and other repair procedures ) line 406. 4) Add Q79.8 ( Other congenital malformations of musculoskeletal system) to line 406 and keep on line 530. 5) Add a new guideline note regarding pectus excavatum to lines 406 and 530 as shown in Appendix B MOTION: To recommend the code and guideline note changes as amend ed.

Immunizations as recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP): http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/index.html TB testing Guideline 1 Question : Should diagnostic guideline D2 regarding TB blood tests be deleted? Question source : HERC staff Issue : There are two methods to screen for tuberculosis (TB). The traditional skin test (PPD or TST) requires a trained person to administer the test and then examine the patient to read the result in 2 -3 days. There are several newer blood tests called interfe ron-gamma release assays (IGRAs) which can be used to detect TB infection, and only require a single patient lab visit. Diagnostic Guideline 2 was adopted in 2006 , and followed the CDC recommendations for use of the TB blood tests that were in effect at that time. Since that time, the CDC has updated recommendation for use, and now recommends IGRA testing may be used in place of standard skin testing whenever the skin test would have been indicated. There are a few circumstances when one of these tests w ould be preferred (i.e. IGRA for a patient with previous BCG vaccination) , but even in those circumstances, the CDC states that either test can be used. Currently, the IGRA tests (CPT 86480 TB CELL MEDIATED ANTIGEN RESPONSE GAMMA INTERFERON) and the skin tests (CPT 86580 Skin test; tuberculosis, intradermal) are on the HSD Diagnostic List. The TST test cost s about $5 plus the cost of the office visit s for the application and for reading the test (generally a nurse visit). The IGRA tests cost approximatel y $60. From the CDC : IGRAs can be used in place of (but not in addition to) TST in all situations in which CDC recommends TST as an aid in diagnosing M. tuberculosis infection, with [certain] preferences and special considerations ... This includes contact investigations, testing during pregnancy, and screening of health care workers and others undergoing serial evaluation for M. tuberculosis infection. Despite the indication of a preference, use of the alternative test (FDA -approved IGRA or TST) is acceptable medical and public health practice. CDC interferon gamma recommendations 2010 (document not included due to length) Current guideline DIAGNOSTIC GUIDELINE D2, TUBERCULOSIS TESTING GUIDELINE Quanti -FERON TB Gold (QFT -G), a blood test for detecting infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis , may be used in the following circumstances: A) Instead of Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) for investigation of contacts to confirmed cases of active tuberculosis (TB) disease. B) Instead of TST for screening for latent TB in persons with definitive history or BCG or who have immigrated from countries with high prevalence (>10%) of latent TB where BCG is commonly given. TB testing Guideline 2 C) As a supplementary test to TST in foreign -born persons with a positive TST, history of BCG vaccination against tuberculosis, and no clinical evidence of current TB disease. D) As a supplementary test in persons with a positive TST who are members of otherwise low-risk populations (e.g., U.S.-born persons and others who have immigrated to the U.S. > 5 years previously or more recently from low TB prevalence countries; absence of immunosuppressive conditions such as HIV infection, renal failure, diabetes mellitus or alcoholism; homelessness; known exposure to someone with active TB), and no clinical evidence of current TB disease. E) In populations that need rapid (within 24 hours) diagnosis in order to guide appropriate public health interventions such as isolation for infectious tuberculosis or contact evaluation. F) In a high -risk patient (e.g. homelessness, immune suppression or deficiency, recent immigrant) who the treating clinician believes is unlikely to return on time for the TST reading.

Interferon-Gamma Release Assays (IGRAs) are whole-blood tests that can aid in diagnosing Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. They do not help differentiate latent tuberculosis infection (LT BI) from tuberculosis disease. Two IGRAs that have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are commercially available in the U.S. They are: QuantiFERON\u00ae - TB Gold In-Tube IGRAs measure a person's immune reactivity to M. tuberculosis. White blood cells from most persons that have been infected with M. tuberculosis will release interferon-gamma (IFN-g) when mixed with antigens (substances that can produce an immune response) derived from M. tuberculosis. To conduct the tests, fresh blood samples are mixed with antigens and controls. The antigens, testing methods, and interpretation criteria for IGRAs differ (see Table 1). What are the advantages of IGRAs? Requires a single patient visit to conduct the test. Results can be available within 24 hours. Does not boost responses measured by subsequent tests. Prior BCG (bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin) vaccination does not cause a false-positive IGRA test result. What are the disadvantages and limitations of IGRAs? Blood samples must be processed within 8-30 hours after collection while white blood cells are still viable. Errors in collecting or transporting blood specimens or in running and interpreting the assay can decrease the accuracy of IGRAs. Limited data on the use of IGRAs to predict who will progress to TB disease in the future. Table1: Differences in Currently Available IGRAs QFT-GIT T-Spot Initial Process Process whole blood within 16 hours Process peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) within 8 hours, or if T-Cell Xtend\u00ae is used, within 30 hours. M. tuberculosis Antigen Single mixture of synthetic peptides representing ESAT-6, CFP-10 and TB7.7Separate mixtures of synthetic peptides representing ESAT-6 and CFP-10 Measurement IFN-g concentration Number of IFN-g producing cells (spots) Possible Results Positive, negative, indeterminate Positive, negative, indeterminate, borderline(Page 2 of 3) Limited data on the use of IGRAs for: \u00bbChildren younger than 5 years of age; exposed to M. tuberculosis; \u00bbImmunocompromised persons; and \u00bbSerial testing. Tests may be expensive. What are the steps in administering an IGRA test? Confirm arrangements for testing in a qualified laboratory, and arrange for delivery of the blood sample to the laboratory in the time the laboratory specifies to ensure testing of samples with viable blood cells. Draw a blood sample from the patient according to the test manufacturer's instructions. Schedule a follow-up appointment for the patient to receive test results. Based on test results, provide follow-up evaluation and treatment as needed. How do you interpret IGRA test results? IGRA interpretations are based on the amount of IFN-g that is released or on the number of cells that release IFN-g. Both the standard qualitative test interpretation (positive, negative, or indeterminate) and the quantitative assay measurements (Nil, TB, and Mitogen concentrations or spot counts) should be reported. As with the tuberculin skin tests (TSTs), IGRAs should be used as an aid in diagnosing infection with M. tuberculosis. A positive test result suggests that M. tuberculosis infection is likely; a negative result suggests that infection is unlikely. An indeterminate result indicates an uncertain likelihood of M. tuberculosis infection. A borderline test result (T-Spot only) also indicates an uncertain likelihood of M. tuberculosis infection.A diagnosis of LTBI requires that TB disease be excluded by medical evaluation. This should include checking for signs and symptoms suggestive of TB disease, a chest radiograph, and, when indicated, examination of sputum or other clinical samples for the presence of M. tuberculosis. Decisions about a diagnosis of M. tuberculosis infection should also include epidemiological and historical information. Recommendations on when to use IGRA tests IGRAs can be used in place of (but not in addition to) TST in all situations in which CDC recommends TST as an aid in diagnosing M. tuberculosis infection, with preferences and special considerations noted below. This includes contact investigations, testing during pregnancy, and screening of health care workers and others undergoing serial evaluation for M. tuberculosis infection. Despite the indication of a preference, use of the alternative test (FDA-approved IGRA or TST) is acceptable medical and public health practice. Caution in interpretation should be used when testing certain populations because of limited data on the use of IGRAs (see Updated Guidelines for Using Interferon Gamma Release Assays to Detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis Infection, United States). Populations in which IGRAs are preferred for testing: \u00bbPersons who have received BCG (either as a vaccine or for cancer therapy); and \u00bbPersons from groups that historically have poor rates of return for TST reading. TST is preferred over IGRAs for testing children less than 5 years of age. As with TST, IGRAs generally should not be used for testing persons who have a low risk of infection and a low risk of disease due to M. tuberculosis. Each institution and TB control program should evaluate the availability and benefits of IGRAs in prioritizing their use.(Page 3 of 3) Routine testing with both TST and IGRA is not recommended. However, results from both tests might be useful in the following situations: \u00bbWhen the initial test is negative and: -The risk for infection, the risk for progression to disease, and the risk for a poor outcome are high (e.g., HIV infected persons or children under 5 years of age who are exposed to a person with infectious TB). -There is clinical suspicion for TB disease (e.g., signs, symptoms, and/or radiographic evidence suggestive of TB disease) and confirmation of M. tuberculosis infection is desired. -Taking a positive result from a second test as evidence of infection increases detection sensitivity. \u00bbWhen the initial test is positive and: -Additional evidence of infection is required to encourage acceptance and adherence (e.g., foreign-born healthcare workers who believe their positive TST is due to BCG). A positive IGRA might prompt greater acceptance of treatment for LTBI as compared with a positive TST alone. -The person has a low risk of both infection and progression from infection to TB disease. Requiring a positive result from the second test as evidence of infection increases the likelihood that the test reflects infection. An alternative is to assume, without additional testing, that the initial result is a false positive or that the risk for disease does not warrant additional evaluation or treatment, regardless of test results. \u00bbIn addition, repeating an IGRA or performing a TST might be useful when the initial IGRA result is indeterminate, borderline, or invalid and a reason for testing persists.Multiple negative results from any combination of these tests cannot exclude M. tuberculosis infection. Steps should be taken to minimize unnecessary and misleading testing of persons at low risk. Selection of the most suitable test or combination of tests for detection of M. tuberculosis infection should be based on the reasons and the context for testing, test availability, and overall cost of testing. Can IGRAs Be Given To Persons Receiving Vaccinations? As with TST, live virus vaccines might affect IGRA test results. However, the effect of live virus vaccination on IGRAs has not been studied. Until additional information is available, IGRA testing in the context of live virus vaccine administration should be done as follows: Either on the same day as vaccination with live-virus vaccine or 4-6 weeks after the administration of the live-virus vaccine At least one month after smallpox vaccination Additional Information Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Updated Guidelines for Using Interferon Gamma Release Assays to Detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis Infection, United nasal fr acture (ICD -10 S02.2XXA) be on a covered line on the Prioritized List? Question source : Alison Little, MD, CCO Medical Director; HSD Hearings Division Issue : Historically, closed nasal fracture repair has not been on a covered line on the Prioritized List. The ICD -9 code (802.0) was on the equivalent to line 578 DEVIATED NASAL SEPTUM, ACQUIRED DEFORMITY OF NOSE, OTHER DISEASES OF UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT paired with several repair CPT codes. The ICD -9 code (802.1) for op en nasal fracture has been on line 233 FRACTURE OF FACE BONES; INJURY TO OPTIC AND OTHER CRANIAL for many years. The ICD -10 code for closed nasal fracture (S02.2XXA) was GEM -mapped to lines 233 and 578, and subsequently line 233 was reviewed by the ICD -10 Maxillofacial surgery review group, which consisted of a single oral surgeon without expertise in nasal fractures. The code was not moved off of line 233 at that time, and no discussion of this change in coverage occurred at HERC. Of note, S02.2XXG (fol low up of nasal fracture) was clearly on 3 incorrect lines (fracture of pelvis, ribs and great toe) but not removed from any of these lines during that review. The closed n asal fracture ICD-10 code was also reviewed by the ENT ICD -10 review group, who only saw the lower line placement and did not recommend any change in this placement. From Dr. Little : I have a case of a depressed nasal bone fracture (S02.2XXA) without complication (no septal deviation or hematoma). It pairs with repair (21325) both abo ve and below the line. There is no guideline note that directs when it should be considered on which line. Can you advise? Summary : Closed nasal fracture appears to have been added to a covered line as an error of ICD-10 conversion and was not as the int ent of the HERC. HERC staff recommendations : 1) Remove S02.2XXA (Fracture of nasal bones, initial encounter for closed fracture) from line 233 FRACTURE OF FACE BONES; INJURY TO OPTIC AND OTHER CRANIAL NERVES a. Keep S02.2XXA on line 578 DEVIATED NASAL SEPTUM, ACQUIRED DEFORMITY OF NOSE, OTHER DISEASES OF UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT 2) Add S02.2XXD (Fracture of nasal bones, subsequent encounter for fracture with routine healing) and S02.2XXG (Fracture of nasal bones, subsequent encounter f or fracture with delayed healing) to line 578 and leave on line 233 3) Keep S02.2xxB (Fracture of nasal bones, initial encounter for open fracture) on line 233 only Hyperbaric Oxygen August 2016 1 Question : Which diagnosis codes need to be added to the hyperbaric oxygen line ? Question source : Dr. Alejandro Perez, Providence hyperbaric oxygen medical director Issue : When the hyperbaric oxygen guidelin e was discussed at the May, 2016 VBBS meeting, Dr. Perez identified several diagnosis codes which were missing from the line. HERC staff was directed to work with Dr. Perez to identify the codes required to be add ed to this line. Dr. Perez recommends adding the ICD -10 codes for soft tissue injury (L 59.9) and radiation cystitis (N30.4). The coverage guidance on hyperbaric oxygen recommended coverage for radiation tissue injury. In ICD -9, there was a single code for this type of injury (ICD -9 990 Effects of radiation, unspecified ). In ICD -10, there is a range of codes representing various types of radiation injury. From the coverage guidance: Recommendation: Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is recommended for coverage for late radiation tissue injury (strong recommendation) Late Radiation Tissue Injury There is moderate -quality evidence from 35 primary data studies suggesting that HBOT improves outcomes of late radiation tissue injury affecting bone and soft tissues (WA HTA, 2013). There is no overall estimate of effect because of the heterogeneity between studies, but the evidence suggests that radiation -induced tissue and bone damage to the head and neck, anus, and rectum show consistent clinical improvement with HBOT. There is also moderate -quality evidence that HBOT reduces the risk of developing ORN following tooth extraction in a previously irradiated area. Currently T66.XXX (radiation sickness, unspecified) is on line 337 CONDITIONS REQUIRING HYPERBARIC OXYGEN THERAPY . Of note, the ICD -9 code for radiation cystitis (595.82 Irradiation cystitis ) was not included on the hyperbaric oxygen line. The ICD -9 code for radiation proctitis (569.49 Other specified disorders of rectum and anus ) was also not included on this line.

Hyperbaric Oxygen August 2016 3 Evidence (not included in CG review) 1) Bennett 2016, Cochrane review of HBOT for soft tissue radiation injury a. N=14 trials (753 participants) b. There was some moderate quality evidence that HBOT was more likely to achieve mucosal coverage with osteoradionecrosis (ORN) (risk ratio (RR) 1.3; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1 to 1.6, P value = 0.003, number needed to treat for an additio nal beneficial outcome (NNTB) 5; 246 participants, 3 studies). There was also moderate quality evidence of a significantly improved chance of wound breakdown without HBOT following operative treatment for ORN (RR 4.2; 95% CI 1.1 to 16.8, P value = 0.04, NN TB 4; 264 participants, 2 studies). From single studies there was a significantly increased chance of improvement or cure following HBOT for radiation proctitis (RR 1.72; 95% CI 1.0 to 2.9, P value = 0.04, NNTB 5), and following both surgical flaps (RR 8.7 ; 95% CI 2.7 to 27.5, P value = 0.0002, NNTB 4) and hemimandibulectomy (RR 1.4; 95% CI 1.1 to 1.8, P value = 0.001, NNTB 5). There was also a significantly improved probability of healing irradiated tooth sockets following dental extraction (RR 1.4; 95% CI 1.1 to 1.7, P value = 0.009, NNTB 4). There was no evidence of benefit in clinical outcomes with established radiation injury to neural tissue, and no randomised data reported on the use of HBOT to treat other manifestations of LRTI. These trials did not report adverse events. c. Authors' conclusions: These small trials suggest that for people with LRTI affecting tissues of the head, neck, anus and rectum, HBOT is associated with improved outcome. HBOT also appears to reduce the chance of ORN following tooth extraction in an irradiated field. There was no such evidence of any important clinical effect on neurological tissues. The application of HBOT to selected participants and tissues may be justified. Further research is required to establish the optimum par ticipant selection and timing of any therapy. An economic evaluation should be undertaken. d.

A B S T R A C T Background Cancer is a signicant global health problem. Radiotherapy is a treatment for many cancers and about 50% of people having radi otherapy will be long-term survivors. Some will experience late radiat ion tissue injury (LRTI) developing months or years later. Hy perbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) has been suggested as a treatment for LR TI based upon the ability to improve the blood supply to these tissues. It is postulated that HBOT may result in both healin g of tissues and the prevention of problems following surger y. Objectives T o assess the benets and harms of HBOT for treating or preven ting LRTI. Search methods We updated the searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Con trolled T rials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 11), MEDLINE, EMBASE, DORCTIHM and reference lists of articles in December 2015. We al so searched for ongoing trials at clinicaltrials.gov. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effect of HBO T versus no HBOT on LRTI prevention or healing. Data collection and analysis Three review authors independently evaluated the quality o f the relevant trials using the guidelines of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and extracted the data from the included trials. Main results Fourteen trials contributed to this review (753 participants). There was some moderate quality evidence that HBOT was more li kely to achieve mucosal coverage with osteoradionecrosis (ORN) (risk r atio (RR) 1.3; 95% condence interval (CI) 1.1 to 1.6, P value = 0.003, number needed to treat for an additional benecial out come (NNTB) 5; 246 participants, 3 studies). There was also moder ate quality evidence of a signicantly improved chance of wound brea kdown without HBOT following operative treatment for ORN (RR 4.2; 95% CI 1.1 to 16.8, P value = 0.04, NNTB 4; 264 participants , 2 studies). From single studies there was a signicantly incre ased chance of improvement or cure following HBOT for radiation proct itis (RR 1.72; 95% CI 1.0 to 2.9, P value = 0.04, NNTB 5), and Hyperbaricoxygentherapyforlateradiationtissueinjury (Review) Copyright\u00a92016TheCochraneCollaboration.PublishedbyJo hnWiley&Sons,Ltd.following both surgical flaps (RR 8.7; 95% CI 2.7 to 27.5, P value = 0.0002, NNTB 4) and hemimandibulectomy (RR 1.4; 95% CI 1.1 to 1.8, P value = 0.001, NNTB 5). There was also a signicantl y improved probability of healing irradiated tooth sockets f ollowing dental extraction (RR 1.4; 95% CI 1.1 to 1.7, P value = 0.009, NNT B 4). There was no evidence of benet in clinical outcomes with establi shed radiation injury to neural tissue, and no randomised da ta reported on the use of HBOT to treat other manifestations of LRTI. Thes e trials did not report adverse events. Authors' conclusions These small trials suggest that for people with LRTI affectin g tissues of the head, neck, anus and rectum, HBOT is associated w ith improved outcome. HBOT also appears to reduce the chance of ORN fo llowing tooth extraction in an irradiated eld. There was no such evidence of any important clinical effect on neurological tis sues. The application of HBOT to selected participants and tiss ues may be justied. Further research is required to establish th e optimum participant selection and timing of any therapy. An e conomic evaluation should be undertaken. P L A I N L A N G U A G E S U M M A R Y Hyperbaric oxygen therapy for the treatment of the late effe cts of radiotherapy The issue There is a risk of serious complications developing after radi ation treatment (radiotherapy) for cancer (late radiation tiss ue injury (LRTI)). These problems can be very difcult to resolve and there i s some doubt as to the best approaches to treatment. Hyperbari c oxygen therapy (HBOT) involves breathing oxygen in a speciall y designed chamber. It is used as a treatment to improve oxygen supply to damaged tissue (cells within the body) and support healing. The aim of the review We searched medical databases for clinical studies aimed to nd t he evidence for or against the ability of HBOT , compared to eith er no treatment or alternative treatments, to improve these com plications. The evidence was current to December 2015. What were the main ndings? There was some evidence that HBOT improved outcome in LRTI affe cting bone and soft tissues of the head and neck, for radiation proctitis (inflammation of the lower part of the large intestin e caused by radiotherapy treatment) and to prevent the develo pment of osteoradionecrosis (bone death caused by radiotherapy treatm ent) following tooth extraction in an irradiated eld. There was no such evidence of any important clinical effect on tissues in the nervo us system. Quality of the evidence The evidence was generally of moderate quality and limited by small numbers of participants, poor reporting of methods and results, and uncertainty as to the exact degree of improvement with HBOT . What are the conclusions? The application of HBOT to selected participants and tissues ma y be justied. Studies of radiation injury suggest that othe r tissues are also likely to respond (e.g. bladder). Further research is requ ired to establish which people may respond and the best timing of such therapy. A study of costs would also be useful.

Hoggan &Alun L. Cameron Received: 26 June 2013 /Accepted: 2 March 2014 /Published online: 29 March 2014 #Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014 Abstract Purpose The purpose of this paper was to provide an evidence-based evaluation of the safety and effectiveness ofhyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) for the treatment of non- neurological soft tissue radiation-related injuries (STRI). Methods Systematic searches of medical bibliographic data- bases, the Internet, and lists of references were conducted inDecember 2010 and April 2013 to identify relevant primary studies. Inclusion and classification of papers was resolved through the application of a predetermined protocol. Informa-tion on both the safety and effectiveness of HBOT was analyzed. Results Forty-one articles were included, with 11 comparing HBOT to a regimen without HBOT. Comparative evidence varied considerably in methodological quality, and numerous limitations were identified. Absolute data showed that seriousadverse events after HBOT were rare, while more common adverse events were minor and self-limiting. Compared to observation, conventional, or sham therapies, evidence ofbenefit in clinical outcomes was shown for HBOT for radia- tion proctitis and wounds in irradiated soft tissue of the head and neck, but not for postirradiation soft tissue edema orradiation cystitis. Clinical outcomes differed little between HBOT and argon plasma coagulation for radiation proctitis and between HBOT and hyaluronic acid for radiation cystitis. Conclusions HBOT is a safe intervention which may offer clinical benefits to patients suffering from radiation proctitis and non-neurological STRI of the head and neck. However, differing clinical responses across STRI demonstrate a needfor further well-designed clinical trials to validate the use ofHBOT for individual STRI, both as an adjunct to conventional treatments and relative to definitive treatments. Keywords Hyperbaric oxygen .Radiation injury .Soft tissue .Radiotherapy .Systematic review Introduction Radiotherapy is a common and well-established treatment of malignancies across a variety of anatomical areas. However,anatomical structures surrounding a cancer, such as soft tissue, are also irradiated during the course of therapy. Radiotherapy is associated with a broad spectrum of normal tissue reactions,and it is impossible to cure a tumor by radiotherapy without risk of injury to normal tissues [ 1,2]. One potential conse- quence of radiotherapy is serious soft tissue radiation-relatedinjury (STRI) that can develop months or years posttreatment [2-4]. When an STRI occurs, soft tissues undergo deteriora- tion in microvascularity with accompanying fibrosis, a pro-cess which continues until there is insufficient oxygenation to maintain tissue integrity and normal function. Damage may eventually reach a critical point where tissue breaks down andan ulcer or area of radionecrosis results. This process can be exacerbated by secondary damage from infection or surgery in the affected area, even long after irradiation [ 2]. The effects of STRI are progressive and do not spontaneously reverse [ 5-7]. While the pathological processes of STRI are similar throughout the body, some tissues appear more susceptibleto injury than others. The pelvis, particularly the rectum, and the skin and mucosa of the head and neck region are especially sensitive [ 2]. While estimates vary, review articles have re- ported STRI incidence rates ranging from 3 to 18 % across a range of anatomical areas. This includes rectal complications following prostate brachytherapy [ 4], complications following B. L. Hoggan :A. L.

Question source: HERC staff Issue : A new ICD -10 code series (H93.A) for pulsatile tinnitus has been issued for 2017. While reviewing this new set of codes, it was identified that ICD -10 H93.1 (Tinnitus) is on a covered line (line 450 HEARING LOSS - OVER AGE OF FIVE) when no treatments are a vailable for this condition. The Health Services Commission approved the movement of the ICD -9 equiv alent (388.3 Tinnitus) from the covered line to the uncovered line for sensory organ conditions with no treatments in January, 2005 after a review found no effective treatments available. However, it appears that this approved movement was never done. In 2012, the ICD -10 ENT review group did not make any recommendations to remove tinnitus from the covered line. Currently, tinnitus pairs with hearing aids o n this line. Evidence review 1) Hoare 2014 , Cochrane review of hearing aids for tinnitus (document not included due to length) a. N=1 RCT (91 participants) b. Compared hearing aids to sound generators; both treatments found to be equivalent c. Authors' conclusions: The current evidence base for hearing aid prescription for tinnitus is limited. Whilst hearing aids are sometimes prescribed as part of tinnitus management, there is cur rently no evidence to support or refute their use as a more routine intervention for tinnitus. 2) Hilton 2013, Cochrane review of gin gko biloba for tinnitus (document not in cluded due to length) a. N=4 trials (1543 participants) b. There was no evidence that Gingko biloba was effective in patients with a primary complaint of tinnitus c. Authors' conclusions The limited evidence does not demonstrate that Ginkgo biloba is effective for tinnitus when this is the primary complaint. 3) Nyenhuis 2013 , meta -analysis of self -help interventions including behavioral therapy for tinnitus a. N=10 studies (1188 participa nts) b. Self-help interventions significantly reduced tinnitus distress (d = 0.48) and depressiveness (d = 0.25) when compared with a passive control (e.g. information only and discussion forums) at post -assessment. There was no difference to the face -to-face controls (group treatment). c. Conclusions: the results suggest that CBT self -help interventions are an effective treatment for tinnitus distress. Since few studies were identified, this conclusion must be supported by future meta -analyses. 4) Bennet 2012, Coch rane review of hyperbaric oxygen for tinnitus a. N=7 trials (392 participants). Generally poor quality 2017 ICD -10 Code Placement Issues Tinnitus 2 b. The significance of any improvement in tinnitus could not be assessed. There were no significant improvements in hearing or tinnitus reported for chronic presentation (six months) of ISSHL and/or tinnitus. c. Authors' conclusions: We could not assess the effect of HBOT on tinnitus by pooled analysis. There is no evidence of a beneficial effect of HBOT on chronic ISSHL or tinnitus and we do not recommend the us e of HBOT for this purpose. 5) Baldo 2012 , Cochrane review of antidepressants for tinnitus d. N=6 trials patients), mostly low quality e. Tricyclic antidepressants, SSIRs, trazodone f. All the trials assessing tricyclic antidepressants suggested that there was a slight improvement in tinnitus but these effects may have been attributable to methodological bias. The trial that investigated the SSRI drug found no overall improvement in any of the validated outcome measures that were used in the study although there w as possible benefit for a subgroup that received higher doses of the drug. This observation merits further investigation. In the trial investigating trazodone, the results showed an improvement in tinnitus intensity and in quality of life after treatment, but in neither case reached statistical significance. g. Authors' conclusions There is as yet insufficient evidence to say that antidepressant drug therapy improves tinnitus. 6) Hobson 2012 , Cochrane review on sound masking for tinnitus a. N=6 trials (553 participants). b. Following analysis of the data, no significant change was seen in the loudness of tinnitus or the overall severity of tinnitus following the use of sound therapy compared to other interventions such as patient education, 're laxation techniques', 'tinnitus coping strategies', counselling, 'tinnitus retraining' and exposure to environmental sounds. c. Authors' conclusions The limited data from the included studies failed to show strong evidence of the efficacy of sound therapy in tinnitus management. 7) Kim 2012, meta -analysis of acupuncture for tinnitus d. N=9 RCTs e. No statistically significant improvements seen with acupuncture vs sham acupuncture f. 2 RCTs compared one -time scalp acupuncture to sham acupuncture found significant positive effects on symptom relief g. Conclusions: The number, size and quality of the RCTs on the effectiveness of acupuncture for the treatment of tinnitus are not sufficient for drawing definitive conclusions. Further rigorous RCTs that overcome the many limitatio ns of the current evidence are warranted. 8) Hoekstra 2011 , Cochrane review of anticonvulsants for tinnitus a. N=7 trials (453 patients) b. These studies investigated different anticonvulsants: gabapentin, carbamazepine, lamotrigine and flunarizine. 2017 ICD -10 Code Placement Issues Tinnitus 3 c. None of t hem showed a significant positive effect of anticonvulsants. d. Authors' conclusions: Current evidence regarding the effectiveness of anticonvulsants in patients with tinnitus has significant risk of bias. There is no evidence from studies performed so far t o show that anticonvulsants have a large positive effect in the treatment of tinnitus but a small effect (of doubtful clinical significance) has been demonstrated. 9) Meng 2011 , Cochrane review of repetitive transcranial stimulation for tinnitus e. N=5 trials (2 33 participants) f. When considering the impact of tinnitus on patients' quality of life, the results of only one study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) scores at four months follow -up (defined as a 'partial improvement ' by the study authors (THI reduction of 21% to 80%)) when low - frequency rTMS was compared with a sham control treatment. However, no statistically significant improvement was demonstrated by another two studies that considered rTMS at the same frequency. Furthermore, this single positive finding should be taken in the context of the many different variables which were recorded at many different points in time by the study authors. g. Authors' conclusions : There is very limited support for the use of low -frequ ency rTMS for the treatment of patients with tinnitus. When considering the impact of tinnitus on patients' quality of life, support is from a single study with a low risk of bias based on a single outcome measure at a single point in time. When considerin g the impact on tinnitus loudness, this is based on the analysis of pooled data with a large confidence interval. Studies suggest that rTMS is a safe treatment for tinnitus in the short -term, however there were insufficient data to provide any support for the safety of this treatment in the long -term. HERC staff summary : There is a robust literature demonstrating a lack of effectiveness for various treatments for tinnitus , including gingko biloba, hyperbaric oxygen . Of note, sound masking and hearing aids have not been found to be effective treatments. CBT may be effective for dealing with the distress caused by the condition. Utilization : In past year, 41 paid claims for visits and hearing aids. All but 4 hearing aid billings had co - billing with hearing loss diagnosis. HERC staff recommendation : 1) Remove ICD -10 H93.1 (Tinnitus) from line 450 HEARING LOSS - OVER AGE OF FIVE and add to line 658 SENSORY ORGAN CONDITION S WITH NO OR MINIMALLY EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS OR NO TREATMENT NECESSARY a. No effective treatments available b. Consistent with past HSC/HERC intent A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis on the Efcacy of Self-Help Interventions Dennis Golm and Birgit Kro \u00a8ner-Herwig Department of Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy, University of Go \u00a8ttingen, Go\u00a8ttingen, Germany Abstract. This study is a review and meta-analysis on the efcacy of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) self-help interventions for tinnitus. Randomized controlled trials were identied by searching in databases (e.g. ISI Web of Knowledge, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and PSYNDEX) and by manual search. Ten studies with 1188 participants in total were included in the meta-analysis.Participants were 49.2 years old and had tinnitus for 5.2 and depressiveness ( d\u00bc0.25) when compared with a passive control (e.g. information only and discussion forums) at post-assessment. There was no difference to the face-to-face controls (group treatment). The presence of therapists and the methodologicalquality of the studies did not influence the results. Sensitivity analysis revealed that there might be a publication bias regarding the comparison to the face-to-face control. However, the results suggest that CBT self-help interventions are an effective treatment for tinnitus distress. Since few studies wereidentied, this conclusion must be supported by future meta-analyses.

Thephantom sound is perceived by up to 30% ofthe population once in his or her lifetime(M\u00f8ller 2011b). Most afflicted individualscope well with the internal noises, but up to6% suffer severely and are distinctly disabledin their daily lives (M\u00f8ller 2011b). They mostoften report tinnitus-related depres-siveness, anxiety, lein, Geisler, & 2011; Landgrebe &Langguth, 2011). These are associ- ated with a higher amount of health-care costs and a reduced rate of occupational rehabilita-tion (Brandes, Ja \u00a8ger, Malewski, & Krauth, 2006). Several the efcacy of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) inter- ventions for the reduction of tinnitus distresswith moderate effect sizes (e.g. Hesser, Wadell, Perera, & 2007). The CBT interventions aim to alter maladaptive cognitive, emotional, and behavioural responses to tinnitus but not toeradicate the sound itself (Greimel & Kro \u00a8ner- Herwig, 2011). They typically encompass attention control techniques, cognitiverestructuring, relaxation training, imagery techniques, and exposure to difcult situations (Greimel & Kro \u00a8ner-Herwig, 2011). Also, mindfulness- and acceptance-based CBTinterventions have proven their efcacy for reducing distress Hayes, & & Kennedy, 2008; Zetterqvist Westin et al., 2011). In the past, studies onthe efcacy of psychological interventions in tinnitus focused mainly on a traditional face- to-face setting, but in the last decade, thenumber of studies on self-help interventionsincreased. Though the term \"self-help\" is ill- dened, denitions share some common q2013 Swedish Association for Behaviour Therapy Cognitive Behaviour Therapy , 2013 Vol. 42, No. 2, 159-169, http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/16506073.2013.803496features onstandardized manuals and can be conductedindependently by the participants. Therapists or other professionals might be involved in order to support the patient and to facilitatethe use of the programme, but not to build atraditional therapeutic alliance. Self-help interventions are typically presented asprinted-, audio-, or video material or on Webpages. Current reviews have come to theconclusion that self-help interventions reduce distress in different psychological disorders such as depression, anxieties, or insomnia withmedium to large effect sizes (Lewis, Pearce, &Bisson, 2012; Van Straten & Cuijpers, 2009;Van't Hof et al., and might treatments (VanStraten & Cuijpers, 2009; to some studies, the efcacy of self-help interventions might be influenced by the degree of therapist input, with a greatereffectiveness being associated with moreprofessional support (Gellatly et al., 2007;Newman, Szkodny, Llera, & Przeworski,2011). However, a few other studies did notnd a relationship between the efcacy and theamount of professional support (Hirai &Clum, 2006; Klein et al., 2009). To the knowledge of the authors of this study, no review on the efcacy of self-help interventions in tinnitus exists. Self-help approaches might be of vital importanceto tinnitus subjects because they are some-times unwilling to take part in ambulatorypsychotherapeutic interventions as they attri- bute the ear noises to somatic causes (Weise et al., 2007). Self-help interventions promise alower threshold for tinnitus subjects. Thus, theauthors wanted to examine efcacy ofCBT self-help interventions on tinnitus dis-tress the self-help interventions with face-to-face interven-tions on the one hand and with other control groups (waiting list, information only, or discussion forums) on the other. In addition,they wanted to analyse whether professionalsupport during the intervention and themethodological quality of the trials functionas moderators of the efcacy.Methods Inclusion and exclusion criteria Inclusion criteria were as follows: (a) the study evaluates the efcacy of an intervention; (b) itis a CBT intervention; (c) participants are of 16 years of age or older; (d) tinnitus distress is one of the outcome measures; (e) there is acomparison group; (f) it is a randomized trial; and(g)thereisatleastoneself-helpintervention. A self-help intervention should be based on astandardized manual that can be followed independently by the participants. In addition, less instruction time is spent with a therapistthan on one's own. Instruction time is dened asthe time that was invested in getting to know the contents of the intervention excluding the time for practice or homework (e.g. relaxationtraining). Exclusion criteria were as follows: (a) the data reported were insufcient for a meta-analysis and (b) if several publications arebased on the same study, all but the highest ranking publication were excluded (e.g. a journal article was included, whereas a disser-tation on the same data was excluded). In addition, data collection must have been carried out before February 2012. There wereno language restrictions. Search strategies and study selection Eligible studies were searched via databases and other relevant sources. The databases were ISI Web of Knowledge, PubMed, theCochrane Library, and PSYNDEX. The otherrelevant sources included databases for theses (e.g. Dissertation Express), reference sections from previous meta-analyses, and locatedstudies, conference proceedings relevant to the eld, and registered ongoing trials. The studies were identied by combining the term\"tinnitus\" with several terms that might indicate low involvement from a therapist and, thus, a self-help intervention (Table 1).Such a broad search strategy was applied due to the heterogeneous terminology in the eld. Some authors classify their interventions as\"self-help\" (e.g. Kaldo, Cars, Rahnert,Larsen, & Andersson, 2007) and others do not though their work qualies as a self- help intervention (e.g. Hesser et al., 2012). In addition, the authors contacted relevant authors in the eld and asked for ongoing studies. In total, 68 abstracts were identiedby databases and 16 by other sources160 Nyenhuis, Golm and Kro \u00a8ner-Herwig COGNITIVE BEHAVIOUR THERAPY(Figure 1). The rst two authors (Ph.D. students) and a master's student, who was not otherwise involved in the meta-analysis, read the full texts and checked independentlywhether the inclusion and exclusion criteria were met in these studies or not. There were no differences in the study selection between thethree raters (Cohen's Kappa \u00bc1.0). The remaining 10 studies were included in this review (Table 2). Coding of the studies The rst and second authors\u2014both are Ph.D. students who had published in the eld oftinnitus\u2014independently coded all the 10 studies. A probation phase was implemented before the actual rating to train the coders andto enhance the quality of the coding sheets. In this probation phase, both raters coded twostudies on interventions for tinnitus patients who were excluded from this review in order totest the tinnitus-related ratings Zetterqvist al., 2011).Another two studies were coded which fullled all inclusion criteria, except that they examined social phobia instead of tinnitus(Berger, Hohl, & Caspar, 2009; Carlbringet al., 2007). By doing this, the ratings related to the self-help were tested. Differences in the ratings were discussed until both raters agreedon the issue. The rating catalogue included items on study characteristics (e.g. type of publication,age, proportion of men, and assessment periods), tinnitus characteristics (e.g. tinnitus duration), and the type of intervention (e.g.duration, number of personal contacts, and communication medium). The methodologi- cal quality of the studies was assessed usingthe clinical trial assessment measure (CTAM),which shows a good blind inter-rater agree- ment of 0.96 (Tarrier & Wykes, 2004). The CTAM is based on the CONSORT statementand has been applied in several meta-analyses, amongst them some on the efcacy of psychological treatment tinnitus (Hesser,Weise, Rief, & Andersson, 2011; Hesser, Weise, Zetterqvist Westin et al., 2011). A score of 65 or higher as an indicator of agood study quality was suggested by Wykes, Steel, Everitt, and Tarrier (2008). Comparison groups: face-to-face and passive control Two categories of comparison groups were dened: face-to-face and passive control. Theface-to-face control groups comprised alterna- tive treatments, e.g. ambulatory psychother- apy groups. The passive control includedwaiting lists as well as conditions that controlled for unspecic effects, such as online discussion forums, or that did not qualify asan alternative treatment such as information booklets. The allocation of the study arms to the comparison groups is presented in Table 2.

Seven of the 10 studies reported intention-to-treat data. For the other studies,e f f e c ts i z ec a l c u l a t i o nw a sb a s e do nt h e completer data. Hedge's gwas calculated as standardized mean difference scores that werecorrected for sample size (Hedges & Olkin, 1985; Rustenbach 2003): rst, using the post- assessment means of the self-help traininggroup and the comparison group, 1and, in addition, using the mean difference between the pre- and post-assessment of each group2 (intragroup change scores). A positive effect size indicates a result in favour of the self- help interventions. If tinnitus distress or depressiveness was assessed by more than one measure in a single study, Hedge's gwas averaged over the assessments by computing the mean over all assessments. Hence, only this merged effect size was included into the meta-analysis.Another important issue in a meta-analysis is the choice of intergroup comparisons. As no study reported more than one control con-dition, multiple comparisons with the control were not an issue. However, some studies included more than one self-help treatmentbased on the same manual. In all these cases, the self-help conditions were presented in distinctive ways (e.g. Internet vs. bibliother-apy) and, thus, all comparisons between a self- help condition and the respective control were included. After the calculation of the effectsizes for the individual studies, the pooled mean effect sizes were calculated using an SPSS 20-Script (SPSS, Inc., Version 21.0. Armonk,NY: IBM Corp.) based on a random effects model. The script by Field and Gillet (2010) did not include any weighting of the studies. Thehomogeneity of the effect size distribution was estimated by the Q-statistic (Lipsey & Wilson, 2001). Moderator analyses were performed byindependent regression models based on a mixed model (as suggested by Field and Gillet, 2010). Each regression model included theeffect size as the dependent variable and either the CTAM rating as a continuous predictor or the presence of therapeutic contact as acategorical predictor (yes/no). A point-biserial correlation was calculated for the association between the presence of therapeutic contactand the effect size. Publication bias was assessed by using a weight-function model (Vevea & Woods,2005). Unlike other methods for estimatingthe publication bias, these so-called selection models are based on the idea that the effectsizes have different chances of being observedin the rst place and, furthermore, of beingincluded into a meta-analysis (Kepes et al.,2012; Vevea & Woods, 2005). Thus, a selectionmodel not only estimates a pooled effect size,but also takes the selection process intoaccount. This is done by using multiple setsof weights, each modelling the probability bywhich a particular study becomes published(Baldwin, Christian, Berkeljon, Shadish, &Bean, 2012). Vevea and Woods, (2005)developed a selection model that is specicallydesigned for a small number of studies as inthe present meta-analysis. Four sets of xedweights are chosen a priori, each representing a specic severity of biased selection (Vevea & Woods, 2005). To implement this idea, theauthors dened p-value intervals that are associated with a certain probability ofobserving an effect size (e.g. p\u00bc.000-.005, .005-.010, .010-.050, ..., .995-1.000; Vevea & Woods, 2005). Although the p-value intervals are equal in all four sets, theprobability of observing an effect size varieswith the assumption of a moderately orseverely biased selection process and a one-or two-tailed selection. Thus, they suggest acombination of four models: moderate one-tailed moderate two-tailed selection, severe two-tailed selection(Vevea & Woods, 2005). For example, theprobability of observing an effect within thepinterval .01 ,p..05 is .95 (moderate one- tailed selection), .90 (severe one-tailed selec-tion), .95 (moderate two-tailed selection), or.90 (severe two-tailed selection; see Vevea and Woods (2005) for the detailed specication of weights). Thus, a study with a p-value..05 is 95% as likely to be selected as a study withp,.05. These four models were implemented as outlined by Field and Gillet (2010).An estimated pooled effect size is calculatedfor each dependent variable (e.g. tinnitusdistress) under the assumption of all fourweight models. Thus, four different estimatesof a pooled effect size are presented for eachdependent variable. If the previous statisticalndings lie in the range of the pooledestimates, the meta-analysis seems robust tothe influence of a publication bias (Kepes,VOL 42, NO 2, 2013 Meta-Analysis on CBT Self-Help Interventions Peters et al., 2010; Vevea & Woods, 2005). Results Study characteristics The number of persons who took part in 10studies is 1188 (Table 2), of which 58.47%(range 48-90.2%) were men. On average, theywere 49.2 ( ^12.6) and ( ^5.7; range: 3.2 months-10.6 years). The methodological quality of thestudies was low. CTAM scores were 42.6 on average (range 31-63), and no study score exceeded the cut-off of 65 points. Looking forreasons for the low ratings, it becomes evident that most studies did not care for a blind assessment or a rater blinding, that thesamples were normally highly selective, and that no study took adequate care of the adherence to the treatment protocol. A higherquality rating was associated with a laterpublication year ( r\u00bc.44). The dropout was 26.9% on average (range 0-66%). The 418 participants in the passive control were 49.3 ( ^13.0) years old and 58.63% were males. The tinnitus duration could not be determined since very few studies reported it.The 220 participants in the face-to-face control were 47.6 ( ^12.7) years old and 50.2% were males. Again, the tinnitusduration could not be determined. Standardized mean differences: intergroup effect sizes atpost-assessment In comparison to the passive controls, participants in self-help interventions showed a lower tinnitus distress [ d\u00bc0.48 (95% p,.01] at post-assessment. control conditions at post-assessment, the self-help interventions did not reduce the slightly lower in the face-to- face control condition, but the condenceinterval included zero, thus indicating nosignicant difference between the groups mean differences: intergroup comparison of change scores The self-help groups showed a statistically signicant greater decrease in tinnitus distress [d\u00bc0.54 the passive controls from pre- to post-assessment. Homogeneity ofthe effect sizes self-help interventions and the to a influence of the study quality and the availability of therapeutic contact on the effectsizes were analysed in the moderator analyses. There was no signicant influence of the study quality on the effect sizes. Neither did thepresence of therapeutic contact have anyinfluence on the outcomes, with one exception. When predicting the difference in depressive- ness between the self-help interventions andthe passive control at post-assessment, the presence of therapeutic contact was a signi- cant predictor of a larger intergroup effect( x2(1)\u00bc4.64, p\u00bc.031). Publication bias Sensitivity analyses indicated that the mean effect sizes based on change scores lay in the range of the estimates presented earlier, withone exception (see Table 3). Comparing theself-help interventions to the face-to-face control with regard to the change in tinnitus distress, the severe one-tailed selection led toan extremely deviant estimate (effect size\u00bc0.5). This outlier indicates an advan- tage of the over and Kro \u00a8ner-Herwig COGNITIVE BEHAVIOUR THERAPYLooking at the sensitivity analysis based on the post-assessment data, there are more hints on publication bias. The effects between the self-help conditions and the passive controls(d tinnitus \u00bc0.48 and ddepressiveness \u00bc0.25) might have been overestimated, as the sensitivity analysis led to lower estimates. The effect sizebetween the self-help and face-to-face controls might have been underestimated for tinnitus distress, as the sensitivity analysis indicateshigher effect sizes in favour of the face-to-facecontrols ( d\u00bc.04-d\u00bc.50). Discussion This review reports on the efcacy of CBT- based self-help interventions for tinnitus patients. Self-help interventions were com-pared with either face-to-face treatments (group treatments) or passive controls, with the latter comprising information only onconditions, discussion forums, or waiting lists. The comparisons were based either on post- assessment data or on change scores from pre-to post-assessment. Follow-up data were not available. Compared with the passive control, the self- help conditions showed a lower tinnitusdistress, with a moderate mean effect size, and a lower depressiveness, with a small mean effect size. Tinnitus distress and depressivenessdid not differ between the self-help conditions and the face-to-face treatments. These results support previous ndings that self-help interventions are efcacious in reducingpsychological distress in different outcome domains (Lewis et al., 2012; Van Straten & Cuijpers, 2009; Van't Hof et al., 2009). In addition, this analysis supports the assump- tion that self-help interventions with little or no therapist contact are as efcacious as face-to-face interventions as shown in previous meta-analyses syndromes (Van Straten & Cuijpers, 2009; Van't Hof et al., 2009). This is a remarkable nding as research often hints at the enhancing effect of a good therapeutic alliance on therapy outcome (Constantino et al., 2007; Stevens, Muran,Safran, Gorman, & Winston, 2007). However, several points have to be kept in mind when interpreting this result: First, a recent study by Andersson et al. (2012) found that the rating of the therapeutic alliance by participants in guided self-help is comparable to the ratings of face-to-face therapies. Thus, the theoretical assumption that guided self-help interventions lack a therapeutic alliance is questionable, and one might argue that the results are influenced bythe fact that the majority of the included comparisons comprise self-help with therapist contact. In addition, Andersson et al. also reported that there was no correlation between the quality of the therapeutic alliance and the outcome of the included self-help trials. Thus, a conclusion was made cautiously that thepossibility of an existing therapeutic alliance in some of the trials has probably not influenced the results. On a theoretical level, it is still open to discussion whether theTable 3.

AC, active controls; PC, CBT Self-Help Interventions in Tinnitus 165absence of a therapeutic alliance is a core feature of self-help interventions. Second, only the data related to post- assessment were reported due to a lack of data. Thus, it is not known whether self-help interventions for tinnitus subjects are as efcacious as face-to-face therapies in the long term. In their systematic review of meta-analyses on guided self-help in depression and anxiety disorders, Van't Hof et al. (2009) conclude that there is a small-to-moderatedecline in post-test effect sizes for self- help interventions. Though the authors focus on other syndromes, it should be kept in mindwhen considering the efcacy of self- help interventions for tinnitus subjects. Finally, the sensitivity analysis indicates that the results of this study might be influenced by publication bias. The effect sizes for the comparison of the self-help interventions and the passive controls at post-assessment might have been slightly overestimated. When comparing self-help toface-to-face treatments, sensitivity analysis displays inconsistent ndings. With regard to the change scores, three out of the fourestimates are congruent with the calculated effect size. One of the estimates is contrary to the authors' ndings and indicates that self-help interventions are more effective than face-to-face treatments. With regard to the post-assessment data, two estimates supportthese ndings, whereas the other two indicate a superiority of the face-to-face controls over the self-help conditions. The comparisons withthe face-to-face controls have low power due to a small number of studies involved. Thus, the lack of stability in the ndings might bedue to publication bias and low statistical power. Some limitations have to be considered. First, there is a conceptual heterogeneity that makes a clear statement on the efcacy of self- help interventions difcult. For example, a keyissue in this discussion is how much pro- fessional contact is necessary and allowed under the name of self-help. The authors triedto solve this issue by including an inclusion criterion on the instruction time. But this operationalization can only be as good as thereported data in the studies, and most studies did not give an estimate on the instruction time. Thus, the raters had to decide based onimpressions, and the authors had to rely ontheir complete concordance on the inclusion of studies. Nevertheless, the present resultsrelate to interventions with a low instruction time that they referred to as self-help. Another important issue is the methodo- logical quality of the studies included. None ofthe authors' studies reached the cut-off for a good study quality. In the moderator analyses, influence of the study quality was not foundon the effect sizes. This deviates from the ndings meta-analyses on psychother- and Hesser, Weise, Zetterq-vist Westin et al. (2011) found a positive association between the study quality based on CTAM ratings and effect sizes. However,some other studies report that a highermethodological quality is associated with lower effect sizes (Altmann, 2002; Cuijpers, van Straten, Bohlmeijer, Hollon, & Anders-son, 2010). Hopefully, a future meta-analysis on this issue will yield more reliable estimates of the influence of the study quality on theeffect sizes in studies on the efcacy of self-help interventions for tinnitus. Another crucial point is the use of dependent data. Effect size estimates thatwere based on the change scores were not corrected for the dependencies caused by the repeated measures at pre- and post-assess-ment. Thus, these estimates are somewhatlarger than the population effect sizes (Dun- lap, 1996). Since none of the studies reported the correlation between pre- and post-assess-ment, adjustment could not be made for thedependencies in the data. The reader should also keep in mind that most of the studies reported intention-to-treatestimates. One of the three studies that were included based on completer data reported a very low attrition rate of 6% (Jasper et al.,2012). The other two reported attrition ratesof 23% (Konzag \u00a8m, & Lyttkens, 2002). Owing the respective comparisongroups, the Konzag study was only includedinto the comparisons between a self- help treatment and a face-to-face treatment, whereas the Andersson study was onlyincluded into the comparisons between self- help treatments and passive controls. Thus, a probable conclusion was made that attritionrates have only a small impact on the results.166 Nyenhuis, Golm and Kro \u00a8ner-Herwig COGNITIVE BEHAVIOUR THERAPYTo summarize, this review shows that self- help interventions are efcacious in reducingtinnitus distress and depressiveness in tinnitus subjects. Though the results of this study, to some extent, indicate a comparable effective-ness of self-help interventions and face-to-face treatments, the authors would have pleaded for a cautious interpretation of the ndings.There are only a few studies comparing self-help interventions with face-to-face treat- ments. A more solid database is needed before drawing conclusions on the role that self-help interventions might play in the health- care system. For the time-being, they would be recommended as a profound way to supporttinnitus patients that are not willing or able to take part in a face-to-face therapy.

A B S T R A C T Background This is an update of a Cochrane Review rst published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 1, 2005 and previously updated in 2007 and 2009. Idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSHL) is comm on and has a signicant effect on quality of life. Hyperbaric ox ygen therapy (HBOT) may improve oxygen supply to the inner ear and r esult in an improvement in hearing. Objectives T o assess the benets and harms of HBOT for treating ISSHL and /or tinnitus. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group T rials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled EMBASE; Abstracts; ICTR P and additional sources for published and unpublished trial s. The date of the most recent search was 2 May 2012, following previou s searches in 2009, 2007 and 2004. Selection criteria Randomised studies comparing the effect on ISSHL and tinnitus of HBOT and alternative therapies. Data collection and analysis Three authors evaluated the quality of trials using the 'Ris k of bias' tool and extracted data from the included trials. Main results Seven trials contributed to this review (392 participants). The studies were small and of generally poor quality. Pooled dat a from two trials did not show any signicant improvement in the chance of a 50% increase in hearing threshold on pure-tone average with HB OT (risk ratio (RR) with HBOT 1.53, 95% condence interval (CI) 0.85 t o 2.78, P = 0.16), but did show a signicantly increased chance Hyperbaricoxygenforidiopathicsuddensensorineuralhea ringlossandtinnitus(Review) Copyright\u00a92012TheCochraneCollaboration.PublishedbyJo pure-tone average (RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.8 4, P = 0.02). There was a 22% greater chance of improvement with HBOT , and the number needed to treat (NNT) to achieve one ex tra good outcome was 5 (95% CI 3 to 20). There was also an absolute improvement in average pure-tone audiometric th reshold following HBOT (mean greater wi th HBOT , 95% CI 1.5 to 29.8, P = 0.03). The signicance of any improve ment in tinnitus could not be assessed. There were no signicant improvements in hearing or tinnitus reported for chronic presentation (six months) of ISSHL and/o r tinnitus. Authors' conclusions For people with acute ISSHL, the application of HBOT signicant ly improved hearing, but the clinical signicance remains unclea r. We could not assess the effect of HBOT on tinnitus by pooled anal ysis. In view of the modest number of patients, methodologica l shortcomings and poor reporting, this result should be inter preted cautiously. An appropriately powered trial is justi ed to dene those patients (if any) who can be expected to derive most benet from H BOT . There is no evidence of a benecial effect of HBOT on chronic ISSHL or tinnitus and we do not recommend the use of HBOT for this purpose. P L A I N L A N G U A G E S U M M A R Y Hyperbaric oxygen for sudden hearing loss and tinnitus (rin ging in the ears) of unknown cause Idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSHL) is comm on and often results in permanent hearing loss. It therefore has a high impact on the well-being of those affected. Tinnitus (abnormal p ersistent noises or ringing in the ear) is similarly common an d often accompanies the hearing loss. Although the cause of these compla ints is not clear, they may be related to a lack of oxygen secondar y to a vascular problem not yet identied. Hyperbaric oxygen th erapy (HBOT) involves breathing pure oxygen in a specially des igned chamber and it is sometimes used as a treatment to increase the s upply of oxygen to the ear and brain in an attempt to reduce the severity of hearing loss and tinnitus. We found some evidence from seven small trials of generally po or quality, that hearing may be improved in people with ISSHL and possibly that tinnitus may also be improved. This may only be true if HBOT is used within two weeks of the onset of problems a nd there is no evidence that HBOT can help people who have been deaf for some months.

Copyright Published by Jo hn Wiley & Sons, Ltd. A B S T R A C T Background This is an update of a Cochrane review rst published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 4, 2006 and previously updated in 2009. Tinnitus is described as the perception of sound or noise in the absence of real acoustic stimulation. It has been compared with chronic pain, and may be associated with depression or depress ive symptoms which can affect quality of life and the ability to w ork. Antidepressant drugs have been used to treat tinnitus in pat ients with and without depressive symptoms. Objectives T o assess the effectiveness of antidepressants in the treatm ent of tinnitus and to ascertain whether any benet is due to a d irect tinnitus effect or a secondary effect due to treatment of concomitant depre ssive states. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group T rials Register; the Cochrane Central ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 5 Jan uary 2012. Selection criteria Randomised controlled clinical studies of antidepressant dru gs versus placebo in patients with tinnitus. Data collection and analysis T wo authors critically appraised the retrieved studies and ex tracted data independently. Where necessary we contacted study a uthors for further information. Antidepressantsforpatientswithtinnitus(Review) Copyright\u00a92012TheCochraneCollaboration.PublishedbyJo hnWiley&Sons,Ltd.Main results Six trials involving 610 patients were included. T rial quali ty was generally low. Four of the trials looked at the effect of tricyclic antidepressants on tinnitus, investigating 405 patients. One trial investigated the effect of a selective serotonin reu ptake inhibitor (SSRI) in a group of 120 patients. One study investigated trazodone , an atypical antidepressant, versus placebo. Only the trial u sing the SSRI drug reached the highest quality standard. None of the other i ncluded trials met the highest quality standard, due to use of inadequate outcome measures, large drop-out rates or failure to separate the effects on tinnitus from the effects on symptoms of anxiety and depression. All the trials assessing tricyclic antidepressa nts suggested that there was a slight improvement in tinnitu s but these effects may have been attributable to methodological bias. The trial that investigated the SSRI drug found no overall improvemen t in any of the validated outcome measures that were used in the study alt hough there was possible benet for a subgroup that received h igher doses of the drug. This observation merits further investig ation. In the trial investigating trazodone, the results sh owed an improvement in tinnitus intensity and in quality of life after treatment , but in neither case reached statistical signicance. Reports of side effects including sedation, sexual dysfunction and dry mouth were comm on. Authors' conclusions There is as yet insufcient evidence to say that antidepressan t drug therapy improves tinnitus. P L A I N L A N G U A G E S U M M A R Y Antidepressants for patients with tinnitus Tinnitus is described as the perception of sound or noise in the absence of real acoustic stimulation, and it is frequently ass ociated with depression or depressive symptoms. Six studies involv ing a total of 610 patients matched the inclusion criteria for th is review. Four evaluated three tricyclic antidepressant agents (amitri ptyline, nortriptyline and trimipramine) for the treatmen t of tinnitus. These studies did not nd enough evidence to prove the efcacy of these agents in the management of tinnitus. One study evaluated pa roxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant, a nd one evaluated trazodone, an atypical antidepressant. Nei ther of these studies showed benet of paroxetine or trazodone in the treatment of tinnitus. Side effects, though relatively minor, were common in all groups of antidepressants.

A B S T R A C T Background This is an update of a Cochrane Review rst published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 12, 2010. Tinnitus is described as the perception of sound or noise in the absence of real acoustic stimulation. Numerous management st rategies have been tried for this potentially debilitating, heterog eneous symptom. External noise has been used as a management tool for tinnitus, in different capacities and with different philosophical inte nt, for over a century. Objectives T o assess the effectiveness of sound-creating devices (including hearing aids) in the management of tinnitus in adults. Prima ry outcome measures were changes in the loudness or severity of tinnitus and/or impact on quality of life. Secondary outcome measures we re change in pure-tone auditory thresholds and adverse effects of treat ment. Search methods We searched the Cochrane ENT Group T rials ICTRP and additional sources f or published and unpublished trials. The date of the most rece nt search was 8 February 2012. Selection criteria Prospective randomised controlled trials recruiting adults w ith persistent, distressing, subjective tinnitus of any aet iology in which the management strategy included maskers, noise-generating dev ice and/or hearing aids, used either as the sole management to ol or in combination with other strategies, including counselling. Data collection and analysis T wo authors independently examined the 387 search results to identify studies for inclusion in the review, of which 33 were p otentially relevant. The update searches in 2012 retrieved no further po tentially relevant studies. Both authors extracted data ind ependently. Soundtherapy(masking)inthemanagementoftinnitusinadu lts(Review) Copyright\u00a92012TheCochraneCollaboration.PublishedbyJo hnWiley&Sons,Ltd.Main results Six trials (553 participants) are included in this review. Stud ies were varied in design, with signicant heterogeneity in t he evaluation of subjective tinnitus perception, with different scores, scales , tests and questionnaires as well as variance in the outcome me asures used to assess the improvement in tinnitus sensation/quality of li fe. This precluded meta-analysis of the data. There was no long -term follow-up. We assessed the risk of bias as medium in three and high in thre e studies. Following analysis of the data, no signicant chang e was seen in the loudness of tinnitus or the overall severity of tinnit us following the use of sound therapy compared to other interv entions such as counselling, 'tinnitus retraining' and sure to environmental sounds. No side effects or signicant morbidity were reported from the use of sound-creating devices. Authors' conclusions The limited data from the included studies failed to show stro ng evidence of the efcacy of sound therapy in tinnitus manageme nt. The absence of conclusive evidence should not be interpreted as e vidence of lack of effectiveness. The lack of quality research in t his area, in addition to the common use of combined approaches (heari ng therapy plus counselling) in the management of tinnitus ar e, in part, responsible for the lack of conclusive evidence. Other comb ined forms of management, such as tinnitus retraining therap y, have been subject to a Cochrane Review. Optimal management may invo lve multiple strategies. P L A I N L A N G U A G E S U M M A R Y Sound therapy (masking) in the management of tinnitus in adu lts Tinnitus can be described as a perception of sound that is not rel ated to an external acoustic source. Subjective tinnitus is not heard by anyone else but the sufferer. At present no particular treatm ent for tinnitus has been found effective in all patients. Sound therapy (also known as masking devices) was introduced on the principle of distraction - if sound, usually 'white noise' (similar to the noise made by an out of tune radio) is played it may be suf cient to distract a patient from hearing the noises produced by their tinnitus; the new sound will mask out the patient's tinnitus sounds. The objective of this review was to assess whether sound thera py is effective in the management of patients suffering from t innitus. Six trials (553 participants) were included in this review. Fol lowing analysis of the data, no signicant change was seen in th e loudness of tinnitus or the overall severity of tinnitus following the u se of sound therapy compared to other interventions such as pat ient education, 'relaxation techniques', 'tinnitus and exposure to environmen tal sounds. No side effects were reported from the use of sound-creating devices. The limited data from the studies included in the review faile d to show strong evidence of the efcacy of sound therapy in tinni tus management, however the absence of conclusive evidence should n ot be interpreted as evidence of lack of effectiveness. There is a lack of quality research in this area and also combined approaches (he aring therapy plus counselling) are commonly used in the manag ement of tinnitus. lts(Review) Copyright\u00a92012TheCochraneCollaboration.PublishedbyJo hnWiley&Sons,Ltd.CLINICAL RESEARCH Open Access Acupuncture for the treatment of tinnitus: a systematic review of Background: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has frequently been used to treat tinnitus, and acupuncture is a particularly popular option. The objective of this review was to assess the evidence concerning the effectiveness of acupuncture as a treatment for tinnitus. Methods: Fourteen databases were searched from the dates of their creation to July 4th, 2012. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) were included if acupuncture was used as the sole treatment. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess the risk of bias. Results: A total of 9 RCTs met all the inclusion criteria. Their methodological quality was mostly poor. Five RCTs compared the effectiveness of acupuncture or electroacupuncture with sham acupuncture for treating tinnitus. The results failed to show statistically significant improvements. Two RCTs compared a short one-time scalp acupuncture treatment with the use of penetrating sham acupuncture at non-acupoints in achieving subjective symptom relief on a visual analog scale; these RCTs demonstrated significant positive effects with scalp acupuncture. Two RCTs compared acupuncture with conventional drug treatments. One of these RCTs demonstrated that acupuncture had statistically significant effects on the response rate in patients with nervous tinnitus, but the other RCT did not demonstrate significant effects in patients with senile tinnitus. Conclusions: The number, size and quality of the RCTs on the effectiveness of acupuncture for the treatment of tinnitus are not sufficient for drawing definitive conclusions. Further rigorous RCTs that overcome the many limitations of the current evidence are warranted. Keywords: Acupuncture, Tinnitus, Systematic review, Alternative medicine, Effectiveness Background Tinnitus is a common yet poorly understood disorder [1]. It is defined as the perception of sounds for which there is no external acoustic source [2]. Tinnitus is often associated with sudden, temporary hearing loss, and it can have a powerful detrimental impact on a patient 's quality of life. Tinnitus may result in sleep disturbances, work impairments and distress [3]. Approximately 10-15% of the general population experiences a persistent sensa- tion of tinnitus. Tinnitus occurs most commonly among the elderly, but it can occur at any age. In many patients,the emergence of tinnitus occurs long after the disappear- ance of the underlying medical condition [2,4]. The pathophysiological mechanism of tinnitus is still unclear, and the disease is difficult to treat effectively [5]. There is firm clinical evidence that cognitive behavioral therapy, which is a type of psychotherapy, improves the quality of life of tinnitus patients [6]. However, no other therapies, in- cluding pharmacological treatment, can be considered to have well-established effectiveness in reducing tinnitus symptoms and the related quality of life [7-9]. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has frequently been used to treat tinnitus, and acupuncture is a particularly popular option. Acupuncture is a thera- peutic technique involving the insertion and manipula- tion of needles in the body. The use of acupuncture for treating the symptoms of tinnitus is similar to its use for pain relief because both conditions produce disagreeable* Correspondence: drmslee@gmail.com Equal contributors 6Medical Research Division, Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, Daejeon 305-811, South Korea 7Complementary Medicine, Peninsula Medical School, University of Exeter, Exeter, UK Full list of author information is available at the end of the article \u00a9 2012 Kim et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2012, 12:97 Page 3 of 10 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6882/12/97sensory and emotional experiences [10]. The rationale for the use of acupuncture is the principle that a needle stimulus may elicit an electrical charge that triggers ac-tion potentials to rebalance the neurophysiological sys- tem or the function of the olivocochlear nucleus [11,12]. In the theory of traditional Asian medicine, tinnitus isclosely connected to the yin-yang imbalance of the kid- neys and of other internal organs such as the gallbladder because channels originating from these organs flowthrough the ear. Acupuncture is considered to be able to balance this skewed condition [13]. Several studies have reported that acupuncture can generate immediate relieffrom both the loudness and the disturbing quality of tin- nitus, thereby resulting in a significant improvement in the quality of life [14,15]. Other studies have failed toshow the effectiveness of the approach [16-18]. Dobie [7] summarized the clinical effectiveness of vari- ous alternative therapies, including acupuncture, intreating tinnitus. One systematic review published 12 years ago reported that the 6 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) cited did not produce convincingly positiveeffects [19]. However, these reviews did not perform sys- tematic assessments [7] or are out of date [19]. The aim of this systematic review was to critically evaluate the current evidence from RCTs on the use of acupuncture as a symptomatic treatment for patients with tinnitus. Methods Data sources The following databases were searched from their dates of creation through July 4th, 2012: MEDLINE, AMED, EMBASE, CINAHL, five Korean medical Information, DBPIA, Korea Institute of Sci- ence and Technology Information, KoreaMed and the Research Information Service System), four Chinesemedical databases (China National Knowledge Infra- structure databases: Chinese Academic Journals, the Century Journal Project, the China Doctoral/Master Dis-sertation full text database and the China Conference Proceedings full text database) and the Cochrane Library (2012, Issue 4). Two sets of search terms were used. Thefirst set included terms for acupuncture, and the second set included terms for tinnitus (Additional file 1). The two sets were combined using the Boolean operatorAND. The term 'acupuncture 'would also capture puncture and auricular acupuncture therapy. TheKorean and Chinese terms for acupuncture and tinnitus were used in the Korean and Chinese databases. We also performed electronic searches of the relevant journals(Focus on Alternative and Complementary Therapies and Forschende Komplementarmedizin) through June 2012. Additionally, the reference lists of all the papersobtained were searched. Furthermore, our own personal files were manually searched. Hardcopies of all articles were obtained and read in full. Study selection Types of studies All prospective RCTs and quasi-RCTs were included in this review. Trials in which acupuncture was performed as part of a complex intervention were excluded. Weexcluded case studies, case series, qualitative studies, un- controlled studies and controlled trials without randomization methods. Trials published in the form ofdissertations and abstracts were included. No language restrictions were imposed. Types of participants Studies of patients of both sexes and any age with any type of tinnitus were included. Types of interventions Studies investigating the use of any type of needle acu-puncture, with or without electrical stimulation, in tin- nitus patients were included. We also included studies that examined the use of auricular acupuncture andscalp acupuncture in tinnitus patients. Trials with acu- puncture as a concomitant treatment with other types of complementary therapies were excluded. Types of controls We included studies with control groups that receivedno treatment, sham acupuncture (i.e., penetrating inser- tion of a needle at a point other than a valid acupunc- ture point (a non-acupoint), superficial insertion at anacupuncture point or non-penetrating acupuncture at an acupuncture point or a non-acupoint) and relevant conventional drug therapies for tinnitus. Trials withdesigns that did not allow for the evaluation of the efficacy of the acupuncture (e.g., using other types of complementary therapies in the control group or com-paring two forms of acupuncture or electroacupuncture) were excluded. Types of outcome measures Studies were required to include either the symptom se- verity or the relief of symptoms in tinnitus as outcomemeasures. Other clinically important outcomes included the quality of life, the response rate (i.e., responder vs. non-responder) and adverse events. Data extraction and quality assessment Hard copies of all articles that appeared promising basedon their abstract were obtained and read in full. All arti- cles were read by three independent reviewers (JIK, MSL, and TYC), and data from the articles wereKim et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2012, 12:97 Page 4 of 10 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6882/12/97validated and extracted according to pre-defined criteria (Table 1). The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane clas- sification of seven criteria: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, patient blinding, assessor blind- ing, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome report-ing and other risks of bias [24]. Because it is difficult to blind therapists to the use of acupuncture, we assessed patient and assessor blinding separately. We assignedlow risk of bias for assessor blinding if the tinnitus wasassessed by someone other than the therapist or the pa- tient who did not know the group assignments. Dis- agreements were resolved by discussion between thethree reviewers (JIK, MSL, and TYC).

Five studies employed mixed interventions that included acupuncture in the active treatment group, in- cluding electroacupuncture plus herbal medicine injec- tion [25], acupuncture plus gua-sha and cupping [26],acupuncture plus mixed administration of herbal and conventional medicines [27] and acupuncture plus herbal medicine ingestion [28,29]. Nine studies employed inter-ventions of unproven efficacy in the control group, including another type of acupuncture [30-36], physio- therapy [37], and biofeedback in one control groupand a third control medication in another group [38]. Nine RCTs met our inclusion criteria, and their key data are listed in Table 1 [12,15-18,20-23]. Three of theincluded RCTs were from Denmark [16,18,21], two were from China [22,23], two were from Brazil [12,15], one was from England [17], and one was from Korea [20].Five of the included trials adopted a two-armed parallel group design [12,15,18,20,23], two used a three-armed parallel group design [21,22], and two RCTs employed acrossover design [16,17]. Five trials employed manual acupuncture [16,18,20,22,23], one used electroacupunc- ture [17], one used manual acupuncture and EA [21],and two used scalp needle acupuncture [12,15]. The number of treatment sessions ranged from one to 30 sessions lasting from 15 seconds to 30 minutes each.The acupuncture points were selected according to trad- itional Chinese medicine (TCM) theory in eight RCTs [12,15-18,21-23] and protocol of previous study in oneRCT [20] (Table 2). Risk of bias Four RCTs employed adequate methods of random se- quence generation [12,15,20,23]. Two RCTs had a low risk of bias [20,23], but the risk of bias in the sequencegeneration was high in 2 RCTs [12,15]. One RCTemployed allocation concealment [16]. Six of the 8 RCTs adopted both assessor and subject blinding [12,15-18,20], and another RCT adopted only assessorblinding [21]. Three RCTs had a low risk of bias due to incomplete outcome data criteria [16,20,21]. The risk of bias in selective outcome reporting was low in threeRCTs [20-22] and high in one RCT [23] (Table 3). Outcomes Acupuncture vs. sham acupuncture Seven RCTs tested the effectiveness of several types of acupuncture on symptoms of tinnitus comparingwith penetrating or non-penetrating acupunctures [12,15-18,20,21]. compared manual acupunc- ture or electroacupuncture on the symptoms of tinnitus to penetrating or non-penetrating acupuncture on acu- points [16-18,20,21]. The results failed to demonstratestatistically significant improvements in the periodic index, annoyance, loudness, awareness, Tinnitus Handi- cap Inventory, symptoms in visual analogue scale and re-sponse rate, although differences were found in some of subjective general evaluation of the treatment. Two RCTs compared the effectiveness of a short one- time scalp acupuncture treatment to penetrating sham acupuncture at non-acupoints in achieving subjective symptom relief on a visual analog scale and in reducingthe amplitude of otoacoustic emissions (OAE) [12,15]. One of these trials demonstrated significant effects of scalp acupuncture on symptom relief [12,15], but theother trial failed to significantly reduce OAE [12,15]. Acupuncture vs. conventional drug therapy Two RCTs compared acupuncture with conventional drug treatments, including Bandazol and Flunarizine hydrochloride [22,23].

Discussion Few sham-controlled RCTs have tested the effectivenessof acupuncture on tinnitus. Collectively, the results of the existing studies have failed to demonstrate specific effects of acupuncture. Only two of the 7 sham-controlled RCTs suggested positive effects. These two RCTs demonstrated beneficial effects of acupuncture for tinnitus when acupuncture was compared with drugtherapy. However, the studies were too small to generate reliable findings. Both of the trials had small sample sizes [n<40 for each group] and were thus prone to a type II error or an exaggeration of the treatment effect [39,40]. Overall, our findings provided no convincing evidence that acupuncture is beneficial for treating tinnitus. We identified 6 new RCTs that had not been examined in previous reviews [12,15,20-23]. Nevertheless, the results of our review are similar to those of a previous review [19]that showed that acupuncture was not supported by sound evidence as a treatment for tinnitus. The previous review expressed concern regarding the poor methodologicalquality of the primary studies included. Although most of the RCTs included in the present re- view employed sham-control groups, none was flawless.Five RCTs included fewer than 10 sessions [15-17,21,22], which may be insufficient for obtaining a positive clinical outcome. Two trials provided acupuncture in only a sin-gle session [15,22]. The likelihood of an inherent bias in the studies was assessed based on the description of the methods of randomization, blinding, and allocation con-cealment. Most of the included trials had a high risk of bias. Low-quality trials are more likely to overestimate the effect size [41,42]. None of the studies used a powercalculation, and the sample sizes were usually small. Details regarding the dropouts and withdrawals were described in three trials [16,20,21]. However, the otherRCTs did not report this information, which can lead to an exclusion or attrition bias. Consequently, the reliabil- ity of the evidence presented here is clearly limited. Several sham acupuncture methods have been pro- posed for acupuncture trials. These methods include the penetrating insertion of needles at non-acupoints[12,15,16], superficially puncturing the non- acupoints [17]. In the present systematic review, noevidence for the superiority of real acupuncture over sham acupuncture was found, regardless of the acupuncture technique employed. Non-penetrating sham acupuncturehas been reported to be superior to placebo tablets in reducing subjective pain [43]. This finding may suggestthat most of the effects of needle acupuncture are non- specific in nature. Two RCTs from China compared acupuncture with conventional drug treatment and demonstrated positive effects on at least one outcome. However, the current evidence for the effectiveness of these drug therapies fortreating tinnitus is not clear, and some drug therapies have been shown to be less effective than other forms of therapy. Additionally, the risk of bias in these RCTs washigh, and the findings may be overestimated. Conse- quently, the evidence comparing acupuncture with drug therapies for the treatment of tinnitus is not clear. Two RCTs compared the efficacy of scalp acupuncture with sham acupuncture for treating tinnitus[12,15]. Al- though the results demonstrated significant benefitsfrom the scalp acupuncture, these trials also had a high risk of bias in randomization and allocation conceal- ment. Consequently, these trials are likely to have over-estimated the effect size. The rationale for the acupuncture point selection was stated in all of the included RCTs. The authors in eightof the included RCTs quoted traditional Chinese theory as the justification for their point selection and used acupoints from the previous study in one RCT [20].Needle stimulation resulting in the desired sensation (de-qi ) in the patient is considered to be important for achieving maximal effects. This needle sensation wasconsidered in the six RCTs included [16-18,20-22]. In the present data set, we found no evidence that the pres- ence or absence of de-qi exerted an important influenceon the clinical outcome. Most of the included RCTs adopted questionnaires or self-reported inventories concerning the symptomsrelated to tinnitus. However, it is important to use only validated questionnaires. Unless the reliability and valid- ity of the outcome measures used have been established,the data derived from the measures are subject to bias, and comparisons between the results of different studies are difficult. In the included studies, several types of active acu- puncture treatment were used: five RCTs used trad- RCT used electroacupuncture [17]; one RCT used both body and electroacupuncture [21];and two RCTs used scalp acupuncture [12,15]. For all of these different types of needle stimulation, de-qi (i.e., sensation of needling in both practitioners and patients)might be a very important therapeutic factor in both traditional Asian medical viewpoint and neurophysiology [29]. However, the underlying neurophysiologic mechan-ism of these different acupuncture types according to the stimulating region (body versus scalp) and/or stimu- lating methods (manual versus electrical stimulation),might not be the same [44-46]. Therefore, the effect ofKim et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2012, 12:97 Page 8 of 10 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6882/12/97different type of acupuncture on tinnitus should be interpreted apart and cannot be simply pooled altogether in future meta-analysis. The experience and the number of the acupuncture practitioners used can influence the results of acupunc- ture clinical trials. Of the included trials, one trial [21]reported that one acupuncturist with more than 10 years of experience administered all of the treatments of real and sham acupuncture. No information was reportedregarding the acupuncture practitioners in the other trials; consequently, we do not know whether the acu- puncture was administered by well-trained practitioners. Reports of adverse events from acupuncture are scarce, and those that have been reported are mild [47,48]. Adverse effects from acupuncture were reportedin one of the reviewed RCTs [15]. Two cases of signifi- cant pain from the needles were reported. The fact that several RCTs did not clearly mention adverse effectsdemonstrates the poor reporting standards of acupunc- ture research. Our review has a number of important limitations. Al- though substantial efforts were made to retrieve all RCTs on the subject, we cannot be certain that our search was exhaustive. Moreover, selective publishing and reportingare major causes of bias that should be considered [49- 51]. It is conceivable that several negative RCTs remain unpublished, and this may distort the overall understand-ing of acupuncture. Further limitations include the pau- city and the often-suboptimal methodological quality of the primary data. These factors influence both the qual-ity and the quantity of the research reviewed. In total, these factors limit the conclusiveness of this systematic review. Conclusion In conclusion, the evidence from sham-controlledRCTs testing the effectiveness of acupuncture for the treatment of tinnitus is not yet convincing. The number, size and quality of the RCTs are not sufficient for draw-ing definitive conclusions. Further rigorous RCTs that overcome the many limitations of the current evidence are warranted. However, in clinical practice, acupuncturetreatment by experienced and licensed practitioners might be an option for tinnitus patients, especially when the patients refuse psychological behavioral therapy,which is the only treatment with clinical evidence dem- onstrating improved quality of life in tinnitus patients. Additionally, because acupuncture is a safe procedureand because there is no current treatment for which clinical efficacy has been demonstrated for specific tin- nitus symptoms, acupuncture is an option for the treat-ment of tinnitus symptoms in patients who request this procedure in the clinic.Additional file Additional file 1: Supplement 1.

A B S T R A C T Background Tinnitus is the perception of sound or noise in the absence of an external or internal acoustic stimulation. It is a common and p otentially distressing symptom for which no adequate therapy exists. Objectives T o assess the effectiveness of anticonvulsants in patients wi th chronic tinnitus. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group S pecialised Register, CENTRAL (2010, Issue 2), MEDLINE, EMBASE, bibliographies and additional sources for publishe d and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 26 May 2010. Selection criteria We selected randomised controlled trials in patients with chro nic tinnitus comparing orally administered anticonvulsants with placebo. The primary outcome was improvement in tinnitus measured wit h validated questionnaires. Secondary outcomes were improve ment in tinnitus measured with self-assessment scores, improvement in global well-being or accompanying symptoms, and adverse dru g effects. Data collection and analysis Three authors assessed risk of bias and extracted data indepe ndently. Main results Seven trials (453 patients) were included in this review. Thes e studies investigated four different anticonvulsants: gab apentin, car- bamazepine, lamotrigine and flunarizine. The risk of bias of most studies was 'high' or 'unclear'. Three studies included a validated questionnaire (primary outcome). None of them showed a signica nt positive effect of anticonvulsants. One study showed a sign icant negative effect of gabapentin compared to placebo with an increa se in Tinnitus Questionnaire (TQ) score of rdised mean difference (SMD) 0.82, 95% condence interval (CI) 0.07 to 1. 58). A second study showed a positive, non-signicant effect of gabapentin with a difference compared to placebo of 2.4 points o n the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) (SMD -0.11, 95% CI - 0.48 to 0.25). When the data from these two studies are pooled no effect of gabapentin is found (SMD 0.07, 95% CI -0.26 to 0.40). Anticonvulsantsfortinnitus(Review) Copyright\u00a92011TheCochraneCollaboration.PublishedbyJo hnWiley&Sons,Ltd.A third study reported no differences on the THI after treatme nt with gabapentin compared to placebo (exact numbers could not be extracted from the article). A meta-analysis of 'any positive effect' (yes versus no) based o n a self-assessment score (secondary outcome) showed a small favo urable effect of anticonvulsants (RD 14%, 22%). A of 'near or total eradication of tinnitus annoyance' showed no effect of anticonvulsants (risk difference (RD) 4%, 95% CI -2% to 11%). Side effects of the anticonvulsants used were experienced by 18% of patients. Authors' conclusions Current evidence regarding the effectiveness of anticonvulsa nts in patients with tinnitus has signicant risk of bias. The re is no evidence from studies performed so far to show that anticonvulsants ha ve a large positive effect in the treatment of tinnitus but a sm all effect (of doubtful clinical signicance) has been demonstrated . P L A I N L A N G U A G E S U M M A R Y Anticonvulsants for tinnitus Tinnitus is the perception of sound or noise in the absence of ex ternal acoustic stimulation. It is a common and potentially di stressing symptom for which no adequate therapy exists. The pathophysi ology of tinnitus has been compared to phantom limb pain there fore anticonvulsant drugs have been proposed as a possible therap y. This review includes seven studies (six low-quality and one hig h-quality) of four different anticonvulsants bamazepine, flunarizine and lamotrigine). We found that anticonvulsants d o not have a benecial effect in the treatment of tinnitus.

Copyright Published by Jo hn Wiley & Sons, Ltd. A B S T R A C T Background Tinnitus is the perception of sound, in the ear or in the head, i n the absence of any external acoustic stimulation. Repetitiv e transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive means of inducin g electrical currents in the brain, and has received increasing at tention in recent years for the treatment of many neuropsychiatric dis orders, including tinnitus. Objectives T o assess the effectiveness and safety of rTMS versus placebo i n patients with tinnitus. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group T rials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. Th e date of the most recent search was 24 May 2011. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of rTMS versus sham rTMS. Data collection and analysis T wo review authors reviewed the titles, abstracts and keywor ds of all records retrieved. Three review authors independen tly collected and extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of the trials . Main results Five trials comprising of 233 participants met our inclusion cri teria. Each study described the use of a different rTMS device th at delivered different waveforms at different frequencies. Al l ve trials were relatively small studies but generally the y demonstrated a low risk of bias. When considering the impact of tinnitus on patients' quality of life, the results of only one study demonstrated a statistica lly signicant improvement in Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) scores at fo ur months follow-up (dened as a 'partial improvement' by the s tudy (THI reduction of 21% to 80%)) when low-frequency rTMS wa s compared with a sham control treatment. However, no statistically signicant improvement was demonstrated by an other two studies that considered rTMS at the same frequency. F urthermore, Repetitivetranscranialmagneticstimulationfortinnitu s(Review) Copyright\u00a92011TheCochraneCollaboration.PublishedbyJo hnWiley&Sons,Ltd.this single positive nding should be taken in the context of t he many different variables which were recorded at many differ ent points in time by the study authors. In accordance with our pre-specied subgroup analysis we extracte d the data from one study to consider the differential effectiv eness Hz). In doing this we were able to demonstrat e a statistically signicant difference between rTMS employing a frequency of 1 Hz and the sham group when considering tinnitus severity and disability after four months follow-up ('partial' improv ement). However, no statistically signicant difference monstrated between 10 Hz and 25 Hz rTMS, and the sham control group, when con sidering the severity and disability of tinnitus at four mon ths follow-up. When considering tinnitus loudness in patients undergoing rT MS we were able to demonstrate a statistically signicant redu ction in tinnitus loudness when the results of two studies were poole d (risk ratio 4.17, 95% condence interval 1.30 to 13.40). Howeve r, this nding was based on two small trials and consequently the cond ence interval was particularly wide. No serious adverse effects were reported in any of the trials. Authors' conclusions There is very limited support for the use of low-frequency rTMS for the treatment of patients with tinnitus. When considering the impact of tinnitus on patients' quality of life, support is fr om a single study with a low risk of bias based on a single outcom e measure at a single point in time. When considering the impact on tinnitu s loudness, this is based on the analysis of pooled data with a large condence interval. Studies suggest that rTMS is a safe treatment for tinnitus in the short-term, however there were insufcient data to provid e any support for the safety of this treatment in the long-term. More prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-bli nd studies with large sample sizes are needed to conrm the eff ectiveness of rTMS for tinnitus patients. Uniform, validated, tinnitu s-specic questionnaires and measurement scales should be use d in future studies. P L A I N L A N G U A G E S U M M A R Y Transcranial magnetic stimulation for tinnitus Tinnitus can be described as the experience of sound in the ear or in the head. Subjective tinnitus is not heard by anyone else. T he exact cause of tinnitus remains unknown. At present no particular tr eatment has been found effective in all patients. Recently, re searchers have been able to image the brain using specialised techniques (such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positr on emission tomography (PET)). This has led us to believe that high spontaneous neuronal activity in the central auditory system and associated areas may responsible for the perception of tinnit us. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive means of inducing electrical currents in the brain and can decrease this neuronal activity. The purpose of this Cochrane Review wa s to assess the effectiveness and safety of rTMS for the treatment of tinnitus. Our search for studies retrieved 283 articles. Of these, ve tr ials comprising 233 tinnitus patients met our inclusion criter ia and were included in the review. The rst study considered the use of 'complex waveform rTMS', t he second looked at the use of high-frequency rTMS, and the other three studies considered the use of low-frequency rTMS. We foun d that the use resulted in 'partial impro vement' in tinnitus severity and disability in one study, however th ese results were not replicated in two other studies that consi dered rTMS at the same frequency. Furthermore, this single positive ndin g should be taken in the context of the many different variable s which were recorded at many different points in time by the study authors . We were able to demonstrate an improvement in tinnitus loud ness in patients undergoing rTMS when we combined the results of two o ther studies. rTMS is a safe treatment for patients with tinnitus in the sho rt-term, however no data were available to verify safety in th e long-term.

What Is the Best Imaging Modality in Evaluating Patients With Unilateral Pulsatile Tinnitus? Syed F. Ahsan, MD, FACS; Kathleen Yaremchuk, MD BACKGROUND Pulsatile tinnitus (PT) is a relatively rare cause of tinnitus. It makes up about 4% of patients with tinnitus,which in turn affects up to 10% of the population. 1PT can be described as objective or subjective, as well asvenous, arterial, or nonvascular. About 20% of PTpatients will have objective tinnitus. Incidence of abnor-mal, often treatable, structural findings in patients withPT has been noted to be high, ranging from 44% to 91%. 1 PT can be a result of vascular as well as neoplasticcauses, and if left undiagnosed, it can lead to significantmorbidity and mortality. Overlooking an aneurysm or atumor maybe catastrophic for the patient; therefore, fur-ther investigation is highly recommended. In this BestPractice review, we aim to evaluate the various imagingmodalities and determine which may be the best initialtest in patients presenting with unilateral PT. LITERATURE REVIEW PT is often due to the transmission of vibrations from turbulent blood flow to the cochlea. Objective PT isaudible to the examining physician. Vascular abnormal-ities are the most common radiological findings in thesepatients. The diagnosis is made through a complete neu-rotological examination, including otoscopy and ausculta-tion of the external ear canal, the periauricular area, andthe neck. 2,3In the elderly, the most common causes of PT are arteriosclerotic plaques and stenosis of vessels in thehead and neck. 4If the initial evaluation reveals a mass in the middle ear, a CT scan of the temporal bone withcontrast is the most helpful initial test. The three mostcommon entities in this situation are high-riding jugular bulb, aberrant internal carotid artery (ICA), include endolymphatic sac tumors, vascular metastasis, extension of intracranialmeningioma, and facial nerve hemangiomas. If the patient has an audible bruit around the peri- auricular region, a CT angiogram may be the best first testto perform. If that is normal and there is a high index of sus-picion, a four-vessel angiogram is appropriate to assess foraneurysm, dissection, or arteriovenous malformations. 4,5 However, the dilemma occurs when a patient presents with unilateral PT without a middle ear mass or audiblebruit. It is important to compartmentalize the evaluation interms of venous, arterial, and nonvascular PT. Venous PT isdetermined by the finding that the tinnitus subsides by gen-tle pressure over the neck vessels on the side of the symp-tom. In older patients without an audible bruit but with ahistory of transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular acci-dent, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, or smoking, a suspicion for atherosclerotic carotid artery disease should be maintained. 1,4These patients are best evaluated by duplex carotid ultrasound and echocardiogram. In obesefemales with associated headaches, hearing loss, andblurred vision, magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic reso-nance venogram (MRI/MRV) should initial hypertension (IIH).Radiographic findings of venous empty the posterior globes, and distension of the peri-optic arachnoid spaces have been described in such cases. 1 If indicated, a definitive diagnosis of IIH can be made bymeasuring the opening pressure at lumbar puncture. Othercauses of venous are of PT are superior semicircular canal dehiscenceand otosclerosis. 3,4These entities are best visualized with a CT scan. Therefore, an initial test for most patients withvenous PT not suspicious for IIH is with a computed tomog-raphy angiogram/computed tomography will evaluate both the bony structure sur-rounding the ear as well as the vasculature with less risksthan would the definitive four-vessel angiogram. 4 CTA/CTV appears to be a promising initial imaging in most cases of PT. Narvid et al. evaluated thebenefits of CTA/CTV in patient with PT. 5The authors compared seven patients with angiographic-proven duralFrom the Department of Otolaryngolog-Head and Neck Surgery, Henry Ford Health Systems, Detroit, Michigan, U.S.A.

Ahsan, MD, Department of Otolaryngology, Henry Ford Tinnitus 284arterio-venous fistula (DAVF) with seven age-matched controls with PT but no DAVF. They proposed that the presence of asymmetrically visible and enlarged arterial feeding vessels, shaggy sinus/tentorium, and asymmetricjugular-venous attenuation had a sensitivity of in identifying DAVF. 5MRI/MRA evalu- ation have yielded a wide range of sensitivities for vascu-lar pathology, ranging from 50% to 100%. Shweel et al.report that MRI/MRA scans diagnosed the cause of PT innine of 27 patients. 2Two patients were subsequently diag- nosed with small ICA aneurysm via angiogram, whichwas missed in the initial MRI/MRA study. The authorsreport an overall sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of88%, with an error rate of 15% in diagnosing the cause ofPT. 2However, it is also important to note that MRI cannot evaluate osseous pathology as well as CT-based imaging.5 Schoeff et al. also report a 23% incidence of SSDD inpatients with PT compared to 1.2% among asymptomaticpatients. 3This is best identified with a CT or CTA. In evaluating arterial subjective PT, the most widely performed tests are MRI/MRA, CTA, or a four-vesselangiogram. Both MRI/MRA and CTA are useful in evalu-ating PT; however, MRI/MRA is limited by poor bonyresolution, flow, and artifacts related to air-fat interface.It is felt that the initial test in these cases should beginwith a CTA. Due to cost and risks of complications, afour-vessel angiogram should not be used in most cases. 4 BEST PRACTICE Deciding on the initial radiographic evaluation in patients with unilateral PT can be challenging due tothe many causes as well as the questionable results ofsome of the imaging findings. Recent studies have shownan increase in the cases of SSDD, which is best visual- ized on a CT scan. In addition, sensitivity and specificity analysis have shown that CTA may be the best initial test in patients with unilateral subjective PT. Forpatients with objective PT with no middle ear mass, aCTA is the best initial exam. For those others with sub-jective unilateral PT, it is important to distinguishbetween venous and arterial PT. For patients with signsand symptoms of IIH, MRI/MRV is the appropriate ini-tial study. And for the remaining cases of venous andarterial PT, consider CTA as the best initial study due tosafety and broad effectiveness (Fig. 1). LEVEL OF EVIDENCE All five of the articles in this review were level 4 (retrospective studies and nonsystematic reviews). Therewere no randomized control trials or systematic reviews looking at the role of imaging in evaluation patients with unilateral PT. There is a need for a prospectivestudy comparing the sensitivity and specificity of thevarious imaging modalities. BIBLIOGRAPHY 1. Madani M, Hamdy B.

Definition: Pulsatile tinnitus is the type of ear noise that is perceived as a rhythmic pulsing that is often in time with the heartbeat. It can be experienced as a thumping or whooshing sound. It is sometimes referred to as vascular tinnitus because in the majority of cases, it i s related to disturbances in blood flow . Unlike tinnitus, pulsatile tinnitus generally has an abnormal structural finding (44 -91% of patients), including vascular abnormalities (aneurysms, fistulas, etc.) and tumors b. Pulsatile tinnitus requires a diagnostic eva luation to attempt to identify the abnormality. Ahsan (2014) recommends an ENT evaluation and, depending on the evaluation results, further imaging with a CT, CT angiogram, duplex carotid ultrasound, or MRI/MRV c. Similar code placement: i.

Acute mediastinitis is treated with antibiotics, and may require surgical intervention to drain abscesses or repair organ ruptures which have led to the infection. Acute mediastinal abscesses have a separate ICD -10 code (J85.3) . Chronic infections of the mediastinum are rare, and result in fibrosis. Treatment for c hronic mediastinitis is cont roversial; treatment may involve steroids, with surgery generally considered palliative. b.

The three types of these disease are: Neonatal Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease (NOMID), which in Europe is called Chronic Inflammatory Neurological Cutaneous Syndrome (CINCA); Muckle -Wells syndrome; and familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome. Symptoms include fever, hives, joint pains, vomiting, and hearing loss. NOMID is the most severe syndrome, and results in chronic menin gitis with resulting blindness, hearing loss and other neurologic damage. Muckle -Wells syndrome is less severe, but also results in hearing loss.

Fibrosing Mediastinitis Clinical Presentation, Therapeutic Outcomes, and Adaptive Immune Response Tobias Peikert, MD, Thomas V . Colby, MD, David E. Midthun, MD, Peter C. Pairolero, MD, Eric S. Edell, MD, Darrell R. Schroeder, MS, and Ulrich Specks, MD Abstract: Fibrosing mediastinitis (FM) is a rare disorder characterized by the invasive proliferation of fibrous tissue within the mediastinum. FM frequently results in the compression of vital mediastinal structures and has been associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Its pathogenesis remains unknown. However, in North America most cases are thought to represent an immune-mediated hypersensitivity response toHistoplasma capsulatum infection. To characterize the clinical disease spectrum, natural disease pro- gression, responses to therapy, and overall survival, we retrospectively analyzed all 80 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of FM evaluated at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, from 1998 to 2007. Furthermore, we characterized the adaptive immune response in 15 representative patients by immunohistochemistry. The majority of patients presented with nonspecific respiratory symp- toms due to the compression of mediastinal broncho-vascular structures. Chest radiographic imaging most frequently revealed localized, invasive, and frequently calcified right-sided mediastinal masses. Most patients had radiographic or serologic evidence of previous histoplasmosis. In contrast to earlier reports summarizing previously reported FM cases, the clinical course of our patients appeared to be more benign and less progressive. The overall survival was similar to that of age-matched controls. There were only 5 deaths, 2 of which were attributed to FM. These differences may reflect publication bias associated with the pref- erential reporting of more severely affected FM patients in the medical literature, as well as the more inclusive case definition used in our consecutive case series. Surgical and nonsurgical interventions effectively relieved symptoms caused by the compression of mediastinal vascular structures in these carefully selected patients. In contrast, antifungal and antiinflammatory agents appeared ineffective. Histologic examination and immunostaining revealed mixed inflammatory infiltrates consistent with a fibroin- flammatory tissue response in these histoplasmosis-associated FM cases. The immune cell infiltrates included large numbers of CD20-positive B lymphocytes. As B lymphocytes may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease, therapeutic B-cell depletion should be investigated as a therapeutic strategy for FM.

INTRODUCTION Fibrosing mediastinitis (FM) is a rare disorder characterized by the proliferation of locally invasive fibrous tissue within the mediastinum.11,19Its etiology remains unknown. FM may represent a clinical-pathologic syndrome rather than a single disease.29A number of triggers with variable geographic fre- quencies have been associated with FM, including fungal in- fections, tuberculosis, and sarcoidosis.12,29In the absence of a specific identifiable cause, FM is categorized as idiopathic.29 In North America, FM is most commonly associated with Histoplasma capsulatum infections and considered to represent an immune-mediated hypersensitivity reaction to this fungal organism.23,33,39However, these abnormal host responses are exceedingly rare. Only 3 of 100,000 patients with histoplasmosis developed FM during an outbreak of this fungal infection in Indianapolis between 1978 and 1979.40The precise pathogenetic mechanisms of FM remain unknown. The exuberant mediastinal fibrosis has been attributed to chronic inflammation in response to various antigens.11The reported association of FM with 1 of the MHC class I antigen presentation molecules, HLA-A2, supports the involvement of host-specific immune factors.27 In the absence of universally accepted diagnostic criteria, the clinical diagnosis of FM remains challenging. Chest radio- graphic findings frequently help to distinguish between FM and mediastinal malignancies such as lymphomas. Although tissue sampling is generally not required to establish a diagnosis of FM at experienced referral centers, diagnostic uncertainty by primary treating physicians often leads to surgical biopsies in these patients. Clinical, radiographic, and histopathologic criteria have been proposed for FM.11,23Once malignancy has been excluded, FM needs to be distinguished from other nonmalignant pro- cesses, such called mediastinal granuloma).11 The current understanding of FM is derived from single case reports, small case series, and synopses of cases re- ported in the literature.3,4,7,9 Y11,23,24,26,28,29,32,33,35,36,39Many of these reports do not clearly distinguish and mediastinal necrotizing granulomatous lymphadenitis (medi- mediastinal necrotizing granulomatous lymphadenitis are also attributed to infection with H.capsulatum . Most of these patients are asymptomatic, and the diagnosis is made when radiographic abnormalities are discovered incidentally. The long-term prognosis of mediastinal necrotizing granulomatous lymphadenitis is Number 6, November 2011From Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine (TP , DEM, ESE, US); Emeritus staff, Division of General Thoracic Surgery (PCP); Division of Bio- statistics (DRS), Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota; and Department of Lab- oratory Medicine and Pathology (TVC), Mayo Clinic Scottsdale, Scottsdale, Arizona.

In contrast, compression or occlusion of vital mediastinal structures, including the tracheobronchial tree, pulmonary ar- teries and pulmonary veins, the superior vena cava (SVC), or the esophagus, caused by FM has been associated with high morbidity and mortality.7,23,24,33,39The optimal therapeu- tic approach to FM remains controversial. Isolated case re- ports have suggested that some patients with FM may benefit from antiinflammatory, antifungal, or antifibrotic medica- tions.15Y17,21,31,33,39However, larger case series have not con- firmed these observations.23Similarly the reported results of surgical and nonsurgical interventions to relieve the compression of mediastinal structures range from very successful procedures to therapeutic failures associated with high peri- and postoper- ative mortality in excess of 30%.4Y7,10,13,18,23,24,30,34,36,38,39 We conducted the present review of 80 consecutive patients with FM evaluated and treated at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, between 1998 and 2007 to analyze the clinical presentation, radiographic and pathologic findings, therapeutic interventions, and clinical outcomes of the disease. In addition, we characterize the adaptive immune response within FM lesions using 15 rep- resentative FM tissue biopsy specimens. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients in the Clinical Case Series The Institutional Review Board approved this study. The Mayo Clinic electronic medical record database was queried using the terms fibrosing mediastinitis, sclerosing mediastinitis , andmediastinal fibrosis to identify patients diagnosed with FM during the 10 years from January 1, 1998, to December 31, 2007. The medical records of all identified cases were reviewed, and all patients meeting our clinical case definition for FM were included. Data regarding their clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, treatment response, and long-term outcomes were extracted from their medical records. Definitions Clinical Definition of FM Patients included in this study had chest radiographic evi- dence of an infiltrative mediastinal process and associated vas- cular, airway, or esophageal compression (n = 78), or, in the absence of any compromised mediastinal structures, histologic features of FM (n = 2) as described below. Patients with medi- astinal malignancies and/or prior mediastinal radiation therapy were excluded. Histologic Case Definition of FM The histopathologic diagnosis of FM is based on the find- ing of a predominance of extensive pauci-cellular fibrous tissue (keloid scar tissue) infiltrating and obliterating adipose tissue with or without patchy infiltration of mononuclear cells in the absence of malignancy. All diagnoses of FM were based on this diagnosis provided in the Mayo Clinic clinical pathology reports doc- umenting the review of the pathology specimens by a pathologist at our institution. The 15 cases evaluated by immunostaining were reviewed and confirmed by 1 of the authors (TVC). Because most of the biopsy specimens had been obtained elsewhere, a central re-review of all samples was not feasible. Histoplasma capsulatum Infection Aconclusive diagnosis of infection was assumed in the presence of a positive fungal stain (Grocott methenamine silver) or culture of the biopsy tissue and/or serologic titer Q1:32 and/or presence of an M or H band by complement fixation/immunodiffusion. A suggestive diagnosis was defined as a sero- logic radiographic granulomas) suggestive of previous granulomatous infection. Outcome Assessments Therapeutic Response All patients with more than 3 months of follow-up were included in the analysis of therapeutic benefit. According to the Mayo Clinic standard of care, all chest computed tomogra- phy (CT) scans were interpreted by chest radiologists unaware of clinical treatment information for the patient. This clinical interpretation routinely includes comparing the current exami- nation to previous studies. Data regarding radiographic response or progression were collected from these original radiology reports. In addition, all serial CT images were reviewed again by 1 of the coinvestigators (TP) prior to and independent of the tabulation of therapeutic interventions. Mortality To evaluate the mortality, we conducted a search of the Social Security Administration death master file using the in- ternet site Ancestry.com (http://Ancestry.com; Ancestry.com Inc, Provo, UT). In searched the comprehensive commercial database Accurint (http://accurint.com; LexisNexis, Dayton, OH). Based on the Accurint database, the last confirmed date to be alive was defined for all patients 6 months prior to the day of the search, July 1, 2007. Patients With Tissue Specimens Obtained at Mayo Clinic A search of the Mayo Clinic pathology database between 1985 and 2006 identified all biopsy specimens with a clinical histopathologic diagnosis of FM. The medical records and pa- thology slides from these patients were reviewed (n = 15). Immunostaining Immunostaining was performed using a DAKO autostain- ing system (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA). Consecutive sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues were using antibodies against CD138, and S100 (all DAKO). All histopathologic specimens from these 15 patients with FM were evaluated for the presence and distribution of CD3+ and CD8+ T cells, CD20+ B cells, CD138+ plasma cells, and S100+ dendritic cells. After scanning the entire slide at low power in all cases, inflammatory infiltrates, CD8+ T cells, CD20+ B cells, CD138+ plasma cells, and S100+ dendritic cells were semiquantitatively scored as 0 = absent/rare, 1 = moderate, or 2 = frequent. The distribution of these cells was also recorded. All antibodies used were developed for use in fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues. The staining protocols used were developed in the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified Mayo Clinic pathology laboratory and per- formed in a research core facility. Representative tissue sections were identified by an expert pulmonary pathologist (TVC). The immunohistochemistry studies were supported by an IST (investigator sponsored trial) from Genentech, Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). Genentech played no role in designing the study; collecting, analyzing, interpreting the data; or drafting the manuscript. The final manuscript was reviewed and approved by Genentech. Statistical Analysis We analyzed patient data using GraphPad Prism 5.0 (La Jolla, CA).

Survival curves were constructed using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS Patients A search and review of the Mayo Clinic electronic records between 1998 and 2007 identified 80 patients with FM (con- sidered the ''clinical series''). Paraffin-embedded biopsy speci- mens were available for 9 of these patients, and a search of the Mayo Clinic pathology database identified biopsy specimens from 6 additional patients with FM obtained between 1985 and 1997. The clinical characteristics of these 15 patients (consid- ered the ''histologic series'') were compared to the remaining 71 patients of the clinical series (Table 1). There were no significant differences in clinical, radiographic, or histologic characteristics or survival between the 2 groups. Therefore, we concluded that the cases in the smaller histologic series are representative of the larger clinical series, and we used these specimens to charac- terize the adaptive immune response by immunostaining. Demographics and Presenting Symptoms Eighty patients with FM were identified between 1998 and 2007. The median age was 42 years (range, 21 Y75 yr). Fifty-four percent were women, and 94% resided in endemic areas for H. capsulatum at the time of evaluation at Mayo Clinic. Only 4 patients (5%) were asymptomatic at the time of presentation. Reported symptoms included respiratory com- plaints such as dyspnea on exertion (n = 39, 47%), cough (n = 17, 21%), facial swelling, head fullness, or headaches consistent with SVC syndrome (n = 17, 21%), chest pain (n = 16, 20%), and hemoptysis (n = 16, 20%). Twenty-seven patients (34%) pre- sented with multiple symptoms. Chest Imaging Chest CT scans were available for review in 74 patients (93%). Focal mediastinal abnormalities were identified in 70 of the 74 patients (95%) (Figure 1A). Diffuse mediastinal infiltra- tion was found in only 4 patients (5%) (Figure 1B). Radiographic abnormalities localized to the right side in 53 (72%) and to the left in 4 patients (5%); bilateral lesions were found in 17 patients (23%). Calcifications were detected in 54 patients (73%). Positron emission tomography (PET) scans were obtained in 7 patients (9%). Clinical indications included suspicion for malignancy (for example, lymphoma) at the time of diagnosis (n = 5) or concerns about malignancy raised by a new lung lesion during FM follow-up. All PET scans showed increased meta- bolic activity within the FM-associated mediastinal lesions. PET images were routinely interpreted as highly suspiciousfor malignancy. Subsequent surgical biopsies (n = 5) revealed FM in 3 cases and granulomatous inflammation in 2 cases. Both patients with granulomatous inflammation had a typical clinical presentation of FM characterized by large airway com- pression. PET images of 2 representative cases are shown in Figure 1C and 1D. Compression of Mediastinal Structures Anatomic structures within the mediastinum were com- pressed or obstructed in 78 patients (98%), and more than 2 mediastinal structures were affected in 28 (35%) (Figure 2). Histopathologic Findings Surgical resections with diagnostic (n = 29) or therapeutic (n = 14) intent, or autopsy (n = 1) were performed in 44 patients (55%), and tissue for histologic examination was obtained in 43 of 44 cases (98%). A histologic diagnosis of FM was estab- lished in 34 of 43 patients (79%). In 6 of the remaining 9 spe- cimens only excessive fibrosis, chronic mixed inflammatory infiltrates, and granulomatous inflammation were described, but no diagnosis of FM was specified in the pathology report. The remaining 3 cases demonstrated only granulomatous inflam- mation. All 9 cases met the clinical diagnostic criteria for FM. In 8 of these cases compression of the large airway, pulmonary artery, pulmonary vein, or SVC Vor a combination thereof V was detected. One individual had isolated compression of the esophagus. Etiology Antibodies against H. capsulatum were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunodiffusion, and/or complement fixation in 58 of 80 patients (73%). Antibody FIGURE 2.

Furthermore, yeast forms typical of H. capsulatum were seen on Grocott methenamine silver stains in 11 of 43 tissue specimens (26%), and these organisms were always found in the necrotic areas of old necrotizing granulomas. However, fungal tissue cultures remained negative when per- formed (n = 5). Taken together, a conclusive diagnosis of histo- plasmosis was established in 22 of 68 patients (32%) who had either serologic tests or tissue stains for the organism. Twenty-one additional patients had antihistoplasma anti- Radiographic evidence of a prior granulomatous infection was detectable in 46 of 74 patients (62%) by chest CT, and based on these radiographic findings another 24 patients were classi- fied as having a suggestive diagnosis of prior histoplasmosis. Therefore, overall serologic and/or radiographic evidence of histoplasmosis was detected in 67 of 80 patients (84%). None of the 80 patient with FM had a history of granulomatous med- iastinitis progressing to FM. Two of the 13 patients without evidence of previous his- toplasmosis had radiographic findings of diffuse mediastinal infiltration. One of these 2 individuals and another patient had associated retroperitoneal fibrosis, both features typically detected in patients with idiopathic FM. No other possible etiologic factors were identified. Treatment Therapeutic interventions were recommended for 54 patients, and observation was advised in 26. The specific med- ical, interventional, and surgical treatments used are outlined inTable 2. Primary therapeutic interventions consisted of antifun- gal and antiinflammatory drug therapy (n = 23 patients), non- surgical procedural interventions (n = 6 patients) and surgical procedures (n = 14 patients). In 11 patients nonsurgical inter- ventions (9 patients) and surgical procedures (2 patients) were combined with medical therapies. Observation alone was recommended for patients without symptoms, or those with mild and nonspecific symptoms that could not be attributed clearly to the compressed mediastinal structures. Medical therapy consisted predominantly of antifungal medications in patients with serologic evidence of histoplasmosis. In contrast, nonsurgical procedural interventions and sur- gical procedures were primarily aimed at relieving symptoms caused by compression of mediastinal structures in patients judged to be candidates for these procedures. Moreover, non- surgical procedural interventions were often needed as secondary interventions to manage recurrent symptoms during follow-up (Tables 3 and 4). Follow-up information (follow-up Q3 mo; me- dian, 37 mo; Y382 mo) to evaluate the long-term thera- peutic outcomes of these strategies was available for 69 patients, 52 treated and 17 untreated. Therapeutic Outcomes Follow-up of longer than 3 months was available for 17 of 26 (65%) untreated patients (median, 68 mo; range, 6 Y357 mo). None of these experienced disease progression. Medical Therapy Follow-up was available for 28 of 34 (82%) patients treated with a variety of medical therapies. Drug therapy was TABLE 3.

No patient achieved complete remission, and only a minority (5 of 28, 18%) experienced partial radiographic and/or symptomatic responses. Itraconazole therapy resulted in the radiographically detected decrease in size of the mediastinal lesions in 3 patients, and 1 of these also reported improved dyspnea. A fourth individual experienced a reduction in chest pain following therapy with itraconazole. The clinical sig- nificance of the 2 isolated radiographic improvements remains unclear. Only 1 of 6 patients treated with antiinflammatory therapies benefited from this intervention (improved symptoms and de- creased radiographic infiltration). This patient was 1 of the 3 cases with either diffuse mediastinal involvement or retroperito- neal fibrosis (idiopathic FM). The patient' s disease subsequently deteriorated despite therapy, and he died as a consequence of progressive pulmonary artery compression and pulmonary hy- pertension. In 2 patients treated medically (1 with itraconazole, 1 with prednisone), radiographic disease progression was detected during follow-up. In the remaining 21 patients managed medically, FM remained stable. Medical therapies were generally well tolerated; however, 1 patient discontinued itraconazole because of hives, and another patient was unable to tolerate tamoxifen.Nonsurgical Procedural Interventions Fifteen patients were managed with primary nonsurgical procedures. Endovascular interventions effectively relieved symptoms caused by compression of the SVC, pulmonary artery, and pulmonary vein by FM-associated fibrous tissue (see Table 3; Figure 1E). In contrast, the 2 patients treated with bronchoscopic interventions to restore airway patency did not experience symptomatic relief. The nonsurgical procedures were generally safe, and there were no procedure-related deaths. Cardiac tamponade occurred in 1 patient following SVC stent- ing, but this complication did not have any lasting consequences. Long-term follow-up information was available for 14 patients (median, 38 mo; range, 8 Y130 mo). The majority of patients treated with endovascular procedures experienced stent re-stenosis with recurrent symptoms and required repeated interventions at 6 Y12 months intervals (see Table 3). Surgical Therapy The operations performed in the 17 patients managed sur- gically (primary surgery in 16 and failed stenting in 1 patient) are outlined in Tables 4 and 5. Despite being technically challeng- ing, all but 1 procedure successfully relieved the symptoms caused by the obstruction of various mediastinal structures. TheTABLE 4.

There were 4 surgical complications and no peri- and post- operative deaths (see Table 4). The only peri- and postoperative complication of significance was 1 patient suffering minimal neurologic deficit (mild weakness) following a perioperative stroke. Long-term follow-up information (median, 89 mo; range, 18Y382 mo) was available for 12 of 17 patients (71%) in whom the surgical intervention had a therapeutic intent. The benefits of the surgical interventions were only temporary in 5 of the 12 patients (42%), and they required subsequent procedures for recurrent symptoms: balloon angioplasty/stenting for vascular graft obstruction (n = 3 patients), angiographic embolization forhemoptysis (n = 1 patient), and endobronchial stent placement for airway torsion (n = 1 patient) (see Table 4). Survival To determine the survival endpoint for our patient cohort, we searched the Social Security Death Index, and the commer- cial Accurint database was searched in addition to the available clinical follow-up. Using this approach the median follow-up was 68 months (range, 0 Y401 mo). Five deaths were identified. Two of these were the result of FM. One patient died shortly after the initial presentation from the hemodynamic consequences of severe pulmonary venous obstruction, despite temporary im- provement after angioplasty. The second fatality was a patient with idiopathic FM and associated retroperitoneal fibrosis. HeTABLE 5.

We note that both of these patients had bilateral mediastinal involvement. Two additional patients died of non-small cell lung cancer, which developed 12 and 29 years after the diagnosis of FM, respec- tively. One additional patient died of an unknown cause. Thispatient originally presented with right-sided bronchial com- pression and broncholithiasis, for which he underwent bi- lobectomy. The death occurred 8 years following his diagnosis and surgical intervention. Overall, the Kaplan-Meier analysis did not reveal a differ- ence between the observed and predicted mortalities (Figure 3). However, the small number of deaths (n = 5) precludes aTABLE 6.

It is noteworthy that both FM-related fatalities occurred in patients with bilateral mediastinal involvement, suggesting that such individuals are perhaps at a higher risk for adverse outcomes. Characterization of the Adaptive Immune Response Paraffin-embedded tissue samples were available for 15 FM cases evaluated at Mayo Clinic between 1985 and 2006 (the histologic series). Based on their clinical characteristics and therapeutic outcomes, these patients were representative of our larger clinical cohort (see Table 1). The clinical characteristics, treatments, and therapeutic outcomes are summarized in Table 5.Detailed results of the histologic and immunohistochemical analysis are listed in Table 6. Mixed, lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrates were almost universally present (14 of 15 patients). CD20-positive B lymphocytes accounted for a large proportion of these cells and were seen in all cases examined. These cells either formed a peripheral rim surrounding the fibrotic lesion or clustered within infiltrating sheets of cells (Figure 4A and 4B). Alternatively, they formed poorly structured lymphoid follicles without germinal centers (Figure 4C). These distribution pat- terns varied between patients but were simultaneously detected in the same cases. CD3- and CD8-positive lymphocytes were also frequently detected (11 of 15 patients), but their distribu- tion was distinct from the CD20-positive B lymphocytes (see Table 6). T lymphocytes predominately infiltrated into fibrotic FIGURE 5. A, CD8-positive T lymphocytes; B, CD138-positive plasma cells; and C, S100-positive dendritic cells in FM.

CD138-positive plasma cells (Figure 5B) and S100-positive dendritic cells (Figure 5C) were also frequently seen. Their distribution resembled that of the T lymphocytes. DISCUSSION FM is a rare disease, and universally accepted diagnostic criteria are lacking. Previous reports on FM include retrospective case series with limited numbers of patients, synopses of pre- viously reported cases, or studies focusing on specific subgroups of FM patients, such as surgically managed cases, idiopathic cases, or cases referred for the management of airway in- volvement.1,3,4,7 Y11,14,23,24,26,32,33,36,39Moreover, heterogeneous case definitions have been applied, and frequently FM and nec- rotizing granulomatous lymphadenitis (mediastinal granuloma) have not been differentiated.4,7,9,10,24,32,36,39Consequently, it has been difficult to predict the clinical course of patients with FM and their response to medical therapy or surgical interventions. Moreover, little is known about the pathogenesis, which has hampered the development of novel therapeutic approaches. The present analysis of 80 consecutive patients with FM from an area where infections with H. capsulatum are endemic provides the following novel insights about this rare disease: the prognosis of FM is better than previously thought; therapy with antifungal and antiinflammatory agents provides little benefit; nonsurgical and surgical vascular interventions are safe and provide symptomatic relief but their benefits are of limited du- ration. Last, but not least, our immunohistochemistry analyses show that B lymphocytes represent a prominent component of the persistent inflammation within the FM lesions. In North America the majority of patients with FM residing in endemic areas for H. capsulatum have either serologic or pathologic evidence of prior histoplasmosis and radiographic findings characteristic of a previous granulomatous infec- tion.4,23,29,33,39Earlier studies had proposed the hypothesis that mediastinal necrotizing granulomatous lymphadenitis and FM represent a continuum.4However, observe the evo- lution of necrotizing granulomatous lymphadenitis into FM in our patient cohort. Only a small number of patients (n = 3) had either diffuse mediastinal involvement or associated retroperi- toneal fibrosis as evidence of the idiopathic FM. The disease severity of FM at presentation is variable and ranges from incidentally discovered, asymptomatic mediastinal mass lesions to acute cardiovascular decompensation or life- threatening hemoptysis. The extent of the initial clinical symptoms and their relationship to the compromise of specific mediastinal structures should guide the therapeutic approach. Our data suggest that progressive mediastinal fibrosis is rare in patients with uni- lateral mediastinal involvement, particularly when symptoms are nonspecific and not clearly attributable to the compression of mediastinal structures. Such patients should be reassured and followed clinically and radiographically for disease progression. We did not detect convincing evidence of the success of antifungal or conventional antiinflammatory therapy. Therefore, these therapies should be avoided in FM, and glucocorticoid therapy should be reserved for patients with idiopathic FM. In contrast, FM patients presenting with clinical symptoms caused by the compression of mediastinal vascular structures with significant hemoptysis or with bilateral involvement should undergo a detailed evaluation to characterize the extent of the mediastinal involvement. These patients may be candidates for surgical and nonsurgical therapeutic interventions. In con-trast to previous reports that raised concerns about the safety and effectiveness of such procedures and even reported fatalities, our observations at a specialized tertiary care center (Mayo Clinic Rochester) reflecting more recent advances in surgical tech- niques suggest that these interventions are generally safe and effective if performed by experienced providers in these care- fully selected patients.23 Unfortunately, the durability of the therapeutic success of these interventions is frequently limited. Subsequent stent or graft obstruction often requires repeated nonsurgical interven- tions to maintain long-term patency. The data presented here expand on the findings of 2 reports from our institution de- scribing 6 patients treated with endovascular stents and 5 who underwent surgical reconstruction of the pulmonary artery.1,8 The exact reasons for the failure of vascular procedures to pro- vide long-lasting benefits could not be established clearly in all cases. There was no apparent radiographic progression of the lesions in these cases. However, stent collapse, vein graft con- traction, and thrombosis were reported in individual cases. The role for bronchoscopic relief of symptomatic airway compres- sion is unclear, as only 2 patient had this intervention and neither appeared to benefit. The overall survival of our patient cohort was independent of the extent of mediastinal infiltration (bilateral vs. unilateral involvement) at diagnosis and was similar to the survival of age- matched controls. This is substantially better than the survival stated in prior reports.23Several factors may contribute to these observed differences in mortality. First, differences in case definitions need to be considered. Second, publication bias may have favored the reporting of more severe cases in the past. Third, recent advances in chest radiography may cause some lead-time bias. Most patients were able to maintain a functional lifestyle, and severe disability was rare. Overall, there were only 2 con- firmed FM-related deaths, both of which occurred in patients with bilateral mediastinal involvement. This is consistent with observations by others indicating that bilateral mediastinal in- volvement by FM is associated with a distinctly worse prog- nosis.3Novel therapeutic strategies are needed for patients with bilateral mediastinal involvement, progressive mediastinal fibrosis, symptomatic airway compression, and those who ex- perience recurrent vascular obstruction following surgical and nonsurgical interventions. PET scanning has developed into a widely available and valuable diagnostic tool. It is routinely used to evaluate known or suspected malignant pulmonary lesions and lymphoma. Considering the high frequency of radiographic surveillance in patients with FM and the diagnostic considerations of lymphoma during the evaluation of a mediastinal mass, it is not surprising that 7 of our patients (9%) underwent PET scanning for these indications. Selected previous case reports demonstrated vari- able metabolic activity within the mediastinal lesions of FM and suggested a possible correlation with disease activity.2,22,37 Interestingly, all 7 PET scans in our series showed increased 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) uptake, suggesting ongo- ing inflammation within the lesion. However, none of these patients experienced disease progression. Based on their histologic review of 30 idiopathic cases of FM, Flieder and colleagues9proposed that FM is not a purely fibrotic lesion but rather represents a fibroinflammatory disease with a variable degree of inflammation. Our analysis of 15 patients with predominantly histoplasmosis-associated FM, who were treated with surgical or nonsurgical interventions, confirmed various degrees of mixed inflammatory infiltration in all cases. The immunophenotyping of these inflammatoryMedicine &Volume 90, Number 6, www.md-journal.com 421 Copyright \u00a9 2011 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited. infiltrates identified a large number of CD20-positive B lym- phocytes. These B cells either accumulate in the periphery or cluster in sheets or poorly formed lymphoid follicles within the fibrous tissue. We propose that these infiltrating B lym- phocytes play a pathogenic role in FM, and consequently, rep- resent a rational therapeutic target. In the absence of any effective medical therapy to date, depletion of B lymphocytes may be a potential therapeutic option for those patients with FM who have a poor prognosis (bilateral mediastinal or progressive involvement), suffer symptomatic airway compression, or have recurrent symptoms attributable to obstruction of mediastinal structures. Further support for such an approach comes from murine models of bleomycin-induced fibrosis as B lymphocytes, spe- cifically CD19 expression, were shown to be required for the development of fibrosis.20This is consistent with reports dem- onstrating effective depletion of B lymphocytes within fibrotic skin lesions and initial therapeutic success of rituximab in scleroderma.25,41 The current study is limited by its retrospective design and incomplete long-term follow-up information. Although difficult to perform, prospective studies to confirm and further charac- terize the disease spectrum, natural history, and outcome of FM are needed. Furthermore, since the disease spectrum and prog- nosis may be affected by the diagnostic criteria used, it is crucial to standardize the case definitions. Our diagnostic criteria closely resemble the case definitions of FM used by the majority of authors. In addition to clinical and radiographic criteria, our case definition includes information obtained from biopsies. Although the histologic pattern of FM is nonspecific, it is highly characteristic and distinctly different from other processes within the mediastinum, such as infec- tion.4,9,26,32,33,36,39In contrast to the largest FM case series reported previously, we decided not to limit our inclusion criteria to the compression of pulmonary arterial, venous, or bronchial structures, but also included cases with invasive mediastinal mass lesions with isolated SVC or esophageal compression, as well as cases with an invasive mediastinal mass and excessive histologic deposition of fibrous tissue and lack of mediastinal compromise.23Even if we excluded the 18 patients with isolated SVC or esophageal compression lacking mediastinal compres- sion, the surgical success rates as well as the overall survival remain unchanged. Moreover, if the exclusion criteria (definition of mediastinal granuloma) provided by Loyd et al23were applied to the current patient cohort, only 5 patients would have to be excluded. These patients were either asymptomatic (n = 4) or had no organ compression (n = 1). Nevertheless, tissue biopsies and chest-radiographic findings clearly supported a diagnosis of FM in these patients. This suggests that the observed differences between the current study and previous reports are more likely to be the result of differences in study design than in case definitions. Our cohort of consecutive patients is more likely to reflect the natural disease spectrum than a synopsis of all previously reported cases, which is likely to be confounded by publication bias toward more severe cases with worse outcomes.23 In conclusion, most cases of FM can be diagnosed based on clinical and radiographic criteria. Tissue biopsies are needed only if diagnostic uncertainty remains in asymptomatic patients presenting without compression of mediastinal structures. The analysis of this large cohort of consecutive patients with FM indicates that the clinical course of FM overall appears to be more favorable than previously reported, and patients are less likely to progress. In contrast to mostly ineffective medicalapproaches, surgical and nonsurgical interventions can effec- tively relieve the symptoms caused by compression of vascular mediastinal structures. The overall survival of FM is similar to age-matched controls. PET scanning and immunophenotyping suggest that FM from histoplasmosis is associated with persis- tent inflammation characterized by large numbers of CD20- positive B lymphocytes. These B lymphocytes may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. Therapeutic B-cell depletion should be investigated as a potential therapeutic strategy for selected patients with FM, particularly those with progressive disease, recurrent compression of mediastinal structures, or the idiopathic variant of the disease.

Chiang, MD \u00fe|| Abstract: Periodic fevers are acquired or inherited disorders of in- nate immunity, which were first described in the 1940s. The patients are typically young at onset and have regularly recurring fevers for afew days to a few weeks with systemic inflammatory symptoms thatare interrupted by symptom-free periods. There is a variety of clinical manifestations including gastrointestinal complaints, myalgias, arthral- gias, and rash. A differential diagnosis in these patients may includerecurrent infections, other inflammatory disorders, and neoplastic dis- ease. This clinical review focuses on a sample of autoinflammatory disorders including familial Mediterranean fever, tumor necrosis factorreceptor 1 Yassociated periodic syndrome, hyperimmunoglobulinemia D syndrome, the cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome, and periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and cervical adenitis syndrome. We review the basics, pertinent clinical and laboratory features, andmanagement of each entity. Key Words: periodic fever syndromes, familial Mediterranean fever, tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 Yassociated periodic syndrome, hyperimmunoglobulinemia D syndrome, periodic fever, Care 2013;29: 842 Y851) TARGET AUDIENCE This CME activity is intended for pediatric emergency medicine practitioners. LEARNING OBJECTIVES After completion of this article, the reader should be able to: 1. Identify the characteristics of v arious periodic fever syndromes. 2. Diagnose patients with periodic fever syndromes. Fever is a common complaint in pediatrics and pediatric emergency medicine (EM). Most often, these are single infec- tious episodes. There are, however, a number of rare noninfec- tious conditions that result in recurrent fever. Patients with thefollowing periodic fever syndromes may present with a previ-ously undiagnosed illness or with worsening of their knowndiagnosis. New presentations often include recurrent fevers, malaise, abdominal pain, arthralgias, and skin findings. Cluesto the diagnosis of a periodic fever syndrome in these cases include age at onset, ethnicity, family history, and response to therapy (or lack thereof), in addition to characteristics ofthe fever episodes such as duration and frequency as wellas associated symptoms. It is important for the pediatric EM practitioner to be aware of these conditions, their presentation, and their management. This CME article will help pediatric EMpractitioners to achieve this goal. FAMILIAL MEDITERRANEAN FEVER Preview Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is considered the most common hereditary fever syndrome and is inherited in an au- tosomal recessive fashion (Table 1). It is caused by MEFV gene mutations, leading to altered pyrin protein and excess produc-tion of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 1 (IL-1). 1,2 This entity is especially common in those of Middle Easterndescent including Jews, Arabs, Turks, and Armenians as well assome European populations such as Italians. 3,4It affects both sexes equally. Familial Mediterranean fever is exemplified by brief febrile attacks triggered by neutrophil-induced serosal in-flammation and a gradual accumulation of amyloid in the kid-neys if left untreated. Clinical Manifestation Most patients experience their first attack within the first 20 years of life (90%), commonly within the first 10 years of life (60%). Attacks can be triggered by diet, exercise, physicalor emotional stress, or menses. Patients with FMF have recur-rent acute febrile painful episodes that last anywhere from half a day to 4 days. The pain usually involves 1 to 2 of the following systems at a time: gastrointestinal, respiratory, musculoskeletal,genitourinary, and skin. Patients can present with arthritis, in-cluding monoarthritis, or arthralgias, myalgias, altered erysipelas-like erythema, and pleuritis. 5Patients are healthy between attacks, although their inflammatory markers may not normalize between attacks. The most common presentation is abdominal pain and can be mistaken for appendicitis. Of note, many patients undergo exploratory surgery before the diagnosis is made. Arthralgiasand myalgias are also rather common. The joint presentation is that of nondestructive acute monoarthritis of brief duration and usually involves the large joints of the lower extremities. 6Pa- tients who present with the protracted febrile myalgia syndromecan have painful and disabling symptoms that last for weeks, affecting the abdominal muscles and lower extremities. Ap- proximately half of patients will present with inflammationof the pleura.

Section 6.0 New Discussion Items Laryngeal Re -Innervation in Children 1 Question : Should laryngeal re -innervation be added as a treatment of unilateral vocal cord paralysis in children on the Prioritized List? Question source : Dr. Henry Milczuk, OHSU Pediatric ENT Issue : Dr. Milczuk is requesting that it be paired with unilateral vocal cord paralysis for children with chronic aspiration or dysphonia (inability to be understood when speaking). Unilateral vocal cord paralysis can be a post -operative complication, congenital, caused by tumors, or have idiopathic causes. Children who undergo cardiac surgery are at higher risk to have unilateral vocal cord paralysis as a complication of the surgery due to injury of the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Long term survival does not appear to be affected by unilateral vocal cord paral ysis (Misono 2012), and many patients have full (33 -52%) or partial (39 -61%) spontaneous recovery. Most recovery happens in the first year after the surgery or other injury or event . Treatment consists of voice and swallow therapy, medi alization of the vocal cord through injection of a filler material (a temporary treatment), thyroplasty, laryngoplasty, and laryngeal reinnervation. Currently, unilateral vocal cord paralysis (ICD -10 J38.01) is on a covered (line 70) and an uncovered (line 521) line. On line 70, this condition pairs with laryngoplasty. It does not pair with vocal cord injection or with laryngeal reinnervation . Laryngeal re-innervation (CPT 31590) is currently only found on one line on the Prioritized List, 210 SUPERFICIAL ABSCESSES AND CELLULITIS. HERC/HSC history Line 70 LARYNGEAL STENOSIS OR PARALYSIS WITH AIRWAY COMPLICATIONS was created as part of the ICD -10 ENT review. Previously, diagnos es like airway stenosis and vocal cord paralysis were only on 521 PARALYSIS OF VOCAL CORDS OR LARYNX. The ENT reviewers recommended mov ing J38.6 (Stenosis of larynx) to the upper line only and mov ing J30.01 and J38.02 (Paralysis of vocal cords and larynx, unilateral or bilateral) to the upper line and to keep them on a lower line with the new guideline note GUIDELINE NOTE 141, LARYNGEAL STENOSIS OR PARALYSIS WITH AIRWAY COMPLICATIONS delineating when these diagnoses were on the covered line. The rationale for this change was: \"Most laryngeal paralysis is iatrogenic, prolonged intubation causes stenosis. Bilateral paralysis causes severe airway obstruction. Unilateral paralysis is most associated with aspiration and can cause recurrent aspiration pneumonias . These are serious and need to be treated. These conditions are fixable and once fixed are low cost. \" The only procedures added to the new line 70 were 31528 and 31529 (laryngoscopy). Laryngeal Re -Innervation in Children 2 31561 (Laryngoscopy, direct, operative, with arytenoidectomy; with operating microscope or telescope) and 31588 (Laryngoplasty, not otherwise specified (eg, for burns, reconstruction after partial laryngectomy)) were added to line 70 as a straightforward item in May, 2015. It is unclear when or why CPT 31590 was added to line 210. No mention of this code was found in HOSC or VBBS minutes. There is no appropriate diagnosis to pair with this treatment on that line. Dr. Milzcuk agrees that this is not a procedure used to treat laryngeal abscesses or similar diagnoses. While reviewing the ICD -10 ENT notes, it appears that the ICD -10 reviewers intended that laryngeal stenosis be removed from now line 367 DYSTONIA (UNCONTROLLABLE) ; LARYNGEAL SPASM AND STENOSIS . The laryngeal stenosis diagnoses in line 367 were intended for movement to what is now line 70 and be deleted from line 367. The deletion portion of this recommendation was not done. It is unclear from the ICD -10 ENT notes if the ENT reviewers intended that laryngeal stenosis not causing airway obstruction should remain on line 521. The notes specify that the laryngeal stenosis ICD -10 code (J38.6) be included only on line 70; however, the guidelin e written by this review group specifies that this diagnosis should only be included on the upper line when it causes airway obstruction. There is no clear intent as to the coverage of dysphonia. There was no mention of where this diagnosis should be prioritized in HOSC or VBBS minutes. The ICD -9 and ICD -10 codes for dysphonia were/are diagnostic and therefore treatments for this condition are not currently covered. GN141 specifies that hoarseness is included on line 521. Dysphonia is the medical term for disorders of the voice: an impairment in the ability to produce voice sounds. The dysphonic voice can be hoarse or excessively breathy, harsh, or rough, but some kind of phonation is still possible . It appears that the ICD -10 ENT reviewers intended that dysphonia be included only on the lower line. GUIDELINE NOTE 141, LARYNGEAL STENOSIS OR PARALYSIS WITH AIRWAY COMPLICATIONS Line 70 Laryngeal paralysis is covered on this line if associated with recurrent aspiration pneumonia (unilateral or bilateral) or airway obstruction (bilateral). Hoarseness is on Line 521. Laryngeal stenosis is included on this line only if it causes airway obstruc tion.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Published studies suggest that reinnervation may be the most effective surgical intervention for children with dysphonia; however, long -term follow -up data are lackin g. With the exception of polytetrafluoroethylene injections, injection laryngoplasty was reported to be a relatively safe, nonpermanent, and effective option for most children with dysphonia. Thyroplasty appears to have fallen out favor in recent years bec ause of difficulty in performing this procedure in children under local anesthesia, but it continues to be a viable option for children with aspiration. 2) Misono 2012 , review of unilateral vocal cord paralysis (document not included due to length) a. Comparison of injection medi alization vs medi alization thyroplasty: i. The available data suggest that, in the short term, injection medialization and medialization thyroplasty are likely comparable with respect to voice outcomes b ut that, in the long term, medi alization thyroplasty ma y provide better voice results. More investigation is needed to clarify and compare long -term outcomes. ii. No significant difference has been detected in the improvement of swallowing between patients who underwent injection medialization versus those who und erwent medialization thyroplasty. b. Comparison of medi alization thyroplasty vs reinnervation i. Summarized Paniello c. Conclusions: Management (evidence grade B). Data on voice therapy suggest a positive impact, but further studies are needed. Injection medializat ion is widely used, and a variety of injectables may be considered. Current evidence suggests that initial voice outcomes after injection medialization are similar to those after medicalization thyroplasty, but long -term results may favor the latter. Laryn geal reinnervation has been shown to have comparable vocal impact with that of medialization thyroplasty, and surgical decision making should take patient age into account. Some patients may benefit from multiple procedures. 3) Paniello 2011 RCT (also submitted by Dr. Milczuk) Laryngeal Re -Innervation in Children 5 a.

Laryngeal reinnervation should be considered in younger patients, whereas medialization laryngoplasty should be favored in older patients. f.

Considers laryngeal reinnervation to be experimental for treatment of vocal cord paralysis HERC staff summary: Laryng eal innervation appears to be equally effective compared to other surgical procedures for treatment for dysphonia . This conclusion is b ased on systematic reviews, although the underlying literature is generally limited to case series and case reports . No long term outcomes have been reported. Larynge al innervation has not been studied as a treatment fo r aspiration pneumonia, or this outcome was not reported in the identified review articles. The HERC needs to clarify its intent regarding : 1) The prioritization of the treatment of dysphonia. The ICD -10 code for dysphonia is diagnostic, which is appropriate. It appears the intent is to include treatment of dysphonia on the lower laryngeal paralysis line (line 52 1) 2) When laryngeal stenosis is a covered condition. The current ICD -10 code placement has all cases covered on line 70. The current GN141 specifies that it is only covered when it causes airway obstruction.

Results: Analysis of videostroboscopic findings indicated that the glottic closure, vocal fold edge, vocal fold position, phase symmetry, and regularity were significantly improved (P < .001, post - vs. preoperative). Perceptual evaluation of dysphonia severity showed that overall grade, roughness, breathiness, asthenia, and strain were also significantly decreased postoperatively (P < .001). Postoperative values of jitter (local), shimmer (local), and mean noise -to- harmonics ratio were significantly lower than the corresponding preoperative values (P < .001). The postoperative MPT value was significantly longer than the preoperative one (P < .001). LEMG showed that there was a significant postoperative improvement in vo luntary motor -unit recruitment during phonation (P < .001). c. Conclusions: In cases with a lack of viable ansa cervicalis on the side of a paralyzed vocal fold, contralateral ansa cervicalis - to-RLN anastomosis is a feasible and effective approach in the tre atment of UVFP and can restore physiologic laryngeal phonatory function. i.

Despiteincreasing interest in surgical interventions for unilateral vocal cord paralysis in children, thesurgical outcomes data in children are scarce. OBJECTIVE To appraise and summarize the available evidence for pediatric unilateral vocal cord paralysis surgical strategies. EVIDENCE REVIEW MEDLINE (1946-2014) and EMBASE (1980-2014) were searched for publications that described the results of laryngoplasty, thyroplasty, or laryngealreinnervation for pediatric unilateral vocal cord paralysis. Further studies were identified frombibliographies of relevant studies, gray literature, and annual scientific assemblies. Tworeviewers independently appraised the selected studies for quality, level of evidence, and riskof bias as well as extracted data, including unilateral vocal cord paralysis origin, voiceoutcomes, swallowing outcomes, and adverse events. FINDINGS Of 366 identified studies, the inclusion criteria were met by 15 studies: 6 observational studies, 6 case series, and 3 case reports. All 36 children undergoing laryngealreinnervation (8 studies) had improvement or resolution of dysphonia. Of 31 childrenreceiving injection laryngoplasty (6 studies), most experienced improvement in voice quality,speech, swallowing, aspiration, and glottic closure. Of 12 children treated by thyroplasty (5studies), 2 experienced resolution of dysphonia, 4 had some improvement, and 4 had noimprovement (2 patients had undocumented outcomes). Thyroplasty resolved or improvedaspiration in 7 of 8 patients. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Published studies suggest that reinnervation may be the most effective surgical intervention for children with dysphonia; h owever, long -term follow-up data are lacking. With the exception of polytetrafluoroethylene injections, injectionlaryngoplasty was reported to be a relatively safe, nonpermanent, and effective option formost children with dysphonia. Thyroplasty appears to have fallen out favor in recent yearsbecause of difficulty in performing this procedure in children under local anesthesia, but itcontinues to be a viable option for children with aspiration.

All rights reserved.Unilateral vocal cord paralysis (UVCP) is defined as immo- bility of a vocal cord due to disruption of its motorinnervation. 1In the pediatric population, UVCP most com- monly arises from iatrogenic recurrent laryngeal nerve injury dur-ing cardiac surgery. Other origins include iatrogenic injury from neckor mediastinal surgery as well as neurologic and idiopathic causes. 2 A pediatric otolaryngologist in a tertiary care center may expect tosee approximately 4 to 10 patients with UVCP each year. 1,3,4 Neonates and infants with UVCP typically present within the first 2 years of life with an abnormal cry or voice, stridor, or feedingdifficulty. 1Over time, many children achieve spontaneous sympto- matic resolution due to compensation in glottic closure from the con-tralateral vocal cord or recovery of the injured nerve. 2,5Unfortu- nately, 20% to 40% of children remain symptomatic after therecommended 8 to 12 months of observation and are considered can-didates for surgical intervention. 2,6The main indication for inter- vention in young children is airway protection. In older children, dys-phonia becomes the primary reason for an intervention. 7With an increased understanding of the negative effect of dysphonia on thelives of children, 8some authors9have advocated earlier interven- tions for children with UVCP and dysphonia. The interest in surgical interventions for pediatric UVCP has in- creased in the past 15 years. The 3 accepted surgical interventionsfor glottic closure improvement in children the thy-roarytenoid muscle in the paralyzed cord; h owever, these re sults may be temporary because some injection materials are reabsorbed overtime. In thyroplasty, the paralyzed vocal cord is medialized perma-nently with an implant positioned by an external neck incision. Thy-roplasty is generally reserved for adolescents who are able to tol-erate the procedure while awake so that phonation can be testedfor optimal vocal cord positioning. to nerve the laryngeal muscles. Reinnervation may overcome theconcerns about laryngeal growth, ongoing muscle atrophy, or theuse of foreign material associated with the other 2 procedures, butthere is a significant time lag between surgery and improvement. 11 Despite increasing interest in surgical interventions for pediat- ric UVCP, the data on outcomes of these procedures in children arescarce. The goal of this systematic review is to synthesize and sum-marize available evidence on injection laryngoplasty, thyroplasty, andlaryngeal reinnervation for pediatric UVCP. This information will helpguide otolaryngologists in choosing an appropriate surgical tech-nique for their patients. Methods Literature Search Strategy We searched MEDLINE (1946 to 2014) and EMBASE (1980 to 2014)for relevant studies. The date of the last search was June 30, 2014.In addition, 2 authors (O.B., B.M.) screened the bibliographies of allrelevant studies and searched available abstracts by hand from rel-evant scientific assemblies from 2003 through 2013: American Acad-emy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Canadian Societyof Otolaryngology, American Society of Pediatric Otolaryngology, andEuropean Society of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology.Study Selection Criteria Two reviewers (O.B., B.M.) screened titles or abstracts from the ini-tial search for the following inclusion criteria: (1) a primary researchstudy (controlled trial or observational study, including case seriesand case reports); (2) study included data on the pediatric popula-tion (0-18 years old); (3) study investigated UVCP and 1 ofthe 3 surgical techniques: injection laryngoplasty, thyroplasty, and/orlaryngeal reinnervation; (4) study documented the interventions for UVCP; (5) English-language study; and (6) nota duplicate study or a study on the same data set. The same reviewers then screened the full texts of all chosen citations; studies that did not meet the selection criteria were ex-cluded. All discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Assessment of Quality, Level of Evidence, and Risk of Bias The level of evidence from individual studies was assessed using theOxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine Levels of Evidence fromMarch 2009. 12The risk of selection, performance, detection, attri- tion, and reporting bias in case series were assessed by determin-ing a score from 0 (low risk) to 5 (high risk) using the following scor-ing system: (1) sample selection (consecutive or not: 1 indicates noor not stated and 0 indicates consecutive); (2) diagnostic criteriastated (1 indicates not stated and 0 indicates stated); (3) out-comes measured consistently for all patients (1 indicates not con-sistent and 0 indicates consistent); (4) outcomes reported consis-tently for all patients (1 indicates not consistent and 0 indicatesconsistent); and (5) follow-up period of 1 year or more (1 indicates<1 year and 0 indicates /H113501 year). Data Extraction and Analysis Data were extracted in duplicate using data forms and outcome mea- sures developed a priori. Descriptive statistics were extracted, andqualitative syntheses of the results were reported. The primary out-come measure was the effect of the surgical intervention on voiceas judged by clinical assessment and change in voice-related quality-of-life surveys. The secondary outcome measures were the effectof surgical intervention on swallowing, glottic closure as assessedby endoscopy, and adverse events. Results Study Selection Using our search strategy, we identified 366 studies; 343 were ex-cluded after review of title or abstracts, and 8 studies were ex-cluded after full-text review. This yielded 15 studies for data extrac-tion ( Figure ). Injection Laryngoplasty Six studies1,13-17reported on for treatment of pediatricUVCP( Table 1 ).Thirty-onepatientswithavarietyofUVCPori- gins were included in the studies (5 male patients, 3 female patients,and 23 patients with unknown sex). The mean age of the patients was7.2 years (range, 1 month to 18 years). Dysphonia was the most com-mon indication for injection laryngoplasty (at least 14 patients). In atleast 5 patients, injection was performed for aspiration. A few authors described the methods for injection laryngo- plasty in detail. During the procedure, the airway was managed usingPediatric Unilateral Vocal Cord Paralysis Review Clinical Review & Education jamaotolaryngology.com (Reprinted) JAMA Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery July 2015 Volume 141, Number 7 655 Copyright 2015 American Medical Association.

Local anesthesia was not used for any of the injections.A number of different injection materials were used (Table 1), butonly 2 authors reported the injected volumes. Levine et al 14used an absorbable gelatin sponge (Gelfoam; Pfizer Inc) and polytetrafluo-roethylene and recommended injecting 0.3 to 0.4 mL twice with theArnold-Bruennings syringe (once into the middle or posterior one-third of the true vocal process and once into the junction of themiddle one-third and anterior one-third). Cohen et al 17reported in- jecting 0.26 mL of calcium hydroxylapatite Voice Gel; Merz Aesthetics Inc), and 0.5 mL of an absorb-able gelatin sponge (Gelfoam). Overall, the injected volumes var-ied from 0.2 to 0.6 mL depending on the injected material. Injection laryngoplasty consistently improved swallowing and voice in children with UVCP in the 6 selected studies. Of 5 patientsin whom injection was performed for recurrent aspiration, 3 pa-tients with tracheotomies were decanulated, 13,14one was weaned from the ventilator, and one stopped having choking episodes.15Dys- phonia was the indication for 26 vocal cord injections (excluding thestudy by Cohen et al 17). All 26 injections were deemed successful in improving voice by subjective measures. Objective measures ofvoice, including videostroboscopy and computerized voice analy-sis, were only documented in one patient. 15Cohen et al17were the only authors to report success rates of less than 100% after injec-tion laryngoplasty. Among patients injected for dysphonia, 94% ex-perienced subjective or objective improvement in voice, and amongpatients injected for dysphagia or aspiration, improvement was seenin 85%. However, in addition to 8 patients with UVCP, this analysis included the outcomes of 5 patients with vocal cord scarring oratrophy. 17Time to the additional injection was underreported and varied depending on the injected material (Table 1). Tucker13and Sipp et al16noted the effects of some injectables to last longer than theywould expect in the adult population.13,16In the 6 studies, one pa- tient with UVCP experienced a complication after vocal cord injec-tion: granuloma formation after polytetrafluoroethylene injection. 1 Thyroplasty Five case reports (level 4 evidence) reported using thyroplasty in 12pediatric patients ( Table 2 ). 1,16,18-20The mean age of the patients was 11.5 years (range, 2-18 years). Dysphonia and aspiration were indi-cations for surgery in 8 patients, whereas 4 patients had dysphoniaalone. Local anesthesia was used in 4 patients (aged 14-18 years).General anesthesia was used in 7 patients (aged 2-14 years). Sev-eral authors 16,20advocated the use of laryngeal airway mask for in- traoperative airway management. Voice outcomes were not evaluated objectively in any of the studies. The authors relied on subjective reports by physician, par-ent, or patient to evaluate voice outcomes. Overall, thyroplasty wasmoderately effective in alleviating dysphonia. Five (42%) of 12 pa-tients had resolution or improvement of dysphonia after thyro-plasty. There were no apparent differences in rates of recovery fromdysphonia in patients who underwent thyroplasty under general orlocal anesthesia. Dysphonia resolved or improved in 3 (43%) of 7 pa-tients and 2 (50%) of 4 patients who underwent thyroplasty undergeneral and local anesthesia, respectively. The laryngeal airway maskwas used for 2 of 3 cases in which dysphonia was resolved while thepatient was under general anesthesia. Link et al 19attributed the lack of voice improvement in 3 patients to the use of an adult thyro-plasty technique in which the prosthesis was placed above the vo-cal cords. The authors adjusted the adult technique in their last caseby lowering the implant placement and reported a successful voiceoutcome. Compared with voice improvement, thyroplasty was more ef- fective in alleviating aspiration. Seven (88%) of 8 patients had reso-lution or improvement in aspiration after thyroplasty. The remain-ing 1 patient had effects of the thyroplasty deteriorate atapproximately 6 months. H owever, this patient had a complicated preoperative history, including 3 failed polytetrafluoroethylene in-jections and an arterectomy that led to intractable aspiration. 18There were no apparent differences in rates of recovery from aspirationin surgical patients under general or local anesthesia. During the period of follow-up (range, 4-19 months), 4 of 12 pa- tients had no complications, while complications were not men-tioned in 7 patients. One patient had a major complication, aspira-tion pneumonia, that resulted in a 7-day period of intubation. In this18-year-old patient, thyroplasty was performed, in addition to ad-duction arytenoidopexy and cricothyroid joint subluxation, with thepatient under local anesthesia. 16 Reinnervation We identified 8 studies that reported outcomes of laryngeal rein-nervation for UVCP in a pediatric population ( Table 3 ). 7,9,13,16,21-24 These studies consisted of case reports and case series (level 4 evi- dence). Risk of bias was 5 in all except 2 studies.22,24 The population of patients in these 8 studies included children aged 2 to 16 years. The cause of UVCP in most of these patients (26of 38) was patent ductus arteriosus ligation. Dysphonia was the in-dication for surgery in 37 of 38 patients. Laryngeal electromyography (EMG) was not used in deciding the timing of surgical intervention in the included studies. How-Figure.

The au-thors did not provide information on whether any of the plannedreinnervation procedures were aborted as a result of unexpectedintraoperative EMG findings. Ansa-RLN anastomosis was the reinnervation approach used in all identified studies. Smith et al 22used ansa-RLN anastomosis in combination with arytenoid adduction in older children. Only 2 stud-ies described the surgical technique in detail: one using a minimallyinvasive approach with the da Vinci System (Intuitive Surgical Inc) 21 and another using the operating microscope.9In both studies, ansa cervicalis was identified low in the neck around the omohyoid muscle,and end-to-end anastomosis was created with 8-0 monofilamentin the first case and 10-0 nylon sutures in the other. An entire ansawas used in both studies and was believed to provide the best sizematch for the RLN. 9,21At the time of surgery, most authors also per- formed a temporary injection laryngoplasty of the paralyzed vocalcord. The results of laryngeal innervation were documented during a follow-up period that ranged from 3 months to 6 years. Many au-thors used validated subjective measures to assess the quality ofvoice and its effect on the child's life, including the Pediatric Voice- Related Quality of Life, Voice Handicap Index, and Consensus Au-ditory-Perceptual Evaluation of Voice, along with objective mea-sures of voice, such as maximum phonation time and pitch range.Most studies did not collect preoperative voice data and instead re-lied solely on postoperative results to demonstrate the effect of thereinnervation on voice. Nevertheless, all the authors commented thatreinnervation improved or resolved the dysphonia in children withUVCP. In the largest cohort of pediatric patients, Smith et al 24found that ansa-RLN reinnervation led to a statistically significant improve-ment in mean parental global voice rating and GRBAS (grade, rough-ness, breathiness, asthenia, and strain) rating scale compared withpreoperative data. In the same study, 24the authors found that the mean parental assessment of dysphasia improved from 3.7 to 1.4(P= .05). The other studies did not investigate the effect of rein- nervation on dysphagia. Of 36 patients, one had a complication thatwas related to surgery: development of a hypertrophic neck scar. 24 A few authors commented on the length of time from surgery to improvement in symptoms. Tucker13reported improvement or resolution of symptoms at 3 months postoperatively in all 3 of hispatients. Sipp et al 16reported that one patient improved at 3 monthsTable 1.

Finally, Marcum et al9reported improve- ment at 7 months postoperatively. Overall, it seems that most pa-tients will experience symptomatic improvement between 3 and 7months. Discussion Our report indicates the scarcity of objective data on surgical inter-ventions for pediatric UVCP. We found 15 English-language studiesreporting information on surgical interventions in 84 patients withUVCP. This report highlights the conclusion that surgical interven-tion for children with UVCP is guided by level 4 evidence. In our re-port, 13 of 16 studies received the highest risk of bias score (Tables 1,2, and 3). The scarcity of data is somewhat expected given that symp-tomatic UVCP is relatively infrequent in a pediatric population. 25 A key issue that remains controversial in the management of UVCP is the timing of surgical intervention. In adult patients, laryn-geal EMG can be used as an adjunct for prognostication and decid-ing on the timing of permanent intervention. Currently, there are noEMG-validated studies in pediatric patients 24; hence, the timing of intervention should be guided by symptom severity, knowledge ofUVCP natural history, and the effect of dysphonia on the child. Astudy of 404 children by Jabbour et al 2provides insights into the natural history of pediatric vocal cord paralysis. The authors note that,for unilateral and bilateral vocal cord paralysis, approximately half(45.8%) of the children achieve symptomatic recovery. Signifi- cantly, both the time to symptom resolution and the rate of symp-tom resolution had statistically significant variations based on thevocal cord paralysis. Children with vocal cord paralysis attributableto cardiac surgery or of neurologic origin achieved lower rates of vo-cal cord movement recovery (24% and 27%, respectively) than chil-dren with idiopathic vocal cord paralysis (40%). In addition, chil-dren with vocal cord immobility attributable to cardiac surgery orof neurologic origin had a shorter mean time to resolution of symp-toms (6.3 and 9.9 months, respectively) than the idiopathic group(11.1 months). The longest time from diagnosis to spontaneous re-covery of vocal cord movement in any category of patients was 38months. 2 Children who experience aspiration due to UVCP should be of- fered at least a temporary surgical intervention, such as tracheos-tomy or injection medialization. H owever, most children with UVCP experience dysphonia as their main symptom, 2and it is currently un- clear when to offer surgery for these patients. Literature on the ef-fect of dysphonia on children is limited. One study 8suggests that children as young as 6 years experience concern over dysphonia. Dys-phonia was found to have a negative effect on the lives of childrenacross the domains of physical, social or functional, and emotionalperformance. This negative effect became more pronounced withage. Given that UVCP was mostly diagnosed close to birth inchildren, 2a logical algorithm for treatment of dysphonia would con- sist of conservative and/or temporary measures for the first few yearsafter diagnosis until the possibility of spontaneous recovery is mini-mized. After observation and ideally before 6 years of age, a moreTable 2.

All rights reserved.permanent solution to dysphonia caused by UVCP should be of- fered as an option to the parents. The only surgical option for a temporary relief of UVCP symp- toms is injection medialization. The duration of effect depends onthe type of injectable material used. Of interest, several authors 13,16 noted that the effect of vocal cord injection appears to last longerin a pediatric population compared with the expected duration usingthe same materials in adults. The reasons for this phenomenon arenot understood. Tucker 13suggested that the slow relateralization of a paralyzed vocal fold as the injected material disappears may en-courage gradual hyperadduction of the contralateral vocal cord. Apotential concern with using injection medialization in a pediatricpopulation is the long-term effects of repeated injections on the vo-cal cords as tissues grow and develop. Long-term follow-up data onvocal cord medialization are required to address this concern. Medialization thyroplasty is the least studied surgical solution for pediatric UVCP. Only 12 cases met our inclusion criteria. The ben-efit of thyroplasty in children is inconsistent. In a study by Link etal, 193 of 6 children with UVCP had symptomatic improvement af- ter medialization thyroplasty. The authors attributed this result tousing an adult technique on a pediatric larynx and advocated forlower placement of prosthesis to improve glottic closure. A limita-tion of performing thyroplasty in children compared with adults is the necessity for a general anesthetic in children. General anesthe-sia takes away the ability to adjust the position of prosthesis basedon real-time vocal feedback. Given this limitation, several authors 16,17 have argued for the use of flexible endoscopy through a laryngealmask airway tube during surgery to improve the positioning of theprosthesis during surgery. Another limitation of pediatric thyro-plasty is the lack of long-term follow-up data. Even though the growthof pediatric larynx has been well studied, 18it is unclear if and how often revision thyroplasties are required for a child operated on ata young age. One interesting finding that has emerged from our studyis the high rate of aspiration recovery or improvement after thyro-plasty (88%). Overall, it seems that thyroplasty has fallen out of fa-vor in a pediatric population but remains a surgical option for chil-dren with aspiration, older children who might be able to tolerateprocedures without anesthesia, and patients with no alternatives. Compared with thyroplasty, reinnervation of RLN for children with UVCP should prevent the loss of muscle bulk and lead to vocalimprovement irrespective of laryngeal growth. With the exceptionof any injectable material used for injection laryngoplasty, which isoften performed concurrently with reinnervation, no foreign ma-terial is added to the larynx in reinnervation of RLN, which mini-Table 3.

Knowledge of origin-specific rates and timing of RLN recov-ery has allowed surgeons to be less fearful of sacrificing any poten-tial for recovery of RLN function with the reinnervation proce-dures. Several studies 7,23,24found that reinnervation can be safe for children as young as 2 years. One study7reported high rates of sat- isfaction after reinnervation as evidenced by Pediatric Voice-Related Quality of Life scores but only a modest improvement in ob-jective measures of voice, such as maximum phonation time. Thesefindings highlight the need for further investigation into reinnerva-tion outcomes in children. Conclusions Our report highlights the lack of quality evidence on surgical inter-ventions for pediatric UVCP. Recent data have clarified the naturalhistory of pediatric UVCP and helped surgeons decide when to of- fer interventions for UVCP. For the first few years after diagnosis ofUVCP, conservative measures and/or temporary measures shouldbe offered. The data summarized in this report suggest that injec-tion laryngoplasty, with the exception of polytetrafluoroethylene in-jections, is safe, nonpermanent, and effective in children. How-ever, long-term follow-up for children who receive the injectionintervention is lacking. Thyroplasty and reinnervation are 2 long-term surgical solutions. Although thyroplasty seems to have fallenout of favor in recent years because of the difficulty of positioningthe prosthesis in anesthetized pediatric patients, it is still a viable op-tion, especially for children with aspiration. Compared with thyro-plasty, reinnervation has seen a resurgence of interest. Recent stud-ies on reinnervation techniques offer encouraging results; h owever, long-term follow-up data are lacking. Surgeons who offer surgicalsolutions for pediatric UVCP are encouraged to systematically docu-ment and present their results to further collective knowledge onmanagement of this condition.

Methods: Previously untreated patients with UVFP were randomized to undergo either ML or LR. Voice results were compared pretreatment and at 6 and 12 months posttreatment using perceptual ratings by untrained listeners (RUL), blinded speech pathologist GRBAS scores, and voice-related quality of life (VRQOL) scores. Other secondary data included maximum phonation time (MPT), cepstral analysis, and electromyography (EMG) findings. Results: Twenty-four patients from nine sites completed the study, 12 in each group. There were no significant inter- group differences in pretreatment variables. At 12 months, both study groups showed significant improvement in RUL, totalGRBAS (grade, roughness, breathiness, asthenia, and strain) scores, and VRQOL scores, but no significant differences were found between the two groups. However, patient age significantly affected the LR, but not the ML, group results. The age less than 52 LR subgroup had significantly ( P<.05) better scores than the age more than 52 LR subgroup, and had better RUL and GRBAS scores than the age less than 52 ML subgroup. The age more than 52 ML subgroup results were significantly bet- ter than the age more than 52 LR subgroup. The secondary data generally followed the primary data, except that the MPTsfor the ML patients were significantly longer than for the LR patients. Conclusions: ML and LR are both effective surgical options for patients with UVFP. Laryngeal reinnervation should be considered in younger patients, whereas medialization laryngoplasty should be favored in older patients. Key Words: Laryngology, quality of life. Level of Evidence: 1b. Laryngoscope, 121:2172-2179, 2011 INTRODUCTION Unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP) occurs from a variety of causes, and can cause a paralytic dysphoniacharacterized as a weak, breathy voice with easy fatigu-ability and possible aspiration problems. 1Approximately 50% of patients with UVFP will pursue treatment for it.The most common surgical intervention is a medializa-tion procedure, either by vocal fold injections (whichtend to be temporary), 2,3or by medialization laryngo- plasty, as popularized by Isshiki and others.4-7These approaches reliably produce improved voice and swal-lowing results. An alternate treatment approach is laryngeal rein- nervation (LR), championed by Crumley and others forthe past few decades. 8,9This option has the theoreticadvantages of restoration of tone to the adductor muscles, leading to a more medial vocal fold position,and the absence of any foreign body implant. Despite anumber of reports of excellent voice results with reinner-vation, 10-13this approach has not achieved widespread acceptance. Some otolaryngologists are uncomfortablewith microneural surgery, are concerned about thepostop delay to achieve the final result, and/or feel thatthe voice results they achieve with medialization laryng-oplasty (ML) are satisfactory. This raises the obvious question of whether one pro- cedure is ''better'' than the other, or whether a subgroupof patients can be identified for which either procedureshould be recommended more strongly. This projectsought to address these questions with a multicenter,prospective, randomized clinical trial. The originalhypotheses include 1) the ratings by untrained listeners(RUL), voice-related life (VRQOL), grade,roughness, breathiness, asthenia, strain (GRBAS) rat-ings, as well as the objective measures, will be better at6 months for the ML group than for the LR group; and2) these parameters will be better at 12 months for theLR group than the ML group. It is already known thatLR requires several months to realize its full benefit,whereas the ML benefit is usually realized within a cou-ple of weeks; so this study also sought to answer thequestion patients most often ask: is the extra waitingtime (for LR to work) ''worth it?''

Euclid Avenue, Campus Box 8115, Reinnervation for Vocal Cord Paralysis 2172METHODS The study design and protocol were finalized with signifi- cant input from and ultimate approval by the Data and SafetyMonitoring Committee, an independent group of otolaryngolo- gists and scientists recruited by the NIH-NIDCD to oversee the project. Study sites were recruited at which the participating phy- sician regularly performed both surgical procedures to be usedin the project. The study protocol was approved by the institu- tional review board (IRB) of each institution prior to any patient recruitment, and informed consent was obtained from each patient prior to enrollment. Patient Selection Inclusion and exclusion criteria are shown in Table I. The diagnosis of UVFP followed an algorithm that included vocal fold immobility (by videostroboscopy), glottic gap, and electro- myography (EMG) criteria. Patients were excluded if they hada secondary laryngeal diagnosis that could potentially limit their final voice result (mucosal lesion, neuromuscular disease) or affect listener's abilities to evaluate it (nonlaryngeal speech disorder). Patients were required to wait at least 6 months from the onset of UVFP, unless the RLN was known to have beentransected. Patients meeting all of these criteria were invited to participate. All patients underwent pretreatment evaluation by a speech-language pathologist (SLP). If the SLP's professional judgement held that the patient might be adequately treated byspeech therapy alone, without surgery, then the patient under- went a trial of speech therapy; patients were not permitted to enter the study unless they were ''released'' by the speech pa- thologist. An initial demographic form was completed and forwarded to the Study Center. Following initial data collection,a pretreatment GRBAS score 14was assigned by three trained listeners. The G (grade) and B (breathiness) subscores were added and used to classify the patients' pretreatment voices as ''Good'' or ''Bad.'' This pretreatment voice classification and site of lesion (to of to sternal notch), distal (to sternal notch), or unknown) were used to stratify patients for random- ization (eight total cells). A stratified block randomizationalgorithm was used to assign patients to one of the two study groups.Data Collection Digital audio acoustic and aerodynamic recording equip- ment, and data collection software, was standardized and supplied to each site with grant funds. Patients underwent pre- treatment EMG of the ipsilateral thyroarytenoid muscle, and the results were classified according to the rating scale of Kouf- man and Walker.15The data collection protocol included standardized voice tasks (sustained vowels and reading pas- sage, ''The North Wind and the Sun''). An initial data collection training workshop was held with all participants prior to patient recruitment. The outcomes instrument used was the Voice-Related Quality of Life.16,17Comorbidities were assessed using the ACE-27 comorbidity index. Data were also collected at 6 and 12 months postoperative as shown in Table II. Surgery For patients randomized to the ML group, surgeons were permitted to perform whicheve r medialization procedure they would have performed if the patie nt were off-study, in order to get typical results. The reinnervatio n procedures were all performed using ansa cervicalis-to-RLN an astomosis. In one case, it was found that the planned anastomosis could not be performed for technical reasons, and a medializa tion was performed instead; this was permitted in the protocol and the patient remained in the study (data included in ML group). For all cases, the choice of an- esthesia was left to the surgeon and patient to decide. During the 12-month postoperative data collection period, patients were asked to avoid elective surgery requiring intuba- tion and to postpone any revision surgery for their vocal foldparalysis until after the data collection was complete. Patients were also specifically prohibited from undergoing any postoper- ative speech therapy until after the 12-month data collection, in order to eliminate this potential confounder. Data Analysis The primary outcome data was defined a priori to be the subjective perceptual voice Ratings determined by 30 volunteer untrained listeners (RUL), using a visual-analog scale to rate astandardized voice sample (second sentence of ''The North Wind and included blinded total GRBAS scores by a trained listener, and patients' quality of life scores using the VRQOL instrument (includes physical functioning and social-emotional subscores). Acoustic signals were converted to .wav files for analysis using CSL4500 (Kay Pentax, Lincoln Park, NJ) and further analyzed by computer.TABLE I. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria. Inclusion Criteria 1.

Laryngoscope 121: October 2011 Paniello et al.: Medialization Versus Reinnervation for Vocal Cord Paralysis 2173Statistical analyses were performed by the statistician (D.K.) using SPSS version 17.0. Because the sample size assump- tions for parametric testing were not met, the Mann-WhitneyU-test was used for independent sample comparison instead of t-tests. Friedman's analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for repeated measures. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test, with an adjusted alpha level ( \u00bc0.016) as used for post hoc analysis, was used for related samples analysis instead of pairwise compari-sons. All statistical tests of significance were two tailed and results were considered statistically significant if P<.05. RESULTS The study was suspended prematurely by the IRB at Washington University (WU) and support suspendedby the NIDCD because of informed consent irregularities and slow accrual at several sites. At that time, 60 patients were enrolled, of an originally planned 298. AWU-IRB-appointed quality assurance subcommitteereviewed all patient records in closed session andapproved the inclusion of 36 of these patients, based onpurely administrative (not scientific or surgical) issues.An adequate, analyzable data set was obtained from 24of these 36 patients. This group included one patientthat was not randomized. Although this group size issubstantially smaller than the original study goal, wefelt the data should still be analyzed, with the under-standing that only very large differences between anysubgroups would be statistically significant. As it turnedout, the final study population, by random chance,included 12 patients in each study group. Demographic and clinical information for the two study groups is shown in Table III. There were no signif-icant differences between the groups, except that the LRgroup had a longer time since the onset of paralysis(P\u00bc.023). The etiologies of paralysis for the ML group were thyroid surgery (four), anterior C-spine surgery(two), cardiothoracic surgery (two), chest cancer (one),skull base surgery idiopathic (one), vagal paragan-glioma (one); (four), cardiothoracic surgery (one),vagal paraganglioma (one), skull base surgery (one). In the ML surgeries, eight of the thyroplasty implants were made from silastic, four from Goretex.Two of the patients had an arytenoid adduction sutureplaced in addition to the thyroplasty implant. 18,19All of the ML procedures were done under local anesthesiawith intravenous sedation, but one was converted togeneral anesthesia the arytenoid adduc-tion suture. In the LR surgeries, all patients had reinnervation with the ansa cervicalis nerve. The branches selected included the sternohyoid (10), sterno-thyroid (2), and omohyoid (5); five of the patientsincluded branches from two muscles. Three of the ansacervicalis donor nerves were taken from the contralat-eral side. All of the LR procedures were performedunder general anesthesia. EMGs were performed using monopolar (n classi- fication system, 15and the number of patients in each study group meeting these criteria, are shown inTable IV.The results of analysis of the RUL, total GRBAS scores, and VRQOL scores for the two study groups areshown in Figure 1. For the two 12-patient study groups,there were no significant differences between the twotreatment groups in any of these three parameters ateach of the time points evaluated. Both study groupsshowed significant improvement in all parameters com-pared with their preoperative values (for RUL, 12months vs. preop, P\u00bc.008 for ML and P\u00bc.027 for LR). However, most of these voice results are still not withinthe ''normal'' ranges. For the total GRBAS scores, thenormal range is typically 0 to 1; for the VRQOL, mostnormal patients give scores of 80 to 100. A normal range was not established for the RUL, but for the nine patients that had ''perfect'' total GRBAS ratings of 0 at12 months, the RUL values averaged 81.5 67.2 (range \u00bc71-92), excluding one outlier. Significant differences were seen comparing the younger versus older subgroups. Choosing an age nearthe median with a natural break in the distribution, itwas found that age 52 resulted in six younger, six olderfor the ML group and five younger, seven older for theLR group. As seen in Figure 1, for the LR patients, theyounger subgroup was significantly better than the oldersubgroup at 6 months for RUL ( P\u00bc.005) and VRQOL (P\u00bc.048) and at 12 months for all three parametersTABLE III.

Following the results across time in Figure 1, it can be seen that the ML groups (total group and both agesubgroups) improved significantly by 6 months (com-pared with preop, P\u00bc.013 for total group RUL), and this result was essentially maintained at 12 months (forRUL at 12 months, P\u00bc.52 vs. 6 months but P\u00bc.004 vs. preop). The younger LR patients were significantlyimproved by 6 months, but continued to improve overthe next 6 months. The older LR patients showed thissame trend, but the magnitude of their improvementwas quite small and not statistically significant. The RUL, VRQOL, and GRBAS results were loosely correlated, as might be expected. An example is shownin Figure 2, comparing RUL with VRQOL results at 12months for the four age subgroups. A trend can be seenin which patients with lower perceptual ratings fromuntrained listeners also reported lower quality of lifescores. Similar scatter plots were observed comparingthese variables with total GRBAS scores. Other subgroup comparisons were evaluated. There was no difference in RUL, GRBAS, or VRQOL based onpatient's gender or smoking history. pretreatmentEMG class, site of lesion, and ACE-27 comorbidity score,the subgroup sizes were too small to allow statisticallymeaningful comparisons. Within the ML group, therewere no differences between the silastic and Goretexsubgroups. 7The VRQOL subscores (physical functioning and social-emotional) followed the same patterns as the total VRQOL scores shown in Figure 1; the SE scores were generally higher than the PF scores. Cepstral peak prominence values (based on con- nected speech, CPPS-s), which may the most reliableobjective measure of dysphonia, 20are shown in Figure 3 for the two study groups, and for their age-based sub-groups. It can be seen that the under-52 ML subgroupimproved to nearly normal (5 dB), whereas the over-52subgroup pulled the study group average down; but at12 months the voice quality fell back a bit. The LR sub-groups both improved throughout the 12 months, so thatby 12 months the LR group exceeded the ML group ( P< .05), young LR subgroup approaching normalat 4.70 dB. (CPPS-s analysis was not part of the original study plan, but was added post hoc). Laryngeal EMGs obtained from all 12 of the LR patients at 12 months are shown in Figure 4. It can beseen that six of the patients had the same LEMG find-ings that they had initially, whereas five ''improved'' byone or more classes and one declined by one class. Noneof the reinnervated patients had a postop class 5 (dener-vation). It should be noted that all of the LR patientswere presumably denervated (to class 5) at the time oftheir surgical procedure, as any existing RLN innerva-tion is transected order to neurorrhaphy. Postop EMGs were obtained fromonly six of the ML patients, with four staying in thesame class and two improving by one class (not shown). Fig. 2.

Laryngoscope 121: October 2011 Paniello et al.: Medialization Versus Reinnervation for Vocal Cord Paralysis 2176At each data interval, maximum phonation time (MPT) was measured as the first task (recorded as thelongest of three trials) in order to avoid added fatiguefrom the other protocol tasks. The median values at each data interval are shown in Figure 5; these were used because some extreme values skewed the means.The two study groups were similar preoperatively ( P\u00bc .895), but the ML group MPTs were significantly longerthan those of the LR group at 6 months ( P\u00bc.009) and at 12 months ( P\u00bc.023). Within each treatment group, the age subgroups were similar at each data point. Theyounger LR subgroup improved to match the ML groupat 12 months, but the older subgroup only improvedslightly over baseline. At the end of the 12 month follow-up period, sur- geons indicated they were planning additional surgeryon six of the study patients, for further voice improve-ment (five) or for aspiration (two). Three of thesepatients were in each study group, two in the youngerML subgroup, and three in the older LR subgroup.Three of the planned revision procedures were injectionaugmentations (two in ML patients) and three were thy-roplasties (two in LR patients). DISCUSSION Comparing the two study groups in their entirety, the hypothesis that the ML group would have betterresults at 6 months than the LR group was confirmed,whereas the hypothesis that the LR group would be bet-ter at 12 months was rejected, there was no differencein any of the major parameters (RUL, VRQOL, GRBAS)studied. Subgroup analysis showed significant differen- ces based on patient age, with the younger LR patients showing significantly better results than the older LRpatients, and also better results than the younger MLpatients. The older patients were better off with ML.Both groups of patients were improved over their base-line, but did not reach the normal range. These are themost clinically useful findings of this study. We speculate that younger patients have greater neuroregenerative potential than older patients, andthus achieved a better reinnervation result; and thatthey may also have a greater ability to adapt their pho-natory motor patterns to the changes produced by UVFPand subsequent reinnervation. Smith et al. 21reported excellent results with ansa-RLN reinnervation in agroup of 12- to 21-year-olds; the procedure has evenbeen performed with a transaxillary, robotic-assistedapproach in children. 22The ML procedure does not require nerve healing and might be expected to give sim-ilar results in all age groups, as found in this study. Itshould be noted that the over-under age of 52 from thisstudy is based on a small number of patients; the opti-mal age range is not known. Patient age has long beenrecognized as an important factor in motor nerve regen-eration, and numerous studies have confirmed thisfinding. 23-30Apel et al.23specifically note that ''the age of the patient at the time of injury is the most importantpredictor of outcome of nerve injury and repair,'' and that ''greater than half of patients over the age of 40 do not achieve any functional recovery following nerverepair.'' The age-related findings in the present studyare consistent with these observations. It has been hypothesized that ML patients may see a diminution in benefit after several months, due to atro-phy of the thyroarytenoid muscle from continueddenervation. This effect was observed in this study in theyounger age group for RUL (Fig. 1), cepstral (Fig. 3), andMPT (Fig. 5) data, but in the older age group for VRQOLdata (Fig. 1), although some of these comparisons did notreach statistical significance. Perhaps this reflects agreater ability in the younger ML group to deal withtheir voice problem, which was improved by ML butremained outside the normal range (Fig. 1). It may alsoreflect the older patients' QOL concerns about communi-cating with friends with diminished hearing capacity. The EMG findings in the LR group were interest- ing. Because the RLN is transected a few centimetersfrom the larynx in order to perform end-to-end anasto-mosis with the ansa cervicalis, any innervation (classes I-IV) was presentin 9 of the 12 patients with clinical UVFP. A fundamen-tal principle of LR is that the replacement innervationfrom the ansa cervicalis should result in improvementover what was already present in the RLN preop, eitherin axon count, synkinetic pattern, or both; this study didnot distinguish which mechanism was at work in thesepatients (the standardized Koufman and Walker EMGclasses do not assess synkinesis). In LR patients withsuboptimal results, the question arises whether theanastomosis has avulsed; but none of the patients in this study had a Class V EMG at 12 months, suggesting that at least some reinnervation occurred in all cases. The ML procedures resulted in longer MPTs than the LR procedures, presumably by doing a better job ofclosing the glottic gap. However, longer MPTs did notdirectly correlate with improved voice quality (Fig. 6). InFigure 6, the three patients with the highest RUL (allyounger LR patients) had average MPTs, whereas thepatients with the longest MPTs (older ML patients) hadintermediate RULs. The four patients with the lowestRUL (all older LR patients) did have the shortest MPTs,however. Thus, MPT is an important clinical parameter,but other factors are also involved in determining voice Fig. 5. Median maximum phonation times for ML (solid markers) and LR (open markers) groups, with age-based subgroups. Laryngoscope 121: October 2011 Paniello et al.: Medialization Versus Reinnervation for Vocal Cord Paralysis 2177quality. We speculate that vocal fold muscle tone, and the freedom of the fold to vibrate, are both incrementallybetter in the younger LR group than in the ML groups,and account for the higher perceptual voice quality. Clos-ing the glottic gap may also be very important incontrolling aspiration, but this was not investigated inthis project. The sample sizes in this study are relatively small, and thus required nonparametric statistical analysis.Larger study groups would clearly add statistical powerand would likely allow for additional subgroup analyses,but we believe the results would not differ significantlyfrom those reported herein. The original design calledfor a substantially larger study population, but theaccrual rate was too slow to expect to reach the targetpopulation in a reasonable time frame. We attempted toaddress this by modifying the protocol to allow a care-fully controlled number of patients who otherwise metall criteria to enter the study without being randomized(one such patient is included in these data), but someinformed consent and other administrative issues arosethat led to study closure by the sponsor. These issueshighlight the challenges of coordinating multiple sites,IRBs, and study personnel. This study also highlights the difficulty of carrying out a randomized trial involving surgical procedures.Surgeons, from their personal experiences and readingof the literature, and patients, from their Internetresearch and discussions with other patients and doc-tors, are often biased in favor of one procedure and arereluctant to agree to randomization. We ran into thisproblem with this study, despite the participating sur-geons' claims of equanimity, adding to the difficulty withstudy accrual. A multicenter approach can help withaccrual, but it also creates problems with data collectionand protocol management; in this study one-third of en-rolled patients were ultimately missing significant datacomponents and had to be omitted from final analysis.Future studies will need to anticipate these problemsand plan appropriately. CONCLUSIONS This small, prospective, randomized clinical trial found no overall differences between ML and LR fortreating UVFP; both treatments gave improvement, but the average patients still did not reach the normalrange. However, subgroup analysis showed that LRpatients under age 52 had significantly better voiceresults than those older than age 52, and also somewhatbetter than the younger patients that underwent ML.There was no difference in voice results between theyounger and older ML patients. The MPTs were signifi-cantly longer in the ML group than in the LR group.These findings should be considered when counselingpatients with UVFP on their surgical options.

Question source : HSD Hearings Division, HERC staff Issue : the current acupuncture guideline has limitations on treatments to specific numbers of treatments for certain conditions but does not specify if these limits are per year, per episode, or some other time period. HERC staff recommendation : 1) Modify GN92 as shown below a. The entries for b ack conditions refer to GN56 which limits to a total of 30 treatments of acupuncture, CMT, or PT per year. Further clarification in the acupuncture guideline is not needed. GUIDELINE NOTE 92, ACUPUNCTURE Lines 1, 208, 366, 407, 415, 467, 543 Inclusion of acupuncture (CPT 97810 -97814) on the Prioritized List h as the following limitations: Line 1 PREGNANCY Acupuncture pairs on Line 1 for the following conditions and codes. Hyperemesis gravidarum ICD-10-CM: O21.0, O21.1 Acupuncture pairs with hyperemesis gravidarum when a diagnosis is made by the maternity care provider and referred for acupuncture treatment for up to 12 sessions of acupressure/acupuncture per pregnancy . Breech presentation ICD-10-CM: O32.1 Acupuncture (and moxibustion) is paired with breech presentation when a referral with a diagnosis of breech presentation is made by the maternity care provider, the patient is between 33 and 38 weeks gestation, for up to 6 visits per pregnancy . Back and pelvic pain of pregnancy ICD-10-CM: O99.89 Acupuncture is paired with back and pelvic pain of pregnancy when referred by maternity care provider/primary care provider for up to 12 sessions per pregnancy . Line 208 DEPRESSION AND OTHER MOOD DISORDERS, MILD OR MODERATE Acupuncture is paired with the treatment of post -stroke depression only. Treatments may be billed to a maximum of 30 minutes face -to-face time and limited to 12 total sessions per year , with documentation of meaningful improvement. Line 366 SCOLIOSIS Acupuncture Guideline Clarification 2 Acupuncture is included on Line 366 with visit limitations as in Guideline Note 56 NON - INTERVENTIONAL TREATMENTS FOR CONDITIONS OF THE BACK AND SPINE. Line 407 CONDITIONS OF THE BACK AND SPINE Acupuncture is included on Line 407 with visit limitations as in Guideline Note 56 NON - INTERVENTIONAL TREATMENTS FOR CONDITIONS OF THE BACK AND S PINE. Line 415 MIGRAINE HEADACHES Acupuncture pairs on Line 12 sessions per year . Line 467 OSTEOARTHRITIS AND ALLIED DISORDERS Acupuncture pairs on Line 467 for osteoarthritis of the knee only (ICD -10-CM M17), for up to 12 sessions per year . *Line 543 TENSION HEADACHES Acupuncture is included on Line 543 for treatment of tension headaches (ICD -10-CM G44.2), for up to 12 sessions per year . The development of this guideline note was informed by a HERC coverage guidance. See http://www.oregon.gov/oha/herc/Pages/blog -low-back -non-pharmacologic -intervention.aspx *Below the current funding line. Conditions 1 Issue: The current GN60 OPIOID PRESCRIBING FOR CONDITIONS OF THE BACK AND SPINE was reviewed and updated at the May, 2016 VBBS meeting. Since that discussion, HERC staff have gotten feedback that the guideline should be clarified. The current guideline appears t o some readers to be a clinical practice guideline, when it is actually a coverage guideline. HERC staff feel that the guideline should be clarified to specify that it is not a clinical practice guideline . In working on this issue, HERC staff identified two other issues which needed to be addressed. First, Guideline Note 6 REHABILITATIVE THERAPIES needs to be reference d in the back lines. Second, Guideline Note 56 needs to clarify that patients on chronic opioids on a taper have treatments available sim ilar to the medium/high risk patients with acute back issues. HERC staff recommendation s: 1) Modif y GN60 as shown below a. HERC staff feel that the changes below clarify intent rather than substantially change prior intent of the HERC b. Clarifies that this guide line is not a clinical practice guideline c. Includes standard wording about \"included on this line\" d. #1e takes out \"lack of\" opioid abuse or misuse as it may be impossible to verify complete lack of prior abuse. Instead, proposed wording echoes #2c . e. #3 take s out the clause that allows continued use after 3 months in exceptional circumstances. Instead, a new surgery or injury would start the patient back down the entire guideline sequence. This clarifies intent and removes a potential loop hole . f. Consider ch anging the taper deadline to a date not around the Christmas/New Year holidays (i.e. end of January or other non -Dec 31 date) 2) Modify GN56 as shown below a. Add a clause specifying that patients on chronic opioid therapy tapers should be treated like medium or high risk new back condition patients in terms of the services and treatments available. This links back to the requirement for these types of treatments in the taper plan 3) Add line 407 to Guideline Note 6 Rehabilitative Therapies to clarify that the PT s ervices on these lines come under the GN6 yearly limits a. Note: lines 351, 366, and 532 are already included in this guideline Opioids for Back Conditions 2 GUIDELINE NOTE 60, OPIOID S PRESCRIBING FOR CONDITIONS OF THE BACK AND SPINE Lines 351, 366, 407, 532 Opioid medications are only included on these lines under the following criteria: The following restrictions on opioid treatment apply to all diagnoses included on these lines. For acute injury, acute flare of chronic pain, or after surgery: 1) During the first 6 weeks after the acute injury, flare or surgery , opioid treatment is included on these lines ONLY : a) When each prescription is limited to 7 days of treatment, AND b) For short acting opioids only, AND c) When one or more alternative first line pharmacologic therapies such as NSAIDs, acetaminophen, and muscle relaxers have been tried and found not effective or are contraindicated, AND d) When prescribed with a plan to keep active (home or prescribed exercise regime) and with consideration of additional therapies such as spinal manipulation, physical therapy, yoga, or acupuncture, AND e) There is documented lack of current or prior verification that the patient is not high risk for opioid misuse or abuse. 2) Treatment with opioids after 6 weeks, up to 90 days after the initial injury/f lare/surgery , requires the following is included on these lines ONLY : a) With Ddocumented evidence of improvement of function of at least thirty percent as compared to baseline based on a validated tools. b) Must be When prescribed in conjunction with therapies such as spinal manipulation, physical therapy, yoga, or acupuncture. c) With Vverification that the patient is not high risk for opioid misuse or abuse. Such verification may involve : i) Documented verification from the state's prescription monitoring program da tabase that the controlled substance history is consistent with the prescribing record ii) Use of a validated screening instrument to verify the absence of a current substance use disorder (excluding nicotine) or a history of prior opioid misuse or abuse iii) Admi nistration of a baseline urine drug test to verify the absence of illicit drugs and non-prescribed opioids. d) Each prescription must be limited to 7 days of treatment and for short acting opioids only 3) Chronic opioid treatment (>90 days) after the initial injury/flare/surgery is not included on these lines except for the taper process described below . Further opioid treatment after 90 days may be considered is included on these lines ONLY when there is a significant change in status, such as a clinically si gnificant verifiable new injury or surgery. In such cases, use of opioids is limited to a maximum of an additional 7 days. In exceptional cases, use up to 28 days may be included on these lines, subject to the criteria in #2 above. Opioids for Back Conditions 3 Transitional coverage for patients on long -term opioid therapy as of July 1, 2016 For patients with chronic pain from diagnoses on these lines currently treated with long term opioid therapy, opioids must be tapered off using For patients on covered chronic opioid therapy as of July 1, 201 6, opioid medication is included on these lines only from July 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016. During the period from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017, continued coverage of opioid medications requires an individual treatment plan developed by January 1, 2017 which includes a taper with a quit date an end to opioid therapy no later than January 1, 2018. Taper plans must include nonpharmacological treatment strategies for managing the patient's pain based on Guide line Note 56 NON -INTERVENTIONAL TREATMENTS FOR CONDITIONS OF THE BACK AND SPINE . If a patient has developed dependence an d/or addiction related to their opioids, treatment is available on Line 4 SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER. GUIDELINE NOTE 56, NON -INTERVENTIONAL TREATMENTS FOR CONDITIONS OF THE BACK AND SPINE Lines 366, 407 Patients seeking care for back pain should be assessed for potentially serious conditions (\"red flag\" symptoms requiring immediate diagnostic testing), as defined in Diag nostic Guideline D4. Patients lacking red flag symptoms should be assessed using a validated assessment tool (e.g. STarT Back Assessment Tool) in order to determine their risk level for poor functional prognosis based on psychosocial indicators. For patie nts who are determined to be low risk on the assessment tool, the following services are included on these lines: Office evaluation and education, Up to 4 total visits, consisting of the following treatments: OMT/CMT, acupuncture, and PT/OT. Massage, if a vailable, may be considered. First line medications: NSAIDs, acetaminophen, and/or muscle relaxers. Opioids may be considered as a second line treatment, subject to the limitations on coverage of opioids in Guideline Note 60 OPIOID PRESCRIBING FOR CONDITIO NS OF THE BACK AND SPINE. See evidence table. For patients who are determined to be medium - or high risk on the validated assessment tool, as well as patients undergoing opioid tapers as in Guideline Note 60 OPIOIDS FOR CONDITIONS OF THE BACK AND SPINE, the following treatments are included on these lines: Office evaluation, consultation and education Cognitive behavioral therapy. The necessity for cognitive behavioral therapy should be re-evaluated every 90 days and coverage will only be continued if the re is documented evidence of decreasing depression or anxiety symptomatology, improved ability to work/function, increased self -efficacy, or other clinically significant, objective improvement. Opioids for Back Conditions 4 Prescription and over -the-counter medications; opioid medicati ons subject to the limitations on coverage of opioids in Guideline Note 60 OPIOID PRESCRIBING FOR CONDITIONS OF THE BACK AND SPINE. See evidence table. The following evidence -based therapies, when available, are encouraged: yoga, massage, supervised exerci se therapy, intensive interdisciplinary rehabilitation. HCPCS S9451 is only included on line 407 for the provision of yoga or supervised exercise therapy. A total of 30 visits per year of any combination of the following evidence -based therapies when avail able and medically appropriate. These therapies are only included on these lines if provided by a provider licensed to provide the therapy and when there is documentation of measurable clinically significant progress toward the therapy plan of care goals a nd objectives using evidence based objective tools (e.g. Oswestry, Neck Disability Index, SF -MPQ, PEG and MSPQ). 1) Rehabilitative therapy (physical and/or occupational therapy), if provided according to Guideline Note 6 REHABILITATIVE THERAPIES. Rehabilitati on services provided under this guideline also count towards visit totals in Guideline Note 6 2) Chiropractic or osteopathic manipulation 3) Acupuncture Mechanical traction (CPT 97012) is not included on these lines, due to evidence of lack of effectiveness for treatment of back and neck conditions. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS; CPT 64550, 97014 and 97032) is not included on the Prioritized List for any condition due to lack of evidence of effectiveness. The development of this guideline note was informed by a HERC coverage guidance. See http://www.oregon.gov/oha/herc/Pages/blog -low-back -non-pharmacologic -intervention.aspx . Opioids for Back Conditions 5 Evidence Table of Effective Treatments for the Management of Low Back Pain Tobacco smoking and surgical procedures Tobacco smoking and procedures , Issue #755 Page 1 Question : Tobacco smoking and elective surgeries Question source : Medical Directors from CCOs Issue : At the November 2015 and January 2016 VbBS meetings , a new guideline on tobacco cessation and elective surgeries was proposed. Members debated a guideline that would require intensive smoking cessation counseling prior to elective surgery versus a guideline requiring tobacco cessation prior to elective sur gery. CCO and FFS medical directors were consulted. In general, implementation of the behavioral intervention was thought to be quite challenging and several members preferred requiring cessation. Concerns about e quity and addiction were also raised . Ad ditionally , there were concerns raised about the acceptability of other nicotine replacement strategies, what the definition of elective entails, presence of severe psychiatric comorbidity interfering with cessation, and which specific surgeries might be included or excluded. Members asked HERC staff to return with further details that would assist with implementation. The following questions thus need to be addressed: 1) Should the guideline note require intensive smoking cessation interventions or require smoking cessation to occur prior to elective surgeries? 2) How should elective versus urgent/emergent surgical procedures be defined? 3) Which types of surgeries should be included? Should the y be by general body system and/or specialty or specifically defined by code? 4) What other procedures should be excluded from the guideline note? 5) Are there certain underlying health conditions such as people with severe and persistent mental illness who should be excluded from the guideline? 6) Should there continue to be a dis crepancy between these elective surgeries requiring 1 month of cessation (if this is chosen) versus other surgeries such as bariatric and spinal fusion surgery which have 6 month abstinence requirements? Evidence on specific surgeries MED, 2015 report 1. Key findings: a. Smoking is associated with greater morbidity across a wide range of surgeries b. Smoking cessation initiated at least four weeks before surgery was associated with reduced complications for certain types of surgeries c. The longer the abstinence the greater the benefit 2.

Mayo Clinic laboratories http://www.mayomedicallaboratories.com/test - catalog/Clinical+and+Interpretive/82510 a. In addition to nicotine and metabolites, tobacco products also contain other alkaloids that can serve as unique markers of tobacco use. Two such ma rkers are anabasine and nornicotine. Anabasine is present in tobacco products, but not nicotine replacement therapies. Nornicotine is present as an alkaloid in tobacco products and as a metabolite of nicotine. tine >30 ng/mL in urine indicates current tobacco use, irrespective of whether the subject is on nicotine replacement therapy. The presence of nornicotine without anabasine is consistent with use of nicotine replacement products. Heavy tobacco users who ab stain from tobacco for 2 weeks exhibit urine to tobacco smoke can cause accumulation of nicotine metabolites in nontobacco users. Urine cotinine h as been observed to accumulate up to 20 ng/mL from passive exposure. Neither anabasine nor nornicotine accumulates from passive exposure. 4.

Intensive smoking cessation interventions that often included NRT showed improvements in postoperative morbidity. NRT is therefore an acceptable practice as part of intensive smoking cessation interventions to reduce perioperative morbidity when the surge ry is planned in the following 4 -8 weeks. With regard to the following questions 1) Should the guideline note require intensive smoking cessation interventions or require smoking cessation to occur prior to elective surgeries ? a. The group seemed to lean toward requiring cessation to occur. QHOC medical dire ctors definitely preferred requiring cessation to make this an implementable requirement. 2) How should elective versus urgent/emergent surgical procedures be defined? a. General literature suggests a high acuity definition (e.g. within 48 hours) however, there are many surgeries, including those for cancer, subacute cardiovascular disease, etc, that may easily be pushed off for a few days to a week or two due to access iss ues, but postponing them until cessation occurs (or doesn't) may not be clinically appropriate nor ethically acceptable. Having the same definition of the time period of cessation as the need for surgery makes some sense. Staff r ecommend s 1 month as the time period. 3) Which types of surgeries should be included? Should they be by general body system and/or specialty or specifically defined by code? a. Including all \"elective\" surgeries may be fraught with issues. Staff recommend s listing specific surgeries f or which we know that smoking worsens outcomes. The challenge with this is that some other related surgeries, for example , shoulder replacement surgery may not have identified studies but outcomes may fair equally poorly among active smokers . 4) What other p rocedures should be excluded from the guideline note? a. At least c ancer -related, diagnostic, and reproductive services. But by listing specific types of surgeries and including specific codes, these (and many others) would naturally be excluded. b. The codes f or those specific surgeries for which there is information about worse perioperative morbidity fall on many lines on the Prioritized List. Consider not applying the guideline to the following lines: Tobacco smoking and surgical procedures Tobacco smoking and procedures , Issue #755 Page 16 i. Orthopedic - lines 85 (hip fracture), 204 (cancer of soft tissue), 205 (cancer of bones), 290 (complications of a procedure always requiring treatment), 360 (closed fracture of extremities), 447 (malunion and nonunion of fracture) ii. Cardiovascular - Line 73 (acute and subacute ischemic heart diseas e); Line 103 (cardiomyopathy ); exclude life and limb threatening lines 5) Are there certain underlying health conditions such as people with severe and persistent mental illness who should be excluded from the guideline? a. Proposed language included 6) Should ther e continue to be a discrepancy between these elective surgeries requiring 1 month of cessation (if this is chosen) versus other surgeries such as bariatric and spinal fusion surgery which have 6 month abstinence requirements? a. It is reasonable to have diffe rent requirements given the invasiveness, and potential impact on delayed healing and complications associated with specific surgeries (e.g. fusion, bariatric). b. For t hose surgeries with a requirement for shorter term smoking cessation (i.e . 1 month) , use of NRT would be considered acceptable; whereas those surgeries using a 6 month requirement would entail complete cessation, including of NRT products. c. Different objective testing would need to be used in elective surgeries for which NRT is acceptable compared to when it is not. HERC STAFF RECOMMENDATIONS 1. Discuss adoption of a new guideline note: GUIDELINE NOTE XXX, SMOKING CESSATION AND ELECTIVE SURGICAL PROCEDURES Lines 193, 317, 354, 361, 364, 392, 423, 469, 496 , 622 Smoking cessation is required prior to elective surgical procedures for active tobacco users. Cessation is required at least 1 month prior to the procedure and requires objective evidence of abstinence from smoking. The well -studied tests for confirmat ion of smoking cessation include cotinine levels and exhaled carbon monoxide testing. However, cotinine level may be positive in nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) users (which is not a contraindication to elective surgery coverage). In patients using NR T the following alternatives to urine cotinine to demonstrate smoking cessation may be considered: o Exhaled carbon monoxide testing (well studied) o Anabasine or anatabine testing Tobacco smoking and surgical procedures Tobacco smoking and procedures , Issue #755 Page 17 Elective surgical procedures in this guideline are defined as surgical proced ures which are flexible in their scheduling because they do not pose an imminent threat nor require immediate attention within 1 month. The specific surgical procedures that fall under this guideline include elective: Orthopedic - rotator cuff (Line 423) , glenoid 364, 392, 423 ), total hip 361) and total knee arthroplasty (Line 361) Cardiovascular CABG (Line 193 = chronic ischemic heart disease ) Lower extremity bypass graft - Line 354 (NON -LIMB THREATENING PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE) Invasive dental procedures - implants, subepithelial connective tissue grafts, guided tissue regeneration, periodontal flap surgery (Lines 496, 622 ) Vaginoplasty and phalloplasty (Line 317 ) Chronic sinusitis surgery (Line 469 ) For patients with severe and persistent mental illness (e.g. schizophrenia) smoking cessation for any duration may be an insurmountable barrier, and adherence to this guideline may be waived. Certain procedures, such as lung volume reduction surgery, bariatric surgery, erectile dysf unction surgery, and spinal fusion have 6 month tobacco abstinence requirements. See Guideline Notes 8, 100, and 112. Additional issues: Modify guideline notes 8, 100, and 112 : A) to be consistent in requiring cotinine level testing, and B) consider adding language about the frequency of testing.

Cosmetic Special Topic Clearing the Smoke: The Scientific Rationale for Tobacco Abstention with Plastic Surgery Jeffery K. Krueger, M.D., and Rodney J. Rohrich, M.D. Dallas, Texas The use of tobacco is a significant contributor to pre- ventable morbidity and mortality in the United States. Asignificant proportion of cardiovascular diseases, variousoral and pulmonary neoplasms, nonmalignant respiratorydiseases, and peripheral vascular disorders can be attrib-uted to the use of cigarettes. Surgical outcomes can alsobe adversely affected as a result of cigarette smoking withintraoperative and postoperative pulmonary, cardiovascu-lar, and cerebrovascular complications as well as increasedwound healing complications. These are found across theentire spectrum of surgical specialties. Tissue ischemiaand wound-healing impairment secondary to the influ-ence of tobacco is particularly problematic for the plasticsurgeon, especially during elective facial aesthetic proce-dures, cosmetic and reconstructive breast operations, ab-dominoplasty, free-tissue transfer, and replantation pro-cedures. By educating and providing guidelines to thosepatients who smoke and by refusing to operate on indi-viduals who fail to abstain, tobacco-associated surgicalmorbidity in the Plast. Reconstr. 2001.) Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in the UnitedStates. Despite achievements and advances inclinical knowledge during the 20th century,approximately 48 million American adults con-tinue to smoke cigarettes, and half of thosewho smoke will eventually die from a smoking-related illness. 1At least one out of every five deaths in this country can be attributed to theuse of tobacco, with the number approaching430,000 per year. 1The annual economic bur- den of tobacco-related diseases is quite stagger-ing as well\u2014nearly $100 billion in health-carecosts and lost productivity each year. 2 The use of tobacco has been implicated in a variety of illnesses and is known to causechronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coro-nary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, pe-ripheral vascular disease, and cancer. An asso- ciation between impaired wound healing andtobacco use has also been clinically recognizedfor centuries and, more recently, supported byexperimental data. The reduced capacity for wound healing is of particular concern when it affects the out-comes of elective surgical procedures, as pa-tients have an increased risk of complicationsand a decrease in the quality of postoperativeresults. Emotional, physical, and financialstrains on patients and surgeons are inevitablein the wake of surgical morbidity and will cer-tainly add to the stresses of developing andmanaging a clinical practice. Plastic and reconstructive surgeons are par- ticularly vulnerable to these problems, as theyperform a high number of elective operationsincluding facial and breast aesthetic opera-tions, restoration of facial and breast deformi-ties, body contouring, and reconstruction ofthe trunk and extremities. Success is largelyjudged on form rather than function; there-fore, any factors that increase the incidence ofscarring, asymmetry, technical failure, andneed for reoperation must be minimized orremoved. To optimize surgical results, plasticsurgeons should (1) identify patients who usetobacco products, (2) provide patient counsel-ing and smoking cessation information, and(3) insist on eliminating tobacco use from allpreoperative candidates. This article discusses the effects of tobacco smoke on wound healing, reviews the data ontobacco use and plastic surgery complications,and provides recommendations for managingpatients who use tobacco products.

We alsoinvestigated the possibility that anabasine and anatabinecan be used as biomarkers for tobacco use duringnicotine replacement therapy. Urine samples and data on self-reported tobacco use were obtained from subjects enrolled in tobacco cessationprograms. Urine concentrations of tobacco alkaloids andmetabolites were measured and correlated with self-reported tobacco use. Concentrations of anabasine andanatabine were used to validate abstinence in smokelesstobacco users who used nicotine gum as part of thetherapy. Correlations of alkaloid concentration with self- reported tobacco use before treatment ranged from fairto poor. In subjects abstaining from smokeless tobaccobut using nicotine gum, anabasine and and cotinine resulting fromnicotine gum use. Anabasine and anatabine concentrations in urine can be used to validate abstinence or measure the extent oftobacco use in persons undergoing nicotine replacementtherapy. Introduction More than 4000 compounds have been identified in tobacco smoke, and at least 50 of these have been found to be carci-nogenic (1, 2). Epidemiological studies in smokers indicate adose-response relationship between the number of cigarettessmoked per day and the risk of developing certain smoking-related diseases (3). The alkaloid nicotine is the major phar-macologically active substance in tobacco (4). There is goodevidence that most smokers are dependent on nicotine and thatthe severity of tobacco dependence may be related to the levelof nicotine intake. Consequently, determining exposure to spe-cific substances in tobacco and tobacco smoke is useful inepidemiological studies exploring relationships between expo-sure to particular toxic substances and development of disease,in assessing the outcome of tobacco dependence treatmentprograms, and in assessing the risks of potentially less harmfulor nonaddictive tobacco products. A major methodological issue is measuring exposure. Self-report measures, such as the number of cigarettes smokedper day, do not take into account individual differences insmokingbehaviororconsumptionoftobaccoproductsthatmaydiffer in their delivery of toxic substances. To validate self-reports of subjects in tobacco-dependence treatment studies, itis desirable to have a biochemical measure of tobacco use fordetermining treatment outcome (5-10). The most widely usedbiochemical measure of tobacco use is cotinine, the proximatemetabolite of nicotine, which can be measured in blood, saliva,or urine (5, 6, 8, 10). Cotinine is quite specific for use oftobacco or for use of nicotine-containing medications. Smallamounts of nicotine are found in some foods, but nicotinederived from dietary sources is insignificant compared with theamounts derived from tobacco use. Cotinine also has the ad-vantage that it has a long half-life compared with nicotine (11).Cotinineconcentrationsdonotfluctuategreatlyduringtheday,andlevelsinbloodaremuchhigherthanthoseofnicotine,thusfacilitating its measurement. Thiocyanate (a hy-drogen cyanide) in serum, carboxyhemoglobin in blood, orexpired carbon monoxide have been used to detect smoking,but these biomarkers have significant dietary and environmen-tal sources, and are less specific and less sensitive for detectingsmoking than nicotine or its metabolites (5, 6, 8, 10). Although an excellent biomarker for tobacco use, cotinine is not a valid marker in persons undergoing treatment withnicotine medications such as gum, transdermal patches, nasalsprays, or inhalers. Carbon monoxide (expired CO or carboxy-hemoglobin) and thiocyanate may be used to detect heavy Received 1/25/02; revised 7/16/02; accepted 8/5/02.

Substances that are pres-ent in tobacco, measurable in biological fluids, but not derivedmetabolically from nicotine would be valuable for validatingtobacco abstinence in persons undergoing NRT. 3 Tobaccocontainsalkaloids,structurallyrelatedtonicotine (Fig. 1), that are not likely to be present in foods or to haveother sources of exposure, and are not present in nicotine-containing medications. Nicotine in tobacco (12) and its me-tabolite cotinine (13) are nearly optically pure S-isomers, whereas tobacco contains substantial (4 -45%) amounts of the R-isomers of the minor alkaloids nornicotine, anabasine, andanatabine (14). In this paper, we report concentrations of thetobacco alkaloids anabasine and anatabine in the urine of cig-arette smokers and smokeless tobacco users, and describe theapplication of these measures to validate abstinence in smoke-less tobacco users undergoing therapy with nicotine gum. Con-centrations of nicotine and its metabolites nornicotine and co-tinine, as well as anabasine and anatabine, in urine of a largepopulation of cigarette smokers and smokeless tobacco usersare also reported. Materials and Methods Subjects and Clinical Protocols. Subjects were persons en- rolled in clinical trials for cessation of tobacco use. Study 1 (Pacific Research Institute) and study 2 (University of Minne-sota)wereprogramsforcessationofsmokelesstobaccousethatusednicotinegumaspartofthetherapy.Study3(UniversityofCalifornia San Francisco) was a smoking cessation programusing behavioral therapy and nicotine gum. Informed consentwas obtained from all of the subjects. The studies involvinghuman subjects were approved by the respective InstitutionalReview Boards. Urine samples were obtained before treatment and, forstudies 1 and 2, urine specimens were also obtained at follow- up. Urine samples were acidified with sodium bisulfate andstored frozen until analysis. Determination of anabasine andanatabine concentrations in urine was used as an outcomemeasure in studies 1 and 2. In study 1 (15), 100 smokeless tobacco users were re- cruited to a four-session cessation program. All of the subjectswere medically screened and randomly assigned to receiveeither2mgofnicotinegum(Nicorette)oraplacebogum,asanadjunct to the behavioral group treatment program. Both sub-jects and group leaders were blind as to the condition of thesubject.Ninety-sevenmalesand3femalesenteredtheprogram, and76%completedthe6-weektreatmentprogramandattendedthe four group counseling sessions. Concentrations of anaba-sine and anatabine were determined in urine of all of thesubjects before treatment, and in urine of 76 subjects complet-ing the study. Study 2 examined the effects of nicotine gum versus placebo by group behavioral treatment versusminimal contact treatment (16). Smokeless tobacco users (210) who were will-ing to quit were randomly assigned to one of the following:(a) behavioral treatment plus 2 mg of nicotine gum ( n/H1100555); (b)behavioraltreatmentandplacebogum(n /H1100550);(c)minimal treatment contact and 2 mg of nicotine gum (n /H1100551); or (d) minimal contact and placebo gum (n /H1100554). Participants were askedtocheweitheractivenicotineorplacebogumforaperiodof 8 weeks. At the end of this treatment period, subjects weregiven the option to receive another box of free gum. Partici-pantsassignedtothegroupbehavioraltreatmentparticipatedineight sessions over the course of 10 weeks. Those individualsassigned to the minimal contact condition met four times forindividual sessions with the nurse over the 10-week period.Nonuse of tobacco was determined by self-report. Concentra-tions of anabasine and anatabine were determined in the urinesof the 105 subjects who were assigned to nicotine gum treat-ment before treatment and in urine of 103 of these subjects onfollow-up, having completed the study. Urine samples from118 subjects using nicotine gum in another study with a similarprotocol (16) were analyzed to verify that nicotine gum doesnot contain significant amounts of anabasine or anatabine. Study 3 urine samples (99 persons) were obtained from cigarette smokers before beginning smoking cessation pro-grams. Of these, 52 were from a study of early versuslate quitting (17). The subjects were 59% female and 91% Cauca-sian, who smoked /H1102210 cigarettes per day. Subjects were be- tween 21 and 60 years of age. The remaining 47 subjects werefrom a study of cognitive behavioral therapy versuspsycho- educational therapy. All of the participants received NRT.Subjects were 52% women and 88% Caucasian who smoked/H1102220 cigarettes per day. Urine samples from 35 nonsmokers were obtained to de- termine the specificity of anabasine and anatabine for tobaccouse. The subjects were persons who provided a urine specimenbeforebeginningastudyoftheeffectsofalowdoseofnicotinein smokers or were laboratory personnel. Nonsmoking statuswasdeterminedeitherbyplasmacotininebeing /H1102115ng/ml(10) or by being obtained from laboratory personnel known tobe nonsmokers. Of these, 49% were female and 49% wereCaucasian. Analysis of Urine Samples. Concentrations of nicotine and cotinine in urine were determined (limit of quantitation, 10 ng/ml) using gas chromatography with nitrogen-phosphorusdetection by a modification of a method published previously(18). The structural analogs is not specified.1669 Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention on May 12, 2016. \u00a9 2002 American Association for Cancer Research. cebp.aacrjournals.org Downloaded from ylnicotine and 1-methyl-5-(2-pyridyl)-pyrrolidinone (ortho- cotinine), were used as internal standards. A procedure forsimultaneous extraction of nicotine and cotinine was used (19). Concentrations of anabasine, anatabine, and nornicotine (limit of quantitation, 1 ng/ml) were determined by gas chro-matography-mass spectrometry (20). Data Analysis. The ratio of nicotine:cotinine was determined for each individual subject, and the mean values for smokers and smokeless tobacco users were computed from these ratios.Analysesofdifferencesinmeanscomparingsmokelesstobaccousers and cigarette smokers were performed by ttests. The criterion for tobacco use was set at a concentration of /H110222 ng/ml in urine for both anabasine and anatabine. The basisfor this criterion was inspection of urine concentration datafrom a group of people who were known not to use tobacco. Sensitivityandspecificityofanabasineandanatabinecon- centrations for detecting tobacco use were determined as de-scribed by Browner et al.(21). Sensitivity was determined in 179 persons enrolled in smokeless tobacco cessation programs(studies 1 and 2). Sensitivity (expressed as percent) is defined as 100 /H11003 a/(a/H11001c), where a is the number of subjects who continued to use tobacco (true positives), and c is the number of tobaccouserswithconcentrationsofanabasineandanatabinebelowthecutoff of 2 ng/ml (false negatives). Self-reported tobacco usewas considered to be accurate, because there would be noincentive to falsely report continued tobacco use. Specificity was determined in 35 persons who did not use any form of tobacco. Specificity (expressed as percent) isdefined as 100 /H11003d/(b/H11001d), where d is the number of non- tobacco users with urine concentrations of anabasine and ana-tabine below the cutoff of 2 ng/ml (true negatives), and b is thenumber of nontobacco users with anabasine and anatabineconcentrations /H110222 ng/ml (false positives). the minor alkaloids anabasine, anatabine, and nornicotine in urine of smokers andsmokeless tobacco users before beginning tobacco cessationprograms are given in Table 1. Mean nicotine concentrationsranged from 1310 to 1960 ng/ml, and were significantly lowerin smokeless tobacco users than in cigarette smokers. Meancotinine concentrations ranged from 1790 to 2420 ng/ml, andwere significantly higher in smokeless tobacco users than incigarette smokers. The ratio of nicotine:cotinine in urine ofsmokeless tobacco users (subjects from studies 1 and 2 com- bined) and cigarette smokers averaged 0.67 and 1.24, respec-tively. The difference between the two groups was significant,P/H110210.005. Because some investigators (22) have reported cotinine concentrations normalized to creatinine concentra-tions, levels expressed as ng/mg creatinine are also reported inTable 1. Mean nornicotine concentrations in urine of all of the tobacco users were similar (range /H11005107-127 ng/ml), as were anabasine concentrations (range /H1100522-24 ng/ml). Mean anat- abine concentrations in urine of cigarette smokers (22 ng/ml)wereabouthalfthosefoundinurineofsmokelesstobaccousers(41-45 ng/ml). To test the specificity of the alkaloids for tobacco use, we measured concentrations of nornicotine, anabasine, and anat-abine in the urine of 35 nonsmokers (confirmed by cotinineanalysis), who reported that they did not use other forms oftobacco and did not use nicotine-containing medications. Con-centrations of nornicotine, anabasine, and anatabine were be-low the limit of quantitation (1 ng/ml) in all but 3 of thesubjects. Of these 3, the urine of one subject contained 3.4ng/ml anabasine, with anatabine and nornicotine below thelimit of quantitation. Another of the 3 contained 4.4 ng/mlnornicotine and 1.7 ng/ml anabasine, with anatabine below thelimit of ng/ml anabasine, and 1.84 exposure, or whether because of small amountsof substances interfering with the assay is unknown, althoughthe subject whose urine contained measurable amounts of allthree alkaloids might indicate some prior tobacco use. How-ever, using the criterion of both anabasine and anatabine con-centrations being /H110222 ng/ml to classify a person as using to- bacco, none of the 3 persons would have been classified ashaving used tobacco, and the specificity for detecting tobaccouse is 100% (21). Concentrations of anabasine and anatabine were used to validate cessation of smokeless tobacco use in studies 1 and 2.Subjects were considered to have relapsed if concentrations ofboth anabasine and anatabine were /H110222 ng/ml. The results are presented in Table 2. In study 1, concordance between self-reported abstinence and urinary concentrations of both anaba-sine and anatabine /H110212 ng/ml was 100%. In study 2, the con- cordance was 79%.

The half-lives of based on urinary excretion data, were found tobe 16 h and 10 h, respectively (23). Correlations of anabasine, anatabine, and cotinine in urine of subjects before beginning tobacco cessation programs werecorrelated with their self-reported tobacco use (Table 3). Cor-relations ranged from fair to poor. Discussion Urine concentrations of anabasine, anatabine, nornicotine, nic- otine, and cotinine were determined in 99 cigarette smokers(study 3), and were compared with concentrations of thesealkaloids in 205 smokeless tobacco users (studies 1 and 2)before initiating treatment (Table 1). The sums of concentra-tions of nicotine and its metabolite cotinine in the smokeless similar,suggestingsimilarlevelsofnicotineabsorption.Thelowerratioof nicotine:cotinine in smokeless tobacco users (0.67) com-pared with cigarette smokers (1.24) is most likely a result ofmore nicotine being swallowed by smokeless tobacco users,which then undergoes presystemic metabolism to cotinine inthe liver (24). Concentrations of anabasine and anatabine inurineofalltobaccousersweremuchlessthanconcentrationsofnicotine, as expected, because of much lower levels in tobacco(23). Cotinine levels were high because it is a major nicotinemetabolite.Nornicotine,bothaminoralkaloidfoundintobaccoandaminormetaboliteofnicotine,waspresentatlevelshigherthan those of anabasine and anatabine, but much lower thannicotine and cotinine. Interestingly,concentrationsofanatabinewereonaverage 2-fold higher in urine of the smokeless tobacco users as com-pared with cigarette smokers, despite similar nicotine and co-tinine levels, and although smokeless tobacco products containconsiderably lower levels of anatabine than cigarette tobacco,0.084mg/gram versus0.27mg/gram(23).Alikelyexplanation is that anatabine is decomposed to a much greater extent thanis nicotine in burning tobacco, resulting in lesser absorption bycigarette smokers than by smokeless tobacco users. It shouldalso be pointed out that anabasine, anatabine, and nornicotine,being secondary amines, are capable of being converted tonitrosamines by reaction with nitrogen oxides or nitrite in vivo (25).N/H11032-nitrosoanabasine and N/H11032-nitrosonornicotine are carci- nogenic in animal models (26). For this reason, urine nornico-tine concentrations, which have not been reported previouslyforalargepopulationoftobaccousers,areincludedinTable1. Objective outcome measures to validate self-reports of abstinenceintobaccocessationprogramsareneeded(5 -10).In addition, methods for quantitating tobacco consumption areneeded in studies for evaluating potential harm reduction. Thenicotine metabolite cotinine, measured in blood, saliva, orurine, is the most widely used biomarker for tobacco use (5).However, cotinine or other nicotine metabolites are not appli-cable for assessing tobacco use in persons undergoing NRT.The objective of our studies was to evaluate the use of urineconcentrations of the minor tobacco alkaloids anabasine andanatabine as outcome measures for persons undergoing NRT.These alkaloids should not be present in nicotine-containingmedications, and, indeed, we found that subjects abstainingfromsmokelesstobaccoandusingnicotinegumdidnotexcretemeasurable amounts of anabasine or anatabine. Urine levels of anabasine and anatabine were evaluated as outcome measures for smokeless tobacco cessation in twostudies that used nicotine gum as part of the treatment. Therewasgenerallygoodconcordancebetweenself-reportedtobaccoabstinence,andurineconcentrationsofanabasineandanatabinebeing below the cutoff (2 ng/ml; Table 2). In study 1, concord-ance was 100% of the 45 subjects reporting abstinence, and instudy 2 it was 79% of the 89 subjects who reported abstinence. Concordance with self-reported relapse and urine meas- ures of anabasine and anatabine was also evaluated (Table 2).In study 1, there were 7 false negatives, with 23% of the 31subjects reporting relapse, and in study 2 there were 5 falsenegatives, which was 36% of the 14 subjects who reportedrelapse.Thefindingoffalsenegativesispresumablybecauseofinfrequent or low-level tobacco use, with enough time elapsedbetween relapse and obtaining a sample for concentrations todrop below the limit of quantitation of the assay. anabasine and anatabine, based on urinary excretion data,were found to be 16 h and 10 h, respectively (23). Our labo-ratory has developed a much more sensitive assay using liquidchromatography-tandem mass spectrometry methodology (lim-it of quantitation, 0.2 ng/ml) that should make it possible todetect much less frequent tobacco use in future studies. Also, itis possible that a metabolite of anabasine or anatabine existsthathasalongerhalf-lifethantheparentalkaloids,whichmightmake it possible to detect infrequent tobacco use. This possi-bility is suggested by the fact that the nicotine metabolitecotinine has a much longer half-life than nicotine (11). How-ever, to our knowledge, studies of the metabolic disposition ofanabasine and anatabine in vivohave not been reported. In the present study, we proposed the use of the alkaloids anabasine and anatabine as biomarkers for tobacco use inpersons undergoing NRT, and have applied these measures totreatment trials for cessation of smokeless tobacco use usingnicotine gum. It would also be of interest to use these measuresto estimate tobacco consumption. Self-reported tobacco con-sumption, such as number of cigarettes smoked per day, gen-erally does not correlate well with nicotine intake (27). In thepresent study, correlations between self-reported tobacco useand urine concentrations of anabasine, anatabine, and cotinineranged from fair to poor (Fig. 2; Table 3).

Presumably, this is because of less var-iability in the systemically absorbed dose of nicotine from acigarette than from a dip or tin of tobacco. This could bebecause the dips are of different sizes, there are differentconcentrations of nicotine in different smokeless tobacco prod-ucts, the products are used differently by different people ( i.e., used for different duration of time or held in the mouth differ-ently), and/or because of differences in saliva pH, which affectnicotine absorption. However, for smokeless tobacco, it hasbeenreportedthatfrequencyanddurationoftobaccouse,ratherthan amount, appear to be better indicators of nicotine/cotinineexposure (28). Consequently, if frequency and duration mea-sures had been obtained in the present study, correlations mayhave been better. In a previous study, we found generally good correlations between nicotine intake from tobacco (determined from bloodnicotine concentrations and nicotine clearance data; Ref. 29)and urine concentrations of nicotine, cotinine, anabasine, andanatabine. Data from that study are also shown in Table 3 andin Fig. 2 (23). Consequently, the measurement of tobaccoalkaloidsortheirmetabolitesasbiomarkersisadvantageousforestimating the amount of tobacco consumed (11, 23).

Question source: HERC staff Issue : Various finger problems are located on different lines on the Prioritized List, some of which are covered lines and some are not covered. Fractures, lacerations, burns, etc. of fingers are all on other lines specific for those types of injuries. The sp rains, strains, dislocations and deformities of fingers do not appear to have an organized system to assign them to a specific line.

Question source : Tracy Muday, MD, OHP Medical Director Issue : Implantable cardiac event monitors (CPT 33282 and HCPCS C1764) are currently excluded. Dr. Muday received a request for placement of this device for evaluation of cryptogenic stroke. The HSC reviewed this device in 2000 and placed it on the Excluded List; the rationale and documentation for this decision is not available. The minutes note that this decision was made with the input of specialty groups familiar with the procedure. This device has not been reviewed since 2000. An insertable cardiac monit or, also referred to as an implan table cardiac loop recorder ( ICLR ), is a small insertable device that continuously m onitors heart rhythms and records them either automatically or when a hand -held patient assistant is used. Unlike Holter monitors (monitor for 1 -7 days ) or external cardi ac loop recorders (monitor for 3 -4 weeks), the ICLR 's record for about 3 years. They are most commonly used to evaluate fainting spells /transient loss of consciousness that remain unexplained after initial evaluation. ICLR s are also used for evaluation of seizures, recurrent palpitations, lightheadedness and dizziness. Cryptogenic ischemi c stroke, one in which the origin of the emboli cannot be determined after full evaluation (e.g. ECG, 24 hours of telemetry, echocardiogram, carotid ultrasound), make up nearly a quarter of all ischemic strokes. There is growing interest in the use of ICLR s to identify occult paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in patients with cryptogenic stroke (MED 2015).

There is no high -quality comparative evidence on the use of implantable cardiac loop records or other ambulatory monitoring modalities on the initiation of oral anticoagulation or stroke recurrence in patients diagnosed with occult atrial fibrill ation. b. In the past two years, four systematic reviews found increased detection of occult atrial fibrillation by ICLR s compared to other ambulatory monitoring efforts. However, these reviews do not report on change in management nor impact on stroke recur rence (Afzal et al., 2015; Dussault et al., 2015; et Implantable Cardiac Event Monitors 2 al., 2014; Sposato et al., 2015). None of the systematic reviews identified head - to-head comparative trials of different ICLR devices or extended monitoring devices. The limited data available fo r inclusion in the reviews were based on observational trials with short follow up periods. c. In a small, poor -quality cohort study of 61 patients receiving ICLR s, all received weeklong serial ECGs as well. The authors reported that within the first week of use, ICLR compared to serial ECG detected cases of intermittent atrial fibrillation at a 3:1 ratio. The authors did not discuss the potential clinical significance of this finding. This study did not observe any recurrent stroke or TIAs in their short follow -up per iod. d. In a fair -quality, industry funded, RCT of 441 patients, higher rates of stroke and lower use of oral anticoagulation were observed in those randomized to conventional monitoring compared to ICLR s (i.e. baseline and serial ECGs every 6 months, thus n ot meeting strict inclusion criteria). At 6 -and 12 -months follow - up, the ICM group compared to controls had statistically significantly higher percentages of participants that received anticoagulation (6 months: 10.1% vs. 6.0%, P=0.007). e. Among the included studies, adverse events were rare and included site infection, pocket erosion, pain, and irritation. A single patient experienced device failure from sub -optimal placement preventing rhythm detection. f. Summary: Patie nts with ischemic stroke found to have atrial fibrillation on initial evaluation experience decreased risk of recurrent stroke with the use of oral anticoagulation therapy. In patients with cryptogenic stroke, despite an extensive initial evaluation withou t detection of atrial fibrillation, the use of prolonged monitoring demonstrates increased detection of paroxysmal or occult atrial fibrillation. The current literature is limited on the impact of the detection of occult atrial fibrillation through prolong ed monitoring and subsequent initiation of anticoagulation on stroke recurrence . Clinicians and researchers are advocating for more comparative research to be conducted on ICLR s and their use in cryptogenic stroke, as well as the clinical impact of detecti ng occult atrial fibrillation in those with cryptogenic stroke. 2) Parry 2010 , review of ICLR for evaluation of unexplained syncope a. Conclusion: The ICLR has entered routine clinical practice over the last 15 years with surprisingly little rigorous data. In this era of evidence -based practice, this requires to be addressed with a focus on high quality trials of up -to-the minute technology. In the interim, the ICLR offers a useful adjunct in the investigation of unexplained syncope, particul arly where an arrhythmic cause is suspected.

Implantable loop recorders in the investigation of unexplained syncope: a state of the art review Steve W Parry,1Iain G Matthews2 ABSTRACT Since its introduction 15 years ago, the implantable loop recorder (ILR) has become the investigative tool ofchoice in recurrent unexplained syncope following negative initial investigations. This is based on very few randomised controlled clinical trials and modestly sizedobservational studies. Further controlled data arerequired to inform clinical practice with attention focused on empowering ILR-guided diagnosis, establishing the optimal timing of ILR use in syncope and embracing newtechnological advancements. INTRODUCTION Syncope accounts for 1 e6% of emergency atten- dances and 0.6 e1.0% of hospital admissions.1The 10-year cumulative incidence of syncope in the Framingham study was 6% with increasing burdenin tandem with advancing years. 2The majority of cases are neurally-mediated in origin, but syncope isa common presentation of cardiac rhythm distur-bance. The sporadic nature of presentation makes syncope a logical target for prolonged cardiac rhythm monitoring. The implantable loop recorder (ILR) is a device implanted in the subcutaneous tissue of the left hemithorax under local anaesthetic. The ILRrecords a high delity bipolar ECG signal stored as a loop, frozen at the time of symptoms using a handheld activator. Newer devices have programmable automatic recognition (typically>160 beats/min, <30 beats/min or pauses >3 s). The majority of clinical studies involving the ILR have focused on the investigation of recurrentunexplained syncope or neurally-mediated syncope. We reviewed the English language scienti c litera- ture by searching MEDLINE from 1966 through January 2009 using the PubMed interface under the terms syncope [MeSH] OR neurally mediated syncope [MeSH] AND ILR. The reference lists fromarticles identi ed by this search were also reviewed for relevant publications. A total of 139 articles were identi ed, with those representing the stron- gest evidence included in our review which con nes itself to the adult population and the key evidenceconcerning ILR use in these contexts. Gaps in the evidence base will be highlighted and suggestionsfor future research proposed. RECURRENT SYNCOPE The initial clinical experience with the ILR was ina population of highly symptomatic patients with recurrent unexplained syncope. 3Sixteen patients with a mean of 8.4 64.4 episodes of previous syncope, all with negative ambulatory monitoring,tilt table testing and electrophysiological (EP) study, underwent device implantation. Fifteen ofthe 16 patients (94%) had recurrent syncope during follow-up (13 68.4 months). A diagnosis was obtained in all 15 patients with symptom-rhythm correlation possible in 9 of them (60%). Treatment was instituted in all 15 with no recurrence of syncope by study termination. This initial success paved the way for further work 4e31in using the ILR as part of the diagnostic strategy in recurrent unexplained syncope (table 1).The considerable majority of these studies areobservational, small and/or retrospective. While conclusions drawn from them individually are tempered by the inherent flaws of this study design, collectively they form a limited but persuasive evidence base to justify the clinical use of the ILR in recurrent unexplained syncope. Randomised controlled trials Clinical effectiveness Only two randomised trials studies involving ILRs have been undertaken, both of which compared the role of the ILR with a conventional testing strategy.The Randomised Assessment of Syncope Trial (RAST) 6involved 60 consecutive patients attending a specialist syncope service with recur- rent unexplained syncope or a single episode of syncope with injury warranting cardiovascular investigation. At baseline all 60 patients hada negative initial evaluation similar to that recom-mended by the European Society of Cardiology guidelines on the management of syncope, 32in common with the remainder of the ILR studies. An ILR was implanted in 30 patients; the remainder underwent prolonged external monitoring, tilt table testing and EP study. If the allocated strategydid not provide a diagnosis, patients were offered crossover to the alternative arm. A diagnosis was established in 14 patients in the ILR arm comparedwith 6 patients in the conventional arm (52% vs 20%, p \u00bc0.012). Six patients in the ILR group and 21 in the conventional testing group crossed over. Overall, when combining the primary strategywith crossover, a diagnosis was established in 55% with a prolonged monitoring strategy compared with 19% with conventional testing (p \u00bc0.0014). The other randomised study is the Eastbourne Syncope Assessment Study (EaSyAS).27Tw o hundred and one unselected patients presenting toa single institution with recurrent syncope without ad enite diagnosis following initial clinical inves- tigation were randomly assigned to ILR implanta- tion (n \u00bc103) or conventional investigation and management (n \u00bc98). There were further syncopal events in 43 (43%) of the ILR group compared with1Institute for Ageing and Health, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK 2Department of Cardiology, Freeman Hospital, Newcastleupon Tyne, UK toDr W upon 2010; 96:1611e1616. doi:10.1136/hrt.2010.193417 1611Reviewgroup.bmj.com on July 9, 2015 - Published by http://heart.bmj.com/ Downloaded from Electric Tumor Treatment Fields for Glioblastoma 1 Question : Should electr ic tumor treatment field therapy be covered for initial treatment of glioblastoma? Question source : Andy Luther, MD, OHP medical director Issue : Electr ic tumor treatment field therapy (ETTF) involves a portable device which delivers low-intensity, intermediate frequency electric fields via non -invasive, transducer arrays. It is thought to physically interfere with tumor cell division. Glioblastoma is a very difficult to treat cancer of the brain with a typical life expectancy with current therapy of 1 -2 years . Standard treatment involves surgical resection, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. ETTF therapy was reviewed for treatment of recurrent glioblastoma in May, 2014. At that time, little evidence was found to support its effectiveness and it was found to be less cost effective than conventional therapy f or recurrent glioblastoma. T he HCPCS codes for this therapy (HCPCS A4555 and E0766) were placed on the Services Recommended for Non -Coverage Table. ETTF recently received FDA approval for initial treatment of glioblastoma. This approval was based on the results of a single trial of 695 participants. A4555 Electrode/transducer for use with electrical stimulation device used for cancer treatment, replacement only E0766 Electrical stimulation device used for cancer treatment, includes all accessories, any type From Dr. Luther : ... had a request for the Optune \"tumor treating fields\" system for treatment of glioblastoma in conjunction with temozolomide. It was FDA approved in October for certain patients, but Up -To-Date is fairly cautious about its use given data available so far. We have an unfortunate patie nt that it might be appropriate for, and of course it is very expensive, OHP coverage not clear. There is now (as of October) an indication for treatment for newly diagnosed glioblastoma, after rad/chemo, in conjunction with ongoing temozolomide. I think the ancillary GL only addresses recurrent glioblastoma, so this may deserve another look, as it seems likely to keep coming up. Originally approved entry in the Services Recommended for Non -Coverage Table ELECTRONIC TUMOR TRE ATMENT FIELDS Most recent review date: May, 2014 Electronic tumor treatment field therapy (ETTF; HCPCS A4555 and E0766) has been found to have significantly lower cost effectiveness compared to conventional chemotherapy for treatment of recurrent glioblastoma.

HERC staff summary : The current evidence to support the use of electric tumor treatment fields in the initial treatment of glioblastoma is based on a single tr ial, which had questions regarding the trial methodology. NCCN has newly released guidelines that recommend its use in t he initial treatment of glioblastoma. Most private insurers are covering this technology for treatment of both newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma.

Question source : Andy Kranenburg, MD and Adam Cabala, MD , orthopedic surgeons Issue: Drs. Kranenburg and Cabala have requested the HERC pairing joint fusion (CPT 27279) with sacroiliitis (ICD -10 M46.1). They report that this procedure can reduce pain and increase function and quality of life. Please see their letter for full de tails. Currently, sacroiliac joint fusion (CPT 27279 Arthrodesis, sacroiliac joint, percutaneous or minimally invasive (indirect visualization), with image guidance, includes obtaining bone graft when performed, and placement of transfixing device) is o n line 187 FRACTURE OF PELVIS, OPEN AND CLOSED. M46.1 (Sacroiliitis, not elsewhere classified) , which includes sacroiliitis and sacroiliac arthritis , is currently on line 407 CONDITIONS OF THE BACK AND SPINE (medical line) . From Dr. Kranenberg: There ar e multiple prospective, randomized, level one studies published in reputable peer reviewed journals showing that SI fusion is superior to non -surgical treatment in properly selected patients, that the surgery is highly safe, and that the results are durabl e. This complements over 20 published level two, three, and four level studies. Information and a bibliography was submitted by the manufacturer , as well as a letter in support of covering this procedure . From Vern Saboe, DC in opposition [excerpt] : Studies that support minimally invasive sacroiliac joint fusion have been single -center, case - based, with the exception of [a] small manufacturer sponsored RCT [with many issues] . The state of Oregon should remain skeptical as per funding this surgical in tervention for chronic low back pain until such time as higher quality evidence is available supporting efficacy, incidence and severity of adverse events, and cost vs. benefit. Evidence No studies of >50 patients were found in HERC staff MEDLINE searc h other than Polly 2015 (below , included as a submitted article ) Submitted articles 1) Polly 2015 : RCT of SIJ fusion with triangular titanium implants vs non -surgical management (document not included due to length) a. N=148 patients (102 implants, 46 non -surgical management \u20142:1 randomization protocol ) i. Crossover from nonsurgical to surgical care was allowed after the 6 - month study visit was complete: \"Study investigators r equired the trial to Sacroiliac Joint Fusion for Sacroiliitis 2 have a crossover component because patients with SIJ dysfunction have markedly reduced quality of life, because limited evidence was available to support the effectiveness of non-surgical management for this condition, and because prel iminary results from SIJ fusion using the study device were very promising.\" ii. Non -surgical management consisted of PT, medications including narcotics and NSAIDs, steroid injections, and radiofrequency ablation iii. Surgical group also received PT two times a week for six weeks post - operatively b. RESULTS: Six-month success rates were higher in the surgical group (81.4% vs 26.1%; posterior probability of superiority > 0.9999). Clinically important ( 15 point) Oswestry Disability Index improvement at 6 mo nths occurred in 72.5% of the SIJ fusion group vs 13% of the nonsurgical management group (P < .001). At 12 months, improvements in SIJ pain and Oswestry Disability Index were sustained in the surgical group. Subjects who crossed over had improvements in pain, disability, and quality of life similar to those in the original surgical group. Adverse events were slightly more common in the surgical group (1.3 vs 1.1 events per subject; P = .31). c. Conclusions: In carefully selected patients with SIJ dysfunction caused by degeneration or disruption of the joint, minimally invasive SIJ fusion using triangular implants placed across the joint provides superior 6 -month outcomes compared with NSM. These positive outcomes for pain, disability, quality of life, and sat isfaction were maintained at 12 months. d.

N=103 patients (52 surgical, 51 medical management) i. Conservative management consisted of PT, information, and \"optimization of medical therapy\" b. Results: At 6 months, mean LBP improved by 43.3 points in the SIJF group and 5.7 points in the CM group (difference of 38.1 points, p<0.0001). Mean Oswe stry disability index improved by 26 points in the SIJF group and 6 points in the CM group (p<0.0001). ASLR, EQ -5D-3L, walking distance and satisfaction were statistically superior in the SIJF group. c. One case of postoperative nerve impingement occurred in the surgical group. d. Conclusions : In patients with chronic SIJ pain, minimally invasive SIJF using triangular titanium implants was safe and more effective than conservative management in relieving pain, reducing disability, improving patient function and q uality of life. e.

Rates of excellent satisfaction, determined by pain reduction, function, and quality of life, ranged from 18% to 100% with a mean of 54% in open surgical cases. For MIS patients, excellent outcome, judged by patients' stated satisfaction with the surgery, ranged from 56% to 100% (mean 84%). g. The reoperation rate after open surgery ranged from 0% to 65% (mean 15%). Reoperation rate after MIS ranged from 0% to 17% (mean 6%).

Authors Conclusions Surgical intervention for SIJ pain is beneficial in a subset of patients. However, with the difficulty in accurate diagnosis and evidence for the efficacy of SIJ fusion itself lacking, serious considera tion of the cause of pain and alternative treatments should be given before performing the operation. i.

There also appears to be significant rates of complications , need for reoperation, and the possible development of novel lumbar pathology as a result of the procedure. Prominent private payers also consider this treatment experimental for back or SI pain . HERC staff recommendation : 1) Do not add sacroiliac fusion (CPT 27279 Arthrodesis, sacroiliac joint, percutaneous or minimally invasive (indirect visualization), with image guidance, includes obtaining bone graft when performed, and placement of transfixing device ) to 532 CONDITIONS OF THE BACK AND SPINE WITHOUT URGENT SURGICAL INDICATIONS a.

Continue to include ICD -10 M46.1 (Sacroiliitis, not elsewhere classified) only on line 40 7 CONDITIONS OF THE BACK AND SPINE . This will allow pairing with medical therapy but not surgical treatments. Ariel Smits, MD, MPH Oregon Health Policy and Research 421 SW Oak Street, 8th Floor Portland, OR 97204 Re: Requesting Coverage for Minimally Invasive (MIS) Sacroiliac (SI) Joint Fusion, CPT Code 27279 Dear Dr. Smits: We would like to appeal for reconsideration of the current Oregon Health Plan for Sacroiliac Joint Fusion. Specifically, we are writing to request a face-to-face meeting to share the clinical evidence that supports MIS SI joint fusion and respectfully request the removal from the \"Experimental & Investigational\" list, and allow coverage for CPT code 27279 as medically necessary for patients who have been properly diagnosed with sacroiliac (SI) joint dysfunction that is a direct result of sacroiliac joint disruption and degenerative sacroiliitis. Why access to 81 joint fusion is important to our practice The SI joint is a well-recognized source of pain in many patients who present with chronic lower back pain (LBP). Quality of life is markedly impaired in patients with SI joint pain compared with age-and gender-matched cohorts, and the impairment is similar or worse than many common disabling medical conditions such as hip, knee, and spine conditions treated surgically [Cher 2014]. Similarly, patients with SI joint dysfunction considering surgery have decrements in quality of life as or more severe compared to patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis, spinal stenosis, and intervertebral disc herniation [Cher 2015]. We reserve surgery as a last resort; we'll first seek to provide pain relief through conservative treatments such as physical therapy and pain management. In fact, thanks to our skilled physical therapists, physicians, and other specialists, only 10 percent of our patients ever undergo surgery. To date, we have performed approximately 50 minimally invasive SI joint fusion procedures with the iFuse Implant System\u00ae. The majority of patients have had excellent results as demonstrated in multiple randomized, controlled clinical trials. SI joint fusion is considered only in carefully selected patients. We employ a diagnostic algorithm designed to determine the specific pain generator by conducting a thorough evaluation of the lumbar spine, hip, and SI joint. Our diagnostic algorithm is consistent with the patient selection guidelines published by the North American Spine Society (\"NASS\") and the International Society for the Advancement of Spine Surgery (\"ISASS'')- 1 Patient Selection Guidelines Proper diagnosis of the SI joint is of paramount importance to obtain good health outcomes and can be achieved by following a diagnostic algorithm. Appropriate diagnosis begins with a complete patient history, followed by a comprehensive physical examination of the lumbar spine-SIJ-hip complex. A series of SI joint provocative maneuvers that stress the joint has been shown to be helpful in diagnosing SI joint pathology.1.2 The diagnosis is confirmed with a radiographically confirmed intraarticular SI joint diagnostic injection. Multiple pain management and spine surgery specialty societies recommend and support this diagnostic algorithm (IASP, AAPM&R, APS, ASIPP, ASA, ASRA, SIS, IPM, ISASS). Several of these professional medical societies have published guidelines that describe a similar diagnostic algorithm. 3-12 Patient selection guidelines for MIS SI joint fusion have been published by both NASS 13 and ISASS. 14 Both societies acknowledge that MIS SI joint fusion is the standard of care for appropriately selected patients and recommend coverage for patients who have failed appropriate non-surgical treatment. The guidelines can be accessed via the links below. NASS: http: I I sibone. com I uploads I do cum en ts I Performed Worldwide The iFuse Implant System has been commercially available since 2009 and is well accepted by the medical community. As of January 2016, more than 20,000 iFuse Implant System procedures (>60,000 implants) have been performed worldwide by over 1,100 surgeons, with the majority being performed in the United States (18,000+ procedures, 850+ surgeons). FDA Indication Statement The iFuse Implant System is intended for sacroiliac fusion for conditions including sacroiliac joint dysfunction that is a direct result of sacroiliac joint disruption and degenerative sacroiliitis. This includes conditions whose symptoms began during pregnancy or in the peripartum period and have persisted postpartum for more than six months. Clinical studies have demonstrated that treatment with the iFuse Implant System improved pain, patient function and quality of life at 12-months post\u00ad implantation. Clinical Evidence The evidence supporting MIS fusion of the sacroiliac (SI) joint has continued to grow in volume and in quality. More than 25 peer-reviewed publications demonstrate the safety, effectiveness and durability of MIS SI joint fusion performed with the iFuse Implant System. Demonstrated outcomes include: 2 Pain Relief- clinically important rapid (6 weeks) and sustained (12, 24, 40, and 60 month) decrease in VAS pain (70-80\u00b0/o reduction)15-25 Patient Function Improvement- clinically important reduction in disability as measured by ODI (Oswestry Disability Index) at 6, 10, and 12 months (mean 30 point reduction)15,16,18,20,21,23,26,27 Quality of Life (QOL) Improvement- measured by SF-36, EuroQol-5D and Roland Morris Disability 15,16,18,21 High Patient Satisfaction(< 90\u00b0/o)15-19,21-23,25 Favorable complication and revision rates 15,16,28,29 Additional published articles address the safety, health state utility, and the biomechanics of the iFuse Implant System. One-year results from SI-BONE's prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial (INSITE): This randomized controlled trial included 148 subjects, randomized 2:1, MIS SI joint fusion surgery versus non-surgical management. This level1 study showed that MIS SI joint fusion using triangular titanium implants was more effective than non-surgical management in relieving pain, improving patient function and improving quality of life in patients with SI joint dysfunction due to degenerative sacroiliitis or SI joint disruptions. Pain, disability and quality of life also improved after crossover from non -surgical to surgical treatment.15 One-year results of a prospective multicenter trial (SIFI): Results from the one-year prospective study are extremely positive. Mean SI joint pain improved from 79.8 at baseline to 30.0 and 30.4 at 6 and 12 months, respectively (mean improvements of 49.9 and 49.1 points, p < 0.0001 each). Mean ODI improved from 55.2 at baseline to 32.5 and 31.4 at 6 and 12 months, respectively (improvements of 22.7 and 23.9 points, p < 0.0001 each). SF-36 physical component summary improved from 31.7 at baseline to 40.2 and 40.3 at 6 and 12 months respectively (p < 0.0001). At 6 and 12 months, 93%) and 87\u00b0/o of subjects, respectively, were somewhat or very satisfied and 92% and 91%, respectively, would have the procedure again. The study concluded that MIS SI joint fusion resulted in improvement of pain, disability, and quality of life in patients with SI joint dysfunction due to degenerative sacroiliitis and SI joint disruption.16 Five Year Outcomes (17 patients followed up out to five years): Rudolf et al reported that long-term clinical and radiographic outcomes after MIS SI joint fusion are favorable. Clinical improvements observed at twelve months postoperatively were maintained at five years. There was no evidence of long-term complications, implant loosening or migration. Pain on VAS scale improved from 8.3 at baseline to 2.4 at five years.22 Additionally, please note that effective January 1, 2016 Medicaid reimburses for CPT 27279 in the following 35 states: AK, AL, AZ, CA, CT, FL, GA, HI, ID, IN, IA, KS, KY, LA, ME, MD, MA, MI, MN, MT, NE, NV, NH, NY, NC, ND, OH, SC, SD, UT, VA WV, WY, WI, and the District of Columbia. 3 Thank you for considering our request for a face-to-face meeting to present and discuss with you and your team the MIS technique for SI joint fusion, the clinical evidence, and relevant case studies. We will follow-up next week to confirm a date and time that will work for you.

When I began practice in 1981 , surgeons held the staunch opinion that the sacroiliac joints did not move nor were they a source of pain. Ten too fifteen years later spine surgeons agreed the sacroiliac joints acted as an important energy transfer mechanism from the legs to the spine by stretching and allowing small movements (joint play). Alternat ively the chiropractic and osteopathic professions had been aware of these small movements for many decades as well as the positive clinical outcomes of manipulating the hypomobile (loss of normal joint play) or fixated SI joint. In clinical practice many is the time that the sympt omatic or painful SI joint is actually hypermobile and compensating for the contralateral SI joint that had become hypomobile (fixated) commonly due to some traumatic event. Manipulating the hypomobile joint restoring normal joi nt play and performing adjunctive physiotherapies to the pa inful hypermobile joint resulting in excellent outcomes. The notion of fusing sacroiliac joints was first described in 1926 before the advent of instrumentation with the first surgical materials be ing ceramic blocks.1 A few years later rods and screws were utilized in an attempt to facilitate internal fixation popular momentarily in the late 1990's only to fall out of fashion as surgeons began to observe other problems and pains. It is well establ ished fusing any part of the spine results in other areas of the spine becoming overloaded in an attempt to compensate for the lack of motion caused by the fusion . The other non -fused areas then begin to degenerate (next level/adjacent level disease) inst igating more long term problems for the patient. Spinal fusion is known to result in adjacent level di sease elsewhere in the spine while at the same time lacking evidence of efficacy as a treatment for chronic low back pain.2345678 We are now le d to believe that fusion of the sacroiliac joints for chronic pain will fare better which appears not to be the case according to a study published last month.9 Germa ne to the concerns of biomechanical stressors elsewhere as a result of fusing one or both SI joints this study of 469 patients noted, \" The incidence of novel lumbar pathology in this population was 3.6% (n=17) at 90 days postoperatively and 5.3% (n=25) at 6 months .\" The investigators concluded ; \"The results of this study show that minimally invas ive SI joint fusion could possibly carry higher risks of complications than previously stated .\" Value -based Benefits Subcommittee August 11, 2016 RE: Sacroiliac Joint Fusion Page 2 To date there is but one small (148 subjects) randomized controlled trial c oncurrently comparing the outcomes after minimally invasive sacroiliac joint fusion and nonsurgical treatment of chronic lower back pain with the presumption that the pain is coming from sacroiliac joint dysfunction.10 This RCT by Polly et al, comparing th e outcomes of patients receiving either triangular titanium implants or nonsurgical treatment presented conspicuously superior outcomes in the implanted patients with sacroiliac joint dysfunction. The manufacturer of the triangular titanium implants (SI -BONE) sponsored the study with all of the authors having direct ties to this device manufacturer with two (Drs. D. Cher and K. Wine) being employees of the company . Concerns regarding this study ; 1. Lack of sufficient detail in NSM treatments: Although the authors indicated that anti - inflammatory and pain medications, intraarticular SIJ steroid injections, and physical therapy, and RFA of the sacral lateral nerve root branches were administered in a stepwise fashion and tailored to each patient's needs, ther e is no indication that these interventions were applied more than once for just immediate pain relief. It is misleading to indicate that surgery was superior to the NSM if the latter was given for a limited time rather than spread out over an extended pe riod or even given prophylactically. Additionally, the authors indicate that 87% of their patients received \"at least two\" interventions in addition to the injections, but these additional applications were never specified. 2. Though \"chiropractic\" (meaning a singular modality/intervention, e.g., manipulation?) is mentioned as a known nonsurgical treatment, the non -surgical management group in this study only received treatment from physical therapy . Furthermore, the specific treatment interventions utilize d by the physical therapists are not specified. 3. Sacroiliac joint dysfunction/hypomobility vs compensatory hypermobility of the contralateral SI joint is many times the symptomatic or painful joint area often with concomitant myofascial trigger points in t he gluteal musculature. There is no mention or apparent recognition of this form of SI joint dysfunction in this study nor the reality that manipulation of the hypomobile SI Joint and adjunctive physiotherapies to the contralateral painful hypermobile SI joint and soft tissues often resolve s this clinical entity. Alternatively, if a therapist focuses only on the painful hypermobile SI joint the typical mobilization techniques and rehabilitative exercises will a t best not resolve the problem and at worse e xacerbated the pain and dysfunction. 4. Adjacent level disease though the authors of this small RCT are quick to acknowledge lumbar fusion , especially at the lumbosacral level , can result in stressors and pathology to the sacroiliac joints due to the biomech anical changes they fail to consider the reverse can also occur. Fusing one or both SI joints will change the biomechanics in the low back resulting in \"novel lumbar pathology\" as the before mentioned stu dy published last month validated . Specifically fu sing one SI joint will cause the contralateral joint to become hypermobile in an attempt to Value -based Benefits Subcommittee August 11, 2016 RE: Sacroiliac Joint Fusion Page 3 5. compensate for the surgically fixated joint, very likely requiring that SI joint to be fused as well. Considering the lack of evidence supporting the efficacy of lumbar spinal fusion for the treatment of chronic low back pain coupled with the reality of adjacent level disease , it is unlikely fusing sacroiliac joints will fare any better. 6. Subjects with planned staged bilateral surgery there is a brief reference to individuals who apparently underwent bilateral fusion of their sacroiliac joints, \"most recent SIJ fusion to accommodate subjects with planned staged bilateral surgery. \" The assumption being that both sacroiliac joints fell within the criteria as needing to be fused is rather aggressive. Could any of these bilateral fusion candidates be due to the stressors placed on the contralateral joint following the first fusion? Bilateral fusion of the SI joints would likely have a profound biomechanical overloading effect on the lumbosacral regions and the question becomes , how will these patients fair 5 -10-15 years later? 7. Most common adverse events of the very chief complaints this surgery is designed to eliminate. 8. Intra -examiner reliability of the physical examination provocative tests are not very good and the sel ection of those who wer e surgical candidates was somewhat subjective. 9. Lack of sufficient sham procedure by the authors own admission, despite the fact that sham procedures are rarely conducted in surgical clinical trials , the fact remains that the surgica l patients experienced a multiplicity of stimuli other than the surgical implants themselves and most likely adhered to post -intervention regimens to achieve recovery more strictly than the NSM cohort (surgical patients towing the line, \"Hawthorne effect\" ). Meaning the effect could not have strictly been attributed to the titanium implants themselves. 10. Unbalanced crossover numbers a total of 35 patients were shown to cross over, but only 9 did not. There is no explanation as to why these numbers were so disparate and it is only by fortune of the large differences in outcomes between the two groups that the non -crossover cohort of just 9 patients was not underpowered. 11. Unbalanced age groups although so many characteristics of the two experimental groups we re generally matched at baseline, it appeared that a greater proportion (17.4%) of NSM patients compared to SIJ fusion patients (9.8%) were over 65 years of age. This could have presented a disproportionate impediment to improvement of those patients rece iving NSM. Value -based Benefits Subcommittee August 11, 2016 RE: Sacroiliac Joint Fusion Page 4 Studies that support minimally invasive sacroiliac joint fusion have been single -center, case -based, with the exception of the small manufacturer sponsored RCT whose issues I have reviewed above . The state of Oregon sho uld remain skeptical as per funding this surgical intervention for chronic low back pain until such time as higher quality evidence is available supporting efficacy, incidence and severity of adverse events , and cost vs. benefit.

The iFuse Implant System\u00ae from 51-BONE, Inc. {San Jose, CA) is the only Sl joint fusion product on the market that has a patented triangular-shape with a titanium plasma spray (TPS) coating designed to provide immediate fixation and minimize joint rotation. Your plan does not currently cover the procedure and I would like to meet with you and/or your policy staff to present and discuss the clinical evidence. iFuse is the only Sl joint fusion product with an FDA cleared indication citing clinical studies that demonstrate improved pain, patient function and quality of life at 12-months post-implantation. It is the only commercially available Sl joint fusion device in the US with published clinical evidence demonstrating safety, effectiveness and economic benefits. There are currently 36 peer-reviewed publications including Levell randomized controlled trial (RCT) papers1 -3 long-term, up to 4.5-and 5-year papers,10 '11 supporting the safety, effectiveness and economic benefits12-14 ofthe iFuse Implant System. I am writing to share the results of another long-term prospective study on iFuse that has been recently published and ask for exclusive coverage for the ifuse procedure based upon the scientific literature: SIFI: Prospective, Multicenter Trial SIFI is a prospective multicenter clinical trial conducted in the US {CiinicaiTrials.gov ID 172 patients with Sl joint dysfunction due to degenerative sacroiliitis or Sl joint disruption underwent MIS Sl joint fusion at 26 centers. 24-month results from SIFI have been published in the International Journal of Spine Surgery which is the official journal of the International Society for the Advancement of Spine Surgery (ISASS).9 2-year follow-up showed early and persistent improvement in Sl joint pain, disability (as measured by Oswestry Disability Index), and quality of life (measured with EQ-5D and SF-36). The rate of adverse events related to the procedure was low and surgical revisions were uncommon {4.7% by 2 years). Note: SIFI's target patient population and study eligibility criteria were identical to INSITE. INSITE (see below) compared SIJ fusion to non-surgical treatment and showed superiority in nearly every endpoint. Both SIFI and INSITE are prospective multicenter trials conducted in the US. SIFI results at 2 years serve as an excellent proxy for INSITE 2- year results (expected this summer).

First Coast Service Options {FSCO), the Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) for Florida, the only state that does not currently provide Medicare coverage, is currently reconsidering their coverage policy and we expect an update by the end of May. Commercial insurers are beginning to cover. Below are some of the prominent insurers covering: Geisinger Kaiser Permanente United Healthcare Blue Cross Blue Shield {BCBS) of Michigan recently established a positive coverage policy for MIS Sl joint fusion (see link below) The Sl joint is a well-recognized source of pain in patients who present with chronic LBP. Quality of life is markedly impaired in patients with Sl joint pain compared with age and gender matched cohorts, and the impairment is similar or worse than in many common disabling medical conditions such as cancer, COPD, and musculoskeletal conditions treated surgically {Cher 2014).16 In addition, patients with Sl joint dysfunction considering surgery have decrements in quality of life as or more severe than patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis, spinal stenosis and intervertebral disc herniation {Cher 2015).17 Furthermore, the costs associated with treating these patients is significant but two recently published studies showed that iFuse is highly cost-effective {Cher 2016)12 and to ignore the Sl joint in chronic low back pain can cost insurers an additional $3,100 per patient than if the Sl joint is considered as a potential pain source (Polly 2016).13 Finally, I want to thank you very much for taking the time to read this letter and I look forward to speaking with you soon to discuss the above information in greater detail.

Previous studies have found minimally invasive SI fusion to be an effective and safe treatment option for chronic SI joint pain. However, these studies have been primarily single-center, case-based, or manufacturer-sponsored investiga- tions, and as such their ndings are limited to their sample populations. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the safety of minimally invasive SI fusion using a large nationwide sample group to more accurately identify complication rates of this increasingly popular procedure. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: This is a retrospective database study. PATIENT SAMPLE: The sample includes patients within the orthopedic subset of Humana data- base who underwent minimally invasive SI fusion between 2007 and 2014. OUTCOME MEASURES: Complications and novel lumbar and nerve pathology were the outcome measures. METHODS: Patients undergoing minimally invasive SI fusion from 2007 to 2014 were identied using the Pearl Diver patient record database (Pearl Diver Technologies, West Conshohocken, PA, USA) from the nationwide private insurance provider Humana Inc. This approach provided access to records of over 18 million patients in every major geographic region of the country. Using the FDA device/drug status: Not applicable.

All rights reserved.The Spine Journal (2016)- REVIEW ARTICLE Sacroiliac joint fusion for low back pain: meta-analysis Kiran Received: Revised: 22 February 2016 / Accepted: 23 February 2016 / Published online: 8 March 2016 /C211Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2016 Abstract Background context Although pain is generally regarded as originating in the lumbar spine, it has been estimated that in 15-30 % of patients, LBP originates from the sacroiliac joint (SIJ). Purpose To determine whether sacroiliac joint fusion (SIJF) for LBP is effective in reducing pain when the SIJ is known to be the pain generator. Study design/setting Systematic review and meta- analysis. Methods A systematic literature review and meta-analy- sis was performed of observational studies describing outcome of SIJF in patients with LBP. Outcome measures were VAS pain, ODI, SF-36 PCS/MCS and Majeed score. The following databases were searched: PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Medline and Google scholar. The methodological quality of selected studies was assessed using the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute case series quality assessment tool. Meta-analysis was used to combine the studies for each outcome and forest plots were prepared. Outcomes were expressed as mean difference (MD). Results Six studies were included in the meta-analysis with a mean follow-up of 17.6 months. All outcomes showed statistical and clinical improvement (VAS pain MD: 54.8; 95 % CI 48.6, n=140; p\\0.001). Conclusions SIJF appears to be a satisfactory procedure for alleviating pelvic girdle pain. Keywords Sacroiliac joint /C1Fusion /C1Pelvic girdle pain /C1 back pain /C1Meta-analysis /C1Outcome Introduction Low back pain (LBP) is a major public health problem and the cause of much misery and disability. Although pain is generally regarded as originating in the lumbar spine, it has been estimated that in 15-30 % of patients LBP originates from the sacroiliac joint (SIJ) [ 1]. Pelvic girdle pain (PGP) is dened as pain experienced between the posterior iliac crest and gluteal fold [ 2]. Poor outcome after spinal fusion for LBP may be due to incorrect diagnosis of the spine as the pain source. Once non-operative treatments have been exhausted and the SIJ has been determined as the source of the PGP by physical exam and SIJ injection, and once the extra-articular ligaments and nerves have been excluded as the pain source, surgical intervention may be considered. Sacroiliac joint fusion (SIJF) can be performed using a variety of approaches and techniques, both open and minimally invasive. There have been a number of reports that have studied SIJF surgery outcome in patients with LBP. Schutz et al. [3] in a series of 17 patients found unfavourable out- come for bilateral SIJF using bone graft and internal xation. Eighty-two drkiran9999@yahoo.com 1Welsh Centre Trauma and Surgery, University Hospital of Wales, Heath Park, Cardiff CF14 4XN, Wales, UK 123Eur Spine J (2016) 25:1924-1931 DOI 10.1007/s00586-016-4490-8outcome at mean follow-up of 39 months. In contrast, other reports have contradicted these ndings showing a statistically and clinicall y signicant improvement. Kibsgard et al. [ 4] in a series of eight patients found the majority had good outcome at 12 months follow-up. Sachs et al. [ 5] in a series of 40 patients found all but one had a clinically and statistically signicantimprovement in outcome at 1 year. Similarly, a recent systematic review by Zaidi et al. [ 6] concluded that SIJF is benecial in a carefully selected subset of patients where the pain source has been accurately diagnosed as originating from the SIJ. Meta-analysis has become an accepted research methodology for quantitatively integrating the results of a collection of studies, some of which may be contradictory,in an unbiased way. Because there have been no meta- analyses of outcome of SIJF in patients with PGP, our aim was to determine whether SIJF, is on the whole, a satis-factory procedure for PGP when the pain source originates from the SIJ. Materials and methods A detailed protocol was prepared in accordance with theguidelines described in the Cochrane handbook for sys- tematic reviews of interventions [ 7]. The review team consisted of two spinal surgeons (KL, SA) and an epi- demiologist (RP). Study selection criteria Types of studiesProspective and retrospective observational studies of adults over 16 years suffering from LBP attributed to theSIJ. Types of interventionsAny type of SIJF. Both standard and minimally invasive surgery (MIS) procedures were included. Types of outcomes The primary outcome measure was pain. The secondary outcome measures were Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Majeed score [ 8] and SF-36 Physical (PCS) and Mental (MCS) component scores. Data on complications was also extracted. Exclusion criteria were general discussion papers not presenting original data, fusion for fracture and animal studies.Literature search Academic and grey literature was searched with no lan- guage restrictions. Electronic searches of on-line databases used the search terms listed below. Any articles that wereunsuitable were excluded in the early stages on the basis of their title and abstract whilst the decision to exclude or include articles was made from a review of the full paper.RefWorks 2.0 on-line reference management software [ 9] was used to store relevant papers as their titles and abstracts. The number of articles included and excludedwas noted in a flow chart (Fig. 1). In addition articles in-press and published ahead of print, where available on the internet, were searched for inthe following journals: Spine, The Spine Journal, European Spine Journal, The Bone and Joint Journal (Br & Am), Journal of Spinal Disorders and Techniques, Joint BoneSpine. These articles may not yet have been entered into the searchable databases. The following databases were searched: Embase 1974 to Medline 1946 to present 10/12/2014Web of Science to 10/12/2014 PubMed = 74 WOS = 58 Embase = 93 Medline = 49 Citations = 2 TOTAL = 276 After duplicates & irrelevant studies removed = 21 studies Title and abstract exported to Refworks Full text papers for review = 21 Studies excluded after full text review & data extraction = 15 Studies included in meta- analysis = 6 Fig. 1 Flowchart of the study selection processEur Spine J (2016) 25:1924-1931 1925 123PubMed to 10/12/2104 Cochrane Library to 10/12/2014Google 10/12/2014 Synonyms and boolean logic of search: sacroiliac joint AND (fusion OR arthrodesis) AND back pain. Manual searches of reference lists in relevant papers were also carried out to identify any additional studies missed during the electronic searches. Study selection Two authors (KL and RP) applied the search strategy independently and after removing irrelevant studies and duplicates there were 21 studies for possible inclusion. Because of the small number of studies, all were obtainedas full text versions and independently reviewed. The remit was to determine whether there was outcome data that could be extracted for SIJF for LBP. Three of the studieswere from the same authoring group describing their increasingly large cohort of patients. In this case only the most recent report was included. Finally six studies weredeemed eligible for inclusion (Fig. 1). Methodological quality assessmentThe National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NIH) quality assessment tool for case series studies [ 10] was used to assess the methodological quality of the selected studies (Table 1). This categorises studies as either good, fair orpoor. Identied studies were assessed by two reviewers (KL & RP) independently and any disagreement over scoring was resolved by consensus. Data extraction Data extraction forms were designed and for each outcome the following were extracted: study design, type of SIJF surgery and whether MIS or open, number of patients and mean and standard deviation (SD) for the outcomes. Two authors (KL, RP) extracted the data independently which was subsequently reviewed jointly to produce accuratedata. Statistical analysisMeta-analysis performed using RevMan review manager software [ 11] was used to combine the studies for each outcome to provide an overall estimate of the effect in the form of a forest plot. Missing SD's, needed for combining the outcomes, were calculated from the range of values(where given) using the formulae of Hozo [ 12] or from the condence interval (CI) [ 7]. Data were expressed as mean and SD and the treatment effect as mean difference andassociated CI. Where it was necessary to combine means and SD's in an individual study (as in the cases where data were given separately for open and MIS procedures to getan overall mean and SD), the formula of Headrick [ 13] was used.

An I2value C50 % was considered suggestive of statistical heterogeneity. Where heterogeneity was present, efforts were made toexplore possible causes such as patient selection, data outliers etc. for each included study. A ''leave-one-out'' sensitivity analysis was performed by iteratively removingone study at a time to conrm the source of the hetero- geneity. Analysis was then performed without the study to determine if heterogeneity was still present and if so, random effects modelling was used. Results Two hundred and seventy-six studies were identied usingthe search strategy. Duplicates and irrelevant studies amounted to 255 leaving 21 studies for detailed evaluation.All were case series. Thirteen were excluded after review leaving 8 papers for data extraction. Reasons for exclusion were no baseline data, only qualitative data on outcomeand studies that were from the same author describing cumulative patient data over time i.e. including previously reported historical data. Of the eight studies, two could notbe included due to missing SD's leaving six studies for the meta-analysis (Fig. 1). Included studies all had complete data in at least one of the outcomes (Table 3). The methodological quality as measured by the NIH quality assessment tool was high with all studies assessed as good (Table 1). Two were retrospective, utilising patient database/hospital registers to get their data and the remainder prospective (Table 2). Two of the studies were small with 17 patients or less. Participants were adults who underwent SIJF surgery with LBP attributed to the SIJ. A variety of surgical approaches were used (Table 2). Three of the studies used MIS techniques, another used both and the other two used open procedures. Table 3lists the outcomes reported in each study.In total 407 patients underwent SIJF with mean age of 53 years (range 30-89). There was a slight excess of females ( n=211, 52 %). All but ve patients had unilat- eral fusions. Meta-analysis VAS pain Pain intensity on a 0-100 scale was reported in four studies [14-17]. Follow-up ranged from 6-60 months. The meta- analysis for pain shows a statistically signicant improve-ment in pain after surgery using a xed effects model (weighted mean difference: 48.57; 95 % CI signicant heterogeneity (I 2=80 %), a sensitivity analysis was performed. All the studies apart from the Mason2013 [ 14] study used MIS procedures. Removing this study from the analysis reducedthe heterogeneity to 39 % using a xed effects model (weighted mean difference: 54.79; 95 % CI 48.56, 61.03; n=380; p\\0.001) (Fig. 2). ODI This was reported in three studies [ 14,16,18]. The study by Rudolf and Capobianco [ 16] only had follow-up data so could not be included in the meta-analysis. The follow-upranged from 6-17 months. The xed effects forest plot (Fig. 3) shows a signicant improvement in ODI after surgery (weighted mean difference: 14.53; 95 % CI8.42-20.64; n=102; PCSThree studies 14,15,18] reported this outcome.

A random effects model was used because of the signicant heterogeneity ( I 2=88 %). Both studies used open procedures and there was no apparent cause for the high heterogeneity. Complications were reported in all six studies [ 14-19]. Sixteen patients out of 307 experienced complications (5.21 %) These were due to implant misplacement, implantfailure, PE, infection, hematoma and neuralgia. Discussion In contrast to the lumbar spine, the SIJ is not widelyrecognised as a pain generator for LBP. Pain can originate from a number of areas both spinal and non-spinal. Spinal generators include nerves, discs, facet joints, muscles andligaments. Non-spinal sources include the SIJ and hip. Failure to alleviate pain after surgical treatment of the spine may be due to incorrect identication of the painsource. In common with the intervertebral disc as a source of pain, pathology in the SIJ does not necessarily correlatewith symptoms making radiological diagnosis difcult.Physical tests have been shown to have poor sensitivity and specicity [ 20,21]. The best available reference standard for diagnosing the SIJ as a pain source is intra-articularsteroid injection under fluoroscopic guidance although there is some doubt about its diagnostic validity [ 20,21]. More recently, single-photon emission computed tomog-raphy (SPECT/CT) has been used to diagnose SIJ dys- function [ 22]. Results from SPECT/CT have been shown to correlate well with those from intra-articular steroidinjections. Therefore, SPECT/CT could be useful as a supplementary diagnostic procedure to intra-articular ster- oid injections. Sembrano and Polly Jr. [ 23] found, in a series of 200 patients with LBP, that using diagnostic injections, the pain source originated in the SIJ in 15 % of patients. In twoother studies, Schwarzer et al. [ 1] reported the SIJ as the source of pain in 30 % of LBP patients and Maigne et al. [24]i n1 9% . Conservative therapies for SIJ pain include medication, physiotherapy and external orthotics such as pelvic belts.Intra-articular steroid injection has been shown to give short term pain relief and additionally, pain relief conrms the SIJ as the pain generator. Failure of pain relief usingconservative therapies may require SIJF. A variety of techniques and approaches have been described both open and MIS. Schutz et al. [ 3] found almost universal poor outcome in a series of 17 patients who underwent open bilateral fusion for PGP, with 82 % of patients reportingStudy or Subgroup Total (95% CI) 0.22); I\u00b2 = 34% Test for overall effect: Z = < 28.49 28.4926.59SD CI -20-10 01020 Favours effect Favours no effect Fig. 4 Forest plot of SF36 PCS Study or Subgroup Duhon2013 Khurana2009Mason2013 Total (95% CI) 0.44); = 0% Test for overall effect: Z = = IV, Fixed, 95% CI -20 -10 010 20 Favours effect Favours no effect Fig. 5 Forest plot of SF36 MCSEur Spine J (2016) 25:1924-1931 1929 123unsatisfactory pain relief as measured by VAS. This poor outcome was accounted for by the novel surgical proce-dure used which resulted in poor quality fusion with 42 % achieving no fusion at all. The technique used internal xation and decortication of the SIJ with local bonegrafting. This study was not included in the meta-analysis because of the poor fusion rate with only 35 % showing a denite fusion. Wise et al. [ 25] in a series of 13 patients, using a MIS posterior approach with percutaneously inserted fusioncages and morphogenic protein, found signicant pain reduction as measured on a VAS and 89 % fusion rate. Patient satisfaction with the procedure was high with 77 %of patients satised with the result. This study was not included in the analysis because only VAS improvement scores were given\u2014there was no baseline and follow-updata. Similarly Slinkard et al. [ 26] found signicant improvement in functional ability (ODI) using an opentechnique in a series of 19 patients. Furthermore they found those patients who had previous spinal fusion surgery showed less improvement than those that did not. Theyused an anterior ilioinguinal approach with autograft and plates across the SIJ. This study was also excluded from the analysis as only improvement scores were given. Kibsgard et al. [ 4] in a case series of eight patients at 12 months follow-up found satisfactory pain reduction (VAS), decrease in disability as measured by the ODI andimprovement in health related quality of life (SF-36), after fusion using an open anterior approach with autologous bone and plates, in 78 % of patients. Unfortunately theydid nd three major and three minor complications in six of the eight patients operated on. This study was not included in the meta-analysis due to missing SD's. In another study by Kibsgard et al. [ 27], 50 patients who underwent SIJ fusion for PGP were followed-up at 1 and 23 years after surgery. Those patients (48 %) with suc-cessful 1 year outcomes had retained their decrease in pain and disability as measured by VAS and ODI, respectively. This study was not included in the meta-analysis due tomissing baseline data.Cummings Jr.et al. [ 28] in a study of 18 patients using a MIS technique, found favourable outcome for pain (VAS)and functional ability (ODI) with only one complication due to implant malposition. Patent satisfaction with the procedure was 95 %. They used a posterior approach andtubular implants without bone. This study was excluded from the meta-analysis because it included data that was subsequently included in another report from this centre [5]. In this meta-analysis of the six studies that included usable data, which excluded the foregoing studies, three reported results using MIS, two used open methods, and one study used both. The analysis has found that patientsundergoing SIJF for PGP had a statistically and clinically signicant improvement in pain relief, ODI, SF-36 and Majeed score. The minimally clinically important differ-ence (MCID) for VAS back pain is around 20 points [ 29, 30]. The meta-analysis shows a mean improvement of 55 points. Similarly, MCID for ODI is considered to be 10points [ 31]. The meta-analysis for SIJF was 14.5 points. For SF-36 PCS, 5 points is considered to be a MCID [ 32]. The analysis gave 19.5 points. SF-36 MCS summary scorewas 8.5 which is within the range of the MCID of 7.0-15.9 [31]. There have been no studies on what is the MCID for the Majeed score but it showed an improvement of 36points. Both studies included in the meta-analysis for the Majeed score showed a mean improvement from poor (37 and 36.2, respectively) to good (64.8) [ 18] and excellent (79) [ 15]. Complications due to the surgery were low and occurred in 16 patients out of 307 (5.2 %). For the open surgery therate was 5.44 and 3.49 % for the MIS methods. The strength of our meta-analysis is that it is the rst to consider outcomes for SIJF for PGP and has been carriedout according to Cochrane guidelines. In addition, the follow-up periods for the included studies varied from 6 to 60 months with the majority over 13 months. Our meta-analysis has some limitations. It pools the results of observational studies but these were the only studies available on the topic. All the included studies werecase series. Furthermore, the number of studies availableStudy or 1 = 0.004); I\u00b2 = 88% Test for overall effect: Z = 5.28 (P < 0.00001)Mean 37 36.2SD 9 15.1Total 15 55 Random, 95% CI -100 -50 0 50 100 Favours effect Favours no effect Fig. 6 Forest plot of Majeed score1930 Eur Spine J (2016) 25:1924-1931 123for meta-analysis was only six. The ODI and Majeed scores only pooled the results of two studies. Although this meta-analysis has shown functional and pain outcomes to be statistically and clinically signicant,the conclusion is based upon very limited data and there- fore its validity may be low. Providing the SIJ is unequivocally identied as the source of pain by means ofprovocative SIJ injections, SIJF appears to be a satisfactory procedure for alleviating PGP. Further high quality studies are needed to verify this nding. Compliance with ethical standards Conflict of interest None. References 1.

According to the National Health Interview Survey conducted in 2002, 26.4% of the 31,044 respondents reported that they had had severe low-back pain some time during the previ- ous 3 months.8 Extrapolating from those data to the current population aged 18 years or older in the United States, al- most 74 million individuals are estimated to have suffered from low-back pain within the last 3 months (http://www.census.gov/popclock/), and 2.3% of all physician visits per year are estimated to be for low-back pain.8 The etiology of this pain varies greatly, ranging from primary nerve pain to degenerated discs, tumors, fractures, or any other com- pressive mechanism, to muscular and ligamentous origin. Recently, the medical field has experienced a resurgence in recognition of the sacroiliac joint (SIJ) as the derivation of a large number of cases of low-back pain.

Zaidi, md ,1 andrew J. m dickman J Neurosurg Spine Volume 23July2015 60interest to orthopedic surgeons and neurosurgeons alike. There is a strong consensus that 15% to 30% of low-back pain cases can be attributed to the SIJ. 3,6,22,23 Even with this high prevalence, the diagnosis and treatment for SIJ pain remains a topic of disagreement, and critics argue against the efficacy of SIJ fusion as definitive treatment for in-dividuals experiencing SIJ pain. Even so, SIJ fusion has been steadily gaining popularity among many orthopedic surgeons and neurosurgeons. We sought to perform an evidence-based systematic analysis of the published lit-erature regarding the indications, clinical outcomes, and fusion rates associated with SIJ fixation to help guide fu-ture clinical practice. methods An extensive literature search was performed using MEDLINE, Google Scholar, and OvidSP-Wolters Kluwer Health search engines. All articles containing the key - words \"sacroiliac fusion,\" \"minimally \"sacroiliac fixation\" published from January 2000 to May 2014 were reviewed by 2 independent investigators. Original, peer-reviewed, prospective or retrospective scientific papers including at least 2 cases were included in the study. Ex - clusion criteria included inadequate clinical data as deter - mined by 2 independent reviewers, nonsurgical treatment, non-English manuscripts, and nonhuman subjects. If a publication by a single institution or author clearly reported on the same cohort of patients as another publication, only the most recently published article with the largest sample size was included for final analysis. Two investigators in - dependently reviewed each article, and data were extracted for the following variables: study design, total number of patients, surgical indications and pathological findings, previous surgical intervention, fusion rates, complication rates, perioperative morbidity, patient satisfaction rates and type of outcome assessment tools used, surgical procedure performed (open vs minimally invasive), inclusion criteria for surgery, and method of diagnosis of SIJ-generated pain. A total of 217 articles were identified from the online database searches. After filtering reports that only con - tained human subjects, English-language publications, and published date from January 2000 to May 2014, a total of 108 unique articles were available for review. Of these 108 studies, 92 were eliminated for the following reasons: repeated studies (n = 4), nonoperative/diagnostic studies (n = 20), not relevant to SIJ fusion (n = 42), technique/individual case reports (n = 11), anatomical studies (n = 8), insufficient data (n = 3), and reviews/meta-analysis (n = 4) (Fig. 1). A total of 16 peer-reviewed journal articles were found: 5 consecutive case series, 8 retrospective studies, and 3 prospective cohort studies. Seven of the studies re - Fig. 1.Systematicreviewflowdiagram.efficacy of sacroiliac fusion J Neurosurg Spine Volume 23July2015 61viewed an open technique for SIJ fusion,2,4,5,10,12,14,21 8 re - viewed a minimally invasive approach,1,7,9,13,18-20,25 and 1 study compared the 2 different techniques.15 results The total number of patients included in this review was 430; 131 underwent an open technique for SIJ fusion (Table 1) and 299 underwent minimally invasive surgery (MIS) (Table 2). The average duration of follow-up was 60 months for open surgery (range 6-408 months) and 21 months for MIS (range 6-70 months). The pathological finding most commonly described in the overall patient population included in this review was SIJ degeneration or arthrosis (257 patients [59.8%]), followed by SIJ dysfunc- tion (79 [18.4%]), postpartum instability (31 [7.2%]), post - traumatic injury (28 [6.5%]), and idiopathic disease (25 [5.8%]) (Table 3). Of the studies reviewed, 12 of 16 speci - fied whether previous back surgery occurred. Reviewing these 12 studies, 201 patients (63.4%) had some form of low-back surgery before undergoing the reported SIJ fu - sion (Table 4). For the open surgery technique, fusion confirmation was determined by CT scan, and success rates ranged from 20% to 90%. Clinical and patient satisfaction was based on several subjective patient assessment tools. Ex - cellent satisfaction, determined by pain reduction, func- tion, and quality of life, ranged from 18% to 100%, with a mean of 54%. Poor satisfaction rates (e.g., patient stating he/she would rather have not had the surgery) ranged from 0% to 47%, with a mean of 32% of patients classified as dissatisfied with the surgical outcome (Table 5). For pa - tients undergoing MIS, fusion was determined in 4 of 9 studies by either CT or plain radiograph, and confirmation rates ranged from 13% to 100%. Clinical and patient sat - isfaction scores were determined by subjective question - naires and pain improvement. Excellent outcome, judged by a patient's stated satisfaction with the surgery, ranged from 56% to 100%, with a mean of 84% (Table 6). The reoperation rate for patients undergoing open sur - gery ranged from 0% to 65%, with a mean of 15%. The major complications after open surgery were painful hardware leading to removal, deep wound or pin infec-tions, and nerve root irritation (Table 7). Other complica - tions encountered were localized muscle herniation at site, peroneal nerve entrapment, neurolysis, iliac crest fracture, and pulmonary emboli. The reoperation rate for patients undergoing MIS ranged from 0% to 17%, with a mean of 6%. Major dickman J Neurosurg Spine Volume 23July2015 62plications encountered after MIS were new-onset facet joint pain, trochanteric bursitis, deep wound infections, new onset of low-back or leg pain, and superficial cellulitis (Table 8). Other complications encountered were radicu - lopathy, vascular necrosis of the hip, piriformis syndrome, implant penetration into the sacral neural foreman, pe - ripheral neuropathy, pulmo - nary emboli/deep vein thrombosis. One study reported the adverse event rate at 56%. discussion The recognition of SIJ pain as the origin of persistent, debilitating, low-back pain is making a resurgence; simi - larly so is surgical intervention, fusing the SIJ by either open or minimally invasive means. Literature is scarce when it comes to describing the efficacy of surgical in - tervention,22 and the general consensus is to refrain from surgery until all nonoperative treatment modalities have been exhausted. 1,2,5,12,14,15,19,22,25 Conservative methods for managing SIJ pain include trials of physical therapy, fo - cusing on core and pelvic stability, external orthotics, pain management, periodic intra-articular injections, anti-in - flammatory medications, and life style changes including smoking cessation and weight loss. 9,22 Whether efficacy is determined by objective measures, CT-confirmed fu - sion, or subjective methods, patients' levels of satisfaction with the results of fusion procedures are inconsistent. In this literature analysis, confirmed fusion rates, patient sat - isfaction, and reoperation rates varied greatly. A major - ity of the patient population had a history of a previous low-back surgery before SIJ fusion, with many undergo - ing concomitant surgery or additional back surgery dur - ing their follow-up period. 18,20 This raises the question of where the true pain generator lies. Ultimately the goal for future practice is to develop screening techniques that can accurately diagnosis whether the SIJ is the pain generator, as a filter to selecting appropriate treatment for patients. The first step to successful clinical outcomes is obtain - ing an accurate diagnosis. While historically the diagnosis of SIJ pain has been difficult to make, all but one of the taBle 2. m inimally invasive Volume 23July2015 63studies (94%) in this review used patient relief from pain after intra-articular joint anesthetic or steroid injection as the ultimate factor for inclusion in an SIJ fusion protocol (Tables 1 and 2). Most screenings were completed under fluoroscopic guidance to ensure accurate placement of the injection. A positive result was pain reduction by 50% to 100%, depending on the specific study, after the injec-tion. 1,2,4,5,7,9,10,12,13,15,19-21,25 Cohen described the various modalities used for di - agnosing SIJ pain\u2014physical examination, radiological studies, pain referral patterns, and diagnostic blocks\u2014in a comprehensive review and came to the conclusion that there is no single universally accepted diagnostic meth - od.6 Factors that can affect the sensitivity and specific- ity of diagnostic blocks include a placebo effect, referred pain, central sensitization, expectation bias, symptomatic blockade, systemic absorption, and psychosocial issues.6 Although the studies analyzed here suggest a positive re - sponse to SIJ block as the final diagnostic inclusion crite - rion, along with physical examination or radiological stud - ies, there is a drastic lack of literature evidence to support such a conclusion in the literature.24 SIJ injection is considered the best test currently avail - able for diagnosing SIJ as the cause of low-back pain, so it is the adopted gold standard; however, there is still consid - erable error in relying on this method alone. To improve diagnostic precision, some authors advocate the use of the double-block standard.21 This method repeats the positive block with a different substance to improve sensitivity of the test. In summary, however, the use of physical exami - nation, radiological studies, or diagnostic blocks cannot diagnose the SIJ as the origin of pain with a reasonably accepted sensitivity or specificity. With questionable diagnostic precision and the high rate of previous low-back surgeries, concomitant surger - ies, and eventual future surgeries among patients undergo - ing SIJ fusion, one must seriously consider whether the SIJ is the actual pain generator for many patients. Prior his - tory of back surgery reached nearly 60% among patients undergoing SIJ fusion in the 16 publications included here 2,5,7,9,10,15,18-21,25 along with 6 reported cases of concomi - tant low-back surgeries.18,20 A few studies demonstrated the possible phenomenon of non-SIJ causes of pain, with relatively high fusion rates (85%-90%) but comparatively poor patient-rated success (48%-60%). 5,14 The SIJ is a complex joint that transmits force from the spine down to the pelvis and lower extremities as well as from the pelvis and lower extremities up to the spine,11 closely associating the SIJ with the lumbar spine superi - orly and the knee joint inferiorly. This relationship is con - firmed with the well-accepted association of SIJ pain after lumbar spine fusion. Maigne and Planchon demonstrated that 35% of pain after lumbar fusion could be attributed to the SIJ, 17 while Liliang et al. confirmed the SIJ as the origin of pain after lumbar fusion in 40% of their popula - tion.16 One of the most commonly stated etiologies for SIJ pain is sacroiliac joint dysfunction, which is defined by pain without a demonstrable lesion.4 There is a presumed mechanical disorder, but taking into account the lack of certainty in diagnostic methods and complexity of the hip and SIJ, an alternative origin of the discomfort is a very reasonable consideration. The pain and discomfort experi - enced by the cohort described in this manuscript is likely a combination of various pathologies, specifically with lumbar, hip, and lower-extremity etiologies. There is no universally accepted method for surgical intervention in the treatment of SIJ pain or instability. Many open methods have been described through short case series, and the new approaches to MIS have made a recent splash in the literature. The Smith-Petersen tech - nique uses an iliac autograft fixated within the SIJ with atlanto-occipital screws. 4,19 Other techniques described in our literature search are a midline posterior approach us -TABLE 4. Patients with history of J Neurosurg Spine Volume autograft, Cloward instrumen tation;2,4,10,12,14 an anterior approach with 3-hole plate and autograft;15 and a bilateral Buttress with autograft21 (Table 1). The MIS procedures included use of hollow modular anchorage screws, autograft, and bone morphogenetic pro - tein (BMP),1,13 longitudinally threaded cages with BMP ,25 multiple long screws crossing both SIJs engaging the iliac bones, 18 and the iFuse Implant System (SI-BONE)7,9,15,19,20 (Table 2).

Five of the studies analyzed here used this approach and reported moderately successful outcomes. However, 80% of the studies did not include image-confirmed ana - tomical fusion as part of the outcome assessment. Other is - sues include short follow-up periods ranging from 6 to 40 months, and several potential conflicts of interest.7,9,15,19,20 Longer follow-up, third-party investigation, and random - ized control studies are needed to assess the true efficacy for this up-and-coming intervention. A true arthrodesis requires apposition of 2 bone sur - faces, allowing for approximation without compromising the stability of the joint. 24 The anatomical position of the SIJ and complex innervation make a routine joint fusion more difficult to accomplish. 22,24 This has resulted in high rates of nonunion or questionable fusion and elevates the complication risk in both open and minimally invasive ap - proaches. Duhon et al. described an adverse event rate of 56% in his safety cohort, 53 events occurring in 94 pa - tients. 9There are many reported cases of successful SIJ ar - throdesis that greatly improve the quality of life for the individuals and eliminate their daily pain.1,2,4,5,7,9,10,12-15,18- 21,25 Certain etiologies\u2014for example, acute traumatic insta - bility\u2014require immediate surgical intervention and have good reported outcomes; however, the majority of patients undergoing surgery are classified as having SIJ degenera - tion or dysfunction, and the consensus on efficacy of fu - sion is not as clear for these patients. To limit the amount of nonunion, unsatisfactory results, reoperations, and need for additional back surgery, a strict guideline for SIJ fu - sion needs to be developed and implemented. Kibsg\u00e5rd et al. compared the long-term results (mean follow-up 279 months) in 50 patients undergoing surgical intervention for their SIJ dysfunction with the follow-up of 28 patients whose cases were only managed conservatively. His re - view demonstrated that the surgical group did not differ from the conservative management group with respect to outcome at long-term follow-up. 14 This finding reiterates the fact that surgical intervention for SIJ pathologies may not be beneficial for everyone. Accurate diagnosis, superior surgical skills, and the right patient population can make SIJ arthrodesis a worthwhile and life-changing procedure; however, these factors are not thoroughly demonstrated in much of the population undergoing the surgery today. conclusions Surgical intervention for SIJ pain is beneficial in a subset of patients. However, with the difficulty in accu - rate diagnosis and lack of evidence for the efficacy of the procedure itself, serious consideration of the cause of pain and treatment alternatives should be made before perform - ing SIJ fusion. Based on our comprehensive review of the literature, prospective, randomized studies with a focus on long-term pain control and fusion rates after SIJ fusion are lacking in the neurosurgical and orthopedic literature. Further, well-designed studies are necessary to better un - derstand the surgical and clinical efficacy of SIJ fusion. references 1.

Multisector Interventions To reduce the use of tobacco during pregnancy and improve associated outcomes , the e vidence supports the following interventions : Financial incentives (contingent most effective) Smoke -free legislation Tobacco excise taxes No or insufficient evidence is available for: Internet or text messaging based interventions Mass media campaigns specific to pregnant women 2 Tobacco Cessation During Pregnancy For VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 RATIONALE FOR DEVELOP MENT OF COVERAGE GUI DANCES AND MULTISECTOR INTERVEN TION REPORTS Coverage guidances are developed to inform coverage recommendations for public and private health plans in Oregon as they seek to improve patient experience of care, population health and the cost - effectiveness of health care. In the era of the Affordable Care Act and health system transformation, reaching these goals may require a focus on population -based health interventions from a variety of sectors as well as individually -focused clinical care. Multisector intervention reports will be developed to addr ess these population -based health interventions or other types of interventions that happen outside of the typical clinical setting. HERC selects topics for its reports to guide public and private payers based on the following principles: Represents a sign ificant burden of disease or health problem Represents important uncertainty with regard to effectiveness or harms Represents important variation or controversy in implementation or practice Represents high costs or significant economic impact Topic is of high public interest Our reports are based on a review of the relevant research applicable to the intervention(s) in question. For coverage guidances, which focus on clinical interventions and modes of care, evidence is evaluated using an adaptation of th e GRADE methodology. For more information on coverage guidance methodology, see Appendix A. Multisector interventions can be effective ways to prevent, treat or manage disease at a population level. For some conditions, the HERC has reviewed evidence and i dentified effective interventions, but has not made coverage recommendations, as many of these policies are implemented in settings beyond traditional healthcare delivery systems. 3 Tobacco Cessation During Pregnancy For VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 GRADE -INFORMED FRAMEWORK The HERC develops recommendations by using the concepts of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluat ion (GRADE) system. GRADE is a transparent and structured process for developing and presenting evidence and for carrying out the s teps involved in developing recommendations. There are several elements that determine the strength of a recommendation, as listed in the table below. The HERC reviews the evidence and makes an assessment of each element, which in turn is used to develop t he recommendations presented in the coverage guidance box. Estimates of effect are derived from the evidence presented in this document. The level of confidence in the estimate is determined by the Commission based on assessment of two independent reviewer s from the Center for Evidence -based Policy . Unless otherwise noted, estimated resource allocation, values and preferences, and other considerations are assessments of the Commission.

Pregnancy can be a motivating time for many women who wish to quit using cigarettes. However, pregnant women may be concern ed about the use of medications which have not been proven safe, or effective during pregnancy. There is likely significant variability in The only pharmacotherapies for which studies were found were nicotine replacement therapies. Bupropion is considered relatively low risk in pregnancy (pregnancy class B ), varenicline has some potential level of risk and it is 4 Tobacco Cessation During Pregnancy For VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 Coverage question: Should pharmacotherapy or electronic nicotine deliver y systems be recommended for coverage for tobacco cessation in pregnancy ?

Looking at all randomized trials of NRT (including those without a placebo control arm), there appears to be a benefit of NRT for tobacco abstinence during pregnancy. Inadequate evidence is available to address the relative benefits and harms of other type s of pharmacotherapy, or electronic cigarettes. Rationale: Pharmacotherap y with NRT appears to be ineffective at reducing maternal and fetal harms . Nicotine replacement therapy may improve tobacco abstinence during pregnancy, however, this does not appear to translate to improved health outcomes. In comparison, with behavioral interventions, there is an improvement in abstinence and an improvement in preterm birth and low birth weig ht. Given a lack of proven benefit, an effective alternative (behavioral counseling), a possibility of harm, associated costs, and mixed values and preferences, a recommendation against coverage would be considered. Federal law requires some payers (including Medicaid) to cover pharmacot herapy for pregnant women who smoke tobacco. 6 Tobacco Cessation During Pregnancy For VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 Coverage question: Should pharmacotherapy or electronic nicotine deliver y systems be recommended for coverage for tobacco cessation in pregnancy ? Outcomes Estimate of Effect for Outcome/ Confidence in Estimate Resource allocation Values and Preferences Other considerations There are no studies on electronic nicotine delivery systems in pregnant women.

Electronic nicotine delivery systems are not recommended for coverage (strong recommendation). Note: GRADE framework elements are described in Appendix A. A GRADE Evidence Profile is provided in Appendix B. Coverage question: Should behavioral interventions be recommended for coverage for tobacco cessation in pregnancy ?

The benefits of decreased low birth weight and preterm labor could result in substantially lower costs. Many women who are motivated to quit smoking during pregnancy would likely be interested in behavioral interventions to quit smoking. There may be some groups of women or some particular types of behavioral intervention s that drive women to smoke more, and Behavioral interventions can encompass a wide range of types and intensity of interventions. The 5As approach is widely endorsed.

Outcomes Estimate of Effect for Outcome/ Confidence in Estimate Resource allocation Values and Preferences Other considerations (Moderate confidence , based on 2 RCTs, N=934) Balance of benefits and harms: Evidence demonstrates that behavioral interventions are effective for reducing preterm labor and low birth weight and also in improving tobacco cessation during , and for a short time after , pregnancy. There was no definite evidence of harms related to behavioral interve ntions reported in the trials, though a possible paradoxical effect of increased smoking resulting from resistance to anti - smoking messages was observed in 4 trials. Rationale: There is moderate confidence that behavioral interventions increase tobacco abstinence during pregnancy and up to 17 months postpartum. The benefit does not persist beyond 18 months. Behavioral interventions are effective at reducing the incidence o f low birth weight and preterm birth. A potential harm is a paradoxical increase in smoking that occurred in four of the seventy studies, but otherwise the intervention carries little risk. The strength of the recommendation is based on evidence demonstrating the significant impac t on morbidity, few harms, moderate cost, and some pregnant women who would have a strong interest in the intervention. Recommendation : Behavioral interventions are recommended for coverage (strong recommendation). 10 Tobacco Cessation During Pregnancy For VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 Coverage question: Should ultrasound with high feedback be recommended for coverage for tobacco cessation in pregnancy ? Outcomes Estimate of Effect for Outcome/ Confidence in Estimate Resource allocation Values and Preferences Other considerations Pregnancy complications (Critical outcome) No data This would involve an increase in reimbursement for additional physician counseling during a prenatal ultrasound and would likely have minimal to modest costs associated with it. Many women would want to have additional detailed information provid ed by physicia ns at the time of an ultrasound , however, the clinical significance of variable findings may be difficult to interpret . However, if specific harms to their fetus about the impact of tobacco were shown to the pregnant woman it is possible this could create psychological distress. Low birth weight (Critical outcome) No data Perinatal/infant death (Critical outcome ) No data Tobacco abstinence during pregnancy (Important outcome) Absolute rate (of cessation): 28.4% in ultrasound with high feedback group vs . 8.1% in controls group ARD 20.3 % (95% CI 2% to 55%) NNT=5 : For 1000 patients treated, 20 0 will be tobacco abstinent during pregnancy RR 2.93 (95% CI 1.25 to 6.86) (Low confidence , based on 1 RCT, N= 129) Tobacco abstinence after pregnancy (Important outcome) No data Balance of benefit s and harm s: The evidence suggests there is a benefit to high feedback ultrasound for tobacco abstinence during pregnancy , but other pregnancy related outcomes have not been studied . The potential harms of this intervention are not well established by this single trial, but since the ultrasound is being performed regardless of the level of feedback, any harms would have to be attributab le to the enhanced feedback itself. 11 Tobacco Cessation During Pregnancy For VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 Coverage question: Should ultrasound with high feedback be recommended for coverage for tobacco cessation in pregnancy ? Outcomes Estimate of Effect for Outcome/ Confidence in Estimate Resource allocation Values and Preferences Other considerations Rationale: There is no evidence available on any of the critical outcomes and on only one of the important outcomes. While the increase in absolute rate of cessation was noteworthy (and higher than any other intervention), it is a single, small RCT with a moderate risk of bias and there is low certainty of the benefit. Additionally, this study was published in 1982 and apparently has not been replicated (or published) which may undermine ou r confidence in these findings. However, the cost of this may be quite modest. A recommendation for coverage is made at this time; it is a weak recommendation because there is potential for this to change, particularly if additional studies conf irm the large increase in tobacco abstinence and if associated health benefits or if harm s to the mother were demonstrated. Recommendation : Ultrasound with high feedback is recommended for coverage ( weak recommendation ). Coverage question: Should financial incentives be recommended for coverage for tobacco cessation in pregnancy ? Outcomes Estimate of Effect for Outcome/ Confidence in Estimate Resource allocation Values and Preferences Other considerations Pregnancy complications (Critical outcome) No data There is a direct, somewhat predictable financial expenditure for the financial incentives. The amounts of incentives used in studies were modest in nature. Performing a contingent model of incentives would lower the overall costs based on individual efficacy (a woman would stop Financial incentives may be quite appealing to many women.

The potential harms of financial incentives have not been well describ ed, but there is the possibility that participants could manipulate the system to earn unmerited financial rewards . Rationale: The evidence supports financial incentives to improv e tobacco abstinence during and after pregnancy. The costs of this are relatively modest, and many women would be interested in participating in this model if motivated to quit for additional financial gain. Contingent financial incentives appear to be the most effective. Therefore, this is recommended for coverage. It is a weak recommendation because of the lack of evidence on critical outcomes. Recommendation : Financial incentives (especially those contingent on demonstrated tobacco abstinence) are recomm ended for coverage (weak recommendation ). As financial incentives are provided in clinical settings, but not typically billed as clinical services, this recommendation is listed both in the Coverage Guidance box and in the multisector recommendations box. 13 Tobacco Cessation During Pregnancy For VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 Coverage question: Should partner support be recommended for coverage for tobacco cessation in pregnancy ?

There is insufficient information on the harms of interventions to reduce secondhand smoke exposure. Rationale: Clinical interventions to reduce secondhand smoke exposure have very limited quality evidence showing inconclusive results. Therefore, these interventions are not recommended for coverage. The recommendation is weak because additional research may s how a benefit.

Oftentimes, tobacco tax revenue is used to help fund addicti on and other health services. Tobacco taxes would reduce tobacco -related healthcare costs to the extent they reduce tobacco use . Tobacco taxes are common in the United States at the state level, though increases in tobacco taxes face opposition from businesses that generate revenue from tobacco sales . Nonsmokers are generally more in favor of tobacco control policies than smokers. Some argue that tobacco taxes are regressive because low-income and less well-educated populations have higher rates of smoking. Counter arguments are that low-income populations show greater decreases in tobacco use after tax increases, and new tobacco tax revenues can be used to fund tobacco control programs and other health and social services.

While this rate represents a substantial improvement over prior decades, smoking during pregnancy remains a major public health problem. Smoking during pregnancy is more common among women aged 20 -24 (13%), unmarried women (1 5%), American Indians or Alaska Natives (18%), Women Infants and Children nutrition assistance recipients (1 3%), and Medicaid beneficiaries (14%). There is also significant geographic variation in the rate of smoking during pregnancy, ranging from 1.8% in California to 27.1% in West Virginia. In Oregon, the rate of smoking during pregnancy is slightly higher than the overall national average at 10.3%. Among women who smoke in the first or second trimes ter, only 1 in 5 will successfully quit smoking by the third trimester. Indications In addition to the well -established risks of smoking for individual health, smoking in pregnancy entails risks to the fetus, including miscarriage and stillbirth, preterm birth, growth restriction, placental abnormalities and abruption, and premature rupture of membranes (Siu, 2015; American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG , 2010). Smoking in the postpartum period is associated with a heightened risk of sud den infant death syndrome and childhood respiratory illnesses (ACOG, 2010). Older data from 2006 suggests that the costs of smoking during pregnancy are substantial and that interventions to promote smoking cessation during pregnancy may be not only cost -effective but cost - saving (ACOG, 2010). Exposure to secondhand smoke also increases health risks for individuals and can impact pregnancy outcomes. For example, maternal exposure to secondhand smoke increases the risk of having a low birth weight baby and exposure to secondhand smoke increases the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (U.S. Department of Health and Huma n Services, 2006) . Technology description Clinical services to aid in tobacco cessation include pharmacological treatments and behavioral interventions. Nicotine (pregnancy category D) is the addictive drug found in tobacco, and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) can be used to reduce cravings during a quit attempt. NRT is available as transdermal patches, gum, lozenges, sprays, and inhalers. V arenicline (pregnancy category C) is a partial agonist to nicotinic receptors, and it reduces cravings and decreases the pleasurable effects of nicotine. Anti-depressants, such as bupropion (pregnancy category B) and nortriptyline (pregnancy category D) are also used to aid in tobacco cessation. 19 Tobacco Cessation During Pregnancy For VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 Behavioral interventions to aid tobacco cessation can be delivered using a variety of methods and in a variety of settings, as summarized by Patnode and colleagues (2015): Specific behavioral interventions include, but are not limited to: self -help materials (e.g., written materials, videos, audiotapes, computer), phone -based interventions, quitlines, brief provider -delivered interventions (e.g., advice from a physician or nurse), intensive counseling delive red on an individual basis or in a group including motivational interviewing, mobile phone and text messaging interventions, biomedical risk assessment, and combinations of these approaches (p. 5). A relatively straightforward behavioral intervention known as the \"5As approach\" is commonly endorsed by professional societies. The 5As direct providers to ask about tobacco use, advise cessation, assess readiness for change, assist with development of a quit plan, and arrange follow -up. An older systematic revi ew (Melvin et al., 2000) concluded that the use of the 5As approach was associated with a relative risk of 1.7 for smoking cessation (95% CI 1.3 to 2.2). Financial incentives have been used to increase motivation to quit. These interventions can be implem ented in a clinic or in other settings. A behavioral intervention specifically targeting pregnant women is high feedback ultrasounds, where women can see the monitor screen and receive detailed visual and verbal explanations of the ultrasound. Behavioral i nterventions can also target a woman's partner or other family members who use tobacco. For women who do not use tobacco, a partner or family member quitting can reduce exposure to secondhand smoke. Interventions that ban smoking in public places, such as smoke -free workplace laws, can also lead to reduced maternal exposure to secondhand smoke. Increasing the price of tobacco lead s to reductions in use, including increasing successful quit attempts. Jurisdictions have increased the price of tobacco by raisi ng tobacco tax es at the local, state, and federal levels. Key Questions and Outcomes The following key questions (KQ) guided the evidence search and review described below. For additional details about the review scope a nd methods please see Appendix C . 1. What interventions are most effective and most cost -effective to: a. Reduce tobacco -related perinatal/infant morbidity and mortality ? b. Reduce tobacco use in pregnant women? c. Sustain tobacco abstinence among women who quit tobacco use during pregnancy? 2. Does effe ctiveness vary by socioeconomic factors such as race, ethnicity, income, and educational attainment? 3. What models of care would allow these interventions to be implemented most effectively and cost-effectively? 20 Tobacco Cessation During Pregnancy For VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 Critical outcomes selected for inclusion in th e GRADE table are p regnancy complications, low birth weight, and perinatal/infant death . Important outcomes selected for inclusion in the GRADE table are abstinence from tobacco during pregnancy and long -term tobacco abstinence . Evidence r eview Pharmacologic Treatments The core sources search identified a Cochrane systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmacologic treatments for smoking cessation in pregnancy that was published in December 2015 (Coleman, 2015). The Medline search did not identify any new RCTs published after the search dates of the systematic review, but did identify an economic analysis (Essex et al., 2015) derived from data from one of the included studies in the Cochrane review. Coleman and colleagues ide ntified nine RCTs for inclusion. Eight of these trials studied nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) using various doses and delivery systems. Five of the trials compared NRT to a placebo control, while three of the trials compared NRT with behavioral support to behavioral support alone. The ninth trial was a small (n=11) RCT of bupropion compared to placebo that reported limited follow -up at nine weeks. There were no trials of other pharmacologic treatments (such as varenicline and nortr iptyline) or the use o f electronic nicotine delivery systems. Four of the nine trials were conducted in the United States; the remaining trials were conducted in Australia, Canada, or Western Europe. The authors concluded that the risk of bias in the included trials was general ly low, notwithstanding concerns over blinding in the three NRT studies that did not use a placebo control. All of the included trials used biochemical validation to ascertain smoking cessation during pregnancy, although the thresholds for positive testing varied. In the meta -analysis of the eight trials of NRT spanning nearly 2,200 participants, NRT demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in smoking cessation during pregnancy (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.93). However, when only the five placebo controlled trials of NRT were included, the effect failed to reach statistical significance (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.68). In the trials that reported continued abstinence from tobacco after pregnancy, NRT did not demonstrate a statistically significant benefit at 6 months (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.77), nor at 12 or 24 month follow -up. Four trials of NRT reported on rates of miscarriage or spontaneous abortion; in the meta -analysis, there was no statistically significant effect of NRT on these outcomes (RR 1.47, 95% CI 0.45 to 4.77). Similarly, in the four studies that reported on stillbirth, there was no statistically significant difference between the NRT and control groups (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.84). Among six studies reporting birth weights, NRT did not have a statistically significant effect on birth weight (mean difference 100.54 grams, 95% CI -20.84 to 221.91). Similarly, while the incidence of low birth weight was lower in the NRT group, the effect was not statistically significant (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.34). It should be noted that both analyses found substantial heterogeneity in the studies. Six studies reported on preterm birth; in the meta -analysis NRT did not have a statistically significant effect on preterm delivery (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.14). Similarly, meta -analytic results of studies 21 Tobacco Cessation During Pregnancy For VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 reporting on neonatal intensive care unit admissions (four studies, RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.27) and neonatal deaths (four studies, RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.17 to 2.62) did not demonstrate a statistical ly significant effect of NRT. Earlier systematic reviews had raised concerns that NRT could be associated with a greater risk of Cesarean birth. However, meta -analysis of data from approximately 1,400 women in two studies included in the Coleman review sh owed no statistically significant difference in the rate of Cesarean section (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.69). Two of the included studies reported detailed information on serious harms including maternal hypertension, 5 minute Apgar score, arterial cord , assisted vaginal delivery, and maternal death. With the exception of one study that showed a small (8 mmHg) but statistically significant increase in maternal diastolic bl ood pressure, there were no other statistically significant differences in serious harms. Non -serious harms were reported in five studies and included headache, dizziness, fatigue, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, and skin irritation. Non -serious harms were no t meta - analyzed but generally occurred in less than 10 -15% of patients in most studies. Overall, the authors conclude that there is high quality evidence of \"borderline significance suggesting that nicotine replacement used with behavioural support by pregnant women for smoking cessation may increase smoking abstinence in late pregnancy... .\" The authors caution that the actual efficacy of NRT for smoking cessation in pregnancy may be closer to the non -statistically significant effect observed in the place bo controlled trials. NRT did not have apparent effects on sustained smoking abstinence after pregnancy, nor on birth outcomes. There was extremely limited evidence on bupropion and no evidence on other pharmacologic treatments such as varenicline and no rtriptyline, nor on electronic nicotine delivery systems. One study identified in the Medline search conducted an economic analysis based on the results of the Smoking, Nicotine, and Pregnancy (SNAP) trial. This economic analysis was done from the perspecti ve of the British National Health Service with a time horizon of up to 7 months. In the SNAP trial (which used nicotine patches as the intervention), the biochemically validated rate of smoking cessation was slightly higher in the NRT group (9.4%) compared to the placebo group (7.6%), though the difference was not statistically significant (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.96). The authors estimated the incremental cost - effectiveness ratio of NRT to be about \u00a35,000 per quitter (95% CI \u00a3 -114,128 to \u00a3126,747) but al so noted the wide confidence interval and the high level of statistical uncertainty. Behavioral Interventions The core sources search identified a review of systematic reviews of behavioral interventions for smoking cessation during pregnancy that was pre pared by the Agency for Health Research and Quality (AHRQ) in September 2015 (Patnode et al., 2015). The authors of the AHRQ review relied on a good quality Cochrane systematic review of behavioral interventions published by Chamberlain and colleagues in 2 013. The Medline search identified one additional RCT published after the search dates of the AHRQ review. The additional trial examined the effectiveness of a physical activity intervention in additional to behavioral support for smoking cessation during pregnancy (Ussher et al., 2015). 22 Tobacco Cessation During Pregnancy For VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 The Chamberlain review included 86 RCTs of behavioral interventions for smoking cessation in pregnancy. The included RCTs enrolled health y pregnant women older than age 16 and most of the studies included women of low soci oeconomic status. The interventions in the trials were varied. Among the 77 studies that were included for meta -analysis, 48 examined behavioral counseling interventions, 7 examined clinician feedback, 7 examined health education, 4 examined incentives, an d 10 examined social support. Forty -four of the trial s compared the behavioral interventions to usual care (information and advice to quit), while in 31 trials the comparator was a less intensive or alternative behavioral intervention. There was no evidenc e on inter net- or text messaging -based interventions in pregnant women, but trials are underway. The meta -analysis of the effect of behavioral interventions on smoking cessation in late pregnancy included 60 RCTs and 10 cluster -randomized trials spanning n early 22,000 patients. In the pooled analysis of all behavioral interventions, there was a statistically significant improvement in smoking cessation in late pregnancy (RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.64) , albeit with moderate heterogeneity. In the exploratory a nalysis, a statistical test for sub -group differences found no difference by the type of intervention. When only trials of behavioral counseling interventions were included, the results were similar (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.59). In the restricted analyse s of other intervention types (social support, financial incentives, and feedback), the results were uniformly in the positive direction, but did not achieve statistical significance. It is important to note that not all trials of behavioral interventions used biochemical validation of smoking cessation, but the authors did not find evidence of significant between -group heterogeneity based on the presence or absence of biochemical validation. Indeed, in the subset of behavioral counseling trials that used b iochemical validation, the results were attenuated but still statistically significant (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.50). The AHRQ review did not summarize information on the effects of behavioral interventions on smoking abstinence after pregnancy , though outcomes at 12 to 17 months and >18 months post -partum are reported in the Chamberlain review . Seven of the trials included in the review reported on stillbirth. The stillbirth event rates in both arms of the study group were very low, and while there was a numerically greater number of stillbirths in the behavioral intervention groups (38/2676 vs . 31/2738 in the control groups), there was no statistically significant difference between the groups (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.95). Fourteen trials contributed t o the meta -analysis of low -birth weight outcomes (defined as <2500 grams). Behavioral interventions were effective in reducing the incidence of low birth weight (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.94). Fourteen trials contributed to the meta -analysis of preterm birth (<37 weeks gestation). Behavioral interventions were effective in reducing the incidence of preterm birth (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.96). In the trials of behavioral interventions, there were too few neonatal deaths to draw valid conclusions. The aut hors note that reporting of adverse events in trials of behavioral interventions was limited and sporadic. They note that four studies include the possibility of a paradoxical effect of increased smoking (the range of possible effects could include escalat ion of tobacco use) after a behavioral intervention. Other speculative harms include nicotine withdrawal and the social costs imposed by the loss of partner support, but no trials reported on these potential adverse events. 23 Tobacco Cessation During Pregnancy For VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 Overall, the authors of the AHRQ review conclude that there is evidence that behavioral interventions result in statistically significant improvements in smoking cessation during pregnancy as well as some birth outcomes. As noted, the Medline search identified an additional RCT of a phy sical activity intervention for smoking cessation in pregnancy (Ussher et al., 2015). The London Exercise and Pregnancy smoking (LEAP) trial, randomized 789 pregnant smokers to behavioral support with a supervised physical activity intervention or to behav ioral support alone. The primary outcome was biochemically validated abstinence from smoking during pregnancy. A secondary outcome was self -reported abstinence at 6 months after pregnancy. In the intention -to-treat analysis, there was no statistically sign ificant difference in smoking abstinence at the end of pregnancy (8% in the physical activity group vs . 6% in the control group; OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.70 to 2.10). Similarly, at six months after pregnancy the smoking abstinence rate was 6% in the physical acti vity group compared to 4% in the control group (OR 1.55, 95% CI 0.81 to 2.97). Thus, the authors conclude that the addition of a structured, supervised physical activity intervention to behavioral support does not improve smoking cessation in pregnancy. Prenatal Ultrasound with High Feedback The core sources search identified one Cochrane systematic review of high feedback versus low feedback prenatal ultrasound during pregnancy that included a smoking cessation outcome (Nabhan & Aflaifel, 2015 ). The CEbP Medline search did not identify any new RCTs published after the search dates of the Cochrane systematic review. In high feedback ultrasound, \"women can see the screen and receive detailed explanations of the images.\" The authors of the review identified a s ingle RCT of 129 women that demonstrated that high feedback ultrasound led to a statistically significant improvement in smoking cessation during pregnancy (RR 2.93, 95% CI 1.25 to 6.86). The authors assessed the GRADE quality of this evidence to be low. Financial Incentives The core sources search identified a Cochrane systematic review of randomized controlled trials and controlled before -and-after studies of financial incentives for smoking cessation during pregnancy (Cahill et al., 2015). The Medline s earch did not identify any new RCTs published after the search dates of the systematic review. The Cochrane review included nine studies of financial incentives spanning almost 1,800 pregnant smokers. Eight of the nine studies were conducted in the United States, mostly in clinical settings. The financial incentives in these studies were vouchers for goods or services, not cash payments. The value of the financial awards was up to $250. Four of the trials used incremental awards in which the vouchers reset to baseline values after relapse or missed visits, but could be restored to the previous value when abstinence was re -established. All of the trials also offered standard cessation support to all participants in addition to routine care. All of the studies examined smoking cessation at the end of pregnancy and six of the studies followed participants after pregnancy. Financial incentives for smoking cessation can be included as part of insurance benefit design, but are also provided as direct benefits from employers or other groups. 24 Tobacco Cessation During Pregnancy For VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 In the meta -analysis, financial incentives showed statistically significant improvements over controls for smoking cessation at end of pregnancy (OR 3.79, 95% CI 2.74 to 5.25) and at longer follow -up of up to 6 months post -partum (OR 3.60, 95% CI 2.39 to 5 .43). In the overall meta -analysis for the primary outcome of smoking cessation at longest follow -up, the likelihood of smoking cessation in the control group was 4.8% compared with 15.4% in the financial incentive group. For all adults, long -term smoking cessation (6 -24 months) was 8.4% in the control group and 11.2% in the incentives group. The authors gave a GRADE quality assessment of moderate for this outcome. The effects on fetal, neonatal, and pregnancy outcomes were not reported. The authors of the Cochrane review address several operational questions about the use of financial incentives, but these conclusions should be interpreted with caution as they are based on the results of smaller numbers of studies. The authors were unable to draw firm concl usions about the effect of reward size. In four studies , contingent rewards (i.e. incentives that increase with prolonged abstinence) appeared to be more effective than fixed payments (OR 6.26, 95% CI 2.35 to 16.68). In one study, front - loading the reward schedule did not improve the odds of quitting (OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.35 to 3.84). Similarly, there was no statistically significant difference between programs that used participant - initiated verification of abstinence compared with researcher -initiated verifi cation (OR 1.70, 95% CI 0.60 to 4.82). The authors of the Cochrane review note a paucity of economic analysis of financial incentives. One study cited a report from the National Institute for Heal th and Clinical Evidence (NICE) that concluded that financi al incentives produced a net cost -benefit of \u00a32,261. A second study reported short -term incremental cost per quitter of \u00a31,127 and longer -term cost per quality -adjusted life year of \u00a3482 based on projected improv ements in maternal outcomes . None of the pre gnancy trials included in the Cochrane review reported on harms or adverse events. Overall, the authors of the Cochrane review conclude that contingent financial incentives improve smoking abstinence in late pregnancy and into the post -partum period. A se parate study (Lopez et al., 2015) was conducted to explore characteristics associated with successful cessation in three of the trials included in the Cochrane review. The authors of this study conclude that contingent incentives, lower -baseline smoking ra te, and a history of quit attempts before pregnancy all predicted successful cessation during pregnancy, but no characteristics were associated with sustained post -partum cessation. Partner Support for Smoking Cessation The core sources search identified o ne narrative systematic review of partner support for smoking cessation during pregnancy (Hemsing et al., 2012). The Medline search did not identify any new RCTs published after the search dates of the systematic review, though there is an ongoing RCT with a published protocol (Meghea et al., 2015). Hemsing and colleagues identified nine studies of partner support that met inclusion criteria. Five studies were RCTs and four studies used before -and-after designs. Overall, in this narrative review, three 25 Tobacco Cessation During Pregnancy For VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 of the four studies that examined the effects of partner support interventions on smoking cessation for pregnant women found no effect. The fourth study, a cluster -randomized trial of an intervention that offered partners an educational booklet, found a statis tically significant increase in quit attempts and 7 - day abstinence for the pregnant women. Among the nine studies that examined the effect of partner support on partner smoking cessation, seven found no effect of the intervention. Overall, the authors of t he review conclude that \"evidence examining partner support...is sparse, and few intervention studies actually demonstrated significant results in either encouraging partners to support smoking cessation during pregnancy and postpartum or in improving the pa rtner's smoking cessation.\" Interventions to Reduce Secondhand Smoke Exposure The core sources search identified one narrative systematic review of interventions to reduce non - smoking pregnant women's exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS) (Tong et al., 2014) . The Medline search did not identify any new RCTs published after the search dates of the systematic review. The narrative review included five RCTs. Four examined psychosocial interventions of varying intensity, while one combined psychosocial interventi ons with NRT for partners of pregnant women. The psychosocial interventions ranged from brief clinical interventions performed by obstetricians to eight sessions spanning pregnancy and the post -partum period that focused on cognitive behavioral strategies delivered by trained counselors. Only one of the studies was done in the United States. The primary outcome was secondhand smoke exposure. Three of the five studies relied on patient reported outcomes rather than biochemical validation of secondhand smoke exposure. Birth outcomes were only reported in one study. Overall, results for secondhand smoke exposure were mixed in the five studies, but the single US -based study (which tested the intensive behavioral counseling intervention detailed above), found a s tatistically significant reductions in self -reported secondhand smoke exposure (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.84). The US study was also the only to report birth outcomes; there were no statistically significant differences in the incidence of low birth weight or preterm delivery (<37 weeks). The overall conclusion offered by the authors is that intervention to reduce SHS exposure during pregnancy may be effective, but firm conclusions are limited by weaknesses in the studies. Multisector Interventions Smoke -free legislation The core sources search identified one systematic review and meta -analysis of the effects of smoke -free legislation on perinatal and child health (Been et al., 2014). The Medline search did not identify any new studies published after the search dates of the systematic review. Been and colleagues included eleven interrupted time series examining the effects of smoke -free legislation in various countries (five studies in North America and six in Europe). The analysis of perinatal outcomes in cludes more than 2.5 million births. Most studies were deemed to be at low or moderate risk of bias; only one was felt to be at high risk of bias. 26 Tobacco Cessation During Pregnancy For VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 Meta -analytic results were available for two outcomes of interest. Smoke -free legislation was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the risk of preterm birth (risk change -10.4%, 95% CI -18.80 to -2.00) and a non -statistically significant reduction the risk of low birth weight ( -1.70%, 95% CI -5.10 to 1.60). Overall, the authors conclude that there is clear evidence that smoke -free legislation is associated with a reduction in preterm births. The authors further contend that smoke -free legislation is cost -effective because there are no established adverse economic effects of smoking bans, but also note that formal cost-effectiveness studies are lacking. Tobacco excise tax es The core sources search did not identify relevant systematic reviews of tobacco tax es and their effects on smoking during pregnancy or birth outcomes. The Medline search ide ntified three observational studies of the effects of tobacco tax es on smoking during pregnancy and perinatal outcomes. Patrick and colleagues (2015) created a time series model based on data from all fifty states between 1999 and 2010. Based on their mult ivariate regression model, they concluded there was a statistically significant effect of tobacco tax es such that every $1 increase in the per pack cigarette tax was associated with a redu ction in infant deaths (before one year of age) of 0.19 per 1000 liv e births (95% CI -0.33 to -0.05). The estimated effect was greater for African American infants with a reduction of 0.46 infant death per 1000 live births (95% CI -0.90 to -0.01) for each $1 increase in the per pack tax. Hawkins and colleagues (2014) perf ormed a quasi -experimental analysis using US natality files of over 16 million singleton births in 28 states between 2000 and 2010 to explore the association of tobacco control policies with birth outcomes. The statistical analysis was done using two model s and the results were analyzed by race and educational attainment. In the first model, each $1 increase in the tobacco tax was associated with a reduction in the rate of smoking during pregnancy of 2.4% for white mothers with 0 -11 years of education and 2 .1% for black mothers with 0 -11 years of education. The association of tobacco tax es with reduced smoking in pregnancy continued, but was attenuated, for black mothers of all levels of educational attainment. In the second model, each $1 increase in cigare tte taxes was associated with increases in birth weight (5.4 grams among white mothers and 4.0 grams among black mothers, both with 0 -11 years of education). Similarly, in the group with 0 -11 years of education, each $1 increase in tobacco tax es was associ ated with a reduction in low birth weight infants (0.08% for white mothers, 0.12% for black mothers) and preterm births (0.07% for white mothers, 0.08% for black mothers). Of note, each $1 increase in tobacco tax es was associated with an increased number o f large for gestational age infants of 0.18% for white mothers and 0.10% for black mothers, both with 0 -11 years of education. Overall, the authors conclude that increased tobacco tax es are associated with lower rates of smoking during pregnancy and improv ements in birth outcomes, including low birth weight and preterm births. These effects are most apparent among women with the lowest levels of educational attainment. Adams and colleagues (2012) performed a pooled cross -sectional analysis of live births in 29 states and New York City between 2000 and 2005. Using regression modeling, they estimated the effects of various tobacco control interventions including smoking ba ns, taxes, and overall tobacco control spending on 27 Tobacco Cessation During Pregnancy For VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 the rates of smoking during pregnancy. The authors found that each $1 increase in tobacco taxes or prices results in a 4% to 5% increase in third trimester smoking abstinence after controlling for other tobacco control policies. Furthermore, each $1 increase in tobacco taxes was also associated with a 4.2% increase in the probability of sustained tobacco cessation at 4 months post -partum. Full private worksite smoking bans were found to be associated with an estimated increase in third trimester abstinence of approximately 5%. Of note, cumulative spending on tobacco control did not have an apparent effect on smoking during pregnancy. The results for these outcomes varied by age group and the results appear to be attenuated in older populations. Models of Care The available summary literature provides no direct evidence regarding models of care that are associated with effectiveness for these interventions, except where noted for specific interventions above. Overwhelmingly, the individual interventions that were studied were delivered in clinical settings, including interventions like financial incentives. Many of the behavioral interventions rely on the use of interdisciplinary care providers, including t rained counselors. The outcomes of m aternity care homes for high -risk pregnant women are currently being evaluated by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation. The included tobacco control policies were mostly implemented at a statewide level, thoug h in some cases local efforts were also included in the analyses. There is limited cost - effectiveness information that is specific to pregnant smokers. The economic analyses that do exist, particularly for financial incentives, suggest that these intervent ions are either cost -saving or cost - effective and well below commonly accepted willingness -to-pay thresholds. EVIDENCE SUMMARY A number of interventions, both at the individual and community levels, have been studied for their effects on smoking cessation during and after pregnancy as well as birth outcomes. At the individual level, behavioral interventions are effective. Among multisector interventions, financial incentives and tobacco control policies (including smoke -free legislation and tobacco taxes ) appear to have the best evidence of effectiveness. Among pharmacologic interventions , only NRT is well studied. NRT may have a modest effect on reducing smoking during pregnancy , but does not appear to encourage sustained smoking abstinence and does not hav e apparent effects on birth outcomes. No evidence was identified that examined the effectiveness or harms of other pharmacologic treatments such as varenicline, nortr iptyline, or electronic/vaporized cigarettes in pregnant women. Behavioral interventions ( among which behavioral counseling is most commonly studied) appear to be effective in reducing smoking during pregnancy and also appear to reduce the incidence of low birth weight and preterm birth. On the basis of a single RCT, ultrasound with high feedba ck may increase smoking cessation in late pregnancy. 28 Tobacco Cessation During Pregnancy For VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 Contingent financial incentives for smoking cessation appear to be among the most promising interventions and are associated with increased smoking abstinence both during and after pregnancy. There is li mited evidence on programs for partner support for smoking cessation and the existing data shows mixed results. There is limited evidence on programs to reduce secondhand smoke exposure for pregnant women. Data from a US -based RCT suggests that intensive b ehavioral counseling may reduce self -report ed secondhand smoke exposure in pregnancy, but there were no apparent effects on birth outcomes. Evidence from interrupted time series examining the effects of smoking bans on perinatal outcomes suggests that thes e interventions reduce the risk of preterm births. Much of the evidence for behavioral interventions was conducted in populations of low socioeconomic status. In general, studies of tobacco control policies, particularly tobacco taxes, suggest greater effe cts in African -Americans, those with lower levels of educational attainment, and younger populations. In conclusion, selected individual clinical interventions , financial incentives, and tobacco control policy interventions appear to be effective in reduc ing smoking during pregnancy and th us improving birth outcomes. OTHER DECISION FACTORS Resource Allocation Complications associated with smoking such as preterm birth and low -birth weight can be very high cost and have significant social implications on a future child's development and productivity. Interventions that are effective at reducing these complications would be high ly appealing for coverage. Of the clinical interventions, behavioral interventions have the strongest evidence of benefit of health o utcomes. Financial incentives have upfront costs, but these costs were modest and the intervention effective. The multisector interventions would have minimal costs for plans but may face concerns from other sectors . Values and preferences Pregnant smoker s are often motivated to quit because of the potential health risks for their pregnancy and their infant. Some pregnant women would be highly motivated to find safe and effective strategies to assist them. Behavioral interventions, while effective at impro ving quit rates and health outcomes, take an additional time commitment on behalf of the woman and would be more appealing to some than others. Financial incentives may be quite sought after by some women. For pharmacotherapy, many women are very uncomfort able with use of medications during pregnancy that are not well studied and proven safe. For them, the risks associated with this without a proven benefit is likely to dissuade their use. For the multisector interventions there are strong stakeholder inter est groups that would have significant concerns about increasing various tobacco control policies . However, such policies already exist in Oregon and other states , and much of the public favors using tobacco taxes to help fund healthcare services. 29 Tobacco Cessation During Pregnancy For VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 POLICY L ANDSCAPE Quality measures The National Quality Measures Clearinghouse includes a large variety of quality measures related to screening/assessment for tobacco use, tobacco use status, and access to treatment. None of these measures specifically focus on women who are pregnant. Starting in 2016, Oregon's Coordinated Care Organization (CCO) Incentive Measures includes: Percentage of adult Medicaid members (ages 18 and older) who currently smoke cigaret tes or use other tobacco products. Payer coverage policies Section 4107 of the Affordable Care Act requires state Medicaid programs and most commercial insurance plans to cover comprehensive tobacco cessation services for pregnant women, including counseli ng and pharmacotherapy, without cost sharing ( Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , 2011). The Washington Medicaid program covers prescription (including bupropion SR (Zyban\u00ae) and varenicline tartrate Chantix\u00ae) and over -the-counter smoking cessation products (including NRT) for pregnant women through the state's Quitline Program or through a pharmacy. The client must be receiving smoking cessation counseling to be eligible to receive medications. Eight cessation counseling sessions are allowed every 1 2 months (Washington State Department of Health, 2015). Multisector Interventions All the included studies in the systematic review of smoke -free legislation (Been et al., 2014) assessed jurisdictions that had implemented smoke -free legislation for workpla ces including bars and restaurants. Thirty states, including Oregon, have implemented smoke -free legislation for workplaces, bars, and restaurants (Campaign for Tobacco -Free Kids [CTFK], 2016a). Oregon's law was passed in 2007 and implemented on January 1, 2009. Tobacco taxes have been implemented at the federal levels, state, and local levels. The current federal cigarette tax is $1.01 per pack. The average state cigarette tax is $1.61 per pack, ranging from $.017 per pack in Missouri to $4.35 per pack in New York. The tax per pack in Oregon is $1.32 and in Washington it is $3.025 (CTFK, 2016b). In the U.S., over 600 local jurisdictions (e.g., cities, counties) have levied cigarette taxes, as high as $3.00 per pack in Cook County, Illinois, and Juneau, Alas ka (CTFK, 2015). In Oregon, state law preempts cities and counties from levying tobacco taxes. Recommendations from others United States Preventive Services Task Force The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guideline was published in Se ptember 2015 and is informed by the evidence review conducted by AHRQ (Patnode, 2015). The USPSTF reached the following conclusions: 30 Tobacco Cessation During Pregnancy For VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 Clinicians should \"ask all pregnant women about tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral inte rventions for cessation...\" (A recommendation) \"[C]urrent evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of pharmacotherapy interventions for tobacco cessation in pregnant women.\" (I statement) \"[C]urrent evidence is insufficient to rec ommend electronic nicotine delivery systems for tobacco cessation in adults, including pregnant women.\" The USPSTF also provided information on the components of effective behavioral interventions (for adults in general, not specific to pregnant women) which are excerpted below: Intensity Both minimal (<20 min in 1 visit) and intensive (20 min plus >1 follow -up visit) physician -advice interventions effectively increase the proportion of adults who successfully quit smoking and remain abstinent for 6 mo. There is a dose -response relationship between the intensity of counseling and cessation rates (i.e., more or longer sessions improve cessation rates). Duration Brief, in -person behavioral counseling sessions (<10 min) effectively increase the proportion of adults who successfully quit smoking and remain abstinent for 1 y. Although less effective than longer interventions, even minimal interventions (<3 min) have been found to increase cessation rates in some studies. Frequency Multiple sessions should be pr ovided; according to the Public Health Service guidelines, patients should receive 4 in -person counseling sessions. Cessation rates may plateau after 90 min of total counseling contact time. Format In-person behavioral counseling sessions (individual or g roup counseling) Telephone counseling Tailored, print -based self -help materials Provider In-person behavioral counseling sessions: Various types of primary care providers, including physicians, nurses, psychologists, social workers, and cessation counselor s Telephone counseling: Professional counselors or health care providers who are trained to offer advice over the telephone Content Assessment of smoking status: o Ask every patient about tobacco use o Advise all tobacco users to quit o Assess willingness of all tobacco users to make an attempt to quit o Assist all tobacco users with their attempt to quit o Arrange follow -up 31 Tobacco Cessation During Pregnancy For VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 Effective counseling interventions provide social support and training in practical problem - solving skills: o Training in problem -solving skills includes helping persons who smoke to recognize situations that increase their risk for smoking, develop coping skills to overcome common barriers to quitting, and develop a plan to quit o Basic information about smoking and successful quitting should also b e provided o Complementary practices that improve cessation rates include motivational interviewing, assessing readiness to change, and offering more intensive counseling or referrals Washington State Department of Health The Washington State Department of H ealth issued a revised smoking cessation during pregnancy guideline in 2015. For most clinics, the guideline endorses the use of a brief behavioral intervention based on the \"5As\" approach created by the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists . The 5As are ask, advise, assess, assist, and arrange. For clinics that are not able to implement a full 5As approach, the guideline suggests the \"2A & R\" approach that includes asking about smoking, advising cessation, and referring to cessation resource s outside the clinic. The Washington guideline includes advice for implementation at clinics, provider scripts, and suggestions for sustaining cessation postpartum. The guideline does not recommend the routine use of pharmacotherapy for cessation, but states that in heavy smokers who have failed behavioral interventions that pharmacotherapy may be considered. The guideline also provides additional information about the covered benefits for smoking cessation in the Medicaid program and offers a compendium of outside resources. North American Quitline Consortium The North American Quitline Consortium (NAQC) released an issue paper in 2014. Though not strictly a clinical practice guideline it is notable for recommending that pregnant smokers should be offered i n- person counseling and that quitlines should be considered an adjunct. It endorses further research into both the effectiveness of quitlines and measures to increase their utilization. It provides established counseling protocols for pregnant and recently postpartum women. World Health Organization The World Health Organization released a GRADE -informed guideline in 2013 regarding the prevention and management of tobacco use and secondhand smoke exposure in pregnant women. The recommendations, including th e strength of recommendation and evidence quality , is excerpted in the table below on the next page. 32 Tobacco Cessation During Pregnancy For VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 WHO recommendations for the prevention and management of tobacco use and second -hand smoke exposure in pregnancy (2013) No. Recommendation Strength of re com - mendation Quality of Evidence Identification of tobacco use and second -hand smoke exposure in pregnancy 1 Health -care providers should ask all pregnant women about their tobacco use (past and present) and exposure to SHS, as early as possible in the pregnancy, and at every antenatal care visit Strong Low Psychosocial interventions for tobacco -use cessation in pregnancy 2 Health -care providers should routinely offer advice and psychosocial interventions for tobacco cessation to all pregnant women, who are either current tobacco users or recent tobacco quitters.* Strong Moderate Pharmacological interventions for tobacco -use cessation in pregnancy 3 The panel cannot make a recommendation on use or nonuse of nicotine replacement therapy to support cessation of tobacco use in pregnancy. Not applicable Moderate 4 The panel does not recommend use of bupropion or varenicline to support cessation of tobacco use in pregnancy. Strong Very Low 5 The panel recommends that further research be carried out in pregnant women on safety, efficacy and factors affecting adherence to pharmacotherapeutic cessation agents. Strong Not applicable Protection from second -hand smoke in pregnancy (smoke -free public places) 6 All health -care facilities should be smoke -free to protect the health of all staff, patients, and visitors, including pregnant women. Strong Low 7 All work and public places should be smoke -free for the protection of everyone, including pregnant women Strong Low Protection from second -hand smoke in pregnancy (smoke -free homes) 8 Health -care providers should provide pregnant women, their partners and other household members with advice and information about the risks of SHS exposure from all forms of smoked tobacco as well as strategies to reduce SHS in the home. Strong Low 9 Health -care providers should, wherever possible, engage directly with partners and other household members to inform them of the risks of SHS exposure to pregnant women from all forms of smoked tobacco, and to promote reduction of exposure and offer smoking cessation support. Strong Low *Recent tobacco quitters may include women who used tobacco before the pregnancy, and who have either spontaneously quit or stopped using tobacco in the pre -conception period or in early pregnancy, before their first antenatal visit . 33 Tobacco Cessation During Pregnancy For VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 Association of State and Territorial Health Officials In 2013, the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO) issued recommendations for smoking cessation strategies for women before, dur ing, and after pregnancy. The eight ASTHO recommendations are excerpted below: 1. Provide training and technical assistance to healthcare and public health providers on helping women quit using tobacco before, during, and after pregnancy. 2. Extend pregnancy -specific and postpartum -specific quitline services to women during and after pregnancy. 3. Promote awareness of cessation benefits and effectiveness of treatment by implementing coordinated media campaigns that specifically target women during childbearing years . 4. Develop customized programs for specific at-risk populations of women who are smokers and of repr oductive age 5. Include Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) sites as points for intervening with pregnant and postpartum women. 6. Design and promote barrier -free c essation coverage benefits for pregnant and postpartum women in public and private health plans. 7. Promote cessation service integration aimed at improving birth outcomes. 8. Implement evidence -based tobacco control policies that augment tobacco cessation for women before, during, and after pregnancy. American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists In 2010, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologist (ACOG) released a clinician -directed self-instructional guide toolkit to help pregnant women quit smoking. ACOG endorses the use of the \"5As\" approach for screening and brief intervention. The 5As are: Ask about smoki ng Advise to quit Assess willingness to quit Assist patient with the process Arrange follow -up The ACOG instructional guide also provides implementation advice and tools for clinics and providers. ACOG endorses the use of tobacco quitlines. ACOG states tha t pharmacologic treatments should not be used as first -line smoking cessation strategies, but may be considered with close supervision in women who are unable to quit after a trial of behavioral interventions like the 5As approach. National Institute for H ealth and Care Excellence In 2010, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) released a public health guideline regarding smoking cessation in pregnancy and after childbirth. NICE provides eight recommendations directed at midwives, gene ral practitioners, and staff at the National Health Service (NHS) Stop Smoking Services. Salient features of the NICE recommendations include comprehensive screening using history 34 Tobacco Cessation During Pregnancy For VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 and exhaled carbon monoxide testing, early referral to behavioral support th rough Stop Smoking Services program of the NHS, and education for partners who also smoke. Like others, NICE also recommends that NRT not be considered unless other attempts at cessation are unsuccessful and should only be prescribed for two week intervals contingent on validation of smoking cessation. 35 Tobacco Cessation During Pregnancy For VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 REFERENCES Evidence Sources Adams, E., Markowitz, S., Kannan, V., Dietz, P., Tong, V., & Malarcher, A.

GRADE INFORMED FRAMEWORK -ELEMENT DESCRI PTIONS Strong recommendation In Favor: The subcommittee concludes that the desirable effects of adherence to a recommendation outweigh the undesirable effects, considering the balance of benefits and harms, resource al location, values and preferences , and other factors. Against: The subcommittee concludes that the undesirable effects of adherence to a recommendation outweigh the desirable effects, considering the balance of benefits and harms , resource allocation, value s and preferences , and other factors . Weak recommendation In Favor: The subcommittee concludes that the desirable effects of adherence to a recommendation probably outweigh the undesirable effects, considering the balance of benefits and harms , resource allocation, values and preferences , and other factors , but further research or additional information could lead to a different conclusion . Against: The subcommittee concludes that the undesirable effects of adherence to a recommendation probably outweigh t he desirable effects, considering the balance of benefits and harms , cost and resource allocation, values and preferences, and other factors, but further research or additional information could lead to a different conclusion . Confidence in estimate ratin g across studies for the intervention /outcome1 High: The subcommittee is very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect. Typical sets of studies are RCTs with few or no limitations and the estimate of effect is likely stable. Moderate: The subcommittee is moderately confident in the estimate of effect: The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different. Typical sets of 1 Includes risk of bias, precision, directness, consistency and publication bias Element Description Balance of benefits and harms The larger the difference between the desirable and undesirable effects, the higher the likelihood that a strong recommendation is warranted. An estimate that is not statistically significant or has a confidence interval crossing a predetermined clinical decision threshold will be downgraded. Quality of evidence The higher the quality of evidence, the higher the likelihood that a strong recommendation is warranted . Resource allocation The higher th e costs of an intervention \u2014that is, the greater the resources consumed in the absence of likely cost offsets \u2014the lower the likelihood that a strong recommendation is warranted . Values and preferences The more values and preferences vary, or the greater the uncertainty in values and preferences, the higher the likelihood that a weak recommendation is warranted . Other considerations Other considerations include issues about the implementation and operationalization of the technology or intervention in health systems and practices within Oregon. 39 Tobacco Cessation During Pregnancy For VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 studies are RCTs with some limitations or well -performed nonrandomized studies with additional strengths that guard against potential bias and have large estimates of effects. Low: The subcommittee's confidence in the estimate of effect is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect. Typical sets of studies are RCTs with serious limitations or nonrandomized studies without special strengths.

Coverage Guidance -Skin substitutes for diabetic foot ulcers and venous leg ulcers CG-Skin substitutes for diabetic foot ulcers and venous leg ulcers , Issue #854 Page 1 Question : How should the Coverage Guidance on Skin Substitutes for Chronic Skin Ulcers be applied to the Prioritized List? Question source : Evidence -based Guidelines Subcommittee (EbGS) Issue : The EbGS made coverage recommendation s about specific skin substitutes, and about the clinical prerequisites necessary for a skin substitute to be appropriate. VbBS March 2016 meeting Key decisions: Adoption of a guideline note and specific recommendations around skin substitutes with at lea st \"low\" level evidence Include the full table of those skin substitutes that were recommended/not recommended Including information about a maximum number of applications for those skin substitutes recommended for coverage. HERC March 2016 meeting Key d ecision Based on public testimony from Dr. Perez that two studies were not included that could change coverage, HERC decided to open the topic up for an additional 21-day comment period followed by a review at the June EbGS meeting. Public comment period #2 8 additional public comments were received Founder study on IDRT was added to the evidence section Clinical support for Epifix, but effectiveness was the first requirement before a consideration of recommendation for coverage was made Discouragem ent of the use of \"non -recommended\" - no change was made 5 studies submitted on Epifix, 2 were new and would meet inclusion criteria, 1 already considered, and 2 would not meet inclusion criteria - the 2 new ones were added to the evidence summary Clarification about Oasis wound matrix versus Oasis Trilayer Matrix, and removal of an obsolete code Clinical support for Epifix Studies on Biovance - none of which met inclusion criteria Studies on Grafix, Lavery EbGS June 2016 meeting minutes : Coverage Guidance -Skin substitutes for diabetic foot ulcers and venous leg ulcers CG-Skin substitutes for diabetic foot ulcers and venous leg ulcers , Issue #854 Page 2 Adam Oble y reviewed the public comment disposition. There was no discussion of comments A1, B1, C1 or D1. For comment E1, there was discussion of whether to treat OASIS\u00ae Wound Matrix and OASIS\u00ae Ultra Tri -Layer Matrix as complete separate products, which could downg rade the evidence for diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), as different products were used for each of the two trials. With only a single trial for each product, the evidence would be downgraded to very low quality, which could change the coverage recommendation. After brief discussion the subcommittee agreed to recommend both products for DFUs and retain its recommendation for OASIS\u00ae Wound Matrix for venous leg ulcers (VLUs). There was no discussion of comment G1 -G6. On comment H, Chan asked about the reason for t he low certainty. Obley explained that it was because of imprecision and only having 1 fair quality randomized controlled trial (RCT). Livingston reviewed the changes in coverage recommendations as stated in the meeting materials, then invited public com ment. John Garrettson and Valene Marmolejo from from Lifenet Health gave testimony. Lifenet Health is a tissue bank that processes tissue for Dermacell. He said the company has randomized data that fulfills the requirements that staff identified. Specifi cally, they have a randomized controlled trial published in February 2016. He said it is a stringently done multicenter RCT. The endpoint was 100% epitheliazation and no drainage. He also said it had a more realistic conventional care arm, including sever al other treatments. Marmolejo also presented, noting that this is intended to be a single application product and that 75 percent of patients only required a single application. Garretson said the lead investigator was the Veteran's Administration. He sai d this product could help contain costs for wound care. In response to a question from Little about why these comments hadn't been submitted earlier, a member of the audience from Dermacell said they were just recently told by a physician that this was u nder consideration. Alejandro Perez provided public comment. Perez is with Providence Health and the Columbia Wound Care Consortium, a nonprofit wound care organization. He expressed concern that one of his public comments did not get considered. Perez r emarked on the Zelen 2015 article comparing Epifix vs. Apligraf vs. standard of care. He said this study met FDA criteria for a good quality study. Secondly he said that the adjudication in the Zelen study was actually blinded. In addition, the Zelen 2016 study has been updated and now has 100 patients with similar findings. He then referenced Appendix E and reported that the average number of applications used in the studies was significantly lower than the coverage limits shown in the appendix. Finally, h e said Epifix and Grafix come in various sizes, while use of Apligraf results in waste as it comes in only one size. He said that some of the outcomes used for the coverage guidance including quality of life and bone infection were not the intent of these skin substitutes, and that the Coverage Guidance -Skin substitutes for diabetic foot ulcers and venous leg ulcers CG-Skin substitutes for diabetic foot ulcers and venous leg ulcers , Issue #854 Page 3 committee set some studies up for failure. He also said that most local wound care professionals were unaware of these discussions about the draft coverage guidance. Staff promised to investigate the issue of Perez's comment , which was submitted outside the formal public comment period. During the meeting Gingerich stated that the comment had not been forwarded to the subcommittee as it should have. (After the meeting, staff investigated further and found that it had been tre ated correctly according to policy; the comment was provided to subcommittee members, though it did not receive a response in the public comment disposition because it was submitted outside the public comment period.) Coffman asked whether there were any c omments in his email were not addressed in the public comment disposition. Perez said he believed his statement that Lavery was a randomized study had not been addressed. Obley explained that staff agreed the trial was an RCT but that it had inadequate allocation concealment and that the randomization method wasn't clear. He said that the clarification from the manufacturer addressed the concern about allocation concealment but not concern about the randomization method. Jamie Hewlett and Tricia Mulcahy f rom Osiris Therapeutics provided testimony. Hewlett said there was an independent clinical effectiveness review published in January 2016 where they looked at the Lavery study stating that Grafix had positive health outcomes. She also said that NICE rated Grafix highly. She said the Lavery study was a 20 -center study. She also clarified that it was an independent auditor's assessment of wound closure that was included in the study (not the treating physician's assessment). All the Medicare Administrative Co ntractors in the United States cover Grafix. Other payers also cover Grafix. Mulcahy also noted that Grafix comes in multiple sizes, which provides cost savings. She said that in a study of 300,000 wounds, including DFUs, VLUs and pressure ulcers, comparin g the costs of Apligraf and Dermagraft to Grafix, the cost was much lower with Grafix. There is a lot of waste with Apligraf and Dermagraft. Hewlett said there is another study coming out soon and asked whether it would be acceptable. Livingston responded that in order to delay this coverage guidance further there would need to be a \"game -changing\" study, as discussed earlier in the meeting. The topic will be reviewed in 2 years as a matter of regular policy. Chan requested staff look at how we notify stak eholders. Coffman said we have a process where we notify certain societies when we list a topic. We also appoint an ad hoc expert to serve as a conduit for the field. Little noted that Perez was not aware though he is with a wound society. Perez said he fo und out later in the process. Other subcommittee members suggested increasing staff outreach to specialty societies, while acknowledging staff has limited time for outreach. Chan said that we may need to discuss how we evaluate small studies that are too small to clearly show an effect on continuous measures (based on lack of optimal information size). Chan asked for a summary of the criteria for recommendation for or against coverage. Obley said it came down to the methodologic quality of the available trials Coverage Guidance -Skin substitutes for diabetic foot ulcers and venous leg ulcers CG-Skin substitutes for diabetic foot ulcers and venous leg ulcers , Issue #854 Page 4 and \"low\" versus \"very low\" confidence in the strength of the estimates. Tippins asked how the subcommittee could bring the issues of waste and number of applications into the discussion. Coffman said that cost is important but that would be an addi tional criterion after showing effectiveness. Waldmann asked if there could be cost information provided. Little said the costs in Appendix E appeared to be for the application, not the product itself and asked Gingerich to clarify about the costs for the product. Gingerich said that costs vary by payer. The Medicare information in the appendix depends on the setting of care. Appendix E shows product and application costs for a single application of the smallest available amount of product. He said that th e cost of treatment for a patient would depend on payer arrangements, wound size, how many applications would be required as well as the setting of care. He did acknowledge that a product which was effective with a single application would be attractive fr om a cost perspective. Tippins expressed reservations about not recommending Grafix and Epifix after public testimony and because of the relatively small differential in number of studies between these products and those recommended for coverage. Other subcommittee members expressed understanding of her concern, but supported the lack of recommenda tion for products where the assessment shows only \"very low\" confidence in the estimates. Some expressed hope that better studies would be available at the next scheduled review in 2 years. They also discussed that the new evidence for Dermacell would not meet the criteria discussed at the May HERC meeting as a \"game changer,\" as there are effective alternatives for this condition. Garretson said that the product usually needs only a single application, making it different from the existing alternatives. Ch an said we cannot delay the process as there are new studies coming out continually. Coffman said if the process were to be delayed it would be important to put the coverage guidance out for comment, and Livingston added that a new study might be published tomorrow for another product at that point in time. The subcommittee took a 5 minute break to allow Obley to evaluate the new Dermacell study. After the break, Livingston reported that staff evaluated the study and found it to be comparable to the other studies for this topic; it would likely receive a fair rating. However in the absence of other studies, the level of confidence in the estimate of effect would still be very low, similar to several other products not recommended for coverage. Livingston re commended moving the coverage guidance forward. After brief additional discussion, the subcommittee voted to refer the draft coverage guidance to HERC without modifications. Motion approved 5 -0.

Callahan, D.P.M., [Submitted Public Comments ID/# Comment Disposition A1 Integra LifeSciences requests that Skin Substitutes for Chronic Skin Ulcers be revised to include coverage of IDRT and Omnigraft for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. Specific coverage language could be taken from the indications for use tab within the attached payer packet. IDRT is an advanced, acellular, bilayer matrix speci fically engineered for dermal regeneration. On the market since 1996, it is the only FDAapproved product indicated Thank you for your comments and for your submission of the FOUNDER study which was published after the initial search . This was added to the evidence section . See new GRADE - informed framework. This FOUNDER study met inclusion criteria but was a single study at moderate risk of bias , so the level of confidence in conclusions is very low . Thus, t he EbGS did not find sufficient HERC Coverage Guidance - Skin Substitutes Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy May 2016 Page 2 ID/# Comment Disposition for the treatment of third degree burns and the reconstruction of scar contracture with a dermal regeneration claim. On January 7, 2016, FDA added an additional indication for use via PMA Supplement to IDRT based on the clinical results of a large multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial (the Foot Ulcer New Dermal Replacement Study (FOUNDER) Study). This study evaluated the safety a nd efficacy of IDRT for the treatment of nonhealing chronic diabetic foot ulcers. The FOUNDER study is unmatched in the wound care area in terms of the strength of its study design, and the study results are both direct and conclusive. Key aspects of the FOUNDER study's design include the following: Large, Multi Center RCT . The FOUNDER study, published in the Wound Healing and Tissue Regeneration Journal, which served as the clinical basis for FDA approval, is the largest multicenter, randomized controlled clinical trial of its kind designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a cellular and/or tissuebased product for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. It included 32 sites from across the United States, and it involved 307 subjects wi th Type II diabetes and at least one diabetic foot ulcer. 14Day Run In Period . In contrast to some previous trials of diabetic foot ulcer treatments that had no runin period or a runin period of 7 days, eligible patients were first required to complete a 14day runin period during which time they were treated with the standard of care regimen. This ensured that the study evaluated the most difficult to heal diabetic foot ulcers. Computerized Planimetry . Third party computerized planimetry was used as an independent assessment method to confirm wound closure and wound size. Generalizability . Despite strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, any bias against generalizability was minimized by enrolling and randomizing subjects from 32 academic and private pr actice sites across the US to ensure that study evidence to recommend coverage. HERC Coverage Guidance - Skin Substitutes Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy May 2016 Page 3 ID/# Comment Disposition participants represent patients with chronic diabetic foot ulcers from a heterogeneous population. Further, a full range of age groups were represented in the study, including the Medicareage population (e.g ., 31 of 153 patients in the control group were age 65 or older [20.3%], and 20 of the 154 patients in the treatment arm [18.2%] were age 65 or older). Key outcomes of the FOUNDER study include the following: Higher Relative Wound Closure . Diabetic foot ulcers treated with IDRT/Omnigraft achieved a 125% relative improvement in closure compared to standard of care at 12 weeks Faster Time to Healing . Patients treated with IDRT/Omnigraft healed 5 weeks faster than patients in the control group who received standard of care. Rapid Wound Closure Rate . Patients who received IDRT/Omnigraft experienced a 50% faster wound size reduction compared to the control group. Single Application . Of the wounds that healed, 96% of those treated with IDRT, Omnigraft healed with three or less applications with 72% healing in one application. In contrast, studies of cellbased products and minimally processed human tissue allografts required an average of 46 applications. Improved Quality of Life . Patients treated with IDRT/ Omnigraft experienced a significant improvement in Physical Functioning and a decrease in Bodily Pain over standard of care (as defined by SF36). We hope that you find these materials sufficient to act favorably on our request to add IDRT and Omnigraft as covered for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers in Skin Substitutes for Chronic Skin Ulcers. B1 I am a board certified podiatrist practicing in Eugene, Oregon. I have used many skin substitutes on the market over the past years and also do wound care studies for the FDA as an investigator for the Center for Clinical Research based in San Francisco , Thank you for your comments and for providing your clinical experience and the perspective on the greater ease of use for Epifix in clinical practice . Cost differences depend heavily on HERC Coverage Guidance - Skin Substitutes Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy May 2016 Page 4 ID/# Comment Disposition California. By far the most utilized skin substitute in my office is Epifix, for both financial and medical reasons. Epifix is approved by Medicare , and comes in multiple sizes, so there is no waste compared to apligra f and other amniotic products. This is an important factor in financial based decision making, and I feel that it is an economically sound modality to utilize in all stalled wounds. In fact, the use of skin substitutes ultimately saves money by healing this at risk patient population sooner, which eliminates the cost of continued wound care modalities, infections, debridements and amputations. There is an actual financial cost as well as a human cost in the form of continued disability due to chronic open wounds. I feel that Medicare exemplif ies the very most basic standard of care that should be available to all patients. It is my sincere hope that your program follows Medicare's example and allows me to use this limb saving modality on all my patients. Epifix is by far the most easy to use a nd in my opinion, effective, skin substitute on the market. The shelf life of the product is five years, and it does not require refrigeration or other special storage circumstances. There is sound research supporting its efficacy in a variety of wounds, a nd I have attached references demonstrating this. Please feel free to contact me at any time if you have any questions or need additional information. Thanking you in advance for considering this important limb saving product for my patients who do not ha ve it currently available to them. wound characteristics and plan contracting, so EbGS 's coverage recommendations include all products with adequate evidence of effectiveness for each type of wounds , acknowledging that each plan will develop its own purchasing strategies. We did not identify any direct evidence from econ omic analyses to suggest that the use of skin substitutes is cost -saving . HERC Coverage Guidance - Skin Substitutes Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy May 2016 Page 5 ID/# Comment Disposition C1 I am writing on behalf of the Oregon Podiatric Medical Association (OPMA) regarding the draft guidance for skin substitutes for chronic skin ulcers. Although OPMA does not advocate one skin substitute product over another, we do believe skin substitutes, in general, play a critical role in healing chronic wounds. Therefore, OPMA recommends HERC exercise caution before labeling a product as \"not recommended.\" Some products ex amined in this coverage guidance are recommended for coverage based on comparative evidence showing their effectiveness for given indications . The subcommittee's recommendation s not to cover products with insufficient evidence of effectiveness could change as additional evidence becomes available. The subcommittee does not find a rationale for covering products not shown to be effective when there are effective alternatives . D1 I would ask to please reconsider Epifix as Recommended. I have had excellent re sults in outpatient setting. I can obtain evidence data for you if necessary. [Submitted bibliography, including articles by Zelen and colleagues (201 5), Serena and colleagues (2014), and Zelen and colleagues (2013), among others. ] Thank you for your comments. The commenter submitted two randomized controlled studies that would have met screening inclusion criteria had they been indexed in Medline at the time of the initial search (Zelen et al ., 2015; Serena et al ., 2014). A third ra ndomized controlled study was included in the original evidence review (Zelen et al ., 2013). The potential concerns regarding the validity of each of these trials are discussed below. The remaining trials submitted (Zelen 2013; Sheikh, 2013) are non -compar ative trials and would not meet inclusion criteria. The final submitted document reviews various local coverage determinations (LCDs) as well as an explanation of the process by which Medicare contractors reach such decisions; relevant LCDs had already bee n noted and discussed in the original draft coverage guidance. Concerns regarding Zelen et al ., 2015: There were baseline differences in the three groups with respect to: o Mean wound size (2.6 cm2 in the Apligraf group, 2.7 cm2 in the EpiFix group, 3.3 cm 2 in HERC Coverage Guidance - Skin Substitutes Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy May 2016 Page 6 ID/# Comment Disposition the standard care group) o Mean wound duration (129 days in the Apligraf group, 109 days in the EpiFix group, 113 days in the standard care group) o Percentage of patients with HbA1c>9 (30% in the Apligraf group, 10% in the EpiFix group, 25% in the standa rd care group) The primary outcome of complete wound closure at 4 and 6 weeks was assessed by an unblinded primary investigator. There are potential differences in the treatments and follow -up between groups. In the Apligraf and EpiFix groups, the products were applied weekly by study investigators. In the standard care group, daily dressing changes were done by the patients. Debridement was carried out in each group \"as necessary.\" Conclusions about comparative effectiveness for sustained wound healing bey ond six weeks cannot be made because more than half (11/20) patients in the standard group exited the trial at 6 weeks. Concerns regarding Serena et al ., 2014: The primary limitation of this study is its use of a surrogate measure (proportion of wounds achieving 40% reduction in size at 4 weeks) as the primary outcome. The trial does not report on complete wound healing, or any of the other critical or important outcomes pre -specified by HERC. HERC Coverage Guidance - Skin Substitutes Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy May 2016 Page 7 ID/# Comment Disposition Additional concerns are the use of an unblinded study investigator as the outcomes assessor and the absence of information on salient baseline characteristics including smoking and diabetes. Zelen et al ., 2013 was included in the original evidence review. Concerns regarding this trial include : This is a very small, single -center study with 13 patients in the treatment group and 12 patients in the control group. There is no description of allocation concea lment. There were baseline differences in wound size between the two groups (2.6 cm2 in the EpiFix group and 3.4 cm2 in the standard care group. There were also differences between the groups with respect to mean body mass index (30 kg/m2 in the EpiFix gr oup and 35.4 kg/m2 in the standard care group. Additionally, baseline information on smoking and glycemic control were not provided. Dressing changes for the EpiFix group were performed by clinicians every two weeks, while the daily dressing changes in th e standard care group were performed by patients or their caregivers. The outcome assessor was unblinded. Conclusions about comparative effectiveness for sustained wound healing beyond six weeks cannot be made because all but two of the 12 patients in the standard care group exited the trial at 6 weeks to HERC Coverage Guidance - Skin Substitutes Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy May 2016 Page 8 ID/# Comment Disposition pursue other treatments. Overall, these studies are at moderate to high risk of bias. E1 In the latest draft guidance, the Commission recommends (with a weak recommendation) coverage of OASIS Wound Matrix for venous leg ulcers (\"VLU\") and diabetic foot ulcers (\"DFU\"). We appreciate the Commission's thoughtful review of the clinical evidence and comments from stakeholders to date. We support the recent changes in the draft coverage guidance, recommend ing for coverage of OASIS not only for VLU but also DFU, and we thank the Commission for its position. OASIS comprises OASIS\u00ae Wound Matrix and OASIS\u00ae Ultra Tri -Layer Matrix. Under the draft guidance, the Commission recommends coverage specifically for OASI S Wound Matrix for VLU and DFU. The OASIS product is currently sold as OASIS Wound Matrix (single layer) and OASIS Ultra Tri -layer Matrix (three layer) with OASIS Burn Matrix no longer commercially available. From a regulatory perspective, OASIS is a singl e product. Both OASIS Wound Matrix and OASIS Ultra Tri -Layer Matrix fall under the same 510(k), varying only in thickness (single (0.1 mm) versus tri -layer (0.3 mm)). OASIS Wound Matrix and OASIS Ultra Tri -Layer Matrix are both available in different size sheets allowing physicians to select the specific form most appropriate for their patients' needs. The Commission has approved OASIS Wound Matrix for coverage based on the current clinical evidence. In our prior comment letter, we presented clinical eviden ce from multiple studies including a 2015 randomized controlled trial. We were pleased that as the Commission reviewed this evidence and other clinical evidence, the Commission decided to expand its coverage of OASIS Wound Matrix to include DFU. We would l ike to draw your attention to the fact that the 2015 randomized controlled trial evidence that we provided used the OASIS Ultra Trilayer Matrix versus standard care. In this trial, the results of which were published in 2015 in Advances in Wound Care 82 qu alified Thank you for your comments providing clarification regarding the range of available OASIS products. Both OASI S Wound Matrix and OASIS Ultra Tri -layer Matrix have been studied for DFU in RCTs. The included RCTs for VLU used OASIS Wound Matrix. We have revised our recommendations to recommend OASIS Wound Matrix and OASIS Ultra Tri -layer Matrix for DFUs and OASIS Wo und Matrix for VLUs. We also deleted Q4103 as you requested . HERC Coverage Guidance - Skin Substitutes Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy May 2016 Page 9 ID/# Comment Disposition patients were randomly assigned to 12 weeks' treatment with OASIS or standard care. The trial found that a greater proportion of the DFUs were closed by the end of the treatment period (week 12) for the OASIS group than for the standard care group (54% vs. 32%; p = 0.021). More ulcers were closed at each weekly study visit in the OASIS group than the standard care group beginning at week 3 (first visit showing ulcers closed). The overall treatment effect on proportion of ulcers closed over the 12 we eks and the interaction of treatment by week were found to be statistically significant in favor of the OASIS group. This study supports the effectiveness of the 3 -layer product (Ultra Tri -layer) consistent with the evidence supporting single layer (Wound Matrix) product. Given that OASIS Wound Matrix and OASIS Ultra Tri -Layer Matrix represent different thicknesses of the same product, we request that the Commission recommend coverage for both, identified by HCPCS codes Q4102 and Q4124 respectively. In addi tion, we suggest that the Commission delete reference to OASIS Burn Matrix, identified by HCPCS Q4103, as it is no longer commercially available. F1 I write this letter in support of Oregon Health Plans, DMAP, ATRIO , etc. covering and approving the use of EPIFIX on ulcers. I have used this product over the past year and have saved many feet and toes from amputation, months of antibiotic use for the patient, hospitalizations etc. When insurances have chosen not to cover EPIFIX for some of my patients, the patient has endured months to almost years of debridements, hospitalizations, months of antibiotics and amputation of forefoot, foot or toe. I hope that you see the benefit to approving this product and appreciate your time in hearing from providers to have a better understanding of this product. Thank you for your comments and for provid ing your clinical experience. However, no ran domized controlled trials of EpiFix have demonstrated reductions in amputations or need for hospitalization . Alternative products are recommended for coverage for both indications . G1 Alliqua BioMedical respectfully requests Biovance be included in this coverage guidance for Skin Substitutes For Chronic Skin Ulcers as we believe the evidence demonstrates net health outcome benefits compared to standard of care (SOC).

G3 Venous Leg Ulcers Biovance placed initially and then at physician discretion (average 2.4 applications) Ulcers of venous stasis etiology comprised the largest subset within the chronic wound group with 85 wounds in 78 intentto treat (ITT) subjects. This analysis demonstrated clinical benefits in a real world, heterogeneous venous st asis ulcer population showing: 53% of the subjects in the Good Wound Care (GWC) Group completely closed in an average observ ation period of about 6 weeks. The impact of good wound care, as defined in this study, resulted in a 26% increase in the incidence of closure for the GWC Group, \"Key Factors Influencing Outcomes of Dehydrated, Decellularized Human Amniotic Membrane Allograft (DDHAM) Treated Venous Ulcers in Real World Experience Study,\" prese nted at Fall SAWC 2015, Las Vegas, NV. None of the submitted references meet inclusion criteria. HERC Coverage Guidance - Skin Substitutes Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy May 2016 Page 11 ID/# Comment Disposition compared to the ITT population. At an average of 8 weeks, the GWC Group's venous stasis ulcers reduced in size by nearly 68%. None of the venous stasis ulcers in the GWC Group that completely closed had reported infection prior to or during treatment while about onethird of those that did not close reported at least one episode of clinically suspected wound infection. G4 Chronic Wounds (venous leg ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers) Biovance placed initially and then at physician discretion (Average application 2.3) The wound closure rate for Biovance\u00ae is notable given the eight -week observation time point, when many chronic wound studies evaluate closure rate at 12 and/or 20 week endpoints; and the broad inclusion criteria for the patient and wound population. The typical woun d size in the Use Registry Study was also almost double the size of the Margolis article (1.6 cm2 vs. 3.1cm2 in the Use Registry Study). Failure of prior therapies Thirty -two subjects with a Smiell JM, Treadwell T, Hahn HD, Hermans MH. Real World Experience With a Decellularized Dehydrated Human Amniotic Membrane Allograft. Wounds. 2015;27(6):158 - 169. Smiell et al ., 2015 is a non -comparative study in which \"any subject with a chronic wound who, in the investigator's opinion, would be nefit from treatment with DDHAM \" was enrolled in a registry to track treatment outcomes . Thus, this is essentially a non-consecutive case ser ies and does not meet inclusion criteria. HERC Coverage Guidance - Skin Substitutes Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy May 2016 Page 12 ID/# Comment Disposition variety of chronic ulcer types (venous, n = 14 [13 wounds]; dia betic n = 10; pressure, 1; arterial [ischemic], n = 7 [4 wounds]) had failed previous courses of therapy with 1 or more advanced biologic therapies (ie, Apligraf, Organogen esis, Canton, MA; and Nephew, Hull, UK; or Regranex, Smith and Nephew, Hull, UK). After a course of therapy that included the DDHAM allograft, nearly half (48.4%) of these ulcers closed despite previous biologic ther apy failures. Those that did not close during a mean observa tion time of 10.3 weeks reduced in size from baseline by 50% (Table 8). G5 Improvements over currently available treatments include (1) a more rapid resolution of chronic non -healing wounds, as measured by time to closure and wound area reduction; (2) ability to treat a patient population unresponsive to currently available treatments; (3) reduced rate of device -related complications; and (4) decreased rate of subsequent therapeutic interventions. A prospective, multi -center registry was conducted, inclusive of all patients with any As noted above t here is no direct comparative evidence from randomized controlled trials demonstrating the effectiveness of Biovance.

The only requirement was that wounds were free of infection. The broad inclusion criteria resulted in a number of patients that were otherwise likely to be excluded from an RCT, either due to co -morbidities, age, wound size, or another factor A total of 19 sites across the U.S. enrolled 230 patients with a total of 246 wounds. Ultima tely, the \"intent to treat\" (ITT) group (defined as any individual that was observed for greater than 3 days and had a documented wound start measurement and end measurement) consisted of 59 acute (traumatic and burn wounds) and 155 chronic wound patients (including diabetic, venous, arterial, pressure, and collagen vascular disease ulcers). The Good Wound Care (GWC) Group represents a large subset of the IIT population. Good wound care was described as compliance with the use of off -loading (DFU) or compre ssion dressings/wraps (venous ulcers), maintenance of allograft, and without the concomitant use of enzymatic debriders. In the Use Registry Study, the chronic wound population demonstrated a closure rate of 50% at approximately 8 weeks. In contras t, Mostow demonstrated that 34% (20/58) of the control (standard care) arm in a venous leg ulcer study closed at 12 weeks with compression dressings and debridement as a SOC, and in the Apligraf\u00ae pivotal venous ulcer study, the control arm (n=100) achieved an incidence of complete closure in approximately 24% of the ulcers at 12 weeks. The wound closure rate for Biovance\u00ae is notable given the eight -week observation time point, when many chronic wound studies evaluate closure rate at 12 and/or 20 week endp oints; and the broad inclusion criteria for the patient and wound population. The typical wound size in the Use Registry Study was also almost double the size of the Margolis article (1.6 cm2 vs. 3.1cm2 in the Use Registry Study). This improvement in wound closure rates was most likely related to the use of Biovance\u00ae in combination with the SOC. The registry provides a persuasive demonstration of effectiveness for HERC Coverage Guidance - Skin Substitutes Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy May 2016 Page 14 ID/# Comment Disposition Biovance\u00ae in a broad \"real world\" population of all wound types. In addition, there were no se rious or unexpected adverse effects related to the use of Biovance\u00ae reported and subject and investigator opinions were generally positive.

There are potentially important baseline differences between the two groups, specifically, larger average ulcer size in the standard treatment group (3.93 cm2 vs 3.41 cm2 in the Grafix group), and the presence of HERC Coverage Guidance - Skin Substitutes Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy May 2016 Page 15 ID/# Comment Disposition o Characteristics of the study support the fact that this is a high -quality RCT o Review and assessment of Lavery et al by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK In view of the independent evidence assessments indicating that the Lavery study is high quality and the meta -analys is indicating a larger strength of effect than other studies on advanced dermal substitutes, Osiris therapeutics requests that you reconsider your decision based on the enclosed information, and cover Grafix at Oregon Medicaid. twice as many dorsal foot ulcers in the Gra fix group (8 vs 4 in the standard care group). The trial permitted the use of custom off -loading devices at the discretion of the investigat or raising the possibility that this additional treatment was not equally applied in the treatment and control group s. The overall rate of attrition in the trial exceeds 15% with 19 of 97 participants withdrawing prior to study completion. There were more dropouts in the control group (23%) compared with the Grafix group (16%). There is a discrepancy in the reported out come of complete wound healing which was originally stated as occurring in 31 of 50 patients in the Grafix group, but in later reporting on wound recurrence after the 12 week treatment phase the authors state that ulcers remained closed in 23 of 28 patient s in the Grafix group. Reporting the odds ratio for complete healing overstates the relative benefits of the treatment; it would be more appropriate to report a risk ratio (which in this case would be 2.91, 95% CI 1.61 to 5.26, as reported in the NICE app endix I submitted by the commenter ). Although the study states that \"wound closure was independently confirmed via a central wound core laboratory\" the initial determination of the primary outcome (complete wound closure) was made by an HERC Coverage Guidance - Skin Substitutes Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy May 2016 Page 16 ID/# Comment Disposition unblinded site inve stigator. Thus, the Lavery study is at least at moderate risk of bias. We find the assessment of High GRADE quality in the NICE appendix to be perplexing in light of the potential risk of bias in this single trial. Furthermore, the final NICE recommendati ons for diabetic foot ulcers state that skin substitutes be considered an adjunct to standard care but do not recommend specific products. The Reguslki et al ., 2013 study (a retrospective non -consecutive case series) and the studies by Duan -Arnold et al ., 2015 (all in vitro studies of the biologic properties of human amniotic membrane) do not meet inclusion criteria.

Product is recommended for the type of ulcer being treated (see table below) 2. FDA indications and contraindications are followed , if applicable 3. Wound has adequate arterial flow (ABI > 0.7) , no ongoing infection and a moist wound healing environment 4. For patients with diabetes, Hba1c level is < 12 5. Prior appropriate wound care therapy (including but not limited to appropriate offloading, mu ltilayer compression dressings and smoking cessation counseling) has failed to result in significant improvement (defined as at least a 50 percent reduction in ulcer surface area) of the wound over at least 30 days 6. Ongoing coverage requires significant improve ment of the ulcer with skin substitute application over the preceding 6 week time period Ulcer improves significantly over 6 weeks of treatment with skin substitutes, with continued significant improvement every 6 weeks required for coverage of ongoing applications 7. Patients is able to adhere to the treatment plan The following products are recommended/not recommended for coverage as shown below. All recommendations are weak recommendations excep t as specified. Product Diabetic foot ulcers Venous leg ulcers Dermagraft \u00ae Recommended Not recommended Apligraf \u00ae Recommended Recommended OASIS \u00ae (Wound Matrix and Ultra Tri - Layer Matrix) Recommended Recommended (OASIS \u00ae Wound Matrix only ) EpiFix\u00ae Not recommended Not recommended Grafix \u00ae Not recommended Not recommended Graftjacket \u00ae Not recommended Not recommended Omnigraft \u00ae Not recommended Not recommended Talymed \u00ae Not recommended Not recommended TheraSkin \u00ae Not recommended Not recommended Other skin substitutes Not recommended Not recommended The use of skin substitutes is not recommended for coverage of chronic skin ulcers other than venous leg ulcers and diabetic foot ulcers (e.g. , pressure ulcers ) (weak recommendation). Note: Definitions for strength of recommendation are provided in Appendix A GRADE Informed Framework Element Description . 2 Skin substitutes for chronic skin ulcers DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 RATIONALE FOR GUIDANC E DEVELOPMENT The HERC selects topics for guideline development or technology assessment based on the following principles: Represents a significant burden of disease Represents important uncertainty with regard to efficacy or harms Represents important variation or controversy in clin ical care Represents high costs, significant economic impact Topic is of high public interest Coverage guidance development follows standard methodology to translate evidence review s into a policy decision. Coverage guidance s are based on a thorough review of the evidence by the Evidence - based Guideline Subcommittee or the Heath Technology Assessment Subcommittee. The evidence review used in the coverage guidance development process may use existing systematic reviews of the evidence on a g iven topic and incorporate additional individual studies published more recently than the included systematic reviews. Included evidence sources are generally published within the last three to five years. A full description of the evidence review methodol ogy is included in each coverage guidance as an appendix. The translation of the evidence review to a policy decision is based on a GRADE - informed f ramework, as described below . 3 Skin substitutes for chronic skin ulcers DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 GRADE -INFORMED FRAMEWORK The HERC develops recommendations by using the concepts of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluat ion (GRADE) system. GRADE is a transparent and structured process for developing and presenting evidence and for carrying out the s teps involved in developing recommendations. There are several elements that determine the strength of a recommendation, as listed in the table below. The HERC reviews the evidence and makes an assessment of each element, which in turn is used to develop t he recommendations presented in the coverage guidance box. Estimates of effect are derived from the evidence presented in this document. The level of confidence in the estimate is determined by the Commission based on assessment of two independent reviewer s from the Center for Evidence -based Policy . Unless otherwise noted, estimated resource allocation, values and preferences, and other considerations are assessments of the Commission. Note: T he Quality of Evidence rating was assigned by the primary evidenc e source, not the HERC Subcommittee . The GRADE framework elements are described in Appendix A. A GRADE Evidence Profile is provided in Appendix B. Apligraf\u00ae/Graftskin\u00ae Coverage question: Should Apligraf \u00ae be rec ommended for coverage for treatment of chronic skin ulcers ? Outcomes Estimate of Effect for Outcome/ Confidence in Estimate Resource allocation Deep soft tissue or bone infection (Critical outcome) DFU1: osteomyelitis 2.7% vs 10.4% (p = 0.4) (low certainty of no benefit, based on one good quality RCT) DFU (Apligraf \u00ae vs TheraSkin \u00ae): One amputation TheraSkin \u00ae vs none for Apligraf \u00ae (p-value not reported) (very low certainty of no comparative benefit , based on one fair quality RCT) VLU: osteomyelitis 8.1% vs 0% (no st atistical cost for adding Apligraf \u00ae to a patient's course of treatment for a small leg ulcer (<25 cm2) under Medicare FFS (using average national prices for October, 2015 ) would range from $771.20 for a single application in an ambulatory surgery center to $ 4,553.81 for three applications in the physician's office setting. Prices are somewhat higher for foot ulcers due to higher physician fees/bundled fee s for application. Product is sold in 44 cm2 sheets. 1 DFU: Diabetic Foot Ulcer; VLU: Venous Leg Ulcer 4 Skin substitutes for chronic skin ulcers DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 Coverage question: Should Apligraf \u00ae be rec ommended for coverage for treatment of chronic skin ulcers ? Outcomes Estimate of Effect for Outcome/ Confidence in Estimate Resource allocation (very low certainty of benefit, based on one good quality RCT) Up to 3 applications appear to be the maximum necessary based on included studies. Complete wound healing (Critical outcome) DFU : RR 1.5, 1.96 (p = 0.01, 0.03) (moderate certainty of benefit, based on two good quality RCTs) DFU -value not reported) (very low certainty of no comparative benefit, based on one fair quality RCT) VLU: RR 2.38 (p < 0.001) (low certainty of benefit, based on one good quality RCT) Unspecified non -healing ulcer s: 100% vs 75% (p < 0.01) (very low certainty of benefit, based on one poor quality RCT) Quality of life (Critical outcome) No evidence identified. Time to complete wound healing (Important outcome) DFU : No evidence identified. VLU: 61 vs 191 days (statistical analysis not provided) (low certainty of benefit, based on one good quality RCT) Unspecified non -healing ulcers : 7 vs 51 weeks (statistical analysis not provided) (very low certainty of benefit, based on one poor quality RCT) 5 Skin substitutes for chronic skin ulcers DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 Coverage question: Should Apligraf \u00ae be rec ommended for coverage for treatment of chronic skin ulcers ? Outcomes Estimate of Effect for Outcome/ Confidence in Estimate Resource allocation Adverse effects (Important outcome) DFU : Pooled data from 4 RCTs showed similar incidence of cellulitis, dermatitis, and peripheral edema with Apligraf\u00ae vs control (statistical analysis not reported) (low certainty of no harm, based on four good quality RCT) VLU: Infection rates of 8.2% vs 7.8% (statistical analysis not reported) (very low certainty of no harm, based on one good quality RCT) Rationale: Apligraf \u00ae is recommended for coverage for venous leg ulcers and diabetic foot ulcers , based on improved complete wound healing, low variability in patient preference, and despite its cost. A strong recommendation was not made because only 2/5 of the predefined critical/important outcomes were addressed by the evidence and in favor of Apligraf \u00ae for DFU. Coverage is recommended only when other conditions exist for wound healing (see Other Considerations section, below). Recommendation: Apligraf \u00ae is recommended for coverage for diabetic foot ulcers and venous leg ulcers (weak recommendation) when conditions necessary for wound healing are present. Payers may wish to consider bundled payment, reference pricing, or other effective alternatives for s maller ulcers, as this product is sold in units of 44 cm2 and has a short shelf life, wh ich may lead to waste. 6 Skin substitutes for chronic skin ulcers DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 Dermagraft\u00ae Coverage question: Should Dermagraft\u00ae be rec ommended for coverage for treatment of chronic skin ulcers ? Outcomes Estimate of Effect for Outcome/ Confidence in Estimate Resource allocation Deep soft tissue or bone infection (Critical outcome) DFU : Osteomyelitis incidence 8.6% in both intervention and control groups (very low certainty of no benefit, based on one fair quali ty RCT) Incremental cost for adding Dermagraft\u00ae to a patient's course of treatment for a small leg ulcer (<25 cm2) under Medicare FFS (using average national prices for October, 2015 ) would range from $771.20 for a single application in an ambulatory surge ry center to $ 11,960.80 for eight applications in the hospital outpatient setting . Up to 4 applications total appears equivalent efficacy to 8 applications. Product is sold in 37.5 cm2 sheets. Complete wound healing (Critical outcome) DFU : OR 1.64 (95% CI, 1.10 to 2.43) in pooled data from 3 fair quality RCTs ; one poor quality RCT with 38.5% versus 31.7% (p = 0.138) (low certainty of benefit, based on three fair quality concordant RCTs and one poor quality discordant RCT) DFU : (Derma graft \u00ae vs OASIS \u00ae Wound Matrix ): 84.6% vs 76.9%, p = 0.62 (very low certainty of no comparative benefit, based on one fair quality RCT) VLU: RR 1.83 (95% 3.04 (95%, CI 0.95 to 9.68) (very low certainty of no benefit, based on two fair quality RCTs) Quality of life (Critical outcome) No evidence identified. Time to complete wound healing (Important outcome) DFU : 13 weeks vs 28 weeks(statistical analysis not reported) (low certainty of benefit, based on four poor to fair quality RCTs) 7 Skin substitutes for chronic skin ulcers DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 Coverage question: Should Dermagraft\u00ae be rec ommended for coverage for treatment of chronic skin ulcers ? Outcomes Estimate of Effect for Outcome/ Confidence in Estimate Resource allocation DFU (Dermagraft \u00ae vs OASIS \u00ae Wound Matrix ): 40.90 vs 35.67 days, p = 0.73 (very low certainty of no comparative benefit, based on one fair quality RCT) VLU: 35 weeks vs 74 weeks, (statistical analysis not reported) (very low certainty of benefit, based on one fair quality RCT) Adverse effects (Important outcome) DFU : 19% vs 32%, p = 0.007; second RCT no difference in rates of AE. (very low certainty of benefit, based on two fair quality RCTs) VLU: Similar number of A Es in all groups, statistical analysis not reported (very low certainty of no harm, based on one fair quality RCT) Rationale: Dermagraft \u00ae is recommended for coverage for diabetic foot ulcers based on evidence of reduced time to wound healing and a higher likelihood of complete wound healing than usual care, with low variability in patient values and preferences. The recommendat ion is weak because of the low certainty of the evidence, and relatively high cost. Dermagraft \u00ae is not recommended for coverage for venous leg ulcers based on insufficient evidence of benefit for any critical or important outcome and lack of FDA approval for this indic ation . Recommendation : Dermagraft \u00ae is not recommended for coverage for venous leg ulcers (weak recommendation ) Dermagraft \u00ae is recommended for coverage for diabetic foot ulcers (weak recommendation) when conditions necessary for wound healing are present. Payers may wish to consider bundled payment, reference pricing, or other effective alternatives for smaller ulcers, as this p roduct is sold in units of 37.5 cm2 and has a short shelf life, which may lead to waste. 8 Skin substitutes for chronic skin ulcers DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 OASIS\u00ae Wound Matrix /Ultra Tri OASIS\u00ae Wound Matrix /Ultra Tri-Layer Matrix be rec ommended for coverage for treatment of chronic skin ulcers ? Outcomes Estimate of Effect for Outcome/ Confidence in Estimate Resource allocation Deep soft tissue or bone infection (Critical outcome) No evidence identified. Incremental cost for adding OASIS \u00ae Wound Matrix to a patient's course of treatment for a small leg ulcer (<25 cm2) under Medicare FFS (using average national prices for October, 2015) would be $235.69 f or a single application in an ambulatory surgery center. In a physician's office, the cost would be $10.72 per cm2 plus physician's fees of $143.73. The manufacturer recommends re - application every three to seven days as needed. Product is sold in units of varying sizes, the smallest of which is 10.5 cm2. One study of DFU showed an average of 10 sheets. One study of VLU reported an average of 8 sheets. Study showed equivalence of 8 sheets of Oasis \u00ae Wound Matrix to 3 sheets of Dermagraft \u00ae for DFU . One Medicare LCD limits to 12 weeks of therapy. Complete wound healing (Critical outcome) DFU: 49% vs 28% (p = 0.06) at 12 weeks (OASIS Wound Matrix) ; 54% vs 32% (p=0.021) at 12 weeks (OASIS \u00ae Ultra Tri-Layer Matrix) (low certainty of benefit , based on two fair quality RCTs ) DFU : \u00ae Wound 76.9% vs 84.6%, p = 0.62 (very low certainty of no comparative benefit, based on one fair quality RCT) VLU: 80% vs 65% at 8 weeks (p < 0.05); 83% vs 46% at 16 weeks (p < 0.001); 55% vs 34% at 12 weeks, (p = 0.02) (OASIS \u00ae Wound Matrix) (low certainty of benefit , based on three fair to good quality RCTs with inconsistency in comparator groups ) Quality of life (Critical outcome) No evidence identified.

Outcomes Estimate of Effect for Outcome/ Confidence in Estimate Deep soft tissue or bone infection (Critical outcome) DFU : (TheraSkin \u00ae vs Apligraf \u00ae): One amputation for infection, compared to none with Apligraf \u00ae (very low certainty of no comparative benefit, based on one RCT of fair quality) Complete wound healing (Critical outcome) DFU : (TheraSkin \u00ae vs Apligraf \u00ae): 66.7% vs 41.3% (p = 0.21) (very low certainty of no comparative benefit, based on one RCT of fair quality) Quality of life (Critical outcome) No evidence identified. Time to complete wound healing (Important outcome) No evidence identified. Adverse effects (Important outcome) No evidence identified. Rationale: TheraSkin \u00ae is not recommended for coverage because of insufficient evidence of benefit (limited evidence suggesting it is comparable to another effective product), a lack of strong patient preferences for this, alternatives available, and its cost. Recommendation: TheraSkin \u00ae is not recommended for coverage for chronic skin ulcers (weak recommendation ). 16 Skin substitutes for chronic skin ulcers DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 EVIDENCE OVERVIEW Clinical background Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) , venous leg ulcers (VLUs), and decubitus ulcers can be serious wounds, leading to severe health outcomes such as amputations and death. Diabetic foot ulcers are the result of atherosclerosis that impedes blood flow to the extremities and peripheral neuropa thy that reduces the ability to sense injuries from extended pressure or other causes. Diabetic foot ulcers can lead to infections such as osteomyelitis and amputation. Appropriate treatment of these wounds can minimize the negative health outcomes and imp rove patient quality of life. Treatment for diabetic foot ulcers include cleaning, dressing, debridement, and pressure relief ( Wound, Ostomy , and Continence Nurses Society, 2012) . During the past 20 years, the prevalence of diabetes among adults in Oregon has more than doubled, to 9% in 2011. Among adults covered by the Oregon Health Plan, 17% have diabetes (Oregon Heart Disease and Stroke a nd Diabetes Prevention Programs, 2013 ). The annual incidence of foot ulcers among Medicare patients with diabetes is 6% (Margolis et al ., 2011). Venous leg ulcers are caused by chronic venous insufficiency. Treatment for venous leg ulcers include cleaning and dressing the wound, hemodynamic support to control the underlying disorder that caused the ulcer (e.g., medicatio n or vascular bypass procedures) , compression bandages, and compression stockings. The lifetime incidence of venous leg ulcers is about Ovington , 2008). Decubitus ulcers or pressure ulcers (commonly called bed sores or pressure ulc ers) occur when patients are unable to reposition themselves, most commonly in hospitals, long -term care facilities, and at home. Sustained pressure on a specific part of the body (often a bony prominence such as hip or sacrum ) for long periods of time can cause a pressure ulcer. Treatment includes removing the pressure from the affected area, skin protection, debridement of necrotic tissues, cleaning, and dressing. Data from the National Nursing Home Survey indicate that 11% of nursing home residents had p ressure ulcers (Park - Lee & Caffrey, 2009). Skin substitutes have been used to treat ulcers that do not heal with the standard treatments. The most common use for skin substitutes is for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg ulcers, and decubitu s ulcers. The etymologies of these ulcers make the wounds slower to heal, and the usual wound treatments are not always sufficient to ensure complete healing. Indications Skin substitutes are indicated for the treatment of chronic wounds, usually defined a s having not healed within 30 days, having not responded to initial treatment, or persisting despite appropriate care. Skin substitutes were originally designed to treat burns, but now the most common usage is treating diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg ulce rs, and decubitus ulcers. 17 Skin substitutes for chronic skin ulcers DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 Technology description Skin substitutes promote healing and wound closure by mimicking or substituting for the skin structure. The skin substitute is designed to help the healing process by stimulating the host to regenerate lo st tissue and replace the wound with functional skin. Skin substitutes can be categorized (Snyder, Sullivan, & Schoelles, 2012) based upon how they are derived or produced: Products derived from human donor tissue Products derived from living human or anim al tissues and cells Acellular animal -derived products Biosynthetic products Currently, there are over 73 skin substitute products approved by the FDA for use in humans. While skin substitute products can be broadly grouped according to their source materials, the products are all sufficiently unique as to make generalization of efficacy across categories impracticable. Table 1 shows skin substitute products available in the United States, categorized by how the product is derived and thus regulated by the FDA. This list of skin substitutes was created from the evidence and policy sources, and may not be complete. Products in the same category may not be equivalent in ter ms of effectiveness (Snyder, Sullivan, & Schoelles, 2012). Human -derived skin substitute products that are minimally processed are regulated by the FDA as human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue -based products (HCT/Ps). With HCT/Ps , tissue is obtained from human donors then processed and used in the same role in the patien t (e.g., skin for skin, tendon for tendon ). These HCT/Ps are regulated as human tissue intended for transpla ntation as long as the processing and clinical use are consistent w ith \"Minimal Manipulation\" and \"Homologous Use\" as defined in 21 CFR 1271. Products regulated as HCT/Ps must be register ed with the FDA but are not required to demonstrate safety or effectiveness. Cellular -derived material for wound healing cultured from h uman -derived tissues are regulated using the Biologics License Application (under the Federal Public Health Service Act) or with premarket approval (PMA) or as a Humanitarian Use Device obtained through a humanitarian device exemption depending on their co mposition and primary mode of action. The application for p roduct s regulated under the PMA process must include scientifically valid clinical studies demonstrating that the product is effective and safe. Acellular animal -derived products and synthetic prod ucts are regulated under Section 510(k) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act . This requires a premarket submission to the FDA to demonstrate that the device is substantially equivalent, i.e., at least as safe and effective, to a legally marketed device that is not subject to PMA. Submitters can compare their device to a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 or a device which has been previously found to be substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process (Snyder, Sullivan, & Schoelles, 201 2). 18 Skin substitutes for chronic skin ulcers DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 Table 1: Skin Substitutes Products derived from human donor tissue, minimally processed Products derived from living human and/or animal tissue Acellular animal - derived products Biosynthetic products Dressing Aongen Collagen Matrix Atlas Wound Matrix Avagen Wound Dressing Biobrane\u00ae Collagen Sponge (Innocoll) Collagen \u00ae chronic skin ulcers DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 Products derived from human donor tissue, minimally processed Products derived from living human and/or animal tissue Acellular animal - derived products Biosynthetic products Integra Micromatrix\u00ae Matristem\u00ae Burn Matrix MatriStem\u00ae Wound Matrix Matrix Collagen Wound Dressing Medline Collagen Wound Dressing OASIS Burn Matrix OASIS \u00ae Wound Matrix OASIS \u00ae Ultra Tri -Layer Matrix Primatrix Primatrix Dermal Repair Scaffold Collagen TheraPorm Standard/Sheet Unite\u00ae Biomatrix Unite Biomatrix The following skin substitute products may not be available for chronic wounds in the substitutes for chronic skin ulcers DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 Key Questions and Outcomes The following key questions (KQ) guided the evidence search and review described below. For additional details about the review scope a nd methods please see Appendix D . 1. What is comparative effectiveness of different types of skin substitutes compared with wound care al ternatives for individuals with chronic skin ulcers? Include consideration of: a. Age b. Body mass index (BMI) c. Comorbidities d. Site of ulcer e. Ulcer etiology (e.g. , infectious, pressure or circulatory). f. Wound severity g. Prior need for skin substitute h. Failure of prior therapies 2. What adverse events are associated with skin substitutes? 3. What are contraindications to the use of skin substitutes? Critical outcomes selected for inclusion in the GRADE table : deep soft tissue or bone infection, complete wound healing, and qu ality of life . Important outcomes selected f or inclusion in the GRADE table: time to complete wound healing and adverse effects . Evidence over view Four systematic reviews and two additional RCTs address the use of skin substitutes for chronic skin ulcers ; they are summarized in Tables 2 and 3. The outcomes considered critical for purposes of this coverage guidance are deep soft tissue or bone infection, complete wound healing, and quality of life . Time to complete wound healing and adverse effects are consi dered important outcomes . Complete wound healing is generally defined as \"full epithelialization with no drainage, no exudate or eschar (scab) present\" (Snyder, Sullivan , & Schoelles, 2012, p. 48). Although some products may have similar components or subs trates, \"[t]he results obtained from studies of a single product [...] cannot be extrapolated to all products in a group because of differences in product components and healing properties\" ( Snyder , Sullivan , & Schoelles, 2012, p. 48). Therefore, the results are organized by product type below. Results are also separated by indication (diabetic foot ulcer or venous leg ulcer ; the search did not identify any evidence for skin substitutes in the treatment of decubitus ulcers ). Effectiveness for one type of woun d cannot be extrapolated across indications \"because of the difference in etiology and pathophysiology\" between different types of wounds (Snyder, Sullivan , & Schoelles, 2012, p. 56). 21 Skin substitutes for chronic skin ulcers DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 One limitation of the body of evidence is a lack of standardization of comparators. Some trials compare one skin substitute versus another, but many use \"usual care\" in the control group. Some treatments that fall into the category of usual care can includ e (but are not limited to): Diabetic Foot Ulcers - usual care techniques: o Nonadherent gauze dressing (Mepitel \u00ae), covered with a secondary dressing including saline -moistened gauze and dry gauze o Saline -moistened, nonadherent gauze (Te gapore \u00ae) covered with a layer of saline - moistened gauze followed by dry gau ze and petrolatum gauze layer o Nonadherent interface + saline moistened gauze o Saline moistened gauze Leg Ulcers - usual care techniques: o Tegapore \u00ae (gau ze bolster), zinc oxide -impregnanted, past e bandage (Unna boot), and self-adherent elastic wrap o Multilayered compression therapy The body of evidence is also limited in the evidence addressing the considerations in Key Question 1. Where possible, discussion of study inclusion/exclusion criteria are presented. Table 2 .

Of the 18 studies, eight were assessed as a low risk of bias, nine as a moderate risk of bias, and one with an unclear risk of bias. The review authors limited study inclusion to RCTs that had a minimum of 10 patients per treatment arm. In addition to the outcomes described in Table 1, the AHRQ review evaluated wound recurrence, need for amputation, need for hos pitalization, return to baseline activities of daily living and function, pain reduction, and exudate and odor reduction. 24 Skin substitutes for chronic skin ulcers DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 Felder (2012) The systematic review by Felder, Goyal, and Attinger (2012) included 15 RCTs and one prospective cohort study as well a s five systematic reviews . This SR was concerned with chronic foot ulcers of any origin. There is significant overlap in included studies (nine RCTS) between the AHRQ SR (Snyder, Sullivan, & Schoelles, 2012) and this SR. Felder and colleagues (2012) includ ed five additional studies (3 DFU, 1 VLU, 1 non -healing foot ulcer) that were not included in the AHRQ review (S nyder, Sullivan, & Schoelles, 2012 ). Of these five, one was assessed at low risk of bias, one at moderate risk of bias, and three at high risk o f bias. Rate of complete wound healing was the primary outcome; secondary outcomes included time to complete wound healing, infection rates, and ulcer recurrence. Jones [Cochrane] (2013) The Jones systematic review ( Jones, Nelson, & Al-Hity, 2013) focused on the treatment of VLUs and included five RCTs on the use of skin substitutes, two of which overla p with the AHRQ review (S nyder , Sullivan, & Schoelles, 2012). Of the remaining three studies, one is rated as unclear risk of bias, one at low risk of bias, and one at moderate risk of bias. Authors included any randomized study, regardless of publication status or language, in which skin grafts or skin replacements for venous leg ulcers were compared against any other intervention (only studies involving skin substitutes are summarized in this coverage guidance), and which reported on the primary outcomes of wound healing, time to complete healing, or absolute rate of change of ulcer area. Game (2015) A systematic review by Game and colleagues ( 2015) assessed the effectiveness of various interventions for diabetic foot ulcers. This is the second update of a systematic review undertaken by the International Working Group of the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) in 2006 and first updated in June 2010. Game and colleagues (2015) included all controlled studies, both prospective and retrospective, that evaluated treatment of chronic foot ulcers in adults (age 18 and older) with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Primary outcomes were healing, time to healing, and reducti on in wound area. The 2015 review included 11 RCTs relevant to skin substitutes; all but three of them overlap with the other SRs included in this report. Of those three, one was rated at medium risk of bias and the others at high risk of bias. Apligraf\u00ae/Graftskin\u00ae Apligraf\u00ae, known previously as Graftskin \u00ae, is a \"living cell based bilayered skin substitute derived from bovine type 1 collagen and human fibroblasts and keratinocytes derived from neonatal fo reskins\" (Snyder, Sullivan, & Schoelles, 2012, pg 38). The FDA has approved Apligraf\u00ae For use with standard therapeutic compression for the treatment of non -infected partial and full -thickness skin ulcers due to venous insufficiency of greater than 1 month duration and which have not adequately responded to conventional ulcer therapy. Apligraf \u00ae is also indicated for use with standard diabetic foot ulcer care for the treatment of full -thickness neuropathic diabetic foot ulcers of greater than three weeks' 25 Skin substitutes for chronic skin ulcers DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 duration which have not adequa tely responded to conventional ulcer therapy and which extend through the dermis but without tendon, muscle, capsule , or bone exposure. Apligraf \u00ae is contraindicated for use on clinically infected wounds. Apligraf \u00ae is contraindicated in patients with known allergies to bovine collagen. Apligraf \u00ae is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to the components of the Apligraf \u00ae agarose shipping medium.\" of non -infected partial and full -thickness skin ulcers due to venous insufficiency of greater than 1 month duration and which have not adequately responded to conventional ulcer therapy. Apligraf \u00ae is also indicated for use with standard diabetic foot ulcer care for the treatment of full -thickness neuropath ic diabetic foot ulcers of greater than three weeks' duration which have not adequately responded to conventional ulcer therapy and which extend through the dermis but without tendon, muscle, capsule or bone exposure (Snyder, Sullivan, & Schoelles, 2012, pg 38). The prescribing information contains a caution; \"The safety and effectiveness of Apligraf \u00ae have not been established for patients receiving greater than 5 device applications.\" Inclusion criteria for trials of Apligraf\u00ae varied in the size and sever ity of wounds. Minimum duration was 2 -4 weeks . Patients were excluded for conditions that would impair wound healing such as poor glycemic control (identified in one trial as hemoglobin A1c 12), active infection, immunocompromise (either from underlying d isease, radiation, chemotherapy, or recent corticosteroid use), evidence of skin cancer at or near the wound, renal or hepatic impairment, drug or alcohol abuse, and Charcot foot or inability to offload the ulcer. Some studies excluded patients whose ulcer s responded to usual care in a 7 -14 day run -in period. The majority of patients were male and in their 50s or 60s. Three early studies (Sabolinski, 1996; Falanga, 1998; Falanga & Sabolinski, 1999) all used the same protocol of up to five applications with in the first 21 days of treatment. Ulcers were re - examined every few days and if less than 50% of the previous application \"took,\" researchers applied the product again, up to five times in total. The earliest study reported that 70% of patients got 1 -3 grafts; the others did not report how many applications were required. A 2009 study re -examined patients at 4 and 8 weeks after initial application and re -applied as necessary. \"In the Apligraf \u00ae group, 13 of the 33 subjects required only 1 application of Apl igraf \u00ae, and 15 and 5 subjects received 2 or 3 applications, respectively. On average, subjects received 1.8 Apligraf \u00ae applications during the course of the study\" (Edmonds, 2009, pg. 14). The comparative study of Apligraf \u00ae vs TheraSkin \u00ae (DiDomenico, 2011) put no limits on the number of applications and allowed them at clinician discretion, they report an average of 1.53 applications (SD = 1.65). Chang, 2000 used only a single application for all subjects, and reported on costs thusly: At our institution, professional fee reimbursement for all skin graft procedures averages $1 350. A single 7 -inch disk of Apligraf \u00ae costs $1000 to the third -party insurer or the patient. The reimbursement for a 3 - to 5-day hospital stay, including operating room and recovery room 26 Skin substitutes for chronic skin ulcers DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 costs, average $8000 -$11,000 for a Medicare patient. Therefore, Apligraf \u00ae application in these patients costs $7000 to $10,000 less that an autologous skin graft. Moreover, further cost reductions may be possible as demand for this product increases. Finally, wound closure yields may further be improved with multiple applications of TESG and as the optimal dressing and management of TESG -treated wounds in this patient population become better defined (Chang, 2000, pg. 49). Critical Outcome : Deep Soft T issue or Bone Infection The AHRQ review ( Snyder, Sullivan, & Schoelles, 2012) included one trial that reported cases of osteomyelitis in patients with DFUs treated with either Apligraf\u00ae /Graftskin \u00ae or usual care. The RCT compared Apligraf\u00ae to saline -moistened gauze (treatment group, n = 112; usual care group, n = 96). There was a significantly low er incidence of osteomyelitis in the Apligraf \u00ae group compared to usual care (2.7% vs 10.4%, p = 0.04). For VLUs, the AHRQ review included a singl e RCT comparing Apligraf\u00ae to compression therapy (treatment group, n = 161; usual care group, n = 136) that reported incidence of osteomyelitis. Approximately eight percent of patients receiving Apligraf\u00ae developed osteomyelitis at the study si te, compared with no patients in the comparison group developing a bone infection (no statistical analysis conducted). Critical Outcome : Complete Wound Healing Snyder and colleagues (2012) included three RCTs comparing Apligraf\u00ae to usual care. Two of the trials includ ed patients with DFUs (total n = 280) and the third trial focused on VLUs (n = 275). The AHRQ review ( Snyder, Sullivan, & Schoelles, 2012 ) found the use of Apligraf\u00ae was associated with significantly greater percentage of wound closures compared to usual c are for patients with DFUs at 12 weeks (Trial 1, n=72, 52% vs 26%, p=0.03, relative risk n=208, 56% vs 38%, p=0.01, relative risk 1.5, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.04) and patients with VLUs at 12 weeks (53% vs 22%, p<0.001, relativ e risk 2.38, 95% CI 1.67 to 3.39). Felder and colleagues (2012) included two additional RCTs comparing Apligraf\u00ae to usual care . The first was a subgroup analysis of a larger study which looked at 120 patients whose ulcers had been present for at least one year, comparing Apligraf\u00ae to multilayer compression wrap. In this hard -to-heal subgroup, complete healing occurred by six months in 47% of subjects receiving Apligraf\u00ae versus 19% of the control subjects. The second study included by Felder (2012) compared Apligraf\u00ae against saline gauze dressing in patients with chronic foot ulcers of any etiology who had undergone limb revascularization within 60 days. Complete closure by six months occurred in 100% of Apligraf\u00ae patients, compared to 75% of usual care pati ents (p < 0.01). Apligraf\u00ae vs TheraSkin\u00ae One RCT included in the AHRQ review (Snyder, Sullivan, & Schoelles, 2012) evaluated the comparative effectiveness of Apligraf\u00ae and TheraSkin \u00ae for DFUs (n = 28). Average wound size was similar between groups. There were no significant differences reported in complete wound closure between the two products ( Apligraf\u00ae 41% vs TheraSkin \u00ae 67%, p=0.21). 27 Skin substitutes for chronic skin ulcers DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 Critical Outcome: Quality of Life No SRs or RCTs reported on the effect of Apligraf\u00ae on validated quality of life indica tors. One RCT included in the AHRQ review reported on pain, noting that it improved significantly in both Apligraf\u00ae and control groups ( Snyder, Sullivan, & Schoelles, 2012). Important Outcome: Time to Complete Wound Healing Snyder and colleagues (2012) in cluded one RCT that report ed on the time to complete wound healing in the use of Apligraf\u00ae for VLU. In the single RCT, patients who received Apligraf\u00ae experienced shorted median time to wound closur e (61 days) compared with usual care (i.e., Unna boot) (19 1 days). Felder and colleagues (2012) included one RCT of patients with chronic foot ulcers who had recently (60 days) undergone limb revascularization, which found mean time to healing with Apligraf\u00ae was seven weeks, compared to 15 weeks in the group trea ted with saline -gauze dressing (p = 0.0021). Important Outcome: Adverse Effects The AHRQ review (Snyder, Sullivan, & Schoelles, 2012) included four studies that reported on adverse effects from Apligraf\u00ae for a total of 332 patients treated with the product and 283 patients treated with usual care. Two RCTs (N = 28 and N = 72) reported only \"serious adverse events\" in the treatment and follow -up phases, and these were roughly equivalent (3 -5 patients in each group). One trial only reported on osteomyelitis, which is discussed above. In the fourth RCT (N = 297) , there were ) in the Apligraf\u00ae group compared to usual care. Although not explicitly stated as a critical outcome, one trial reported on the incidence of death. Six cases of death reported in the Apligraf\u00ae group compared with five cases in the usual care group (reasons not described); there were no other deaths reported across the three other trials. Felder and colleagues (2012) included one additional study (a subgroup of a previous study, separating out 12 0 patients with hard -to-heal venous ulcers present longer than one year) that reported infection rates of 8.2% in the Apligraf\u00ae treatment group (n = 72) versus 7.8% in the usual care control group (n = 48). In addition to the adverse effects described abo ve, trials also reported relatively rare incidence of rashes, pain, urinary tract infection, pain, dyspnea, congestive heart failure, accidental injury, pharyngitis, asthenia, arrhythmia, cough, scaffold. The fibroblasts are obtained from human newborn foreskin tissue \" (Snyder, Sullivan, & Schoelles, 2012, pg 38) . It is indicated by t he FDA [f]or use in the treatment of full -thickness diabetic foot ulcers greater than six weeks' duration which extend through the dermis, but without tendon muscle, joint capsule or bone exposure. Dermagraft\u00ae should be used in conjunction with standard w ound care regimens and in patients that have adequate blood supply to the involved foot. 28 Skin substitutes for chronic skin ulcers DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 Dermagraft \u00ae is contraindicated for use in ulcers that have signs of clinical infection or in ulcers with sinus tracts. Dermagraft \u00ae is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to bovine products, as it may contain trace amounts of bovine proteins from the manufactur ing medium and storag e solution (Snyder, Sullivan, & Schoelles, 2012, pg 38). The FDA prescribing information contains a caution than Dermagra ft\u00ae has not been studied in patients receiving greater than 8 device applications. Trials of Dermagraft\u00ae included patients with adequate glycemic control and evidence of adequate circulation as measured by ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI). Patients we re excluded for evidence of active infection, impaired mobility, and significant comorbidities such as HIV, severe peripheral vascular disease, or a bleeding disorder. Patients were also generally excluded if their ulcers responded to usual care during a r un-in or screening period. Average age ranged from 55 to 72 years. Application regimens for Dermagraft \u00ae are diverse in the literature. Earlier trials involved weekly applications for up to 7 or 8 treatments (Gentzkow, 1996; Naughton, 1997; Marston, 2003). A study in 2003 divided patients into three different treatment arms; weekly applications for up to 12 weeks and a total of four applications at 0, 1, 4, and 8 weeks had identical efficacy (5/13 wounds healed). The most recent trial in this report (Omar, 2004) used this same 0, 1, 4, and 8 protocol and had a similar result (5/10 ulcers healed). Critical Out come : Deep Soft Tissue or Bone Infection The AHRQ review (Snyder, Sullivan, & Schoelles, 2012) identified one RCT comparing Dermagraft\u00ae to saline -moistened gauze in the treatment of DFU that reported on incidence of osteomyelitis. Rates were 8.6% in both t he intervention and the control groups. Critical Outcome : Complete Wound Healing Snyder and colleagues (2012) included three RCTs that reported on complete wound healing in the use of Dermagraft\u00ae for DFUs. All three RCTs on DFUs found that patients receiv ing Dermagraft\u00ae experienced greater rates of complete wound healing compared to usual care at 12 weeks. A meta -analysis found Dermagraft \u00ae to be more effective for achieving wound closure compared to usual care (saline - moistened gauze) for patients with DFU s (odds ratio 1.64; 95% CI 1.10 to 2.43). Felder and colleagues (2012) identified one additional RCT of Dermagraft\u00ae in care of DFUs, in which the metabolic activity of the graft was assessed and patients in the treatment arm were stratified by whether or not the Dermagraft\u00ae was \"metabolically active within the therapeutic range\" (Felder, 2012, p. 150). At twelve weeks, the rate of complete healing was 38.5% in the entire treatment group and 31.7% in the control group (p = 0.138), but was 50.8% in the \"meta bolically active\" Dermagraft\u00ae group. Snyder and colleagues (2012) identified one RCT that included patients with VLUs , which found greater rates of complete wound healing in the Dermagraft\u00ae group at 12 weeks, although this finding was not statistically si gnificant (28% vs 15%, p=0.30, relative risk 1.83, 95% CI 0.47 to 7.21). 29 Skin substitutes for chronic skin ulcers DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 Jones and colleagues (2013) identified one additional RCT of Dermagraft\u00ae versus usual care in VLUs that used a four -piece protocol. They pooled this data with the results of the afore mentioned RCT and found that \"There was no evidence of overall benefit associated with four pieces of dermal skin replacement (at baseline, one, four and eight weeks) in the two studies (RR 3.04, 95% CI 0.95 to 9.68), when pooled using a fixed -effect model (44 participants)\" (Jones, Nelson, and Al -Hity, 2013, p. 10). Dermagraft\u00ae vs OASIS\u00ae Wound Matrix One RCT included in the A HRQ review (Snyder, Sullivan, & Schoelles, 2012) evaluated the comparative effectiveness of Dermagraft\u00ae and OASIS\u00ae Wound Matrix for DFUs (n = 26). Average wound size was similar between groups (p = 0.94). There were no significant differences reported in complete wound closure between the two products (Dermagraft \u00ae 84.6% vs OASIS\u00ae Wound Matrix 76.9%, p = 0.62). Critical Outcome: Quality of Life No SRs or RCTs reported on the effect of Dermagraft\u00ae on validated quality of life indicators or surrogate measures . Important Outcome: Time to Complete Wound Healing Felder and colleagues (2012) identified four RCTs that reported on time to complete healing for DFUs treated with Dermagraft\u00ae. In all four trials, generally speaking, healing was faster in the Dermagraft\u00ae group than in the control. A fair quality small RCT testing three different Dermagraft\u00ae regimens against usual care (N=50) found that weekly application of Dermagraft\u00ae resulted in mean time to healing of 12 weeks, while less frequent applications and usual care led to heali ng times greater than 12 weeks. A second, fair quality RCT (N=235) assessed the metabolic activity of the Dermagraft\u00ae product prior to application and found an improvement in healing time (13 weeks vs 28 weeks) only when the product was \"metabolically active within the therapeutic range\" (Felder, Goyal, & Attinger, 2012, p. 150). A poor quality RCT (N=281) published the same year had identical results (13 weeks vs 28 weeks), while the final RCT in this review (also poor quality , N=245 ) demonstrated that time to healing was significantly faster with Dermagraft \u00ae than with control (p = 0.04) Similarly, the one RCT included in the AHRQ review (Snyder, Sullivan, & Schoelles, 2012) on the use of Dermagraft\u00ae for patient with VLUs found shorter wound closure time in the Dermagraft \u00ae group compared with usual care (35 weeks vs 74 weeks). Dermagraft\u00ae vs OASIS\u00ae Wound Matrix One RCT included in the A HRQ review (Snyder, Sullivan, & Schoelles, 2012) evaluated the comparative effectiveness of Dermagraft\u00ae and OASIS\u00ae Wound Matrix for DFUs (n = 26). There were no significant differences reported in time to complete wound closure between the two products (Dermagraft \u00ae 40.90 days, p = 0.73). Important Outcome: Adverse Effects Two trial s identified by Felder and colleagues (2012) reported on adverse effects with Dermagraft\u00ae . One trial (n = 314) found that compared to usual care (saline -moistened gauze), patients who received Dermagraft\u00ae had lower rates of adverse effects (i.e., infection , osteo and cellulitis) (19% vs 32%, 30 Skin substitutes for chronic skin ulcers DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 p=0.007). In the second trial, patients in the Dermagraft\u00ae groups had similar rates of adverse events (undefined, statistical significance not reported in the AHRQ review). Unrelated AEs in this study (N = 53) included syncope, skin excoriation, bleeding from biopsy site, latex allergy, development of bullous pemphigoid, and cerebrovascular accident. The AHRQ review (Snyder , Sullivan, & Schoelles , 2012) reported adverse events from one fair quality RCT (N=53) of Dermagr aft\u00ae in treatment of VLUs. With 13 -14 subjects in each treatment group, total number of adverse events was 15 -18 per group, Serious adverse events were not reported in the control group; the three treatment groups each had at least one serious adverse even t, with four serious events in the most intensive treatment arm. EpiFix\u00ae EpiFix\u00ae is derived from human amniotic membrane and is marketed both in a skin allograft form as well as an injectable form. It does not presently have any FDA indications . This evi dence review identified one small , poor quality, open -label RCT of EpiFix\u00ae for DFU (Zelen et al ., 2013) . This study was also highlighted in the second public comment period. This trial randomized 25 patients with DFUs between 1 cm2 and 25 cm2 present for at least four weeks to receive EpiFix\u00ae or standard care. There were several limitations to this trial including: This was a very small, single -center study with 13 patients in the treatment group and 12 patients in the control group. There is no description of allocation concealment. There were baseline differences in wound size between the two groups (2.6 cm 2 in the EpiFix \u00ae group and 3.4 cm 2 in the standard care group. There were also differences between the groups with respect to mean body m ass index (30 kg/m2 in the EpiFix \u00ae group and 35.4 kg/m2 in the standard care group. Additionally, baseline information on smoking and glycemic control were not provided. Dressing changes for the EpiFix \u00ae group were performed by clinicians every two weeks, while the daily dressing changes in the standard care group were performed by patients or their caregivers. The outcome assessor was unblinded. Conclusions about comparative effectiveness for sustained wound healing beyond six weeks cannot be made because all but two of the 12 patients in the standard care group exited the trial at 6 weeks to pursue other treatments. A second poor quality RCT (Zelen et al ., 2015) of EpiFix \u00ae compared to Apligraf or standard care was identified during the second public comme nt period. This trial randomized 60 patients with DFU to EpiFix \u00ae, Apligraf \u00ae, or standard care. There were several limitations to this trial including: There were baseline differences in the three groups with respect to: o Mean wound size (2.6 cm2 in the Apligraf \u00ae group, 2.7 cm2 in the EpiFix \u00ae group, 3.3 cm2 in the standard care group) 31 Skin substitutes for chronic skin ulcers DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 o Mean wound duration (129 days in the Apligraf \u00ae group, 109 days in the EpiFix \u00ae group, 113 days in the standard care group) o Percentage of patients with HbA1c>9 (30% in the Apl EpiFix \u00ae group, 25% in the standard care group) The primary outcome of complete wound closure at 4 and 6 weeks was assessed by an unblinded primary investigator. There are potential differences in the treatments and follow -up betwee n groups. In the Apligraf \u00ae and EpiFix \u00ae groups, the products were applied weekly by study investigators. In the standard care group, daily dressing changes were done by the patients. Debridement was carried out in each group \"as necessary.\" Conclusions abou t comparative effectiveness for sustained wound healing beyond six weeks cannot be made because more than half (11/20) patients in the standard group exited the trial at 6 weeks. Both trials were funded by the maker of EpiFix. Critical Outcome: Deep Soft Tissue or Bone Infection No SRs or RCTs reported on the effect of EpiFix\u00ae on deep soft tissue or bone infection. Critical Outcome: Complete Wound Healing Zelen et al ., 2013 reported complete wound healing at 6 weeks of 92% in the EpiFix \u00ae group and 8% in the standard care group (p<0.0001). Game and colleagues (2015) noted in their review that this repr esents an unexpectedly low rate of healing in the control group. Zelen et al ., 2015 reported complete wound healing at 6 weeks of 95% in th e EpiFix \u00ae group compared to 45% in the Apligraf \u00ae group (p = 0.0006) and 35% in the standard care group (p = 0.0001) . Critical Outcome: Quality of Life No SRs or RCTs reported on the effect of EpiFix\u00ae on validated quality of life indicators or surrogate measures. Important Outcome: Time to Complete Wound Healing Zelen et al ., 2013 reported mean time to complete healing of 5 weeks in the control group and 2.5 weeks in the EpiFix \u00ae group. No test of statistical significance was reported. Zelen et al ., 2015 rep orted median wound healing time of 13 days in the Epi Fix\u00ae group compared to 49 days in both the Apligraf \u00ae and standard care groups (p<0.0001). Important Outcome: Adverse Effects Zelen et al ., 2013 reported four adverse events in the standard care group (2 cases of cellulitis, one gastrointestinal bleed, and one acute pyelonephritis; t here was one case of pneumonia in the Epi Fix\u00ae group. No test of statistical significance was reported. Zelen et al ., 2015 reported five adverse events. There was one celluliti s of the study foot in the EpiFix \u00ae group (of note, this patient was withdrawn from the study) . There was one urinary tract infection and one cellulitis of the non -study foot in the Apligraf \u00ae group. There were two cases of cellulitis (one study 32 Skin substitutes for chronic skin ulcers DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 foot and one non-study foot) in the standard care group (of note, both of these patients remained in the study). No test of statistical significance was bilayer matrix that was approved by the FDA for use in DFU in January 2016. This evidence review identified one RCT of fair quality (Driver, 2015). This multicenter trial randomized 307 patients with DFU to standard wound care or IDRT afte r a 14 -day run -in period to exclude wounds that were healing well (>30% epithelialization) with standard care. There were several limitations to this RCT including: The treatment and control groups were generally similar at baseline, but the median age of ulcers in the control group was greater (152 days vs 126 days in the Omnigraft \u00ae group) and there were small differences in the location of wounds between the two groups. While computerized planimetry was used for in assessing the time to complete wound closure, the primary endpoint of complete closure was assessed by an unblinded study investigator during the treatment phase. There was both high overall attrition (39%), as well as differential attrition between study groups (32% dropout in the Omnigraft \u00ae group compared to 47% dropout in the control group). The trial was funded by the maker of Omnigraft \u00ae. Critical Outcome: Deep Soft Tissue or Bone Infection No SRs or RCTs reported on the effect of IDRT on deep soft tissue or bone infection. Critical Outco me: Complete Wound Healing Driver and colleagues (2015) reported greater complete wound healing at 16 weeks in patients treated with IDRT (51%) compared with standard care (32%) (p = 0.01). At final follow -up 12 weeks after the study period there was no st atistically significant difference in wound recurrence between the 2 groups (19% IDRT versus 26% control, p = 0.32). Critical Outcome: Quality of Life Driver and colleagues (2015) reported statistically significant differences in SF -36 Physical Functioning score (p = 0.047) and Bodily Pain score (p = 0.033) in favor of IDRT , but the magnitude of the improvements were not reported . Important Outcome: Time to Complete Wound Healing Driver and colleagues (2015) reported a statistically significant improvement in time to complete wound healing of 43 days in the IDRT group versus 78 days in the control group (p = 0.001). Important Outcome: Adverse Effects Adverse events attributed to the study treatments were similar in both groups (4.5% versus 5.2%). 33 Skin substitutes for chronic skin ulcers DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 Grafix\u00ae Grafix\u00ae is another product derived from cryopreserved human placental membrane. It is approved by the FDA as a \"wound cover\" for both acute and chronic wounds. According to the manufacturer it intends to submit a Biologics License Application for more clin ical indications. This evidence review identified only one RCT of fair quality. Patients in this trial had wounds of four to 52 weeks' duration, and of 1 cm2 to 15 cm2 in area. Patients were excluded for A1c 12, inadequate ABPI, presence of active infecti on, and response to usual care during a one -week screening period. Other subject characteristics were not reported. Patients received weekly applications for up to 84 days (Lavery, 2014). There were several limitations to this RCT including: Insufficient i nformation to determine the appropriateness of the randomization scheme. The use of a central third party in treatment assignment likely satisfies the need for concealment of allocation. There are potentially important baseline differences between the two groups, specifically, larger average ulcer size in the standard treatment group (3.93 cm2 vs 3.41 cm2 in the Grafix \u00ae group), and the presence of twice as many dorsal foot ulcers in the Grafix \u00ae group (8 vs 4 in the standard care group). The trial permitted the use of custom off -loading devices at the discretion of the investigator , raising the possibility that this additional intervention was not equally applied in the treatment and control groups. The overall rate of attrition in the trial exceeds 15% with 19 of 97 participants withdrawing prior to study completion. There were more dropouts in the control group (23%) compared with the Grafix \u00ae group (16%). There is a discrepancy in the reported outcome of complete wound healing which was originally stated as occurring in 31 of 50 patients in the Grafix \u00ae group, but in later reporting on wound recurrence after the 12 week treatment phase the authors state that ulcers remained closed in 23 of 28 patients in the Grafix \u00ae group. Although the study states that \"woun d closure was independently confirmed via a central wound core laboratory\" the initial determination of the primary outcome (complete wound closure) was made by an unblinded site investigator. The trial was funded by the maker of Grafix \u00ae. Critical Outcome: Deep Soft Tissue or Bone Infection No SRs or RCTs reported on the effect of Grafix\u00ae on deep soft tissue or bone infection. The RCT by Lavery and colleagues (2014) did report that patients randomized to Grafix\u00ae did experience significantly fewer wo und infections than the usual -care group (18.0% versus 36.2%, p = 0.044), and a trend to fewer infection -related hospitalizations (6% versus 15%, p = 0.15). 34 Skin substitutes for chronic skin ulcers DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 Critical Outcome: Complete Wound Healing Lavery and colleagues (2014) conducted an RCT of Grafix\u00ae versus standard wound care for DFUs. Complete wound healing occurred in 62% of patients treated with Grafix\u00ae and in 21% of the control group (p < 0.01). Critical Outcome: Quality of Life No SRs or R CTs reported on the effect of Grafix\u00ae on validated quality of life indicators or surrogate measures. Important Outcome: Time to Complete Wound Healing In the fair quality RCT by Lavery and colleagues (2014), time to complete healing was a secondary outcome . Patients treated with Grafix\u00ae experienced complete wound healing in a median time of 42 days, compared to 69.5 days in the control group (p = 0.019). Important Outcome: Adverse Effects Lavery and colleagues (2014) reported that patients treated with Gra fix\u00ae were less likely to experience any adverse event than patients in the control group (44% versus 66%, p = 0.031). One control group subject underwent amputation due to an adverse event; there were no amputations in the intervention arm. There was no di scussion of whether any of the adverse events were thought to be related to treatment. Graftjacket\u00ae Graftjacket\u00ae is derived from donated human tissue, and is composed of extracellular components of human dermis (collagen, elastin, and proteoglycans). One RCT included patients with non -infected ulcers and a palpable/audible pulse to the affected extremity, but did not describe other inclusion/exclusion criteria. A second RCT included only patients with good diabetic control (Hgb A1c < 12, serum creatinine < 3.0 mg) and adequate ABPI, and excluded patients who had received biomedical or topical growth factors within 30 days. Other subject characteristics were not reported. Both RCTs used a single application in the treatment group (Brigido, 2006; Reyzelman, 2 009) . Critical Outcome: Deep Soft Tissue or Bone Infection The AHRQ review (Snyder, Sullivan, & Schoelles, 2012) identified one RCT that reported wound infection rates in the use of Graftjacket\u00ae. In 46 patients treated with Graftjacket\u00ae, one patient experi enced a wound infection that eventually ended with amputation; there were no cases of wound infection in the 39 control group subjects. Critical Outcome: Complete Wound Healing Two RCTs were included in the AHRQ review ( Snyder , Sullivan, & Schoelles, 2012) that evaluated the use of Graftjacket\u00ae in patients with DFUs (total n = 113). The authors of both studies report a significantly greater proportion of wound closure compared to usual care at 12 weeks (compared with moist -wound therapy dressings: 70% vs 46%, p=0.03, relative Curasol: 86% vs 29%, p=0.006). In the AHRQ review, one of these RCTs was assessed at moderate risk of bias; the other was determined to be at low risk of bias after author communication s clarified the randomization 35 Skin substitutes for chronic skin ulcers DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 procedures. However, Felder and colleagues (2012) point out other flaws in this second RCT, specifically that the dropout rate was twice as high in the treatment group as in the control group, that the average pretreatment wou nd size was bia sed in favor of the Graftjacket \u00ae arm (3.6cm2 in the treatment subjects versus 5.1cm2 in the control subjects), and that the control group \"had a higher percentage of foot wounds, which are more likely to be weight -bearing and therefore more difficult to heal\" (Felder, Goyal, & Attinger, 2012, p. 60). Critical Outcome: Quality of Life No SRs or RCTs reported on the effect of Graftjacket\u00ae on validated quality of life indicators or surrogate measures. Important Outcome: Time to Complete Wound H ealing The AH RQ SR (Snyder , Sullivan, & Schoelles, 2012) included two RCTs that reviewed the effectiveness of Graftjacket for DFUs. In one trial, time to complete healing was 11.92 weeks in the treatment group versus 13.5 weeks in the control group; in the other, it was 5.7 weeks in the treatment group versus 6.8 weeks in the control. While both studies reported a shortened time to would closure compared to a usual care group, neither finding was statistically significant. Important Outcome: Adverse Effects One RCT reported wound infection rates of 21.4% versus 35.7% in the treatment and control groups, respectively (Felder, Goyal, & Attinger, 2012). The other RCT reported on a control group patient who experienced altered mental status and hypotension and another who developed an abscess; in the treatment group, one patient had an infection leading to amputation (discussed above), and a second required vascular surgery. OASIS\u00ae Wound Matrix /Ultra Tri -Layer Wound Matrix OASIS \u00ae is derived from hydrolyzed bovin e collagen and is approved by the FDA \"[f] or the management of wounds including full thickness and partial thickness wounds, pressure ulcers, venous ulcers, ulcers caused by mixed vascular etiologies, diabetic ulcers, second -degree burns, donor sites and o ther bleeding surface wounds, abrasions, traumatic wounds healing by secondary intenti on, dehisced surgical incisions \" (Snyder, Sullivan, & Schoelles, 2012, pg. ES -12). The AHRQ review identified five RCTs evaluating the effectiveness of OASIS \u00ae Wound Matrix . Patients were enrolled with a wound of >4 weeks duration (in one trial, > 6 months). Patients with conditions that would slow wound healing were excluded from all trials, for example, malnutrition (albumin < 2.5 g/dL), poor glycemic control (A1c >1 2), active smoker status, inadequate circulation to the affected limb, active infection, immunosuppression, use of steroids, vascular disease, and Charcot foot. 36 Skin substitutes for chronic skin ulcers DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 In three trials of OASIS \u00ae Wound Matrix for DFU, the product was re -applied as deemed clinically necessary. One RCT (Niezgoda, 2005) reported an average use of 10 sheets of OASIS Wound Matrix per patient. A trial of OASIS Wound Matrix compared to Dermagraft \u00ae (Landsman, 2008) reported that up to eight applications of OASIS Wound Matrix was similarly effective to up to three applications of Dermagraft \u00ae. The third trial (Romanelli, 2010) reported an average of 5.2 days between dressing changes for OASIS patients. Two RCTs reported on OASIS \u00ae Wound Matrix in treatment of VLU. One (Mostow, 2005) reported an average of eight sheets per patient; the other (Romanelli, 2007) reported an average of 6.4 days between dressing changes but did not report on number of sheets of product used. Critical Outc ome: Deep Soft Tissue or Bone Infection No SRs or RCTs reported on the effect of OASIS \u00ae on deep soft tissue or bone infection. Critical Outcome: Complete Wound Healing The AHRQ review (Snyder, Sullivan, & Schoelles, 2012) included one RCT of patients with DFUs (n = 98), comparing OASIS \u00ae Wound Matrix with Regranex Gel (contains platelet -derived growth factor) and found greater wound closure of plantar ulcers at 12 weeks in the OASIS \u00ae group (49% vs 28%, p=0.06). A fair quality RCT comparing OASIS\u00ae Ultra Tri-Layer Matrix with standard care was identified after the initial search and draft coverage guidance was completed . Cazzell and colleagues (2015) published results of an open -label RCT of 82 patients comparing OASIS\u00ae Ultra Tri -Layer to standard care for treatment of DFU. In the intervention group, OASIS \u00ae Ultra Tri -Layer was applied once each week. Patients in the control group were also seen weekly and the standard care intervention was selected by the investigator (standard care included sliver dressing, Hyd rogel, wet -to-dry, alginate, Manuka honey, or triple antibiotic dressing). Ulcer measurement was standardized by use of a digital image capture and wound measurement device. At 12 weeks, wound healing was greater in the OASIS \u00ae group (54%) compared with the standard care group (32%) (p=0.021). Smith and Nephew funded the study and employs three of the authors. Aside from the conflicts of interest and open -label design, the study otherwise appears to be at low risk of bias. This fair quality RCT demonstrates improved DFU wound healing at 12 weeks for patients treated with OASIS \u00ae Ultra Tri -Layer compared to standard care. Snyder and colleagues (2012) included three RCTs of patients with VLUs that evaluated the effectiveness of OASIS \u00ae Wound Matrix (total n = 222 ). The trials included disparate usual care groups (petrolatum - impregnated gauze with no compression, Jaloskin containing hyaluronan, nonad herent dressing with compression bandages). However, healing rates were greater in the OASIS \u00ae Wound Matrix arms acros s all three trials and follow -up periods (80% vs 65% at 8 weeks, p<0.05; 83% vs 46% at 16 weeks, p<0.001; 55% vs 34% at 12 weeks, p=0.02; respectively). OASIS \u00ae Wound Matrix vs Dermagraft\u00ae The AHRQ SR (Snyder, Sullivan, & Schoelles, 2012) included one RCT that compared OASIS \u00ae Wound Matrix with Dermagraft\u00ae for individuals with DFUs (n = 26). The study found no significant di fference in 37 Skin substitutes for chronic skin ulcers DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 complete wound closure between the two products (Dermagraft \u00ae 84.6% vs OASIS \u00ae Wound Matrix 76.9%, p = 0.62). Critica l Outcome: Quality of Life No SRs or RCTs reported on the effect of OASIS \u00ae Wound Matrix on validated quality of life indicators . One RCT identified in the AHRQ review reported fewer wound dressings with OASIS \u00ae Wound Matrix (6.46 \u00b1 1.39 changes vs 2.54 \u00b1 0.78), while a second reported lower pain levels in the intervention group as measured by a 10 -point visual analog scale (3.7 vs 6.2, p < 0.05). A third RCT reported that 2/17 patients in the OASIS \u00ae group experienced pain, compared to 1/10 control p atients. Important Outcome: Time to Complete Wound Healing Of the three RCTs included in the AHRQ review ( Snyder , Sullivan, & Schoelles, 2012) that evaluated OASIS \u00ae Wound Matrix in patients with DFUs, only one trial reported a shorter time to wound closure compared to nonadherent dressing with compression bandages (5.4 weeks vs 8.3 weeks, statistical analysis not reported) . A second RCT reported 35.67 \u00b1 41.47 OASIS \u00ae arm vs 40.90 \u00b1 32.32 days in the control (not significant). The third RCT reported average time of 67 days with OASIS \u00ae Wound Matrix and 73 days with control (p = 0.245). All three RCTs were of fair quality. One RCT of OASIS \u00ae Wound Matrix in VLUs did not report time to healing, but did estimate using Cox analysis that at twelve weeks, 63% of the treatment group vs 29% of the controls would be expected to achieve complete wou nd healing (Snyder, Sullivan, & Schoelles, 2012). OASIS\u00ae Wound Matrix vs Dermagraft\u00ae The AHRQ SR included one RCT that compared OASIS \u00ae Wound Matrix with Der magraft for individuals with DFUs. The study found no significant difference in the time to wound closure between the two products (Snyder, Sullivan, & Schoelles, 2012). Important Outcome: Adverse Effects The AHRQ SR included one RCT that compared OASIS \u00ae Wound Matrix with Regranex \u00ae growth gel (Snyder, Sullivan, & Schoelles, 2012). The authors reported adverse effects in the OASIS \u00ae group (n=17) including one patient with depression/mood disorder, one patient with gastrointestinal disorder, and three patients with infections in a non -study ulcer. In the Regranex \u00ae group (n=10), there was one instance of infection in a non -study ulcer, two cases of limb injury, one respiratory tract infection, one case of septic arthritis, and one skin injury. The AHRQ SR also reported on one trial in which eight patients received OASIS \u00ae Wound Matrix and 15 were treated with compression. In this trial, three patients in each group experienced an allergic reaction or intolerance to the secondary dressing. One patient in the OASIS \u00ae group died of cardiovascular disease; one patient in the compression group developed a new ulcer from the compression. One patient in each group developed an infection in another (non -target) wound, one patient receiving compression developed a seroma, a nd one patient in each group suffered skin injury. 38 Skin substitutes for chronic skin ulcers DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 Talymed\u00ae Talymed \u00ae is a wound dressing product containing poly -N-acetyl glucosamine (pGlcNAc) derived from microalgae. (Snyder, Sullivan, & Schoelles, 2012, pg. 56). This evidence review identified one small pilot RCT within the AHRQ review. Patients in this trial were 59 -63 years old, 25 -65% male, and had wounds ranging from 2.7 to 3.6 months duration. Patients in both intervention and control groups had comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, obesity, arthritis, and blood clotting disorders. Patients were excluded for a variety of more severe indications such as collagen vascular disease, Charcot disease, previous radiation, current hemodialysis, or insufficie nt ABPI. The RCT (Kelechi, 2011) included three treatment arms (single application, application every other week, or application every three weeks). A single application was equivalent to control (45%, n = 9 of 20) for complete wound healing . Complete hea ling occurred in 86.4% (n = 19 of 22) and 65.0% (n = 13 of 20) with applications every two and every three weeks, respectively. P -value was significant for every other week versus standard care (p < 0.01). Critical Outcome: Deep Soft Tissue or Bone Infecti on No SRs or RCTs reported on the effect of Talymed\u00ae on deep soft tissue or bone infection. Critical Outcome: Complete Wound Healing The AHRQ review (Snyder, Sullivan, & Schoelles, 2012) included a single RCT that evaluated the use of Talymed\u00ae in combinati on with usual care compared to usual care alone for VLUs (n=82). Patients receiving Talymed\u00ae with usual care every other week experienced higher wound closure rates than usual care alone at 20 weeks (86% vs 45%, p=0.0005). Snyder and colleagues (2012) note that patients receiving Talymed\u00ae once every three weeks or only receiving one application did not experience statistically significant results. Critical Outcome: Quality of Life No SRs or RCTs reported on the effect of Talymed\u00ae on validated quality of lif e indicators or surrogate measures. Important Outcome: Time to Complete Wound Healing No SRs or RCTs reported on the effect of Talymed\u00ae on time to complete wound healing. Important Outcome: Adverse Effects In the AHRQ review (Snyder, Sullivan, & Schoelles, 2012), a single RCT reported \"no pain, edema, or significant treatment -related adverse events occurred\" (p. C-65). 39 Skin substitutes for chronic skin ulcers DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 TheraSkin\u00ae TheraSkin\u00ae is a cryopreserved human skin allograft (Snyder, Sullivan, & Schoelles, 2012). This evidence review iden tified one RCT in which TheraSkin\u00ae was used as a comparison for Apligraf\u00ae for diabetic foot ulcers , discussed above. Patients in this trial had either Type I or Type II diabetes with A1c < 12.0 and the ability to comply with an offloading regimen as well a s adequate ABPI (>0.75) and absence of infection, gangrenous tissue, or abscess. The study was rated at moderate risk of bias. Patients in the RCT (DiDomenico , 2011) received up to five applications, in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. Authors report that most patients received only a single application and that the mean number of applications was 1.38 (SD = 0.29). Critical Outcome: Deep Soft Tissue or Bone Infection The A HRQ review (Snyder, Sullivan, & Schoelles, 2012) identified one R CT in which TheraSkin\u00ae was used as the comparator to Apligraf\u00ae. In this trial, one patient treated with TheraSkin\u00ae was hospitalized due to infection, but no further information is available. Critical Outcome: Complete Wound Healing The RCT identified in t he A HRQ review (Snyder, Sullivan, & Schoelles, 2012) reported complete wound healing at two time points. By 12 weeks follow up, the TheraSkin\u00ae group had 66.7% complete healing, versus 41.3% in the Apligraf\u00ae group (p = 0.21). The difference was even smaller at 20 weeks, as no more patients in the TheraSkin \u00ae group experienced complete healing (66.7% vs 47.1%, p not reported). Critical Outcome: Quality of Life No SRs or RCTs reported on the effect of TheraSkin\u00ae on validated quality of life i ndicators or surro gate measures. Important Outcome: Time to Complete Wound Healing No SRs or RCTs reported on the effect of TheraSkin\u00ae on time to complete wound healing. Important Outcome: Adverse Effects No SRs or RCTs reported on the adverse effect s of TheraSkin\u00ae Summary of the Evidence The field of biologic skin substitutes for treatment of chronic skin ulcers such as venous leg ulcers and diabetic foot ulcers is rapidly expanding with a variety of new innovations and products. An AHRQ review in 2012 identified 57 unique products, while this updated search found 73 and there are likely more. Evidence for the effectiveness and safety of these products has not kept pace with their development, however , as this review was only able to find published trials of nine products (available in the US) , and none dealing with pressure ulcers . While early tests are promising for these products in the treatment of serious and occasionally life -threatening wounds , our confidence in the estimates of effectiveness is generally very low. St udies are almost universally limited by small sample size and inconsistency in control groups and what is defined as \"usual care.\" There is virtually no evidence to 40 Skin substitutes for chronic skin ulcers DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 illuminate the comparative effectiveness of these products, nor to compare their effectiven ess versus other alternative types of wound dressings besides moist saline gauze and compression. Our key question regarding subgroup analysis (considerations of age, BMI, comorbidities, etc.) went largely unanswered by these studies. Where inclusion/excl usion criteria were reported, in general the patients were predominantly male, between 50 -70 years of age, had hemoglobin A1c < 12.0%, had no active infectious process, and had adequate circulation to the extremity as measured by ankle -brachial pressure in dex (ABPI). Some trials excluded other comorbidities such as immunosuppression. Most trials did report on the likelihood of complete wound closure, which makes comparison of results across studies possible; however, the limitation is that many studies hav e a short follow -up time that may miss complete healing that takes place in the usual care group at a later time. The second critical outcome was incidence of deep soft tissue or bone infection; this outcome was not widely reported and could be inferred fr om some studies only by the occasion of an amputation. No information was identified related to validated quality of life indicators for any of the products , although there is very limited information about pain and number of dressing changes for a few pro ducts . Time to complete healing is another outcome considered important to this review. In these early trials, the skin substitutes do appear to reduce time to wound healing but it should be noted that none of the trials had adequate blinding and many are subject to selection as well as observer bias. In the AHRQ review, Snyder and colleagues (2012) express concern about the external validity of this body of evidence: The overall applicability of the evidence base is limited to a small number of skin subs titute products examining diabetic foot ulcers and venous and/or arterial leg ulcers and to patients in generally good health. Although these results are consistent in showing a benefit when using skin substitutes and suggest that skin substitutes could be used in treating diabetic foot ulcers and venous leg ulcers, the patients enrolled in these studies were in generally good health and free of infected wounds, medications that would impede wound healing, clinically significant medical conditions, signific ant peripheral vascular disease, malnutrition, or uncontrolled diabetes. The results of these studies may not easily translate to everyday clinical situations. The expected population with chronic wounds is likely to have these conditions; therefore, the r esults reported in studies without these patients may not extrapolate well. The applicability of the findings to sicker patients may be limited (Snyder , Sullivan, & Schoelles , 2012, p. 74). These products are dissimilar enough that even though they can be broadly categorized by derivation, results from a trial of one product cannot be extrapolated to other products in its category. With such a large number of products, it will be challenging to have high confidence in the evidence of their effectiveness without many, many more trials. 41 Skin substitutes for chronic skin ulcers DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 OTHER DECISION FACTORS - Resource Allocation Cost for a course of treatment with skin substitutes can vary widely, depending on the product used, the number of applications required , the amount of skin substitute purchased, where it is applied (inpatient hospital, outpatient hospital, ambulatory surgical center, office) and payer reimbursement policies. Costs for a course of treatment can vary from a few hundred dollars for an in -office treatment with a low-cost skin substitute such as OASIS \u00ae Wound Matrix to several thousand dollars for multiple applications of higher cost products such as Apligraf \u00ae and Dermagraft \u00ae. While these products are sometimes billed separa tely from the physician fees for applying them (including related debridement), some payers are bundling payment in order to incentivize the use of cost -effective products. For instance, in the ambulatory surgery center setting, Medicare fee-for-service bu ndles the professional fee with the product itself . In addition, in a form of reference pricing, Medicare groups t hese bundles into two groups --for high -cost and low -cost products \u2014in order to encourage the use of cost -effective products. Some other payers follow Medicare's practices, but others have their own reimbursement policies. When not bundled, prices for the skin substitute product itself are usually based on the number of square centimeters purchased, though some products are only sold in relatively large pieces (creating waste when used for small ulcers) , while others can be purchased in a variety of sizes. In addition, som e products are perishable and must be ordered to arrive within a few days of use ; others have a longer shelf life. If these products are effective at improving time to complete ulcer healing, or prevent ing amputations, they could be cost -effective. However , given the low quality evidence available on most of these products, it is difficult to determine whether or not the expected improvement is sufficient to justify the cost. For products recommended for coverage, the GRADE -informed framework above shows e xamples of pricing for smaller ulcers for Medicare fee -for-service in various settings. Information about costs for a course of treatment in the GRADE -informed framework and in Appendix E reflects a certain number of application s, based on FDA approval cri teria, other payers' coverage criteria or averages from studies. When multiple effective skin substitutes are available for a given indication, s trategizing preferred products based on price or using alternative payment strategies may create savings for p ayers . Values and preferences Ulcers can be painful, distressing, and debilitating to patients and patients would likely be highly motivated to have effective treatment. However, few of these products have any evidence of benefit at this point and patients would be unlikely to strongly prefer skin substitutes if benefit is unclear. Skin substitutes , however, do not appear to add much burden to the patient ; they would continue to require frequent wound dressings, offloading, and other mediating treatments re gardless of the use of skin substitutes, so adverse effects or impact on convenience would not be a strong consideration against these products. 42 Skin substitutes for chronic skin ulcers DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 Other considerations Expert input and study inclusion criteria show that skin substitutes can only be effectiv e when other conditions necessary for wound healing exist. These conditions include the following: 1. Product is recommended for the type of ulcer being treated (see table below) 2. FDA indications and contraindications are followed, if applicable 3. Appropriate offloading has been performed 4. Wound has adequate arterial flow, no ongoing infection and a moist wound healing environment 5. Multilayer compression dressings are used (when clinically appropriate) 6. Patient has not used tobacco products 4 weeks prior to placem ent 7. For patients with diabetes, Hba1c level is < 12. 8. No prior failure of the same skin substitute for the ulcer being treated 9. Prior appropriate wound care therapy has failed to result in significant improvement of the wound over at least 30 days 10. Ulcer impr oves significantly over 6 weeks of treatment with skin substitutes, required for coverage of ongoing applications 11. Patients is able to adhere to the treatment plan POLICY LANDSCAPE Quality measures No quality measures related to skin substitutes were iden tified on the National Quality Measures Clearinghouse. Payer coverage policies Among the four private payers reviewed, two payers provide coverage of skin substitute products (Aetna and Cigna) and two payers do not have coverage criteria ( Moda and Regence) . Washington Medicaid only covers one skin substitute ( TheraSkin \u00ae for diabetic foot ulcers) and requires prior authorization. No National Coverage Determinations were identified. However, there are four Local Coverage Determinations (LCDs) that specify cov erage of skin substitutes. Two of the LCDs detail specific products covered (L 34285 and L34593 ), while the other two do not ( L36377 and L 35041 ). Table 4 summarizes the coverage for skin substitutes to treat diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) and venous leg ulcers (VLU) across payers. None of the skin substitute coverage policies cover decubitus ulcers. All payers reviewed, except the Medicare NCD and Washington Medicaid, cover skin substitutes when a wound has not adequately responded to standard treatments, usuall y within 30 days. Many coverage policies have additional indications that limit use, such as the ulcer being infection -free (Aetna, L 35041 , L34593 , and L 34285 ), the foot having adequate blood supply (Aetna, Cigna, L 35041 , and L34593 ), and HbA1C < 12% (Cig na). Some payers limit the number of applications of skin substitutes, for example, a maximum of four treatments of Apligraf \u00ae or Epi Fix\u00ae in 12 weeks and wound healing must be present (Cigna), not more than 10 applications per wound (L 35041 ), Apligraf \u00ae and and Graftj acket \u00ae is limited to one application (L 34285 ). 43 Skin substitutes for chronic skin ulcers DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 Table 4 . Summary of Other Payer Coverage of Skin Substitutes Payer Skin Substitutes DFU, VLU - no specific products identified Key: X - product is not covered Abbreviations: DFU - diabetic foot ulcer; LCD - local coverage determination; VLU - venous leg ulcer Clinical Practice Guidelines Diabetic foot ulcers Three clinical practice guidelines address care for diabetic foot ulcers ( Braun, Kim, Margolis, Peters, & Lavery, 2006; NICE, 2011; Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario, 2013). The good -quality National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clinical practice guidelines recommend to, \"Consider dermal or skin substitutes as an adjunct to standard care when treating diabetic foot ulcers, only when healing h as not progressed and on the advice of the multidisciplinary foot care service\" (2015, p.18). The fair-quality guideline from the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario and Braun and colleagues (2006) poor -quality update to the Wound Healing Society guideline did not include a recommendation on use of skin substitutes. Venous leg ulcers Three clinical practice guidelines address care of venous leg ulcers (AAWC, 2010; Australian Wound Management Association Inc. and the New Zealand Wound Care Society Inc. , 2011; SIGN, 2010). One good -quality guideline, Australian and New Zealand Clinical Practice Guideline for Prevention and Management of Venous Leg Ulcers, and one poor -quality guideline from the Association for the 44 Skin substitutes for chronic skin ulcers DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 Advancement of Wound Care (AAWC) recomme nd skin substitutes for non -healing or persistent venous leg ulcers, but do not provide recommendations on the use of specific products. The good -quality SIGN guideline found that there is insufficient evidence on which to base a recommendation for includi ng skin substitutes, or any skin grafting. Pressure ulcers The good -quality Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement (ICSI) guideline recommends that clinicians refer the patient to a wound -focused physician or clinician to select the appropriate skin s ubstitute or other biological application for the treatment of chronic skin ulcers , such as platelet gels, platelet - derived growth factor therapy, or extracellular matrix sheets. 45 Skin substitutes for chronic skin ulcers DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 REFERENCES Evidence Sources Felder, J.

GRADE INFORMED FRAMEWORK - ELEMENT DESCRIPTIONS Strong recommendation In Favor: The subcommittee is confident that the desirable effects of adherence to a recommendation outweigh the undesirable effects, considering the quality of evidence, cost and resource allocation, and values and preferences. Against: The subcommittee is confide nt that the undesirable effects of adherence to a recommendation outweigh the desirable effects, considering the quality of evidence, cost and resource allocation, and values and preferences. Weak recommendation In Favor: The subcommittee concludes that th e desirable effects of adherence to a recommendation probably outweigh the undesirable effects, considering the quality of evidence, cost and resource allocation, and values and preferences, but is not confident. Against: The subcommittee concludes that t he undesirable effects of adherence to a recommendation probably outweigh the desirable effects, considering the quality of evidence, cost and resource allocation, and values and preferences, but is not confident. Quality or strength of evidence rating across studies for the treatment/outcome2 High: The subcommittee is very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect. Typical sets of studies are RCTs with few or no limitations and the estimate of effect is likely stabl e. Moderate: The subcommittee is moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different. Typical sets of studies are RCTs with some lim itations or well -performed nonrandomized studies with additional strengths that guard against potential bias and have large estimates of effects. 2 Includes risk of bias, precision, directness, consistency and publication bias Element Description Balance between desirable and undesirable effects The larger the difference between the desirable and undesirable effects, the higher the likelihood that a strong recommendation is warranted. The narrower the gradient, the higher the likelihood that a weak recommendation is warranted Quality of evidence The higher the quality of evidence, the higher the likelihood that a strong recommendation is warranted Resource allocation The higher the costs of an intervention \u2014that is, the greater the resources consumed \u2014 the lower the likelihood th at a strong recommendation is warranted Values and preferences The more values and preferences vary, or the greater the uncertainty in values and preferences, the higher the likelihood that a weak recommendation is warranted Other considerations Other considerations include issue about the implementation and operationalization of the technology or intervention in health systems and practices within Oregon. 50 Skin substitutes for chronic skin ulcers DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 Low: The subcommittee's confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect. Typical sets of studies are RCTs with serious limitations or nonrandomized studies without special strengths. Very low : The subcommittee has very little confidence in the effect estimate: The true effect is lik ely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect. Typical sets of studies are nonrandomized studies with serious limitations or inconsistent results across studies. 51 Skin substitutes for chronic skin ulcers DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 APPENDIX B.

METHODS Scope Statement Populations Adults with chronic skin ulcers Population scoping notes: Considered limiting scope to diabetic foot ulcers and venous leg ulcers, sacral decubitus ulcers, but decided on the broader definition above, considered burns and other types of wounds Interventions Skin substitutes Intervention exclusions: None Comparators Usual care Outcomes Critical: Deep soft tissue or bone infections, c omplete wound healing, quality of life Important : Time to complete wound healing, adverse effects Considered but not selected for the GRADE table: Cellulitis, sepsis, death, need for surgical management, ulcer recurrence Key Questions 1. What is comparative effectiveness of different types of skin substitutes compared with wound care alternatives for individuals with chronic skin ulcers? Include consideration of: a. Age b. Body mass index (BMI) c. Comorbidities d. Site of ulce r e. Ulcer etiology (e.g. , infectious, pressure or circulatory). f. Wound severity g. Prior need for skin substitute h. Failure of prior therapies 2. What adverse events are associated with skin substitutes? 3. What are contraindications to the use of skin substitutes? Search Strategy A full search of the core sources was conducted to identify systematic reviews, meta -analyses, technology assessments, and clinical practice guidelines using the terms \"wound,\" \"ulcer,\" \"skin substitute,\" or \"bioengineered skin .\" Searches o f core sources were limited to citations published after 2005. 65 Skin Substitutes for Chronic Skin Ulcers DRAFT for VbBS/HERC meeting materials 8/11/2016 The core sources searched included: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Blue Cross/Blue Shield Health Technology Assessment (HTA) program BMJ Clinical Evidence Canadian Agency f or Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) Cochrane Library (Wiley Interscience) Hayes, Inc. Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) Medicaid Evidence -based Decisions Project (MED) National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Tufts Cost -effectiveness Analysis Registry Veterans Administration Evidence -based Synthesis Program (ESP) Washington State Health Technology Assessment Program A MEDLINE\u00ae (Ovid) search was then conducted to identify systematic reviews, meta -analyses, and techno logy assessments published after the search dates of the AHRQ report ( Snyder et al ., 2012 ). The search was limited to publications in English published after 2011 (the end search date for the AHRQ SR). Using the 2012 AHRQ systematic review as the predomina nt evidence source, a second MEDLINE\u00ae (Ovid) search was conducted to identify any randomized controlled trials published after the search dates of the AHRQ review ( 2011 ). Searches for clinical practice guidelines were limited to those published since 2010 . A search for relevant clinical practice guidelines was also conducted, using the following sources: Australian Government National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) - Community Preventive Servic es Choosing Wisely Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement (ICSI) National Guidelines Clearinghouse New Zealand Guidelines Group NICE Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) Veterans Administration/Department of Defense (VA/DOD) Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Studies were excluded if they were not published in English, did not address the scope statement, or were study designs other than systematic reviews, meta -analyses, technology assessments, or clinical practice guidelines. A MEDLINE\u00ae search was conducted for randomized control trials published after the AHRQ systematic review. The AHRQ systematic review (Snyder, Sullivan and Schoelles, 2012) was selected as the base systematic review for this topic based on its comprehensiveness; thus systematic reviews published prior to the AHRQ review were excluded.

Upon review of the included references, Theraskin is as eff ective and at least equivalent to products currently recommended for coverage by Oregon Medicaid (Apligraf and Dermagraft).\" Thank you for your comment. We will address each of these studies individually below. A2 \"The 2011 Landman's study concluded that Theraskin healed (closed) 60% of previously non -progressing diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) and venous leg ulcers (VLUs) at 12 weeks and 74% at 20 weeks.\" Because this is a non -comparative retrospective case series, it does not meet individual inclusion criter ia for the evidence review. A3 \"DiDomenico's 2011 study concluded that TheraSkin had a greater rate of wound healing than Apligraf, both at 12 weeks (66.7% vs. 41.3%) and 20 weeks (66.7% vs. 47.1%).\" This study is included in the systematic review by Snyder, Sullivan, & Schoelles (2014), and has thus already been included in the evidence review for the draft coverage guidance. DiDomenico and colleagues did not report a test of statistical significance of the difference observed in the trial; the authors o f the AHRQ report found that the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.21). HERC Coverage Guidance - Skin Substitutes Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy Page 3 ID/# Comment Disposition A4 \"Sanders 2014 clinical study showed wounds treated with TheraSkin are twice as likely to close by week 12, with half the number of grafts, versus wounds treated with Dermagraft .\" This manuscript is not indexed in Medline and therefore was not included in the evidence review. Furthermore, this small (n=23) RCT is of poor quality because of uncertainty about allocation concealment; baseline differences in study population (particularly with respect to number of diabetes medications, peripheral arterial disease, tobacco use and wound duration before treatment); differences in the nu mber of office visits in each treatment group and use of offloading techniques; and inadequate blinding of participants, personnel, and outcomes assessors. Additionally, two authors are paid consultants of Soluble Systems and the research was funded by Sol uble Systems. A5 \"Snyder, Sullivan and Schoelles 2012 (AHRQ Review included on page 26 of Oregon's Draft Policy) evaluated the effectiveness of Apligraf and TheraSkin for DFUs with average wound sizes. The study also concluded that there were no significant differences reported in complete wound closure between the two products Apligraf 41% vs. Theraskin 67%, p=0.21.\" The AHRQ systematic review concluded that there is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about the comparative effectiveness of Theraskin and Apligraf. The single trial that informed this comparison (DiDomenico, 2011) was a small (n=28) and imprecise trial deemed to be at moderate risk of bias by the authors of the AHRQ review. HERC Coverage Guidance - Skin Substitutes Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy Page 4 ID/# Comment Disposition A6 \"We respectfully recommend Oregon Medicaid to tak e into consideration that Theraskin is broadly and long accepted by the medical community and insurance carriers as medically and reasonably necessary therapy for the treatment of a broad range of chronic wound indications. o All A/B Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) across the U.S., including Oregon, cover Theraskin. o 41 Medicaid plans throughout the country, including many states surrounding Oregon, also provide Theraskin coverage. o Many large Private Health Plans cover Theraskin including Regence, K aiser, Unite d Health Care, Tricare, UPMC Health Plan, etc. \" Thank you for your comment. Our review of Local Coverage Determinations (LCDs) as well as the policies of selec ted Medicaid programs and private health plans found that Theraskin is commonly, but not uniformly, covered. HERC Coverage Guidance - Skin Substitutes Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy Page 5 ID/# Comment Disposition A7 \"Oregon Medicaid proposes a recommendation of non -coverage for Theraskin due to 'product cost being moderate compared to alternative treatment options.' Listed within the Oregon Medicaid draft policy under 'Frequency of application and cost of skin substitute' Apligraf and Dermagraft product costs were based upon clinical studies while Theraskin's product cost was based upon Medicare LCD limits. Thus, causing Theraskin associated cost -savings to appear modest when compared to alternative treatments. We respectfully recommend that Oregon Medicaid reevaluate Theraskin's product cost in a similar manner as Apligraf and Dermagraft or adults all product cost using Medicare's' LCFD maximum limits.\" The right -hand column of the frequency of application document presented to EbGS was based on the maximum number of applications from the study, while lower limits were used for other products. The rati onale column does note that most patients in the study only required a single application. At its November 3, 2015 meeting , the subcommittee recognized that costs and number of applications will vary by patient and that the cost of these products cannot be easily estimated at the population level. Therefore we have removed a specific number of applications for each product from the right column of the ap plications table and added information on application frequency used in the studies for those products recommended for coverage. However, the subcommittee still finds insufficient evidence of effectiveness to recommend this product for coverage. B1 \"In the draft guidance, the Commission recommends (with a weak recommendation) coverage of OASIS Wound Mat rix for venous leg ulcers ('VLU' ). We support the recommendation for coverage of OASIS for VLU, and we thank the Commission for its position. \" Thank you for your comment. B2 \"By contrast, the Commission recommends against coverage of OASIS Wound Matrix for the trea tment of diabetic foot ulcers ('DFU' ) concluding that there is 'inadequate evidence of benefit, other alternatives available, and its costliness. ' We respectfully disagree with this recommendation for the reasons summarized below. The study by Cazzell and colleagues was not indexed in Medline at the time of the search; it has subsequently been indexed. The previous RCTs of Oasis for DFU were included in the AHRQ review. Landsman, et al (2008) found no statistically significant difference between OASIS and Dermagraft for DFU wound healing at 12 weeks. Niezgoda, et al (2005) compared OASIS to Regranex Gel and found a HERC Coverage Guidance - Skin Substitutes Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy Page 6 ID/# Comment Disposition There is new evidence, published after the 2012 Agency for Healthcare Research & Quality ('AHRQ' ) systematic review from supporting the use of OASIS in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. This evidence was not considered by the Commission. The findings from a prospective, randomized controlled trial of OASIS Ultra Trilayer Matrix versus standard care were published in 2015 in Advances in Wound Care. I n this 16 week trial, 82 qualified patients were randomly assigned to 12 weeks' treatment with OASIS or standard care. The trial demonstrated that a greater proportion of the DFUs were closed by the end of the treatment period (week 12) for the OASIS group than for the standard care group (54% vs. 32%; p = 0.021). More ulcers were closed at each weekly study visit in the OASIS group than the standard care group beginning at week 3 (first visit showing ulcers closed). The overall treatment effect on proporti on of ulcers closed over the 12 weeks and the interaction of treatment by week were found to be statistically significant (p = 0.047) in favor of the OASIS group. In the draft coverage guidance, the Commission defined five outcomes considered in its evalua tion: Critical Outcomes \u00ad Deep soft tissue or bone infection \u00ad Complete wound healing Important Outcomes \u00ad Quality of life \u00ad Time to complete wound healing \u00ad Adverse effects The randomized, controlled study above included three of these outcomes and supports the use of OASIS compared to the standard care with statistically significant results. \" difference in healing at 12 weeks that approached statistical significance (49% vs 28% respectively, p=0.06). Cazzell is an open -label RCT of 82 patients comparing OASIS to standard care for treatment of DFU. In the intervention group, OASIS was applied once each week. Patients in the control g roup were also seen weekly and the standard care intervention was selected by the investigator (standard care included sliver dressing, Hydrogel, wet -to-dry, alginate, Manuka honey, or triple antibiotic dressing). Ulcer measurement was standardized by use of a digital image capture and wound measurement device. At 12 weeks, wound healing was greater in the OASIS group (54%) compared with the standard care group (32%) (p=0.021). Smith and Nephew funded the study and employs three of the authors. Aside from t he conflicts of interest and inadequate blinding, the study otherwise appears to be at low risk of bias. This fair quality RCT demonstrates improved DFU wound healing at 12 weeks for patients treated with OASIS compared to standard care. HERC Coverage Guidance - Skin Substitutes Disposition of Public Comments Center for Evidence -based Policy Page 7 ID/# Comment Disposition B3 \"OASIS has the same level of general acceptance by the medical community as Apligraf. While not a consideration for coverage, the Commission does review the policy landscape and payer coverage policies. Under Medicare, with respect to local coverag e determinations, the policy must be based on published authoritative evidence derived from definitive RCTs or other definitive studies, and general acceptance by the medical community (standard of practice), as supported by sound medical evidence. Use of OASIS in the treatment of DFU is well established in the payer community: All of the MACs cover OASIS for VLU and DFU OASIS has positive coverage based on medical necessity from 760 private payers \" Thank you for your comment. Our review of Local Coverage Determinations (LCDs) as well as the policies of selected Medicaid programs and private health plans found that OASIS is commonly, but not uniformly, covered. B4 \"OASIS is the least costly product per application compared with Apligraf and Dermagraft. The Commission's recommendation against coverage for OASIS for DFUs is based, in part, on the Commission's conclusion that the product is costly. In fact, as is shown below, OASIS has a lower cost per application compared with Apligraf and Dermagraft \u2014two othe r products recommended for coverage for diabetic foot ulcers. \" See chart in submitted comments. OASIS does have a lower unit cost than Apligraf and Dermagraft. However, as noted in the cost comparison chart, studies which showed effectiveness of OASIS used 8 to 10 applications of this product per patient versus smaller quantities used in the studies showing effectiveness for Dermagraft and Apligraf. The subcommittee does recognize that costs and number of applications will vary by patient and that the cost of these products cannot be easily estimated at the population level. B5 \"The Commission stated in the draft guidance that OASIS ' is not recommended for coverage for diabetic foot ulcers based on inadequate evidence of benefit, other alternatives available, and its costliness. ' We believe that this new evidence, together with the position taken by private and public payers as well as the relative low cost of OASIS compared to Apligraf and Dermagraft, support coverage for OASIS fo r the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. \" Thank you for your comment.

There are only approximately 20 ICD -10 codes on line 392 that do not also appear on line 364. There is no clear definition of what is considered a major vs a minor joint. The diagnoses on line 392 include hip, wrist, shoulder, ankle, finger and toe conditions, while the diagnoses of line 364 include basically all joints. The ICD-10 Orthopedics group never finished their review due to the overwhelming number of new ICD -10 codes and their complexity. Therefore, there is not clear guidanc e on how these lines should be t reated. On review, HERC staff found very few codes on line 392 that could not be easily placed elsewhere, and did not see a good rationale for maintaining both of these lines. Additionally, these two lines have caused confusion and bee wn sadfasdasd source of numerous questions from providers and plans about what diagnoses were intended to appear on each. Line 392 contains only 2 CPT codes not found on line 364 (CPT 26045 and 26426). CPT 26045 is on one other appropriate line. CPT 26426 is on two other inappropriate lines and needs to be added to the line contai ning the diagnosis of boutonniere deformity. HERC staff recommendation s: 1) Delete line 392 DEFORMITY/CLOSED DISLOCATION OF MINOR JOINT AND RECURRENT JOINT DISLOCATIONS a.

Question source : Carl Ste vens, MD, OHP Medical Director with CareOregon Issue : Dr. Stevens requested that coverage for uncomplicated inguinal hernias in adults and for any type of umbilical or ventral hernia be reviewed. He feels that lack of coverage for uncomplicated hernias in adults limits many symptomatic patients and affects their ability to work. He feels that elective repair of hernias, especially in young patients with symptomatic abdominal wall hernias that limit their ability to work, would allow return to functional status. He also argues that such repair is the commun ity standard of care. The current guideline may result in undue morbidity and disability in members with symptomatic hernias. Historically, repair of uncomplicated hernias has not been covered as the complication rate with watchful waiting was felt to be very low. Hernia repair surgery is the most common elective surgery in the US. Coverage for repair of uncomplicated ventral and/or inguinal hernia has been discussed extensively at the H ealth Services Commission and HERC (see below). History : 1) In 1994, move uncomplicated hernias in children under age 18 to covered line due to significantly higher rate of complication if left untreated ( >30% in children vs <2% in adults). 2) 1998 biennial review considered moving uncomplicated hernias for patients over age 1 8 from the low uncovered line to a covered line. Noted that complicated/obstructed hernias had a death rate of 10% if untreated, and 0.5% if treated. No change was made with that review other than adding some surgical CPT codes missing from the covered line. 3) 2002 biennial review looked at coverage for uncomplicated hernia. In that review, ventral hernias were added to the lower, uncovered hernia line. 4) In 2005, ventral hernias were considered for addition to the upper hernia line, but not moved. Reducible umbilical hernias in children were moved to the lower, uncovered line. 5) In 2006, the current guideline was added to clarify when hernias were on the covered upper line. 6) In 2007, coverage for hernias in children were reviewed, and coverage maintained due to evidence of higher rates of complications for children. 7) In 2008, the guideline was clarified that all incarcerated hernias are on the upper line. Laparoscopic repair codes were added to the upper hernia line 8) In 2008, repair of large ventral hern ias was reviewed. The outcomes of repair of large ventral hernias, with our without mesh, was found to be poor. 9) In 2010, Dr. Gubler, a surgeon on the HOSC, recommended coverage of inguinal hernias, as femoral hernias were covered. He also felt that fat incarc eration rather than 2018 Biennial Review Repair of Inguinal and Ventral Hernias 2 intestinal incarceration, should be a covered indication for repair. No changes were made based on his recommendations. 10) In 2012, the ICD -10 general surgery review group proposed div iding the two hernia lines into 3 lines. The evidenc e supporting the safety of expectant management was discussed. Members decided to continue the current line structure for hernias. All ventral hernias were moved to the lower, uncovered line. 11) In 2014, ventral hernias were again discussed and the hernia g uideline modified to clarify coverage. 12) In 2015, ventral hernias were again discussed and lack of any coverage, even when incarcerated, was clarified again. Evidence Inguinal hernia, watchful waiting (WW) vs surgical repair 1) AHRQ 2012 , comparative effectiveness review of inguinal hernia repair a. For pain -free hernia, watchful waiting was compared to surgical repair b. Two studies met inclusion criteria. One compared WW with Lichtenstein repair, and the other compared WW with \"tension -free mesh repair\" (w hich might have been Lichtenstein repair). Both studies were considered to have moderate risk of bias for all outcomes reported. c. For this Key Question, we considered the following outcomes to be major: long - term QOL, which was reported as \"overall change in health status in previous 12 months\"; long -term pain; and acute hernia/ strangulation. The evidence was sufficient to permit a conclusion for one outcome: long -term QOL, for which the results favored repair over WW. Estimated difference on a 0 -11 scale, 7 points (CI, 0.4 to 14.3) d. Evidence level was considered low 2) Fitzgibbons 2006 and 2013 , RCT of WW vs surgical repair a. N=720 men (364 watchful waiting, 356 surgical repair) b. At 4.5 years, p rimary intention -to-treat outcomes were similar at 2 years for watchful waiting vs surgical repair: pain limiting activities (5.1% vs 2.2%, respectively; P=.52); PCS (improvement over baseline, 0.29 points vs 0.13 points; P=.79). Twenty -three percent of pa tients assigned to watchful waiting crossed over to receive surgical repair (increase in hernia -related pain was the most common reason offered); 17% assigned to receive repair crossed over to watchful waiting. Self -reported pain in watchful -waiting patien ts crossing over improved after repair. Occurrence of postoperative hernia -related complications was similar in patients who received repair as assigned and in watchful -waiting patients who crossed over. One watchful -waiting patient (0.3%) experienced acut e hernia incarceration without strangulation within 2 years; a second had acute incarceration with bowel obstruction at 4 years, with a frequency of 1.8/1000 patient -years inclusive of pat ients followed up for as long as 4.5 years. 2018 Biennial Review Repair of Inguinal and Ventral Hernias 3 c. After 11.5 years, the es timated cumulativ e cross over rates using Kaplan -Meier analysis was 68%. Men older than 65 years crossed over at a considerably higher rate than younger men (79% vs 62%). The most common reason for cross over was pain (54.1%).A total of 3 patients have req uired an emergency operation, but there has been no mortality. d. Conclusions Watchful waiting is an acceptable option for men with minimally symptomatic inguinal hernias. Delaying surgical repair until symptoms increase is safe because acute hernia incarcerations occur rarely. The later study added that patients should be counseled that symptoms will likely progress and an operation will eventually be needed. 3) Chung 2010, RCT of WW vs surgical rep air a. N=160 mean , with painless inguinal hernia (80 surgery, 80 WW) b. Mean follow -up of 7.5 years i. 42 men had died (19 in the observation and 23 in the operation group) ii. 46 of the 80 men randomized to observation had conversion to operation. iii. The estimated conversion rate (using the Kaplan -Meier method) for the observation group was 16 (95 per cent confidence interval 9 to 26) per cent at 1 year, 54 (42 to 66) per cent 5 years and 72 (59 to 84) per cent at 7.5 years. The main reason for conversion was pain i n 33 men, and two presented with an acute hernia. Sixteen men developed a new primary contralateral inguinal hernia and three had recurrent hernias. iv. Conclusion: Most patients with a painless inguinal hernia develop symptoms over time. Surgical repair is recommended for medically fit patients with a painless inguinal hernia. 4) Mizrahi 2012 , systematic review of WW vs surgery for inguinal hernia a. N=41 articles b. No significant difference in pain scores and general health status were found when comparing the patie nts who were followed up with the patients who had surgery. A significant crossover ratio ranging between 23% and 72% from watchful waiting to surgery was found. In patients with watchful waiting, the rates of IH strangulation were 0.27% after 2 years of f ollow -up and 0.55% after 4 years of follow -up. In patients who underwent elective surgery, the range of operative complications was 0% to 22.3% and the recurrence rate was 2.1%. c. Conclusion: Both treatment options for asymptomatic IH are safe, but most patients will develop symptoms (mainly pain) over time and will require operation. 5) Hwang 2014 , retrospective cohort study in NHS of WW vs sur gery for asymptomatic inguinal hernia a. NHS instituted a nationwide policy of WW for asymptomatic inguinal hernias in 2010 b. A total of 1,032 patients undergoing inguinal hernia repair in the 16 months after the policy change were compared with 978 patients in the 16 months before. 2018 Biennial Review Repair of Inguinal and Ventral Hernias 4 c. RESULTS The period after the policy change was associated with 59% higher odds of emergency repair (3.6% vs 5.5%, adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 1.59, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03 -2.47). In turn, emergency repair was associated with higher odds of adverse events (4.7% vs 18.5%, Fisher's exact test). d. CONCLUSIONS Introduction of a watchful waiting policy for asymptomatic inguinal hernias was associated with a significant increase in need for emergency repair, which was in turn associated with an increased risk of adverse e vents. Current policies may be placing patients at risk. 6) Van den Heuval 2011 , review of WW vs surgery for asymptomatic inguinal hernia a. The risk of incarceration is approximately 4 per 1,000 patients with a groin hernia per year. Risk factors for incarcerat ion are age above 60 years, femoral hernia site and duration of signs less than 3 months. b. The recurrence rate after tension -free mesh repair in the management of emergency groin hernias is comparable to that of elective repair. c. There is no divergence in p ain and quality of life after elective repair compared to watchful waiting. There is no advantage in cost -effectiveness of elective repair compared to watchful waiting. d. Conclusion Watchful waiting for asymptomatic groin hernias is a safe and cost - effective modality in patients who are under 50 years old, have an ASA class of 1 or 2, an inguinal hernia, and a duration of signs of more than 3 months . 1) INCA 2011 , review of WW vs surgery for inguinal hernias for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic inguinal hernia a. Mortality associated with elective hernia repair was investigated as a primary outcomes measure in 11 studies and as secondary outcomes measure in 65. Mean mortality associated with elective hernia repair was 0.2% (range 0% to 1.8%) b. Mortality associated with emergency hernia repair was investigated as a primary outcomes measure in 13 studies and as secondary outcomes measure in 7. Mean mortality associated with emergency hernia repair was 4.0% (range 0% to 22.2%) c. Rate of incarceration and/or strangulation has been investigated by 4 retrospective cohort studies as primary outcomes and 2 randomized trials as secondary outcomes. The yearly rate of irreducibility associated with a nonoperative approach was 0.4% (range 0.2% to 2.7%) d. The crossover f rom watchful waiting to operation has been reported by 2 randomized trials. Combining these figures, 13% (range 8.0% to 19.5%) of mild symptomatic and asymptomatic inguinal hernia patients assigned to watchful waiting management will cross over for inguina l hernia repair. e. A meta -analysis of long -term follow -up studies concerning recurrence is reported by inguinal hernia guideline of the European Hernia Society.Data of all trials with a follow -up of >48 months were reported comparing recurrences after Lichte nstein and endoscopic repair. We converted the observed probabilities of recurrence into annual rates, assuming a constant rate of recurrence. Because 2018 Biennial Review Repair of Inguinal and Ventral Hernias 5 no substantial difference in recurrence rate between the Lichtenstein technique and endoscopic repair was reported, we calculated a mean yearly recurrence rate of 0.9% (range 0.2% to 4.0%). f. Conclusions: the available data suggest that life expectancy for elderly male inguinal hernia patients associated with watchful waiting or operation differs very little. T herefore, the general doubt about operating on mild symptomatic and asymptomatic elderly hernia patients, illustrated by 2 recent randomized trials investigating pre and postoperative pain for these types of management, is justified. In case of asymptomati c and mild symptomatic patients, there seems to be no difference in pain relief between watchful waiting and operation. Ventral hernia repair, watchful waiting vs surgical repair 1) Bellows 2014 , longitudinal cohort study of WW a. N=41 patients i. 11 patients lost to follow up, 7 died of other causes b. 24 patients followed for 2 years i. 1 had incarceration ii. There was no deterioration in the AAS score (baseline vs 24 months 5 28 vs 25, P 5 0.60). There was deterioration of the physical functioning dimension of the SF -36 (baseline vs 24 months 5 40 vs 32, P \\0.01), but the mental functioning dimension was improved (45 vs 51; P 5 0.01). c. Conclusions: Watchful waiting was a safe option for patients in this study with ventral hernias. 2) Stey 2014 , cohort study of WW vs surgic al repair a. N=243 patients i. 80 were observed, 69 underwent repair of an incarcerated hernia, and 94 underwent repair of a nonincarcerated hernia. b. Quality of life as measured by utility score was less at 0.68 (95% CI, 0.65 -0.71) in patients who did not undergo repair compared with those after repair of a nonincarcerated hernia, 0.76 (95% CI, 0.73 -0.79; of a nonincarcerat ed hernia was cost -effective with an incremental cost effectiveness ratio of $8,646 per quality -adjusted lifeyear. c. Conclusion. The prompt elective repair of ventral hernias is cost -effective. 2018 Biennial Review Repair of Inguinal and Ventral Hernias 6 HERC staff summary ; Based on two large RCTs as well as seve ral meta -analyses, there appears to be a low r ate of progression of inguinal hernia to incarceration or obstruction. When obstruction or incarceration does occur, the complication rate for emergency surgery compared to elective repair appears to be simila r. It is important to note that these studies were all done in asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients, and patients who developed pain were no longer followed by watchful waiting. In several large studies, the rate of eventual surgical repair, ma inly due to the development of pain, was very high. The AHRQ report found that quality of life was significantly improved with surgical repair. Repair of inguinal hernia was not generally associated with improved function, but the functional measures may h ave been skewed by the repair of painful hernias . One cost study found no cost -effectiveness advantage in elective repair compared to watchful waiting. Based on several small studies, watchful waiting for ventral hernia appears to be a safe strategy that did not affect disability or quality of life. HERC staff recommendations : 1) Discuss what outcomes would lead to consideration for reprioritization of inguinal hernia repair a. Traditionally have only covered repair for children (higher risk of incarceration or other complication), and adu lts with obstruction, gangrene or otherwise complicated . Evidence still shows that watchful waiting is safe and that emergent repair has little increase in surgical complication compared to elective repair b. Does quality of life, pain, or function constitute an outcome which should lead to consideration for coverage? 2) Make no change in the current non -coverage of repair for ventral hernia a. Good evidence for lack of benefit for repair b.

GUIDELINE NOTE 24, COMPLICATED HERNIAS Lines 172,527 Complicated hernias are included on Line 172 if they cause symptoms of intestinal obstruction and/or strangulation. Incarcerated hernias (defined as non -reducible by physical manipulation) are also included on Line 172, excluding incarcerated ventral hernias. Incarcerated ventral hernias are included on Line 527, because the chronic inc arceration of large ventral hernias does not place the patient at risk for impending strangulation. 1 Comparative Effectiveness Review Number 70 Surgical Options for Inguinal Hernia: Comparative Effectiveness Review Executive Summary Background An inguinal hernia is a protrusion of abdominal contents into the inguinal canal through an abdominal wall defect. The lifetime rate of inguinal hernia is 25 percent in males and 2 percent in females.1 The risk of inguinal hernia increases with age, and the annual incidence is about 50 percent in males by the age of 75 years.2 Approximately 10 percent of cases are bilateral.3 In children, the incidence ranges from 0.8 to 4.4 percent.4 It is 10 times as common in boys as in girls and also more common in infants born before 32 weeks' gestation (13-percent prevalence) and in infants weighing less than 1,000 grams at birth (30-percent prevalence).4 Surgical repair of hernias is the most commonly performed general surgical procedure in the United States.5 In 2003, U.S. surgeons performed an estimated 770,000 surgical repairs5 of inguinal hernia. (Note, however, that a more recent study, presently in press, estimates the U.S. prevalence at 600,000 and asserts that approximately 42 percent of males will develop an inguinal hernia in their lifetime.6) These repairs are typically performed on an outpatient basis (87 percent in 1996).5 Effective Health Care Program The Effective Health Care Program was initiated in 2005 to provide valid evidence about the comparative effectiveness of different medical interventions. The object is to help consumers, health care providers, and others in making informed choices among treatment alternatives. Through its Comparative Effectiveness Reviews, the program supports systematic appraisals of existing scientific evidence regarding treatments for high-priority health conditions. It also promotes and generates new scientific evidence by identifying gaps in existing scientific evidence and supporting new research. The program puts special emphasis on translating findings into a variety of useful formats for different stakeholders, including consumers. The full report and this summary are available at www.effectivehealthcare. ahrq.gov/reports/final.cfm . Such a large volume of procedures suggests that even modest improvements in patient outcomes would have a substantial impact on population health.7 Effective Health CareEffective Health Care Program2 The primary goals of surgery include preventing strangulation, repairing the hernia, minimizing the chance of recurrence, returning the patient to normal activities quickly, and minimizing postsurgical discomfort and the adverse effects of surgery. The various surgeries include a constellation of benefits and risks, which presents some clinical uncertainty in the choice between approaches. Recurrence occurs in approximately 1 to 5 percent of cases.8 Balancing all the factors (e.g., recurrence, adverse events, time to return to work [RTW]) is a difficult yet critical process in making the best possible medical decisions. Surgical procedures for inguinal hernia repair generally fall into three categories: open repair without the use of a mesh implant (i.e., sutured), open repair with a mesh, and laparoscopic repair with a mesh. Within each of these categories, several specific procedures have been employed. Until the 1980s, open suture repair was the standard; however, the resulting tension along the suture line yielded relatively high rates of recurrence and patient discomfort. Nonsutured \"tension-free\" surgical mesh has gained in popularity, and many specific open procedures are used. One author estimates that in 2003, 93 percent of groin hernia repairs involved the use of a mesh, and of these, about three-fourths involved either a Lichtenstein repair or mesh plug.5 In the Lichtenstein procedure, surgeons suture the mesh in front of the hernia defect. Mesh plug repair involves a preshaped mesh plug that surgeons introduce into the hernia weakness during open surgery; they then position a piece of flat mesh on top of the hernia defect. The near-universal adoption of mesh means that the most important questions about hernia repair involve various mesh procedures. In terms of setting, most hernia surgeries are performed not in specialized hernia centers but by general surgeons who also perform many other types of surgeries.9 The laparoscopic surgical repair of inguinal hernia is generally recognized as a highly specialized skill, and patients receiving care from more experienced surgeons may fare better than patients receiving care from less experienced surgeons. This review specifically examines evidence on the association between laparoscopic surgical experience and hernia recurrence (See Key Questions below). The most commonly performed laparoscopic repair procedures are transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) repair and totally extraperitoneal (TEP) repair. During TAPP repair, surgeons enter the peritoneal cavity to place a mesh through an incision over the hernia site. With TEP surgery, surgeons do not enter the peritoneal cavity but use a mesh to cover the hernia from outside the peritoneum.Given the clinical uncertainty, a systematic review of the existing evidence on comparative effectiveness will help inform important medical decisions about surgical options for inguinal hernia. The findings of the review may affect clinical decisions by patients and surgeons, treatment recommendations by professional societies, purchasing decisions by hospitals, and coverage decisions by payers. Objectives We sought to thoroughly summarize the evidence pertaining to nine Key Questions (listed below and presented graphically in Figure A): Among adults with pain-free primary inguinal hernias: Key Question 1. Does hernia repair differ from watchful waiting in patient-oriented effectiveness outcomes and/or adverse events? Among adults with painful inguinal hernias without incarceration/strangulation: Key Question 2. Does open hernia repair with a mesh differ from laparoscopic hernia repair with a mesh in patient-oriented effectiveness outcomes and/or adverse events? a. For primary hernias? b. For bilateral hernias? c. For recurrent hernias? Key Question 3. Do different open mesh-based repair procedures (e.g., Lichtenstein repair, mesh plug) differ in patient-oriented effectiveness outcomes and/or adverse events? Key Question 4. Do different laparoscopic mesh-based repair procedures (e.g., transabdominal preperitoneal repair, totally extraperitoneal repair) differ in patient- oriented effectiveness outcomes and/or adverse events? Key Question 5. Do different mesh products differ in patient-oriented effectiveness outcomes and/or adverse events? Key Question 6. Do different mesh-fixation methods (e.g., no fixation, sutures, glue) differ in patient-oriented effectiveness outcomes and/or adverse events? Key Question 7. For each type of laparoscopic mesh repair, what is the association between surgical experience and hernia recurrence? Among pediatric patients (age 21 years or younger): Key Question 8. For a possible contralateral hernia, does same-operation repair/exploration differ from watchful 3waiting in patient-oriented effectiveness outcomes and/or adverse events? Key Question 9. Does open hernia repair without a mesh differ from laparoscopic hernia repair without a mesh in patient-oriented effectiveness outcomes and/or adverse events? Methods We developed and refined the topic in late 2010 in collaboration with five Key Informants: two hernia surgeons, two individuals from payer organizations, and one individual from a mesh manufacturer. The Key Questions were posted on the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Web site for public comments for 1 month. We finalized the review protocol in spring 2011 based on input from the public comment period and four Technical Experts (three hernia surgeons and a product specialist from a mesh manufacturer).Information professionals in the Evidence-based Practice Center Information Center performed literature searches and followed established guidelines and procedures as identified by the Director of Health Technology Assessment/Evidence-based Practice Center Information Center. We searched MEDLINE\u00ae and PreMEDLINE; Embase; the Cochrane Library, including the Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Database of Methodology Reviews, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, and the Health Technology Assessment Database; and the United Kingdom National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database. The searchers applied no limits on language, and search dates were January 1, 1990, to November 17, 2011. For inclusion in the review, we selected only full articles published in English.

Analytic framework Note: Circled numbers are Key Questions.4 have either randomly assigned patients to treatments or used an analytic method to address selection bias, such as intentional baseline matching on multiple characteristics, propensity scoring, or other analytic approach. Studies could be prospective or retrospective, but retrospective studies must have used consecutive enrollment (or enrollment of a random sample of eligible participants). The treatments being compared must have been administered during the same time period, so any observed difference between treatment outcomes were not attributable to differences in other aspects of care during different timeframes. For a study to be included for a given Key Question, at least 85 percent of its patients must have had the condition specified in the Key Question. The study must have reported data on at least one of the included outcomes for at least one of the Key Questions; outcome data must not have relied on retrospective recall; data must have included at least 6 months' followup for hernia recurrence, quality of life (QOL), and patient satisfaction (SFN); and data must have been reported on at least 10 patients with the condition of interest, who represented at least 50 percent of enrolled patients. From each included study, we extracted all important information. This included author, publication year, country, study design, number of centers, dates of patient enrollment, type of setting, length of followup, funding source, which Key Question(s) the study addressed, all authors' reported patient enrollment criteria, specific procedure, specific mesh (if applicable), fixation method (if applicable), number of surgeons, surgeons' length of experience with the repair procedures performed, surgical setting (i.e., specialized hernia center, general surgery), type of anesthesia, methods of followup for data collection, and all reported baseline characteristics. We also extracted the numerical data needed to compute an effect size (such as an odds ratio [OR] or standardized mean difference) and its standard error for all included outcomes for each study. We assessed the risk of bias (i.e., internal validity) separately for each outcome and each time point of each study using 15 risk-of-bias items, such as randomization, concealment of allocation, blinding of outcome assessors, and whether the surgeons had similar experience performing the study procedures. Some studies involved one surgeon performing different procedures, whereas other studies assigned surgeons to procedures. Based on these items, each data point from each study was assigned a risk-of-bias category of low, moderate, or high. This assessment was performed in duplicate, with disagreements resolved by consensus. Within each treatment comparison, we examined all included outcomes from all relevant studies. The outcomes were divided into the following eight categories: hernia recurrence; hospital-related information, including the length of hospital stay and subsequent hospital/office visits; the time to return to daily activities (RTDA); the time to RTW; QOL; patient SFN; pain, including visual analog scale scores and the rates of chronic pain; and other adverse events not involving pain. We performed meta-analysis if appropriate and possible. This decision depended on the judged clinical homogeneity of the different study populations, cointerventions, and outcomes, as well as whether studies reported the outcome in the same way. In the choice of effect size metrics, for hernia recurrence we used the relative risk (RR) because of its ease of interpretation and because some studies reported only an adjusted RR. Thus, only a relative-risk meta-analysis for hernia recurrence would include all the studies. For all continuous outcomes, we used the weighted mean difference, which is on the same scale as the measured outcome. For adverse events and pain reported dichotomously, we analyzed ORs. To aid interpretation, for each outcome in the review, we estimated the smallest difference between groups that could still be considered clinically significant (minimum clinically significant difference). For example, for the outcome of hernia recurrence, we defined the minimum clinically significant difference as 3 percentage points (e.g., 1 percent vs. 4 percent for two separate treatments). This definition aids interpretation in two main ways: (1) determining whether a statistically significant difference is important and (2) determining whether a statistically nonsignificant difference is small enough to exclude the possibility of an important difference. Our estimates were based on published literature, guidance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, input from the Technical Expert Panel, and the consensus of the research team. If meta-analysis was deemed appropriate and possible for a given comparison and a given outcome, we performed DerSimonian and Laird random-effects meta-analysis using comprehensive meta-analysis software (Biostat, Inc., Englewood, NJ). To measure heterogeneity, we used both I2 and tau. If there was substantial heterogeneity and 10 or more studies of the same patient outcome of the same treatment comparison were available, we conducted meta-regressions using a variety of predictors (e.g., whether the study used concealment of allocation).5For major comparisons and outcomes, we rated the strength of evidence using the Evidence-based Practice Center system described by Owens and colleagues.10 This system includes four core domains (risk of bias, consistency, precision, and directness) as well as four optional domains (large magnitude of effect, all plausible confounders would reduce the effect, publication bias, and dose-response association). The directness domain does not encompass applicability, which is considered outside the evidence rating system. The various domains were considered together using transparent rules to rate the evidence for the outcome as high, moderate, low, or insufficient. We performed strength-of-evidence rating for all Key Questions except Key Question 7, which did not involve comparing treatments but rather an assessment of the relationship between surgical experience and hernia recurrence. To assess applicability, we first abstracted data from each included study on factors that may affect the study's applicability. Using the PICOTS (populations, interventions, comparators, outcomes, timing, and setting) approach as a guide, we primarily focused on the three categories most relevant to inguinal hernia repair: Population\u2014demographic characteristics, comorbidity or general physical fitness, and types of hernia Intervention and comparators\u2014inguinal repair procedure being compared, timeframes of the procedure being performed, cointerventions, and experience of the surgical team Setting\u2014geographic and clinical factors Based on a review of the data abstracted, we narratively summarized any patterns reflected from these factors that might affect the applicability of the evidence. We made no attempt to generate any rating or score for the applicability of the evidence. Our narrative summaries are intended to draw stakeholders' attention to potential applicability issues embedded in the evidence. Results Searches identified 2,722 potentially relevant articles, and we excluded 1,878 of these at the abstract level (Figure B). We excluded another 621 articles at the full-article level, typically because of irrelevance to our Key Questions (252 publications), background/review/ commentary/protocol articles (80 publications), case- series design (81 publications), or nonrandomized designs with no control for selection bias (79 publications). The remaining 223 publications described 151 unique studies that we included in our review. The largest number of studies addressed Key Question 2a (38 studies), which compared open mesh repair with laparoscopic mesh repair in patients with primary inguinal hernia. We found other large evidence bases for Key Question 3 (comparing different procedures for open mesh repair, 21 studies), Key Question 5 (comparing meshes, 32 studies), Key Question 6 (comparing fixation methods, 23 studies), and Key Question 7 (the association between laparoscopic hernia repair experience and hernia recurrence, 32 studies). We included no studies for Key Question 8 (comparing surgical exploration vs. watchful waiting [WW] for pediatric contralateral inguinal hernia). We included 17 studies for multiple Key Questions (e.g., two studies were each included for four Key Questions) because they included three or more groups or reported subgroup analyses. Our synthesis of results included quantitative meta- analysis for seven of the Key Questions (2a, 2b, 2c, 3, 4, 5, and 6). We conducted these analyses only where reasonable and appropriate (i.e., similar patients, comparisons, outcomes). Meta-analyses allowed us to extract greater statistical power from the evidence. Key Question 1 (Repair Vs. Watchful Waiting for Pain-Free Hernia) Two studies met inclusion criteria. One compared WW with Lichtenstein repair, and the other compared WW with \"tension-free mesh repair\" (which might have been Lichtenstein repair). Both studies were considered to have moderate risk of bias for all outcomes reported. For this Key Question, we considered the following outcomes to be major: long-term QOL, which was reported as \"overall change in health status in previous 12 months\"; long-term pain; and acute hernia/ strangulation. The evidence was sufficient to permit a conclusion for one outcome: long-term QOL, for which the results favored repair over WW. Key Question 2a (Open Vs. Laparoscopic Repair, Primary Hernia) Thirty-eight studies met inclusion criteria. The most commonly compared specific surgical procedures were TAPP repair versus Lichtenstein (14 studies), TEP repair versus Lichtenstein (14 studies), TAPP repair versus mesh plug (3 studies), TEP repair versus mesh plug (3 studies), and TAPP repair/TEP repair versus Lichtenstein (4 studies). All but two studies (which were registry studies) were considered to have moderate risk of bias. 6 560: Not English language 516: Case series375: Did not address any Key Question 191: Background, commentary, protocol, guideline, or review44: Incarcerated or strangulated hernia43: Did not focus sufficiently on a patientpopulation of interest 6: Nonrandomized study that did not attempt to control for selection bias4: Exact duplicate of other included article 1: Abstract only 138: Other2,722 articles identified Abstracts reviewed Full articles reviewed1,878 articles excluded: 252: Did not address any Key Question 81: Case series 80: Background, commentary, protocol, guideline, or review79: Nonrandomized study that did not attempt tocontrol for selection bias18: Abstract only12: Did not attempt any outcomes of interest11: Did not focus sufficiently on a patientpopulation of interest8: Did not report data comparing the procedures1: Not English language1: Exact duplicate of other included article78: Other621 articles ecluded: Included 223 articles, describing 151 unique studies a KQ 1 (pain-free hernia): 2 studiesKQ 2a (open mesh vs. lap. mesh in primary hernia): 38 studiesKQ 2b (open mesh vs. lap. mesh in bilateral hernia): 6 studiesKQ 2c (open mesh vs. lap. mesh in recurrent hernia): 8 studiesKQ 3 (open mesh vs. open mesh): 21 studies KQ 4 (lap. mesh vs. lap. mesh): 11 studies KQ 5 (comparing meshes): 32 studiesKQ 6 (comparing mesh fixation methods): 23 studiesKQ 7 (surgical experience and hernia recurrence): 32 studiesKQ 8 (pediatric contralateral exploration vs. watchful waiting): 0 studiesKQ 9 (pediatric vs. open flap): 2 studiesFigure B. Literature flow diagram aThe counts for Key Questions add to more than the number of included studies because some studies were included for multiple Key Questions.7For this Key Question, we considered the following outcomes to be major: hernia recurrence, length of hospital stay, RTDA, RTW, QOL, SFN, long-term pain, injury, small-bowel obstruction, urinary retention, hematoma, and wound infection. The evidence was sufficient to permit the following conclusions: Results favored laparoscopy for five outcomes (RTDA, RTW, long-term pain, hematoma, and wound infection). Results favored open surgery for two outcomes (hernia recurrence and epigastric vessel injury). Results indicated approximate equivalence for one outcome (length of stay). Key Question 2b (Open Vs. Laparoscopic Repair, Bilateral Hernia) Six studies met inclusion criteria. Three studies compared TEP repair with the Stoppa procedure, two compared TAPP repair with Lichtenstein repair, and a Danish registry compared either TAPP repair or TEP repair with Lichtenstein procedure (authors combined data on TAPP repair and TEP repair procedures). We considered all but one study (which was the registry study) to have moderate risk of bias. For this Key Question, we considered as major the same outcomes as for Key Question 2a. The only outcome for which evidence was sufficient to permit a conclusion was RTW: patients with bilateral hernias returned to work sooner if they received laparoscopic repair. Key Question 2c (Open Vs. Laparoscopic Repair, Recurrent Hernia) Eight studies met our inclusion criteria. The open mesh procedure was the Lichtenstein repair in six studies and the Stoppa procedure in the other two studies. For the laparoscopic mesh procedure, two studies reported results of TAPP repair; two reported on TEP repair; in one other study, investigators performed both and reported data separately; and in the final three, the investigators performed both TAPP repair and TEP repair and combined the data. All but two studies (which were registry studies) were considered to have moderate risk of bias. For this Key Question, we considered as major the same outcomes as for Key Question 2a. The evidence favored laparoscopic repair over open repair for hernia recurrence (lower rates after laparoscopy), return to daily activities (faster after laparoscopy), and long-term pain (lower rates after laparoscopy). Key Question 3 (Comparing Different Types of Open Mesh Repair) Twenty-one studies met inclusion criteria. For this Key Question, we considered the following comparisons to be major: Lichtenstein repair versus mesh plug (seven studies), Lichtenstein versus Prolene Hernia System (PHS) (five studies), Lichtenstein versus open preperitoneal mesh (three studies), mesh plug versus PHS (two studies), and Lichtenstein versus Kugel\u00ae patch (two studies). Most studies were considered to have moderate risk of bias; a registry study was considered to have high risk of bias. For each comparison, we considered the following outcomes to be major: hernia recurrence, length of hospital stay, RTDA, return to work, short-term pain, intermediate- term pain, seroma, urinary retention, hematoma, and wound infection. Evidence was sufficient to permit the following conclusions: For Lichtenstein repair compared with mesh plug technique, recurrence rates were similar, but Lichtenstein yielded better results for RTW and rates of seroma. For Lichtenstein compared with PHS, outcomes for short-term pain were similar. For Lichtenstein compared with open preperitoneal mesh, outcomes for short-term pain were similar. For mesh plug compared with PHS, outcomes for short-term pain were similar. For Lichtenstein versus Kugel mesh, outcomes were similar for both short-term pain and intermediate-term pain. Key Question 4 (Comparing Different Types of Laparoscopic Mesh Repair) Eleven studies met inclusion criteria. For this Key Question, we considered only the comparison of TAPP repair versus TEP repair to be major (nine studies). The remaining two studies compared different variant types of TEP repair (one study) or TAPP repair versus intraperitoneal onlay mesh (one study). Most studies were considered to have moderate risk of bias.8 For the studies that compared TAPP repair versus TEP repair, we considered the following outcomes to be major: hernia recurrence, length of hospital stay, RTDA, RTW, short-term pain, intermediate-term pain, long- term pain, urinary retention, hematoma, and wound infection. Evidence was sufficient to permit the following conclusions: For TAPP repair compared with TEP repair, TAPP resulted in quicker RTW, and data on short-term, intermediate-term, and long-term pain suggested equivalence. Key Question 5 (Comparing Meshes) Thirty-two studies met inclusion criteria. For this Key Question, we considered the following seven comparisons to be major: standard polypropylene (PP) versus low- weight PP (6 studies), standard PP versus combination materials (17 studies), standard PP versus coated PP (6 studies), standard PP versus three-dimensional PHS (2 studies), standard PP versus porcine (2 studies), combination materials versus porcine (1 study), and low-weight PP versus combination materials (3 studies). Most evidence was considered to have moderate risk of bias. For this Key Question, we considered the following seven outcomes to be major: hernia recurrence, QOL, patient SFN, long-term pain, feeling of a foreign body, infection, and bleeding. Standard PP mesh and combination materials had similar rates of recurrence. Three types of meshes (standard PP, low-weight PP, and porcine) had approximately equivalent rates of long-term pain. Key Question 6 (Comparing Fixation Approaches) Twenty-three studies met inclusion criteria. For this Key Question, we considered five comparisons to be major: tacks or staples versus no fixation (seven studies), fibrin glue versus staples (three studies), sutures versus tacks (three studies), sutures versus glue (seven studies), and absorbable sutures (short or long term) versus nonabsorbable sutures (one study). Most studies were considered to have moderate risk of bias. For this Key Question, we considered as major the same outcomes as for Key Question 5. We found approximate equivalence in recurrence rates for tacks or staples versus no fixation and sutures versus glue. Also, for long-term pain, we found approximate equivalence between sutures and glue, but less pain with fibrin glue than staple fixation. Key Question 7 (Surgical Experience and Hernia Recurrence) Thirty-two studies met inclusion criteria. Sixteen involved only TEP repair, 12 involved only TAPP repair, 1 reported separate data on TEP repair and TAPP repair, and 3 provided combined data on TAPP repair and TEP repair. Most studies failed to report data that factored out the length of followup; patients treated earlier in the series might have had higher recurrence rates simply because they were followed longer. Some studies reported changing important procedural aspects over time, such as the size of the mesh (which typically involved using larger meshes in later time periods), making it difficult to pinpoint the true impact of expertise. Among studies comparing an early set with later set(s) of repairs, the size of the early set varied from a low of 10 repairs to a high of 825 repairs. It was unclear how authors chose their cutoff points. The reporting differences mean that one cannot use the data to estimate the length of the learning curve for TEP repair or TAPP repair. Most studies reported results in the expected direction: lower recurrence rates with increased experience. This was also true when examined more specifically for TEP repair (11 of 17 studies) and TAPP repair (11 of 13 studies). Key Question 8 (Exploration Vs. WW for Pediatric Hernia) No studies met inclusion criteria. Key Question 9 (Open Vs. Laparoscopic for Pediatric Hernia) Two studies met our inclusion criteria. One study enrolled patients aged 4 months to 16 years; the other study enrolled patients aged 3 months to 9 years. Both studies were considered to have moderate risk of bias. For this Key Question, we considered the following outcomes to be major: hernia recurrence, length of hospital stay, RTDA, and patient/parent SFN. The evidence was sufficient to permit the conclusions that length of stay, long-term patient SFN, and long-term cosmesis favored laparoscopy, and RTDA data suggested equivalence.

Discussion The typical adult in the included studies was a man in his mid-50s, of average weight, experiencing a primary unilateral hernia. About a quarter of the men worked in physically strenuous jobs; for these men, a durable repair is relatively important to prevent recurrence. Our review can inform numerous treatment decisions faced by these men and their providers, including: Whether to undergo surgery or wait Whether to choose open surgery or laparoscopic surgery Which type of open surgery to choose Which type of laparoscopic surgery to choose Which type of mesh and fixation approach to choose Consideration of expertise with laparoscopic hernia repair The evidence-based conclusions listed in the previous section are applicable only to the types of patients enrolled in the studies underlying those conclusions. For example, for Key Questions 2 to 7, a large majority of enrolled patients were middle-aged men; therefore, how well the conclusions apply to women or to men of other ages is uncertain. Similarly, for Key Question 9 on pediatric hernia, open versus laparoscopic high ligation, both studies excluded cases less than 3 months old, so it is uncertain whether the conclusions apply to patients younger than 3 months old. One limitation of this review is that we included only studies published in English. In an attempt to address this 10 Table A.

Another limitation of this review is that for many outcomes, the evidence was inconclusive because of low precision. Generally, the included studies were well conducted but small. We maximized the power of the data by conducting meta-analyses wherever appropriate and possible. Nevertheless, the data often precluded conclusions because they suggested contradictory conclusions (i.e., the evidence could favor option A or B by a clinically significant amount). A third limitation is that no studies met our inclusion criteria for Key Question 8 on pediatric contralateral hernia: no studies have compared surgical exploration with WW in this population. Therefore, we informally described some of the existing research in this area, such as the percentage of pediatric patients with a unilateral inguinal hernia who have a contralateral patent processus vaginalis (which is a risk factor for inguinal hernia). Future Research Needs We identified several gaps in the evidence in the course of conducting this review. We discuss potential areas for future research in greater detail in the full report but highlight some here that we consider particularly important. For adult inguinal hernia, it would be helpful to know recurrence rates over the very long term. The typical patient was middle-aged, presumably with a few decades of life ahead in which a hernia might recur. Studies have generally not reported recurrence rates past 5 to 10 years, but conceivably patients and clinicians would be interested in much longer timeframes (e.g., 30 years). Projection factors have been proposed (e.g., to estimate the 25-year recurrence rates, multiply the 1-year rate by 5); however, they have not been tested empirically. We also encourage greater focus on outcomes that matter most to patients, such as chronic pain, long-term QOL, SFN, and the feeling of a foreign body. These outcomes may be associated with the type of mesh or mesh fixation methods, or size and severity of the hernia, but our evidence review neither revealed nor ruled out potential influencing factors because of low precision. To characterize the gaps in the overall review, we examined the 87 comparisons and outcomes for which the evidence was insufficient to permit a conclusion and determined the primary reasons for the rating of insufficient. In 31/87 cases (36 percent), the only component preventing a conclusion was imprecision. Thus, quite often, there were simply not enough studies and/or the studies had insufficient patient enrollment. In a further 51/87 cases (60 percent), there was a problem with consistency as well as precision. Problems with consistency involved either the existence of only a single study (and therefore the inability to assess consistency) or conflicting results among multiple studies. In the remaining four cases, precision was sufficient, yet there were problems with both consistency and selective outcome reporting. Much of the existing literature on inguinal hernia has been conducted outside the United States. The differences in health care systems and practice patterns between the United States and other countries might have an impact on the applicability of the evidence from the perspectives Table A.

Future U.S. studies could elucidate issues unique to the United States and describe any important differences from other health care settings. While a surgical registry could be useful for this purpose, existing registries are limited in part because of their voluntary nature. A large registry could address the widespread problem of imprecision, mentioned above. Many randomized trials have investigated important questions, but their modest size limits their ability to detect rare events, such as hernia recurrence, which require much larger sample sizes to permit clear inferences. Registry data require sophisticated analytic techniques, such as propensity scores or instrumental variables, to reduce the impact of confounding resulting from selection bias. The registries that we assessed (e.g., Swedish Hernia Registry) were large (e.g., 143,000 hernias), but authors did not use these techniques, so it was difficult to determine the potential impact of selection bias. Specific recommendations for future research addressing the Key Questions appear in the full report, but we highlight some of them here. For Key Question 1, there were no studies of laparoscopic repair versus watchful waiting for pain-free hernia. Furthermore, the available comparative studies in the adult population did not report long-term outcomes that could be useful for decisionmaking, such as the risk of an eventual acute presentation (e.g., strangulation, incarceration) in an unrepaired pain-free hernia, the likelihood of recurrence for a repaired pain-free hernia, or the likelihood of developing pain or impairment in function in the long term with either repair or watchful waiting. In addition, there were no studies comparing surgical repair with watchful waiting in the pediatric population (Key Question 8). In the studies comparing mesh products and fixation methods, several important outcomes were infrequently reported, such as recurrence rates, perception of a foreign body, and long-term pain and infection rates.

WEBBER, P H.D., DAVID H. BERGER, M.D. From the *Department of Surgery, Tulane University, New Orleans, Louisiana; the Michael E. DeBakey Department of Surgery, Baylor College of Medicine, Michael E. DeBakey Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Houston, Texas; and Creighton University School of Medicine, Omaha, Nebraska Ventral hernias are a common clinical problem. Immediate repair is recommended for most ventral hernias despite significant recurrence rates. This practice may be related to a lack of un- derstanding of the natural history of ventral hernias. The purpose of this study was to determine the natural history of ventral hernias and to determine if watchful waiting is an acceptable andsafe option. Forty-one patients with ventral herni as were enrolled in a longitudinal cohort study of watchful waiting. Primary outcomes were functional impairment resulting from hernia disease as measured by the Activities Assessment Scale (AAS) and changes from baseline to two years in the physical and mental component score of the SF-36 Health Survey. Secondary outcomes includedcomplications such as incarceration. Mixed-effects model for repeated measures and Student's ttests were used to evaluate scale performance. The mean age of enrollees was 64 years, and the mean hernia size was 239 cm 2. Eleven patients were lost to follow-up, and seven patients died of other causes. All remaining patients were followed for two years. There was one incarceration during the follow-up period. There was no deterioration in the AAS score (baseline vs24 months 528 vs25,P50.60). There was deterioration of the physical functioning dimension of the SF-36 (baseline vs24 months 540vs32,P\\0.01), but the mental functio ning dimension was improved (45vs51;P50.01). Watchful waiting was a safe option for patients in this study with ventral hernias. THE CURRENT ACCEPTED treatment of ventral hernia is repair at diagnosis regardless of the presence of symptoms. The primary reason for this recommendationis to prevent the development of a hernia accident, de-fined as either strangulation of hernia contents or bowelobstruction. Another reason ventral hernias are repairedat diagnosis is to address the generally accepted conceptthat hernia repairs become more difficult with time asa result of chronic scarring and enlargement. Addition- ally, there is the belief that hernia repair will improve the patient's quality of life. As a result, over 200,000 ventralhernias are performed annually in the United States ata cost of nearly $3.2 billion every year. 1Although usually considered a low-risk operation, incisional her-nia repair is associated with morbidity (up to 60%),mortality (up to 5.3%), frequent complications such aswound infection and cardiovascular abnormalities, reoperations, readmissions, and time off from work. 2-4 For years physicians and their patients have struggled with a decision to undergo surgical repair of their in-guinal hernias when they were minimally symptomaticbecause of a lack of knowledge concerning the natural history of an untreated inguinal hernia. A better un- derstanding of the natural history has now been obtainedafter a large prospective randomized trial sponsored bythe American College of Surgeons. 5This was a multi- center trial in which patients were assigned to routinerepair or watchful waiting (WW). The risk of a herniaaccident (strangulation or bowel obstruction) was foundto be quite low in the WW group (1.8 per 1000 patient- years) and quality-of-life measures showed no differ- ence at two years between the two groups. These datahave allowed patients with inguinal hernia to avoidunnecessary surgery and have undoubtedly saved thehealthcare system millions of dollars annually. A strategy of WW for minimally symptomatic ventral hernias would be a logical next consideration.However, data regarding the natural history of un- treated ventral hernias are lacking just as it was for inguinal hernias before the trial described. Currentlya multicenter trial comparing WW versus routine repair funded by the German Research Foundation isaccruing patients with ''oligosymptomatic'' ventralhernias. 6Anticipating tha t results from that trial will n o tb ea v a i l a b l ef o ry e a r s ,w er e p o r tt h er e s u l t so fa prospective longitudinal cohort study of 41 patientsAddress correspondence and reprin t requests to Charles F.

The aim of this study was to determine the long-term outcome of patients with a painless inguinal herniarandomized to observation or operation. Methods: Some 160 men aged 55 years or more with a painless inguinal hernia were randomized to observation or operation between 2001 and 2003. All were invited to attend a research clinic at 6 and12 months, and 5 years after randomization. Those unable to attend for clinical review were sent aquestionnaire based on the clinical review pro forma. Results: After a median follow-up of 7 \u00b75( r a n g e6 \u00b72-8 \u00b72) years, 42 men had died (19 in the observation and 23 in the operation group); 46 of the 80 men random ized to observation had conversion to operation. The estimated conversion rate (using the Kaplan-Meier method) for the observation group was 16(95 per cent condence interval 9 to 26) per cent at 1 year, 54 (42 to 66) per cent 5 years and 72 (59 to 84) per cent at 7 \u00b75 years. The main reason for conversion was pain in 33 men, and two presented with an acute hernia. Sixteen men developed a new primary contralateral inguinal hernia and three hadrecurrent hernias. There have been 90 inguinal hernia repairs in the 80 patients randomized to surgery compared with 56 in those randomized to observation. Conclusion: Most patients with a painless inguinal hernia develop symptoms over time. Surgical repair is recommended for medically t patients with a painless inguinal hernia. Presented to the International Surgical Congress of the Asso ciation of Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland, Liverpool, UK, April 2010 Paper accepted 14 October 2010 Published online 30 November 2010 in Wiley Online Library (www.bjs.co.uk). DOI: 10.1002/bjs.7355 Introduction The lifetime risk of inguinal hernia is 27 per cent in men and 3 per cent in women1. Inguinal hernia repair is one of the most common general surgical operations, carriedout in 10 per 10 000 of the population per annum in theUK and 28 per 10 000 in North America 2. Hernias are a socioeconomic burden, with 13 per cent of individualstaking time off work because of the hernia, and almost 30 per cent indicating that the hernia interferes with their leisure activities 3. Previous studies have demonstrated that up to one-third of patients presenting with an inguinal hernia have fewsymptoms 3. The major concern with surgical repair in these patients is that some may go on to develop chronicpostoperative groin pain. This can be debilitating, and in 3-6 per cent affects their work and leisure activities4-7. Two randomized trials have addressed the issue of chronic pain after surgery in patients with no pain orminimal symptoms from a primary inguinal hernia 8-1 0. Both trials showed no increase in chronic pain in patientswho had early surgery compared with that in patients undergoing initial observation. Both trials also reported on the rate of crossover to operation for symptoms in patientsinitially randomized to observation. In one 10, 28 per cent of patients had crossed over to operation after a median of574 days, and in the other 923 per cent had crossed over at 2-year follow-up. The difference may be explained by the inclusion criteria for the respective trials. In the UK study10, only patients with a visible hernia on standing 2010 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd British Journal of Surgery 2011; 98: 596-599 Published by John Wiley & Sons of patients wi th a painless inguinal hernia 597 were included, whereas in the US study940 per cent of patients had a palpable cough impulse only. The issue of what might happen to patients with minimal symptoms from their hernia in the longer term was notaddressed by either trial 9,10. The aim of the present study was to examine the long-term outcome of patients with nopain from their inguinal hernia randomized to observationor early operation. Methods Informed consent was obtained from men aged 55 yearsor above with an asymptomatic inguinal hernia between2001 and 2003 for randomization to early hernia repair or observation. Men who were unt for local anaesthetic hernia repair or who had an irreducible inguinal herniawere excluded. Patients randomized to operation had atension-free mesh repair under local or general anaesthetic.The men were given a contact number in the eventthat their hernia became symptomatic or there were anyrelated concerns. Patients in both groups were invited forexamination at 6 and 12 months after randomization. Theprimary outcome at 12 months from this trial has already been published 10. The hospital database was investigated to identify any deaths since the last review, to avoid family distress. All patients known to be alive were invited to attend a researchclinic for a clinical review by a research fellow, a minimumof 5 years after randomization. Clinical review was basedon a pro forma, which included history, examination andthe completion of a questionnaire on pain, symptoms andoutcome from the inguinal hernia or inguinal hernia repair.Twenty men who could not attend had a telephone reviewand were sent questionnaires based on the research clinicreview pro forma to complete. Statistical analysis The original study was powered to address the primaryendpoint of pain at 1 year 10. Baseline data were tabulated by treatment group (observation or operation). Categorical data were compared between the two groups by 2 test. Continuous data were given as mean(s.d.) and compared using t tests or ANOVA. In those randomized toobservation, a Kaplan-Meier curve was plotted for time tocrossover from observation to surgery. Survival curves forboth groups were also plotted and compared using the logrank test. All analyses were carried out using SAS version 9.1 for Windows (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina,USA). P<0\u00b7050 was considered statistically signicant.Results On initial recruitment, there were 232 eligible men with an asymptomatic inguinal hernia, of whom 160 agreed to ran-domization ( Fig. 1 ). There were no signicant differences in patient demographics or clinical characteristics between the observation and operation groups 10. After a median follow-up of 7 \u00b75( r a n g e6 \u00b73-8 \u00b73) years, 42 men had died, 19 in the observation and 23 in the operation group; their median age at death was 82 (range 61-90) years. Most deaths were due to cardiovasculardisease or cancer. No patient died secondarily to anacute hernia, although one man in the observation group died from acute myocardial infarction after elective hernia repair. There was no difference in overall survival betweenthe two randomized groups ( P=0\u00b7459). Eighty-seven men attended for clinical examination; 20 were unable to attend, but completed a questionnaire. Crossover from observation to surgery Forty-six of the 80 men in the observation group crossedover to surgery during follow-up. Estimated conversionrates for the observation group were 16 (95 per centcondence interval (c.i.) 9 to 26) per cent after 1 year, 32 (23 to 44) per cent after 2 years, 54 (42 to 66) per cent after 5 years, and 72 (59 to 84) per cent after 7 \u00b75 years (Fig. 2 ). The most common reason for conversion was pain: 33 of 46 men. Twenty-two men noted an increase in the size of their hernia during follow-up, but in onlyve was this the sole indication for the surgery. Six menrequested repair as they felt that, although painless, the hernia was affecting their quality of life. Two patients presented with an acute hernia for repair, but neitherrequired bowel resection. The estimated median time between randomization and conversion (the point at which 50 per cent of the observation group had been converted)was 1678 (95 per cent c.i. 1274 to 2059) days. At a median follow-up of 5 years the median visual analogue scale (VAS) pain scores were 1 (range 0-44) mm at rest and 1 (range 0-30) mm on movement in theoperation group compared with 1 \u00b75 (range 0-46) and 1\u00b75 (0-62) mm in the men randomized to no operation. There was no signicant difference in pain scores betweenthe two groups. Contralateral or recurrent hernia During follow-up 16 men developed a new primarycontralateral inguinal hernia, eight in each group. Allpatients in the surgery group requested to have the contralateral inguinal hernia repaired.

Of 143 inguinal hernia repairs in the study, three men (2\u00b71 per cent) developed a recurrence, two in the operationand one in the observation group; all went on to have a further repair. Discussion This study has conrmed previous ndings3that most patients with minimal symptoms from an inguinal hernia develop pain over time. Pain was the most common reasonfor requesting operation, followed by effect on quality oflife and an increase in size of the hernia. The estimated conversion rate of 72 per cent at 7 \u00b75 years was similar to the rate of 90 per cent at 10 years predicted from the previousstudy 3. Only two of the 80 patients in the observation group had an acute presentation. This may, however, indicate that the lifetime risk of acute presentation for conservatively managed inguinal hernia is higher than previously thought.Fitzgibbons and colleagues 8estimated that the lifetime risk of strangulation without operation for a 72 year old was one in 2941. In the present study the mean age was 72 years at inclusion in the observation group10and these patients were followed for just 469 patient years.Although it may not be safe to extrapolate this risk of acute presentation to all age groups, the nding from this study 2010 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd www.bjs.co.uk British Journal of Surgery 2011; 98: 596-599 Published by John Wiley & Sons of patients wi th a painless inguinal hernia 599 is important because population-based studies indicate a tenfold increase in postoperative mortality associated withan acute operation 11 - 13. If a strategy of follow-up only for patients over 55 years with a painless hernia were adopted, based on the presentdata this would reduce the number of hernia operations byless than 10 per cent over the long term. Any cost savingsfrom this policy would have to be balanced against a smallincrease in morbidity and mortality from acute surgery.Delaying elective operation until the patient is older mayalso increase the risk of perioperative mortality 12. The recent guidelines published by the European Hernia Society14recommend that watchful waiting is an acceptable option for men with minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic inguinal hernia. However, they recognized that the results from the two controlled trials published in2006 9,10were not conclusive. The authors came to different conclusions: one group suggested that watchful waitingwas safe and acceptable, whereas the other indicated thatrepairing asymptomatic hernias did not cause chronicpain, improved general health and might reduce potentialpostoperative morbidity. The present long-term follow-up should help clarify some of the uncertainties; thereseems little point in watchful waiting because the majorityof patients will require an operation in the foreseeablefuture. One of the drawbacks of this study is that the results may not be generalizable to other regions. Many patients withan inguinal hernia in the UK have known that they have ahernia for a number of years before attending their doctor.Indeed, in this study, patients had their hernia for a meanof 3 years before attending a surgical clinic 10. In addition, rates of operation for inguinal hernia vary widely2.T h i s is unlikely to be related to differences in the prevalenceof this condition, and probably reflects the attitudes ofpatients and clinicians to intervention. Operation on aninguinal hernia that is not visible or palpable on standing is uncommon in the UK. In the US study, this accounted for 40 per cent of patients included in the trial 9. The natural history of such hernias is unknown, in particular whatproportion will progress to a visible symptomatic inguinalhernia. Acknowledgements This study was funded by the Scottish Executive.

O'Dwyer Commentary Long-term follow-up of patients with a painless inguinal hernia from a clinical 98: 596-599) Despite inguinal hernia repair being one of the most common operations and the fact that many are asymptomatic, the scientic evidence to provide valid recommendations concerni ng early repair or watchful waiting until symptoms occur continues to be debated1,2. In addition, the overall information available includes only about 400 patients, with about 25 per cent having surgery 2 years after watchful waiting, but 72 per cent after 7 \u00b75 years of observation1,2. The risk of death after an acute operation for strangulated hernia will require more data, in contrast to conclusive data that electiverepair is extremely safe, especially when performed under local anaesthesia. The overall cost benet with watchful waiting seems to be limited, at least based on the Scottish study 1. One argument for not repairing an asymptomatic inguinal hernia is the risk of persistent postoperative pain, although this r isk was not signicantly different between the two treatment approaches1,2. However, there are opportunities for identifying patients at high risk of persistent pain and optimizing surgical technique to reduce this complication3, which should be considered in the future approach to the asymptomatic inguinal hernia. In summary, I tend to agree with Chung and colleagues1that an inguinal hernia repair is recommended in patients with a painless hernia, but taking into consideration whether the patient is at high risk of persistent pain3, the use of the safest anaesthesia (local inltration) in patients with co-morbiditi es, the surgical technique (laparoscopy) with the lowest risk of nerve damage3, and estimated life expectancy.

Context Many men with inguinal hernia have minimal symptoms. Whether defer\u00ad ring surgical repair is a safe and acceptable option has not been assessed. Objective To compare pain and the physical component score (PCS) of the Short Form-36 Version 2 survey at 2 years in men with minimally symptomatic inguinal her\u00ad nias treated with watchful waiting or surgical repair. Design, Setting, and Participants Randomized trial conducted January 1, 1999, through December 31,2004, at 5 North American centers and enrolling 720 men (364 watchful waiting, 356 surgical repair) followed up for 2 to 4.5 years. Interventions Watchful-waiting patients were followed up at 6 months and annu\u00ad ally and watched for hernia symptoms; repair patients received standard open tension\u00ad free repair and were followed up at 3 and 6 months and annually. Main Outcome Measures Pain and discomfort interfering with usual activities at 2 years and change in PCS from baseline to 2 years. Secondary outcomes were com\u00ad plications, patient-reported pain, functional status, activity levels, and satisfaction with care . Results Primary intention-to-treat outcomes were similar at 2 years for watchful waiting vs surgical repair: pain limiting activities (5.1% vs 2.2%, respectively; P=52); PCS over baseline, 0.29 points vs 0.13 points; P=.79). Twenty-three percent of patients assigned to watchful waiting crossed over to receive surgical repair (increase in hernia-related pain was the most common reason offered); 17% assigned to receive repair crossed over to watchful waiting. Self-reported pain in watchful-waiting patients crossing over improved after repair. Occurrence of postop\u00ad erative hernia-related complications was similar in patients who received repair as assigned and in watchful-waiting patients who crossed over. One watchful-waiting patient (0.3 %) experienced acute hernia incarceration without strangulation within 2 years; a second had acute incarceration with bowel obstruction at 4 years, with a frequency of 1.8/1000 patient-years inclusive of patients followed up for as long as 4.5 years. Conclusions Watchful waiting is an acceptable option for men with minimally symp\u00ad tomatic inguinal hernias. Delaying surgical repair until symptoms increase is safe be\u00ad cause acute hernia incarcerations occur rarely.

Men with mini\u00ad mally symptomatic chronically incarcer\u00ad ated hernias were not excluded. Partici\u00ad pants were recruited from 5 community and academic centers (Creighton Uni\u00ad versity, Omaha VA Medical Center, ofT Cen\u00ad ter, VA Medical Center, Dallas; and Lovelace Clinic, Albuquerque, NM). Enrollment of eligible patients began on January 1, 1999, and took place over 2.5 years; patients were followed up for a minimum of 2 years. The trial ended on December 31, 2004. The study was designed to assess primary outcomes at 2 years. Patients enrolled early in the trial were followed up for as long as 4.5 years (median, 3.2 years). Recruitment Men were referred by primary care phy\u00ad sicians or other surgeons or were self\u00ad referred in response to public adver\u00ad tising. Approximately half of the men screened were not eligible for the trial, and 55% of eligible patients declined to give consent to be randomized (FIGURE 1). Information on race/ ethnicity was gathered to ensure that a spectrum of individuals was repre\u00ad sented in this trial. Race/ethnicity were indicated by the patient on a standard form with choices as defined by the US Census Bureau: Hispanic/Latina or non\u00ad Hispanic, white, black or African\u00ad American, Asian, native Hawaiian or Pa\u00ad cific Islander, or American Indian or native Alaskan.

The randomization scheme was developed by the study.biostatis\u00ad tician and allocated treatments in random block sizes of 2, 4, or 6. Ran\u00ad domization was accomplished by a computer-generated permuted ran\u00ad dom sequence and assigned by the Vet\u00ad erans Administration (VA) Coopera\u00ad tive Studies Program Coordinating Center, Hines, Ill. After the patient sat\u00ad isfied all inclusion criteria and pro\u00ad vided written informed consent, the site coordinator telephoned the VA coor\u00ad dinating center to request that the pa\u00ad tient be assigned. Patients were as\u00ad signed to either watchful waiting or surgical repair in equal proportions. Be\u00ad cause of the obvious identity of the study groups, treatment allocation was not blinded to patients or surgeons. Interim unblinclecl reports were pro\u00ad vided to the data and safety monitor\u00ad ing board (DSMB) for safety monitor\u00ad ing, but all site investigators were blinded to interim outcome compari\u00ad sons until all patients had undergone their final evaluation. Protocol and con\u00ad sent forms were approved by the Hines V A/North Chicago VA Human Stud\u00ad ies Subcommittee and by each site's in\u00ad stitutional review board. Detern:.ination of Outcomes The primary outcomes were pain and discomfort interfering with usual ac\u00ad tivities 2 years after enrollment and change from baseline to 2 years in the physical component score (PCS) of the WATCHFUL \u00b7wAITING VS REPAIR OF INGUINAL HERNIA Short related quality-of-life survey.10 Pain in\u00ad terfering with activities was defined as the selection of a level 3 or 4 response to questions with 4 choices: (J.) no pain or discomfort clue to the hernia or her\u00ad nia operation; (2) mild pain that does not interfere with activities; (3) mod\u00ad erate or ( 4) severe levels of pain that interfere with usual activities. These patient-reported variables were mea\u00ad sured at baseline and at the 6-month and annual visits. Postoperative complications of sur\u00ad gical repair were assessed at the 2-week visit and as needed for 3 months. Long\u00ad term complications, including hernia recurrence, were assessed at the 6-month and annual visits.7 Life\u00ad threatening complications were de\u00ad fined prior to the start of the study and were assessed for up to 30 clays after surgical repair. Secondary outcomes included com\u00ad plications, as well as patient-reported outcomes of pain (assessed using four 150-mm visual analog surgical pain scales to measure sensory and emo\u00ad tional aspects of hernia-related painll), functional status (using the Short Form-36 Version 2 ac\u00ad tivity levels (using the Activities As\u00ad sessment Scale13), and satisfaction with care (using a 5-point Likert scale). These were measured at baseline, 6 months, and annually. Pain was also as\u00ad sessed at the time of crossover in pa\u00ad tients assigned to watchful waiting who ultimately received surgical repair. Statistical Analysis The sample size of 720 randomly as\u00ad signed patients had more than 91% power for each of the primary out\u00ad comes at 2 years to detect a 10% dif\u00ad ference in the proportion of patients with pain interfering with activities and an 8-point difference in the PCS change from baseline levels, allowing an over\u00ad all 2-sicled type I error rate of 5% and 4 interim analyses of the primary end points. All final analyses and associ\u00ad ated confidence intervals for primary and secondary outcomes were ad\u00ad justed for interim monitoring.14 Baseline characteristics were com\u00ad pared across groups using a x2 test or the Fisher exact test for categorical vari\u00ad ables and t test or analysis of variance for continuous variables. Primary analyses comparing watch\u00ad ful waiting with surgical repair for 2-year outcomes were performed on an intention-to-treat basis. Rates for pain interfering with activities at 2 years were compared using O'Brien-Fleming se\u00ad quential proportion tests. Changes in PCS were compared using O'Brien\u00ad Fleming sequential z tests.14 Some patients assigned to watchful waiting requested and received surgi\u00ad cal repair, and some patients assigned to receive surgical repair refused sur\u00ad gery and were treated with watchful waiting. Therefore, as an exploratory analysis, primary and seconda1y out\u00ad comes were also examined to account for the intervention received (as\u00ad treated analyses). Time-to-crossover es\u00ad at termination tion or at completion of follow-up. Sta\u00ad tistical testing of 2-year primary and secondary outcomes used the Dunnett t test to account for multiple compari\u00ad sons of the reference group receiving sur\u00ad gical repair as assigned with the other as-treated groups.16 Statistical tests were not adjusted for comparisons related to multiple secondary end points. Analy\u00ad ses were performed using SAS version 8.0 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). Organization and Monitoring The principal investigator (R.].F.) vis\u00ad ited each site within the first few months to ensure compliance with study protocols. An executive commit\u00ad tee, independent DSMB, and the Hines VA/North Chicago VA Human Stud\u00ad ies Subcommittee provided oversight of the study. Site institutional review boards reviewed the study annually. Pa\u00ad tient follow-up was deficient in 1 of the original sites, prompting an indepen\u00ad dent audit of all sites. All data from the single deficient site were purged, the site was dropped from the study, and anal\u00ad ternate site activatecl.7 \u00a92006 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.

Eighty-five (23%) of 364 patients assigned to watchful waiting had received surgical repair within 2 years, and 62 (17%) of356 pa\u00ad tients assigned to receive surgical re\u00ad pair did not undergo repair (Figure 1).

Most patients (86%) were white; 5% were black; and 9\u00b0/c> were Asian, mixed race, or gave no response. Operative Findings In patients receiving surgical repair and those assigned to watchful waiting who crossed over to receive surgical repair, hernia types were determined at time of repair using the Nyhus classifica\u00ad tionY Among spinal anesthesia in 10%, and local anesthesia in 37%. Fourteen percent of patients receiving surgical repair had bilateral repair. Seven patients had missing operative data. Complications and Deaths The rate of complications was similar among those who were assigned to and received surgical repair (21. 7%) and those assigned to watchful waiting who crossed over to receive surgical repair (27.9%) (P= .30). Three intraopera\u00ad tive complications (a wound hema\u00ad toma requiring return to the operat\u00ad ing room, postanesthetic hypertension, and an ilioinguinal nerve injury) were reported in all patients who received surgical repair (0.8%). Postoperative complications (90 events) reported in 85 patients (22.3%) included wound hematomas (23 [ mas minor com\u00ad plications (22 [5.8%]). One life\u00ad threatening complication occurred in each of 3 patients receiving surgical re\u00ad pair: postoperative tion. By 2 years, recurrence of the her\u00ad nia had occurred in 3 patients (1.0%) assigned to receive surgical repair and in2 patients (2.3%) assigned to watch\u00ad ful waiting who crossed over to re\u00ad ceive surgical repair (P = .31). When as\u00ad sessed at 3 months postoperatively, 13 patients (3.4%) receiving surgical re\u00ad pair experienced groin pain and 2 pa\u00ad tients (0.5%) experienced leg pain. One acute hernia incarceration with\u00ad out strangulation occurred in a watch\u00ad ful-waiting patient 4 months after en\u00ad rollment; emergency surgical repair was complicated by a wound hematoma. There were 22 deaths among enrolled patients (1.0 among surgical repair and 12 among watchful-waiting patients, P=.70), with 15 occurring within 2 years (7 among surgical repair and 8 among watchful-waiting patients, P= .83); none of the deaths were attrib\u00ad uted to the study. Outcomes at 2 Years Of the original 364 watchful-waiting ancl356 surgical repair patients, 21 and 28 died or withdrew consent within 2 years, respectively, leaving 94.2% and 92.1% who could have been evaluated at 2 years. Of these, 7 and 11 in the watchful-waiting and surgical repair groups, respectively, were lost to follow\u00ad up, leaving 92.3% and 89.0% who com\u00ad pleted 2-year follow-up and who were included in analyses of the primary and secondary outcomes. Primary Outcomes. At 2 years, in\u00ad tention-to-treat analyses showed that 288 JAMA, janua1y 18, 2006-Vol 295, No. 3 (Reprinted) \u00a92006 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.

Mean 2-year PCS change from baseline was not significantly different: watchful\u00ad waiting patients improved by 0.29 points (of 100) and surgical repair pa\u00ad tients improved by 0.13 points (differ\u00ad ence, 0.16; 95% confidence interval, -1.2 to 1.5) (FIGURE 3). A sensitivity analysis adjusting for stratification fac\u00ad tors and imbalance in baseline charac\u00ad teristics (ie, body mass index, Activi\u00ad ties Assessment Scale, and recent hernia enlargement) yielded almost identical results. In the as-treated analyses, 4 7.1% of pa\u00ad tients assigned to watchful waiting who crossed over to receive surgical repair had developed pain that interfered with their activities at the time of crossover. Eighty-six percent reported some de\u00ad gree of pain and discomfort as their rea\u00ad son for requesting repair. By the time of the 2-year interview; however, the per\u00ad centage ofpatientswho with activity was not signifi\u00ad cantly greater in the patients who had crossed over (8.6% in the crossover group vs 1.5% in the group receiving sur\u00ad gical repair as assigned; difference, 7.1 %; 95% confidence interval, -0.63% to 14.99%) (Figure 2). Patients assigned to watchful waiting who crossed over tore\u00ad ceive surgical repair reported signifi\u00ad cantly larger improvement from base\u00ad line in PCS relative to patients receiving surgical repair as assigned (difference, 2.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.01 to 5.0; P=.Ol) (Figure 3). Secondary Outcomes at 2 Years. Both groups had less pain at 2 years than at baseline. The amount of change from baseline in pain while at rest, during normal activities, and during work or exercise did not differ between the in\u00ad tention-to-treat groups. The reduc\u00ad tion in perception of pain unpleasant\u00ad ness was significantly greater for patients receiving surgical repair than for those receiving watchful waiting (surgical repair, -6.2 mm vs watchful WATCHFUL \u00b7wAITING VS REPAIR OF INGUINAL HERNIA waiting, -2.3 mm; difference, mm; 0.8 to 7.0 mm; P= .01).

Patients also reported on their ability to perform a spectrum of everyday ac\u00ad tivities. In all categories of activities, in\u00ad tent-to-treat analyses indicated that pa\u00ad tients receiving surgical repair showed significantly greater improvement than did watchful-waiting patients. More than 97% of patients in both treatment groups were satisfied or very satisfied with the care they received. Outcomes at Last Follow-up The mean (SD) time to crossover was 2 7.2 (13. 7) months (median, 24.4 months); beyond 2 years, the cross\u00ad over rate was 4% per year (FIGURE 4). Of the 379 patients who underwent hernia repair, 20 were lost to follow-up or withdrew consent and 5 died. Of the 354 remaining patients, 1.4% had are\u00ad cunence (n=5), with a rate of0.0045 re\u00ad currences per patient-year. All randomly assigned patients were considered at risk for acute incarcera\u00ad tion without strangulation until herni\u00ad orrhaphy was performed. Acute her\u00ad nia incarceration occurred in 1 patient (0.3%) within 2 years of assignment to watchful waiting, and 1 acute hernia in\u00ad carceration with bowel obstruction oc\u00ad curred at 4 ina watchful-waiting patient; this was reduced with seda\u00ad tion and repaired electively. The her\u00ad nia accident rate was 0.0018 events per patient-year. COMMENT Watchful waiting is a reasonable op\u00ad tion for men whose inguinal hernia is years af\u00ad ter randomization, similar propor\u00ad tions of patients in the watchful\u00ad waiting and surgical repair groups had pain sufficient to limit usual activities, and their levels of physical function\u00ad ing were similar. Patients assigned to watchful waiting who requested surgi\u00ad cal repair most commonly reported in\u00ad creased pain as the reason for the cross\u00ad over, and nearly half reported that pain interfered with nonnal activities. These symptoms improved for most patients after hernia repair. 290 JAMA, january 18, 2006-Vol 295, No. 3 (Reprinted) \u00a92006 American Medical Association. All rights reserved. Downloaded From: http://jama.jamanetwork.com/ by a Oregon Health & Science University User on 03/31/2016 Hernia accidents were extremely un\u00ad common (rate of 1.8 per 1000 patient\u00ad years). Others have suggested that her\u00ad nia accidents are more common in elderly patients, many of whom are un\u00ad aware of their diagnosis and have not sought surgical care.518 In a review of the VA database (W. Henderson, PhD, National Surgical Quality Improve\u00ad ment Program, written communica\u00ad tion, 2005), the mean age of patients having hernia emergencies was 77 years, and the rate of death after repair was found to be only 2.2%. The low ac\u00ad cident rate of 1.8 per 1000 patients per year found in this strategy, the low mor\u00ad tality rate associated with surgical re\u00ad pair, and the similar pain and health outcomes identified at 2 years suggest that deferring surgery for men with\u00ad out troublesome symptoms is a reason\u00ad able option. By 2 years, 23% of our watchful\u00ad waiting patients crossed over to re\u00ad ceive surgical repair. We had antici\u00ad pated that progression of symptoms in some men assigned to watchful wait\u00ad ing would lead them to request repair. Unexpectedly, nearly the same propor\u00ad tion of men assigned to receive repair (17%) did not have the operation, de\u00ad spite being well informed that partici\u00ad pation in thisstudywould give them a 50% chance of being directed to an op\u00ad erative intervention. Crossovers from watchful waiting to surgical repair con\u00ad tinued to the close of the study, reach\u00ad ing 31% at 4 years. We explored some of the differ\u00ad ences in characteristics and outcomes between the as-treated groups. It ap\u00ad peared that certain baseline character\u00ad istics of patients assigned to watchful waiting who requested surgical repair differed from those of the other groups. At baseline, these patients reported high levels of sensory and affective pain dur\u00ad ing their normal activities (as mea\u00ad sured by the hernia-specific Surgical Pain Scale11) and had impaired physi\u00ad cal function (as measured by the PCS of the Short Form-36 Version 2). Pros\u00ad tatism was also common. The men as\u00ad signed to surgical repair who did not undergo repair may have been less WATCHFUL WAITING VS REPAIR OF INGUINAL HERNIA healthy than patients in other groups, as indicated by a somewhat higher American Society of Anesthesiologists classification and greater frequency of diabetes and hypertension. This cross\u00ad over group also had worse physical functioning at baseline, but after re\u00ad pair they experienced considerably greater improvement in physical func\u00ad tioning than did the patients who re\u00ad ceived surgical repair as assigned. It may be useful to consider these character\u00ad istics when recommending a therapeu\u00ad tic strategy for men with few hernia\u00ad related symptoms. These differences may be the result of unique character\u00ad istics of these patients or of therapeu\u00ad tic intervention. Results from as\u00ad treated analyses, however, must be interpreted with caution. The validity of intention-to-treat analyses is based on randomization of subjects into the treatment groups, helping to ensure that the groups are comparable and the dif\u00ad ferences found between them after an intervention are real.19 Minimally symptomatic men who choose to defer surgical repair also de\u00ad fer the small risk of adverse conse\u00ad quences of a tension-free repair. Ad\u00ad verse consequences of surgical repair were identified in some patients, in\u00ad cluding short-term complications in 32. 7%; longer-term problems, includ\u00ad ing chronic pain sufficient to limit ac\u00ad tivities in l. 7% at 3 years and 1.3% at 4 years for the subset of the group avail\u00ad able for analysis at these points; andre\u00ad currence of the hernia in 1.4%. This study has several limitations. The mix of patients evaluated (pre\u00ad dominantly white, privately insured) may not resemble those found in other settings. Progression of hernia-related symptoms is time-dependent and the main outcomes of the study were as\u00ad sessed at 2 years. For all patients, the median length of follow-up was only 3.2 years. Because the risk of a hernia ac\u00ad cident increases with the length of time the hernia is present and because acci\u00ad dents are more common in elderly in\u00ad dividuals, a longer follow-up period may be needed to ascertain the longer\u00ad term risks of either treatment strat-egy.18 To this end, we have established a voluntary long-term registry of pa\u00ad tients enrolled in this and its compan\u00ad ion trial comparing open and laparo\u00ad scopic hernia repair2 to annually assess patient-reported currence of hernia accidents and re\u00ad currences. CONCLUSIONS A strategy of watchful waiting is a safe and acceptable option for men with asymptomatic or minimally symptom\u00ad atic inguinal hernias. Acute hernia incarcerations occur rarely, and patients who develop symptoms have no greater risk of operative complica\u00ad tions than those undergoing prophy\u00ad lactic hernia repair.

O. Gibbs, PhD,and Domenic J. Reda, PhD ;Investigators of the Original Trial Objective: To assess the long-term crossover (CO) rate in men undergoing watchful waiting (WW) as a primary treatment strategy for their asymptomaticor minimally symptomatic inguinal hernias.Background: With an average follow-up of 3.2 years, a randomized con- trolled trial comparing WW with routine repair for male patients with min-imally symptomatic inguinal hernias led investigators to conclude that WWwas an acceptable option [ JAMA . 2006;295(3):285-292]. We now analyze patients in the WW group after an additional 7 years of follow-up.Methods: At the conclusion of the original study, 254 men who had been assigned to WW consented to longer-term follow-up. These patients werecontacted yearly by mail questionnaire. Nonresponders were contacted byphone or e-mail for additional data collection.Results: Eighty-one of the 254 men (31.9%) crossed over to surgical repair before the end of the original study, December 31, 2004, with a median follow-up of 3.2 (range: 2-4.5) years. The patients have now been followed for anadditional 7 years with a maximum follow-up of 11.5 years. The estimatedcumulative CO rates using Kaplan-Meier analysis was 68%. Men older than65 years crossed over at a considerably higher rate than younger men (79% vs62%). The most common reason for CO was pain (54.1%). A total of 3 patientshave required an emergency operation, but there has been no mortality.Conclusions: Men who present to their physicians because of an inguinal hernia even when minimally symptomatic should be counseled that althoughWW is a reasonable and safe strategy, symptoms will likely progress and anoperation will be needed eventually.

In 2011, the longer-termresults of the United Kingdom trial were published. Using Kaplan-Meier analysis, 72% of patients were predicted to crossover (CO) fromWW to surgery by 7.5 years causing the authors to conclude thatroutine repair should be recommended for minimally symptomaticpatients without medical contraindications to surgery. We now reportthe long-term results of the WW arm of the North American Trial. METHODS Data The methods and study design used for the American Col- lege of Surgeons (ACS) hernia trial have been previously reported in detail.5,6In brief, after informed consent, men who were 18 years or older and had an asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic inguinalhernia were recruited from 5 different geographical locations in NorthAmerica including both community and academic centers (Table 1).These patients were randomized to WW or a standard Lichtensteinopen tension-free repair. Patients with female gender, undetectablehernias, symptomatic hernias, acute hernia complications, and localor systemic infection; those in ASA (American Society of Anesthe-siologists) class IV; or those participating in another clinical trialwere excluded from the trial. The outcomes of the trial have beenpublished previously. 5After completion of the trial on December 31, 2004, study participants were invited to voluntarily enroll in a registryfor long-term follow-up after approval from the institutional reviewboard (IRB) of each participant center. Because of inability to ob-tain IRB approval for one site (McGill University, Montreal, Quebec,Canada), this center was excluded from the registry. After informedconsent, men who agreed to participate in the study were contactedby mail questionnaire in mid 2005, mid 2006, early 2008, early 2009,and late 2010. Nonresponders were contacted by phone or e-mail foradditional data collection. Patients initially randomized to WW eitherunderwent surgery during follow-up (CO group) or continued to re-main in the WW group. For the CO group, the questionnaire collectedinformation about reason for CO and details of surgery including date,side, type of surgery, whether mesh was used for the hernia repair,postoperative pain, and hernia recurrence. For those who remained in the WW group, details about their hernia including size, descent into scrotum, use of truss, and pain associated with hernia were collected.Patient satisfaction was recorded for both the groups. The question-naire was purposely kept very short and simple and did not containitems related to quality of life or standardized instruments for painand activity assessment to maximize compliance. Patients Patients assigned to the WW group in the initial RCT were divided into the CO group and WW group for this study.

He is easily able to push it back completely, but it reappears in-termittently. He says it is not painful and that he has not altered his activity level be - cause of it. Physical examination confirms the presence of a right inguinal hernia. How should his case be managed? The Clinical Problem The lifetime risk of development of a groin hernia has been estimated at 27% for men and 3% for women. 1 The frequency of surgical correction varies among coun - tries and ranges from 10 per 100,000 population in the United Kingdom to 28 per 100,000 in the United States. 2 The word \"hernia\" is from the Latin word \"rupture\"; the condition occurs when an organ normally contained in one body cavity protrudes through the lining of that cavity. Groin hernias have three components: the neck, which is the opening in the abdominal wall; the sac, which is formed by the protrusion of the perito - neum through the opening; and the contents \u2014 that is, any tissue or organ that protrudes through the neck into the hernia sac (Fig. 1). The abdominal wall in the groin region is composed of the peritoneum, transversalis fascia, internal and external oblique muscles and their aponeurotic structures, subcutaneous tissue, and skin. A failure of the transversalis fascia to prevent the intraabdominal con - tents from protruding through the anatomical area known as the myopectineal orifice of Fruchaud is the final common denominator in the development of all groin hernias ( inguinal hernias are either direct or indirect. Both direct and indirect hernias protrude above the ingui - nal ligament; a direct hernia is medial to the inferior epigastric vessels, whereas an indirect hernia is lateral. A femoral hernia protrudes below the inguinal ligament and medial to the femoral vessels (Fig. 1 and 2). Demographics and Risk Factors Inguinal hernias are more common on the right side than on the left and are 10 times more common in men than in women. 3 Indirect inguinal hernias are twice as common as direct hernias. The reported prevalence of inguinal hernias varies widely from study to study; hernia repair is often used as a surrogate.

Among adults, the annual frequency of groin hernia repair was found to increase consistently with age, from 0.25% at 18 years of age to 4.2% at 75 to 80 years of age. 4 Femoral hernias account for fewer than 5% of groin hernias; however, 35 to 40% of femoral hernias are not diagnosed until the patient pres - ents with strangulation or bowel obstruction, and mortality is higher in association with emergency repair than with elective repair. 5-7 The incidence of femoral hernias increases steadily with age and is higher among patients with recurrent hernias. Femoral hernias are more common in women than in men, but a woman with a groin mass is still 5 times more likely to have an inguinal her - nia than a femoral hernia; inguinal hernias in women are almost always indirect. 6 In addition to male sex and increased age, a major risk factor for a groin hernia is a family history of groin hernias, which is associated with up to eight times the risk. 8,9 Other conditions re - ported to be associated with increased risk include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, smoking, lower body-mass index, high intraabdominal pres - sure, collagen vascular aortic aneurysm, patent processus vaginalis, history of open appendectomy, and peritoneal dialysis. 8 Patients with matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) abnormalities, such as Ehlers-Danlos, Marfan's, Hurler's, and Hunter's also have increased risks of having a hernia; consis - tent with these observations is the report of mark - ers of abnormal connective-tissue homeostasis, including an increased type I:type III collagen ratio and increased metalloproteinase activity (in -creased MMP-2 and MMP tissue inhibitor 2 activ - ity),10 in association with hernias in the general population. Whether heavy lifting is also a risk factor re - mains controversial. A recent systematic review showed data concerning the relationship between occasional heavy lifting, repeated heavy lifting, or a single strenuous lifting episode and the devel - opment of a groin hernia to be inconclusive. 11 Of note, weight lifters do not have an increased inci - dence of inguinal hernias.12 Strategies and Evidence Diagnosis and Evaluation Symptoms are absent in about a third of patients13 but, when present, include a heavy or dragging sensation, a burning sensation, a sharp pain, or discomfort or pain during coughing, defecation, micturition, exercise, or sexual intercourse. Symp - toms are usually worse by the end of the day and are relieved by lying down or manually reducing the hernia. The sudden onset of severe pain sug - gests strangulation and is a surgical emergency. Inguinal hernias are diagnosed by means of a physical examination disclosing a visible bulge or an easily palpable mass on straining with an examining finger in the external ring. Differen - tiating an indirect from a direct inguinal hernia is unnecessary, because it does not affect treat - ment. It is not always possible to differentiate an inguinal hernia from a more worrisome femoral hernia during physical examination. 5,14 Imaging studies are required only in cases in which there are typical symptoms in the absence of physical Key Clinical Points Groin Hernias in Adults Groin hernias are much more common in men than in women. Patients with symptoms of acute incarceration and strangulation require emergency surgery. Watchful waiting is a safe approach for asymptomatic male patients with inguinal hernia, but data from randomized trials suggest that the majority of men will ultimately be referred for surgery, primarily because of pain, within 10 years. For an uncomplicated unilateral inguinal hernia, open repair has the advantages of potentially being performed under local anesthesia and incurring lower initial costs; laparoscopic repair results in less postoperative pain and an earlier return to normal activities, but it requires general anesthesia routinely and carries a small risk of major intraabdominal injury. Femoral hernias occur more often in women than in men, are associated with much higher risk of strangulation, and can be difficult to distinguish from inguinal hernias; watchful waiting is not recommended in women.

Ultrasonography is relatively inexpensive and avoids the use of radiation, but its accuracy is operator-dependent. 15 Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are alterna-tives; MRI provides the best anatomic detail and has the highest sensitivity and specificity. 16,17 The differential diagnosis varies according to the clinical presentation. In the case of a groin mass thought to be a hernia, other possible causes include lymphadenopathy, a soft-tissue tumor, or an abscess. Possible causes of scrotal masses in-clude a hydrocele or a testicular tumor. In the case of a patient with symptoms consistent with a groin hernia but without a mass, possible causes (other than occult hernia) include epididymitis, local musculoskeletal abnormalities osteitis pubis, or tenosynovitis), nerve-root compression, and renal calculi. Athletes can have unusual syndromes that result in symp-toms suggestive of a which results in intestinal ischemia, requires emergency surgery. The patient presents with a tense, exquisitely tender groin mass and may have signs of sepsis (e.g., fever, tachycardia, hypotension, vomiting, and confu-sion). Incarceration (i.e., a state in which a hernia cannot be reduced) is not synonymous with stran-gulation; many patients with chronically irreduc-ible hernias have no symptoms. Careful exami-nation of the groin should be performed for any patient presenting with a bowel obstruction. In contrast to other causes of bowel obstruction, hernias causing this complication are almost always associated with complete obstruction and cannot be managed conservatively. Unless an ob-structed hernia is treated expeditiously, progres-sion to strangulation is inevitable. Asymptomatic or Minimally Symptomatic Hernias Regardless of the type of hernia, symptomatic pa- tients should be offered repair to improve quality Figure 1.

However, the results of two randomized trials comparing prompt repair with a strategy of watchful waiting for asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic inguinal hernias have argued against routine repair. 18,19 One of these, a single-center randomized trial from the United Kingdom in-volving 160 patients, showed no significant dif-ference between groups in pain scores and a minimal difference in scores on the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey at 1 year. 18 In a larger mul- ticenter trial from North America (involving 720 patients), there was no significant difference at 2 years in pain or quality of life between the group that underwent surgery and the group that did not. 19 In both studies, approximately one quarter of patients assigned to watchful waiting crossed over to surgery (by 15 months in the first and by 2 years in the second), primarily because of increasing pain; the delay did not affect the frequency of operative complications. 20 The inci- dence of an acute presentation was very low (a total of 3 patients in both studies combined, and 2 of the 3 patients had the hernia reduced and re-paired electively), and there was no mortality or increased morbidity with watchful waiting as compared with prompt repair. Both studies have recently been updated with longer-term follow-up data. 21,22 The estimated fre- quency of crossover to surgery from the watchful-waiting group was 72% by 7.5 years in the U.K. trial and 68% by 10 years in the North American trial; most crossovers to surgery were a result of increasing pain. In the subset of men who un-derwent randomization after 65 years of age in the original North American study, 79% were predicted to need surgery. The logical conclusion is that watchful waiting is safe but only delays the inevitable surgery. Concern that watchful waiting would result in greater complication rates as a result of increasing severity of coexisting condi-tions and larger fascia defects in cases where surgery was later performed was not borne out. 20 Because the patients in both studies had pre-sented to their physicians with concerns about Figure 2.

Another im - portant caveat is that these results apply only to inguinal hernias and not to femoral hernias, be - cause of the higher risks of serious complications with the latter. Surgical repair is routinely rec - ommended for women because of their higher incidence of femoral hernias and the difficulty in accurately differentiating them from inguinal hernias by means of physical examination. 6,23-26 Surgical Treatment Hernia repair is performed as either an open pro - cedure or a laparoscopic procedure. Open repairs are divided into two types: tension-free repair with the use of a prosthetic mesh (usually polypropyl - ene) or sutured repair. A Cochrane meta-analysis strongly supported the superiority of prosthetic-mesh repairs over sutured repairs, reporting a 50 to 75% lower risk of hernia recurrence, a lower risk of chronic postherniorrhaphy groin pain, and an earlier return to work. 27 The Lichtenstein tension-free repair or one of its modifications (e.g., \"plug and patch\") is the most commonly performed repair of all types in the United States. Sutured repairs are generally limited to unique indications such as an infected or contaminated field where the use of a prosthesis might be con - traindicated. One type of sutured repair (the Shouldice repair) is still used in certain specialty clinics but requires a complex dissection that is not easily mastered without specialized training; in general practice, the hernia recurrence rate as - sociated with this type of repair is higher than with mesh techniques. 28 Laparoscopic Inguinal Hernia Repair The laparoscopic method uses the preperitoneal space behind the musculofascial elements of the groin area to place a prosthesis over the entire myopectineal orifice. The preperitoneal space may be entered directly through the abdomen by mak - ing an incision in the peritoneum (transabdomi - nal preperitoneal technique). Alternatively, one can avoid the abdomen by dissecting the space between the peritoneum and the muscular ele - ments, with or without the aid of a dissecting balloon (totally extraperitoneal repair) (Fig. 3). Laparoscopic herniorrhaphy results in less pain initially, an earlier return to normal activities, and easier repair of recurrent hernias that have previously undergone open repair, and it allows treatment of bilateral hernias through the same skin incisions. 29,30 The risks of common surgical complications are similar for laparoscopic and open repair; complications include wound seroma or hematoma (approximately 7 to 8% risk), 15 wound (approximately 1% risk),15 tes- ticular complications (approximately 0.7% risk),30 and complications related to the mesh \u2014 for ex - ample, contraction, erosion, and infection. How - ever, laparoscopic repair is associated with a small risk of life-threatening vascular or visceral injury (0.9 and 1.8 per 1000 procedures, respec - tively 31). Whereas laparoscopic repair requires gen - eral anesthesia, open repair can be performed under local anesthesia (although registry data from Europe indicate that local anesthesia is used in only about 10% of cases 32); the possibil - ity of using local anesthesia is a particular ad - vantage in older patients who require repair and have serious coexisting medical conditions. Lap - aroscopic herniorrhaphy is more expensive, but the costs of the procedure may be offset by an earlier return to daily function and work. 33 A Cochrane meta-analysis including 41 random - ized trials showed no significant difference in recurrence rates between open mesh and laparo - scopic repairs. 29 However, other studies, includ - ing a recent large cohort study34 and a more re - cent meta-analysis including 27 randomized trials, have revealed a significantly higher risk of recur - rence of primary hernias after laparoscopic re - pair as compared with open repair 35 (reoperation rates in the cohort study, 4.1% vs. 2.1%). No sig - nificant difference between the two types of pro - cedures has been noted in recurrence rates after repair of recurrent hernias. 34,36 Numerous studies have shown that the most important factor in - fluencing the outcome of laparoscopic hernior - rhaphy is the experience of the surgeon.34,37 The learning curve for laparoscopy is steep; inexpe - rienced surgeons have poorer results with higher rates of complication and recurrence. The num - ber of procedures required for a surgeon to be-come proficient is not clearly defined.

Although the incidence varies widely in the literature (1.5 to 54% 38,39), the consensus is that approximately 10% of patients who have undergone an inguinal herniorrhaphy have some chronic pain, and in 2 to 4% it inter-feres with daily living. 30 Whether this complica- tion is less likely after laparoscopic repair than after open repair remains controversial. 30,38 Pain has been attributed to one or more of the follow-ing factors: damaged or trapped nerves (neuro-pathic) or scar tissue or a reaction to the pros-thetic material (nociceptive); however, the exact mechanisms are unknown. Because the pain resolves within 6 months in about a third of cases, antiinflammatory medication is a reason-able initial treatment. In patients with persistent pain, strategies for treatment have included mesh and suture excision, neurectomy, and neu-roma excision, but there is wide variation in the reported rates of improvement after these inter-ventions in case series. 40,41 Rigorous studies are needed to clarify the efficacy of various treat-ment strategies. Postherniorrhaphy pain should be discussed as part of informed consent. There is a paucity of information to guide the management of groin hernias in women. A par-ticular concern in women is their higher fre-quency of femoral hernias, with the attendant Figure 3. Laparoscopic Totally Extraperitoneal Herniorrhaphy.

Indeed, a large study of more than 6000 women from Sweden showed a rate of femoral-hernia recur - rence that was much higher than that among men, especially after the repair of a direct her - nia; because direct hernias are extremely rare in woman, this observation suggests that the femo - ral hernia was actually missed during the index operation. 6 Thus, many experts recommend lapa - roscopic repair (which results in coverage of the entire myopectineal orifice) (Fig. 2, inset) for all women with groin hernias. 6,14,30,42 However, a modified Lichtenstein operation, attaching the inferior edge of the prosthesis to Cooper's liga - ment instead of the inguinal ligament, can achieve the same coverage. The use of a truss (hernia belt) for a groin hernia in men is controversial. Data to determine whether their use prevents hernia complications are lacking. Guidelines Guidelines for the management of inguinal her - nias have been published by the U.K. National In - stitute for Health and Care Excellence,25 the Eu - ropean Hernia Society,30 the Society for Surgery of the the Danish Hernia Database,24 the International Endohernia Society,44 and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.26 The current recommendations are gen - erally consistent with these guidelines. Conclusions and Recommendations This 67-year-old man presents with a history and physical-examination results consistent with an inguinal hernia. Imaging studies are not indi - cated. Watchful waiting is an acceptable strate - gy, although data from randomized trials pre - dict that, given his age (>65 years), he has an 80% chance of requiring surgical hernia repair for evolving symptoms. If surgery is performed, an open conventional prosthetic inguinal herni - orrhaphy would be recommended by most sur - geons; however, a laparoscopic herniorrhaphy performed by an experienced surgeon is also an acceptable option. The laparoscopic operation would be expected to result in less pain and an earlier return to normal activities, but the differ - ences would probably be modest for this uncom - plicated unilateral hernia; at the same time, it would carry a risk (albeit a small one) of a seri - ous vascular or visceral injury. If the patient were a woman, surgery would be recommended rou - tinely, given the greater concern for a femoral hernia and the greater associated risk of com - plications.

Unintended consequences of policy change to watchful waiting for asymptomatic inguinal hernias MJ Hwang, Gannon, SS Karandikar Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust, UK ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION In 2009 the Department of Health instructed McKinsey & Company to provide advice on how commissioners might achieve world class National Health Service productivity. Asymptomatic inguinal hernia repair was identified as a poten- tially cosmetic procedure, with limited clinical benefit. The Birmingham and Solihull primary care trust cluster introduced a policy of watchful waiting for asymptomatic inguinal hernia, which was implemented across the health economy in December2010. This retrospective cohort study aimed to examine the effect of a change in clinical commissioning policy concerning elective surgical repair of asymptomatic inguinal hernias. METHODS A total of 1,032 patients undergoing inguinal hernia repair in the 16 months after the policy change were compared with 978 patients in the 16 months before. The main outcome measure was relative proportion of emergency repair in groups before and after the policy change. Multivariate binary logistic regression was used to adjust the main outcome for age, sex and hernia type. RESULTS The period after the policy change was associated with 59% higher odds of emergency repair (3.6% vs 5.5%, adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 1.59, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03 -2.47). In turn, emergency repair was associated with higher odds of adverse events (4.7% vs 18.5%, p<0.001, Fisher 's exact test). CONCLUSIONS Introduction of a watchful waiting policy for asymptomatic inguinal hernias was associated with a significant increase in need for emergency repair, which was in turn associated with an increased risk of adverse events. Current policies may be placing patients at risk. KEYWORDS Inguinal hernia -Emergency surgery -Commissioning -Guidelines E: sharad.karandikar@heartofengland.nhs.uk Inguinal hernia repair is one of the most commonly per- formed surgical operations, at an estimated annual rate of over 70,000 in the UK and 20 million worldwide.1-3Con- ventional wisdom has been to arrange prompt surgicalrepair owing to the perceived risk of hernia related emer- gencies. Elective repair as a day procedure is an estab- lished, safe and effective treatment for uncomplicatedhernia. 4In contrast, emergency repair for incarcerated, obstructed or strangulated hernia can be associated with significant morbidity and even death. While the mortalityrate following elective repair is less than 1%, it is over 5% in emergency repair. 5,6 Two recent randomised controlled trials (RCTs), one from North America7and one from the UK,8have rekindled interest in asymp- tomatic or minimally symptomatic inguinal hernias, by comparing watchful waiting versus surgical repair. Bothtrials reported extremely low need for emergency repair in the observation arm. 7,8Based on these two RCTs, watchful waiting has been recommended as the first-line treatmentfor asymptomatic inguinal hernias in guidelines published by the European Hernia Society.9However, the active follow- up provided in these trials may not reflect 'real world 'prac- tice. Crossover rates to surgery were high (23% and 29%),7,8 which, paired with the low emergency intervention rate, we believe reflects the strict, active observation of a RCT. Such observation may not be possible in a 'real world 'setting, which would rely on routine community-based patient -doctor interaction. In 2009 the Department of Health instructed manage- ment consulting firm McKinsey & Company to provide advice on how commissioners might achieve world class National Health Service (NHS) productivity.10Asymptomatic inguinal, umbilical and femoral hernias were identified asinterventions with limited clinical benefit that could be decommissioned to drive financial savings. Widespread policy changes were implemented by NHS clinical commis-sioners, who withdrew funding for elective repair of asymptomatic hernias. To date, as far as we are aware, no assessment of this policy change has been published. ThisGENERAL SURGERY Ann R Coll 343study aimed to describe how this change has manifested itself at a large NHS foundation trust. Methods This study was a retrospective analysis of patients at theHeart of England NHS Foundation Trust, one of the largest trusts in the UK, serving a population of over one million people. Permission to perform this study was granted fromthe hospital 's clinical audit department. Intervention A policy of watchful waiting and prior approval for elective asymptomatic hernia repair, introduced by the Birmingham and Solihull primary care trust cluster,11was implemented in the trust in December 2010. The new policy supported surgi-cal treatment for patients with symptomatic inguinal hernias, hernias not amenable to simple reduction or strangulated hernias. Based on the date of this policy change, patientswere divided into two groups: those from the 16 monthsbefore implementation (1 August 2009 -30 November 2010) and those from the 16 months after (1 December 2010 -30 March 2012). Outcome measures The primary outcome measure was the relative proportion of emergency surgery before and after implementation of the new policy. The proportion of emergency surgery acts as asurrogate marker for worse outcome. Since the overall rate of adverse events is low, a more frequent proxy marker makes differences easier to show. The adverse event rate was there-fore a secondary outcome measure, alongside postoperative mortality and length of stay. Patients Patients aged 18 years and older undergoing repair of uni-lateral or bilateral inguinal hernia during the study period were included. They were identified from the prospectivelymaintained hospital theatre database. Clinical data were obtained from discharge summaries, clinical letters and recorded inpatient episodes using the electronic integratedhospital information system. Adverse events Postoperative complications were classified according to theinternationally standardised and validated Clavien -Dindo scoring system for postoperative complications. 12In this clas- sification, the factor determining the severity of the unex-pected complication is the treatment required. Intraoperativecomplications are not considered, except intraoperative death (grade V). For this study, major complications were defined as grades III -IV, with grades I -II indicating a minor complication. All documented postoperative adverse events up to 30 days were included and the highest grade complication for each patient was recorded. Postoperative mortality was defined asdeath from any cause in the 30-day postoperative period. Statistical analysis Differences between demographic groups of categoricaldata were tested using the chi-squared test or Fisher 'sexact test as appropriate. In order to take account of the effect of confounding variables, binary logistic regressionmodelling was used. The first model assessed the likeli- hood of need for emergency surgery (with emergency sur- gery coded as '1'). The summary statistic was the odds ratio (OR), which was assumed to approximate the relative risk. An OR of >1.0 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) that did not cross 1.0 indicated a significantly higher asso-ciation with the outcome of interest. Subsequent modelswere constructed using occurrence of any complication and major complications as a target. Mortality was not included as a specific target of regression analysis aloneowing to its low occurrence. It was, however, included as an adverse event and compared using Fisher 's exact test. The age and sex of the patient, and the primary versus recurrent type of the inguinal hernia were judged a priori to be likely to be relevant to the rate of emergency presen- tation and adverse events. In order to prevent a loss of dataassociated with categorising age, it was maintained as acontinuous variable and log transformed. As interpretation of log-transformed ORs are difficult owing to their magni- tude, these values were transformed to allow the OR torelate to a 10% increase in age. Models were repeated using age as an unadjusted continuous variable to confirm validity. These variables were included in multivariate binary logistic models based on their clinical importance (rather than reliance on their statistical importance in stepwisemodels, which can be misleading). 13Interaction between categorical variables was tested sequentially and signifi- cant pairings were included in the model if they improvedthe Akaike information criterion (a measure of quality ofmodel selection). Overall model performance was assessed using the C statistic as a measure of discrimination, which is equivalent to the area under the receiver operating char-acteristic curve for fitted values. Data handling was per- formed in SPSS \u00aeversion 21.0 (IBM, New York, US) and statistical modelling in R statistical software version 3.0.0(R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Results Patient demographics and outcomes in the period before and after the policy change are shown in Table 1. Patient age, sex and hernia type were similar in both groups. Themost common reason for emergency repair was incarcera- tion (ie irreducibility without obstruction or strangulation, n=50, 54.3%), ( 10.9%). In six cases (6.5%), the indication was not recorded. One hundred and seven patients (5.3%) suffered at least one recorded postoperative complication. This was associ- ated with a minor complication rate of 4.4% ( n=88) and a major complication rate of 0.9% ( n=19). Effect of policy change on presentation type There was a crude relative increase of 52.8% in the rate of emergency repair (Table 1). When adjusted for age, sexand hernia type, policy change was associated with CHANGE TO WATCHFUL WAITING FOR ASYMPTOMATIC INGUINAL HERNIAShigher odds of emergency repair (adjusted OR: 1.59, 95% CI: 1.03 -2.47). Increasing age and female sex were signifi- cant predictors of the need for emergency repair in the multivariate model (Table 2). The C statistic of this model was 0.73 (95% CI: 0.68 -0.79), indicating adequate discrimi- native value. When this model was repeated for men only,the effect of the time period after the policy change remained significant, with an increase in odds to 68% (adjusted OR: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.04 CI: 1.05 -2.72, p=0.030). Effect of emergency surgery on adverse event rate Emergency presentation was associated with a significantly higher rate of any complications (18.5% emergency vs 4.7% elective, p<0.001), major complications mortality vs 0.1%, p<0.001). When adjusted for age, sex, hernia type and time period, emergency presentation remained significantlyassociated with occurrence of any complications (OR: -35.87). Effect of policy change on adverse event rate The postoperative mortality rate was not significantly dif- ferent between the periods prior to and following the pol-icy change (Table 1). In adjusted models, the time period after the policy change predicted neither occurrence of any complications (adjusted OR: 1.26, 95% 2.85). Successful completion of day-case surgery was notdifferent before and after the policy change. Discussion To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the impact of a change in clinical commissioning guidelines on elective surgery for inguinal hernia in the UK. In thecatchment area of a large foundation trust, the proportion of patients undergoing emergency surgery increased sig- nificantly following the policy change. The absolute per-centage change in the rate of emergency presentation was small (1.9%) but this is correlated to increased odds of 59% in an adjusted model (68% in men). Such relativeincreases may be important to the individual patient when considering the morbidity profile associated with emer- gency repair. The main strength of this study is its assessment over a large geographical region. This allowed for high numbers and inclusion of patients from a 'real world 'population. Although no direct link was made between timing of thestudy period (ie before or after policy change) and adverse events, when extrapolated across the country, such an increase is likely to be detected. Additionally,detailed clinical outcome assessment at source likely afforded higher accuracy than routinely collected admin- istrative data alone. 14Table 1 Demographics and outcomes before and after policy change Before change After change p-value 63 (6.1%) 0.902 Type hernia (91.1%) Recurrent 106 (10.8%) 92 (8.9%) 0.148 Day case Yes 253 (24.5%) (5.5%) 0.037 Any complication No (95.4%) 970 (94.0%) Yes 45 (4.6%) 62 (6.0%) 0.160 CHANGE TO WATCHFUL WAITING FOR ASYMPTOMATIC INGUINAL HERNIASThe main limitation is underlying assumptions that the increased number of patients presenting as emergencies were asymptomatic and had either been seen by their gen- eral practitioner (GP) but not referred or had been referredbut were not offered surgery. These assumptions are important confounders of the theory that the changes observed were due to policy change. This study thereforeprovides evidence of association rather than direct cause.Other limitations should be considered. With only the catchment area of one UK hospital, the ability to generalise to other areas requires confirmation. However, the founda-tion trust is comprised of three hospitals with two emer- gency departments and is likely to be representative of other UK hospitals. This study did not test quality of life or pain measures from patients. Large cohort studies have shown that elective repair of an inguinal hernia enhances life quality. 4Ak e y argument against surgical repair of an asymptomatic ingui- nal hernia is the risk of surgical morbidity, such as postop- erative chronic pain, which is quoted to patients in theorder of 5 -10%. 15,16Nevertheless, long-term follow-up of the UK trial by O 'Dwyer et al showed equivalent median vis- ual analogue scale pain scores between men randomised to operative and non-operative groups at five years.8,17This confirms findings from the North American trial, where analysis by both intention-to-treat and as-treated showed equivalence between observation and surgery for pain inter-fering with activity. 7These findings suggest that the risk of chronic pain should not be a barrier when considering surgical repair.18In order to answer the primary study question, it was decided a priori to adjust for the factors that we judged would be clinically relevant to affecting elective versus emergency presentation: age, sex and primary/recurrenthernia type. Data on pre-existing co-morbidity, use of lapa- roscopy and other desirable (but not necessary) factors were not included. These are unlikely to be relevant con-founders following the adjustment already performed.Finally, the proportion of patients successfully managed conservatively by GPs was not investigated in this study. Such data may reveal a high success rate and reduce theproportional size of emergency presentations although it would not affect the relative increase seen. Changes in commissioning policy were based on evi- dence from two RCTs. In the largest RCT, by Fitzgibbons et al, the estimated cross-over rate from observation to sur- gery, through Kaplan -Meier analysis, was 68% at ten years. 7,19The second RCT did not find significant differen- ces in pain scores but showed an overall change in SF-12\u00ae health status of 7.0 (95% CI: 0.2 -13.7, p=0.045), favouring the operation group over the observation group.8,17Out of 80 men randomised to observation, 46 crossed over to operation, which was estimated by Kaplan -Meier methods as a rate of 72% at 7.5 years. The high rate of conversion to operative intervention, accompanied by a low rate of emergency intervention, seen in the two RCTs is in contrast to the rates from thepresent study for before and after the policy change. This is likely explained by the careful, active observation afforded in RCTs, which may not be feasible in non-trial,Table 2 Univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression association of patient and policy factors to adverse events (emergency presentation and complications) Univariate Multivariate OR (95% CI) p-value = confidence interval *OR relates to a 10% increase in age. All models were repeated using age as an unadjusted continuous variable; there were no alterations to significance and the maximum change to the Akaike information criterion was 0.8%. CHANGE TO WATCHFUL WAITING FOR ASYMPTOMATIC INGUINAL HERNIAScommunity settings. The North American authors sug- gested that watchful waiting is reasonable and safe (recog-nising the high likelihood of future operation) 19but the UK authors suggested that there is little point in observation.17 The European Hernia Society issued guidelines in favour of watchful waiting for men with minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic inguinal hernias, without clarifying the method of implementation in practice.9While this may remain the best policy for some patients, the ideal candi-date and process will only be identified after further research. Elderly patients with co-morbidity have been suggested as targets of this strategy although they may beat highest risk of morbidity and mortality if emergency sur- gery is required. In the present study, increasing age was associated with both emergency presentation and compli-cations. This suggests that age alone should not be a bar- rier to elective surgical repair. Despite this, patients choosing observation may be reassured that the risk ofemergency repair remained below 10%. It is notable from this study that the proportion of patients undergoing elective repair differed only slightly between time periods (96.4% to 94.5%). Although thedecrease is small, it reflects the important increase in emergency presentation. The fact that elective referrals are still being made in volume suggests that only a small pro-portion of patients are asymptomatic. Additionally, pene- trance of guidelines may not yet be complete and if proportion of elective repair falls further, even more emer-gency presentations may occur in the future. Day-case, ambulatory inguinal hernia repair may also prove to be more cost effective than active observation incommunity settings. Ongoing observation comes at a finan-cial cost that should be quantified and compared with that of early repair. The UK RCT showed that operative strat- egies were over \u00a3400 more expensive per patient than forthe observation group, taking into account clinic and observation costs. 8However, with longer-term community- based follow-up and more adverse events (when applied toa wider population), these costs may increase and deserve prospective reassessment. Conclusions This study suggests that the current policy is associated with an increased proportion of emergency presentationsand may be putting patients at risk. It may also be less cost effective than a policy of early elective surgery. For these reasons, we advocate further studies at a national level aswell as a timely clarification of clinical commissioning pol- icies to allow expert surgical assessment and follow-up if awatchful waiting policy is to be adopted.

The rationale for surgical treatment is to cure inguinal pain and discomfort associated with the hernia and to pre- vent emergency surgery in case of incarceration and/orstrangulation, which is clearly associated with higher mor-bidity and mortality. 3,4The indication for elective surgery, however, should not only depend on consideration of themortality rate that is associated with emergency and elec-tive repair. The risk of incarceration or strangulation re-quiring emergency repair should be considered as well. Ad-ditionally, risk of recurrence and crossover rates fromconservative to operative management in this group of pa-tients should be taken into account. Recently, 2 randomized trials have reported that pain is not substantially different at 1 or 2 years after assigningopen tension-free hernia repair or watchful waiting in caseof asymptomatic mildly symptomatic inguinal herniacompared with preoperative pain levels. 5,6In addition, one third of patients presenting with an inguinal hernia at amean age of 60 years (range 45 to 71 years) have beenreported to be asymptomatic. 7Another study reported that 81% of patients (62% older than 50 years of age) did notsuffer from any inguinal pain at rest, which included 27%with no pain at all. 8 All the factors mentioned here are important when con- sidering repair of inguinal hernia in elderly male patients.Neuhauser conducted a life-expectancy analysis includingmost of these factors in 1977 and concluded that elective hernia repair does not prolong life in the elderly, it might ormight not improve quality of life, and life expectancywould be determined mainly by the yearly rate ofstrangulation. 9 The aim of this study was to investigate which treat- ment, operation or watchful waiting, would be better incase of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic elderly maleinguinal hernia patients by means of a literature review anda Markov model integrated relevant parameters. METHODS Review Studies in which the following outcomes measures were studied were included: risk of incarceration and/or stran-gulation, mortality associated with elective and emergencyhernia repair (in case of incarceration and/or strangula-tion), and risk of recurrence and crossover rates fromwatchful waiting to operation. Studies were identified bysearching PubMed, the Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 2007),scholar.google.com, and Current Controlled T rials (search across multiple registers including the National Health Ser-vice in England and US ClinicalT rials.gov). Search terms used and cross-checked were hernia, inguinal, strangula- tion, incarceration, mortality, elective, emergency, and hernia repair. Studies containing data about femoral and in-guinofemoral hernia were excluded from analysis. Ran- domized trials published after 1990 comparing open and lapa-roscopic hernia repair were also included with respect toelective mortality rates because there is no evidence of a sub-stantial difference in mortality between these types of repair.Randomized controlled trials and prospective and retrospec-tive cohort studies were included. Reviews and references ofthe articles retrieved were checked for additional studies. Let-ters to the editor, abstracts, and comments were excluded.Only articles written in English were reviewed. Additionally, studies investigating pain before and after assigning operative or conservative management in case ofmildly symptomatic and asymptomatic elderly hernia pa-tients repair, pain, postoperative, and pain, chronic.

Parker, FRCS Objective :To base, Embase, national guidelines (including the Na-tional Library of Guidelines Specialist Library), Na-tional Institute for Health and Clinical Excellenceguidelines, and the National Research Register weresearched for prospective randomized trials comparing sur-gical treatment of patients with asymptomatic IH withconservative treatment. Study Selection :The literature search retrieved 216 ar- ticle headlines, and these articles were analyzed. Of thosestudies, a total of 41 articles were found to be relevant and2 large well-conducted randomized controlled studies thatpublished their results in several articles were reviewed. Data Extraction :The pain and discomfort, general health status, complications, and life-threatening eventsof patients with asymptomatic IH managed by surgery or watchful waiting were determined. Data Synthesis :No significant difference in pain scores and general health status were found when comparing thepatients who were followed up with the patients who hadsurgery. A significant crossover ratio ranging between 23% and 72% from watchful waiting to surgery was found. Inpatients with watchful waiting, the rates of IH strangula-tion were 0.27% after 2 years of follow-up and 0.55% af-ter 4 years of follow-up. In patients who underwent elec-tive surgery, the range of operative complications was 0%to 22.3% and the recurrence rate was 2.1%. Conclusion :Both treatment options for asymptomatic IH are safe, but most patients will develop symptoms(mainly pain) over time and will require operation. Arch Surg. 2012;147(3):277-281 INGUINAL HERNIA (IH) OCCURS when a peritoneal sac protrudes through a weak point within thegroin area. It often contains ab-dominal content and is tradition- ally treated with surgery. 1As a rule, IH is diagnosed by a simple physical examina-tion except in cases where the diagnosisis obscure; in these cases, different mo-dalities are used for confirmation. 2Asymp- tomatic IH is a term used to describe the condition in a patient who has a groinbulge or impulse cough with only minoror no symptoms. On the other hand, anincidental operative finding of an inter-nal ring defect with no groin lump or othersymptoms is defined as an occult IH , a con- dition prevalent since the introduction oflaparoscopic surgery. Inguinal hernia repair (IHR) is the most frequent elective operation performed inthe United States and Europe, althoughwhen comparing the rate of surgery per-formed to treat IH there is great varietyamong different populations. 3,4For ex- ample, IHR is done in 10 per 10 000 peoplein the United Kingdom, while the rate is28 per 10 000 people in the United States. 5 There are several possible explanations forthis observable fact, including different pri-mary care management, costs, and insur-ance policies. As in any other operation, elective IHR carries its share of complications. Surgi-cal site infection, hematoma, urinary re-tention, and other short-term morbidi-ties well long-termcomplications including chronic groinpain, neuralgia, and IH recurrence. 6How- ever, postponing the operation might carrya risk of acute IH and visceral organ stran-gulation with additional risks of gan-grene, perforation, and infection of theperitoneal cavity. Hence, operations in theemergency setting for incarcerated IH havehigher morbidity and mortality rates. 7 The aim of this review is to establish a surgical approach to asymptomatic IH byAuthor Affiliations: Department Manor Hospital(Dr Parker), Kent, England.

Question source : Alison Little, MD, Medical Director, PacificSource Issue : There is still confusion about obstructed versus incarcerated ventral hernias and whether they fall on Line 172 or on Line 527. GUIDELINE NOTE 24, COMPLICATED HERNIAS Lines 172,527 Complicated hernias are included on Line 172 if they cause symptoms of obstruction and/or strangulation. Incarcerated hernias (defined as non -reducible by physical manipulation) are also included on Line 172, excluding ventral hernias. Incarcerated ventral hernias are included on Line 527, because the chronic incarceration of large ventral hernias does not place the patient at risk for impending strangulation. HERC Staff Recommendation : 1) Modify Guideline N ote 24 as follows: GUIDELINE NOTE 24, COMPLICATED HERNIAS Lines 172,527 Complicated hernias are included on Line 172 if they cause symptoms of intestinal obstruction and/or strangulation. Incarcerated hernias (defined as non-reducible by physical manipulation) are also included on Line 172, excluding incarcerated ventral hernias. Incarcerated ventral hernias are included on Line 527, because the chronic incarceration of large ventral hernias does not place the patient at risk for impending strangulation. "}
