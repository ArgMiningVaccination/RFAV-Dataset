The office is very warm and soothing with aromatherapy and a very nice receptionist. I never had to wait for an appointment and I had 4 of them. The baby has flipped to the head down position but equally important is the fact that I was having some pretty bad pain on my right side throughout my entire pregnancy and had assumed it was normal. Dr. Gorecki was able to tell by my walking that I was in pain and his alignments and exercises helped tremendously. I recommend my fellow pregnant ladies go see Dr. Gorecki if you have any pain or are dealing with a breech baby. He is very gentle and has a sweet table with a drop-down hole (with pillow) in the center to support the bump. - 7/11/2016Updated review As always, when I was in need of an amazing doctor to help me out, Dr Gorecki was there. I hurt my neck/shoulder/back yesterday, and they were able to squeeze me in today. he's a lifesaver, and I feel amazing once again. You can't go wrong with Dr G.4/26/2013Previous review Dr. Gorecki has been my chiropractor for years, as I am a chiropractor myself, I don't go to anyone who isn't the absolute best in what they do. Dr. Eddie is talented, thorough, and an inspiration to my own practice and work. he is compassionate, kind, and never makes me feel rushed. I would recommend him to anyone, anytime. I also have him down as my coverage doctor if I leave town,. I trust him with my own patients, and no one else. - 4/8/2013First to Review Worst adjustment and Chiropractic experience in 30 years! Kept insisting on taking X rays and didn't get one vertebrae to crack. Ended up walking out a very disappointed client. Will dispute any claims for sure! - 7/16/2014 There are very few chiropractors and energetic workers who embody the role of a healer. Dr. Edward Gorecki is one of those incredibly rare, compassionate gems. I began seeing him over a year ago for chronic back pain due to a fusion in my low spine and my rigorous lifestyle as a professional dancer, as well energetic and energy healing work. His intuitive nature is a gift to every person who crosses his path, and I couldn't be more grateful for all he does and all he is. He is the best of the best. If you're in search of caring, trustworthy chiropractic work and/or energetic work (healing, assessment, support), Dr. Gorecki is without a doubt your best bet. Happy Healing! - 11/5/2018 Dr. Gorecki is an absolute miracle worker!! He turned my baby head down not once but twice!! I cannot possibly say enough positive things about him and his practice. I have had 3 major sports injuries/surgeries in my life and have become very accustomed to living with pain and living with my body feeling very out of alignment. I just thought it was the way life would be for me. I ended up in Dr. Gorecki's office because I was pregnant with a large, breech baby at 35 weeks. My physical therapist who I trust completely referred me - I was actually really not into the idea of seeing a chiropractor under normal circumstances but wanted to try the Webster technique to turn the baby with hopes I would not have to have a C section. First of all, Dr. Gorecki is one of the most intuitive and educated people with regards to the body/alignment that I have ever come across - and like I said, I have seen a lot of people. He was able to exactly diagnose all of the pain points I normally have upon his first examination of me. He did work to align my pelvis, my back and open my hips to make room for the baby to turn. I walked out of his office and the baby was incredibly active for the rest of the day. I saw my OB the next morning and the baby had flipped! By 36 weeks, the baby had flipped back to breech position. I saw Dr. G again at 37 weeks and with one session he flipped the baby again! I actually could feel it happening right after the session. I then saw him twice a week until birth to maintain the alignment and position. I have since given natural birth to a healthy girl with a much easier labor than my first! Outside of the Webster technique, Dr. G made my 35 week pregnant body feel better than it had in years not pregnant. I had ankle surgery 8 years ago and always felt like my ankle was stuck. I had been to PTs and was resigned to having surgery again someday. He identified a bone that was out of place and in one swift movement completely changed my life. My ankle now has almost full range of motion for the first time in 8 years! It was an absolute remarkable experience. Truly a miracle. I can't wait to continue seeing Dr. G once I am through the postpartum timeframe. I cannot recommend him highly enough for both pregnancy related issues and general alignment/quality of life.
