Preventing child abuse and neglect: A randomized trial of nurse home visitation. Pediatrics 1986; 78: 65 - 78. PICO Tabell 1: Beskrivelse av PICO i The Elmira Trial ( Olds 1986 ) PICO P inclusion criteria Recruiting: Between April 1978 and September 1980 - 500 women were recruited through the health department antepartum clinic, the offices of private ob- stetricians, Planned Parenthood, the public schools, and a variety of other health and human service agencies and interviewed for participation in the study. - Women were actively recruited if, at intake: they had no previous live births they had any one of the following characteristics that predispose to infant health and devel- opmental problems: young age (<19 years) single -parent status low socio -economic status setting Small, semirural county of approximately 100,000 residents in the Appalachian region of New York State. At the time the study was initiated, the community was well served from the standpoint of both health and human services . In spite of abundance of these services, the community has consistently exhib- ited the highest rates of reported and confirmed cases of child abuse and neglect in the state. Moreo- ver, in 1980 the community was rated the worst Standard Metropolitan Statist ical Area in the United States in terms of its economic conditions. 7 actual sample Although there was a clear inclusion criteria, the study design allowed any women who asked to par- ticipate and who was bearing a first child to be enrolled. All women were enrolled prior to the 30th week of pregnancy. Approximately, 10% of the target population was missed due to late registration for prenatal care. An additional 10% was missed because some eligible women from the offices of private obstetricians were not referred. There were no differences in age, marital status, or education between those women who participated and those who declined. Of the non- white women (mostly blacks), 94% enrolled as opposed to 80% of the whites (p=0.02) At the registration, 47% of the participating women were younger than 19 years of age, 62% were un- married, and 61% came from families in Hollingshead's social class IV and V (semiskilled and un- skilled laborers; Hollingshead's index1 was adapted slightly). Eighty -five percent of the w omen met at least one of the age, marital status, or socioeconomic status criteria, and 23% possessed all three risk characteristics. Forty -six non -white women were removed from the analyses reported in this article because the sam- ple of nonwhite women was too small to cross -classify race with other variables of importance. Prior to their assignment to one of the treatment conditions, the women were interviewed to determine their family characteristics, psychologic resources, health conditions, health habits, the availability of informal support, and childhood histories. At the registration, to determine preintervention equivalence, treatment conditions were examined on sociodemographic characteristics (social class, marital status, age, maternal education) and psycho- logic and social support variables (maternal sense of control, helping network (number of people, inti- mates and kin), expected accompaniment to labor and delivery, husband/boyfriend support (availabil- ity, contact and anticipated help), grandmother support (availability, contact and anticipated help), pre- dicted positive parenting (scale derived from discriminant analysis to predict quality of care giving, based on weighted sum of mother's reports of being yelled at, spanked and treated r estrictively in her own childhood,; the level of psychosocial stress in her family of origin; her level of ego development; her prepregnant level of smoking; the economic status of her current household; and a housing- crowd- edness index)). 1: Hollingshead AB: Four -factor index of social status. Working paper. New Haven, CT, Yale Univer- sity, 1976 I The study had 4 treatment conditions and treatment number 4 (Nurse Family Partnership) was used as intervention. Families assigned to the fourth condition received the same services as those in treat- ment 3 (see below), but, in addition, the nurse continued to visit until the child was 2 years of age. For 6 weeks following delivery, the nurses visited families every week; from 6 weeks to 4 months, every 2 weeks; from 4 to 14 months, every 3 weeks; from 14 to 20 months, every 4 weeks; and from 20 to 24 months every 6 weeks. When predetermined crisis conditions existed, they visited weekly. The visits lasted approximately one hour and 15 minutes. The visits were consisted of three major activities: par- ent education regarding fetal and infant development, the involvement of family members and friends in child care and support of the mother, and the linkage of family members with other health and hu- man services. Treatment 4 (n=116) was shown in the tables labeled as \"nurse -visited: infancy\". C Remaining 3 treatme nts conditions were: Treatment 1(n=90): During pregnancy, no services were provided through the research pro- ject. When the babies were 1 and 2 years of age, an infant specialist hired by the research project screened them for sensory and developmental problems. Suspected problems were referred to other specialists for further evaluation and treatment. Treatment 2 (n=94): Families were provided free transportation for regular prenatal and well - child care at local clinics and physicians` offices through a contract with a local taxicab com- pany. Sensory and developmental screenings as in treatment 1, was provided when the ba- bies were 1 and 2 years of age. Treatment 3 (n=100): Families were provided a nurse home- visitor during pregnancy in addi- tion to screening a nd transportation services. The nurses visited families approximately once 8 every 2 weeks and made an average of nine visits during pregnancy, each of which lasted approximately one hour and 15 minutes. Treatments 1 and 2 were combined for purposes of anal ysis after it was determined that there were no differences between these two groups in their use of routine prenatal and well -child care, hence, the combination of treatments 1 and 2 served as the comparison group. Although treatment 3 was shown in the tables labeled as \"nurse- visited: pregnancy\", comparisons focused on the contrast of the treat- ment 4 and the comparison group (combination of treatment 1 and 2) for the whole sample and for those subsamples defined as being at risk: the teenagers (<19 years of age), the unmarried, the poor, and the group with all three risk characteristics. O Interviews and infant assessments were carried out at registration (prior to the 30th week of preg- nancy), and at 6, 10, 12, 22, and 24 months of the infant's life. Duri ng infancy, the babies were brought to the project office at 6, 12, and 24 months for weighing and measuring. Medical records were abstracted for the infant's first 2 years of life. Reliability of the medical record review procedure was checked on a system atic and regular basis and was found to be acceptable. The outcomes included attrition, child abuse and neglect, reports of infant temperament and behav- ioural problems, and maternal concern, conflict, scolding, and spanking, provision of appropriate play materials and avoidance of restriction and punishment and developmental quotient, emergency room visits, and maternal sense of control as a conditioner of trea tment effects. Elmira Trial ( Olds 1986 ) OUTCOMES MEASUREMENTS POINT OF TIME CHILD DEVELOPMENT Child abuse and ne- glect A list containing the names of all participating women and their children, their children's ages, and their addresses was given to state department of social service workers who thoroughly reviewed the department records for the presence of \"indicated\" (verified) cases of abuse or neglect. Veri- fied cases consisted of those that were reported for abuse or neglect and investigated by a department caseworker who determined that an episode of abuse or neglect, as defined by state law, had indeed occurred. Those cases were then reviewed by depart ment workers to abstract standard in- formation such as age of the child at the time of the first confirmed report, the specific type of abuse and neglect, the alleged perpetrator, and source of the maltreatment report (mandated sources like professionals required by law to report suspected maltreatment or nonmandated sources like neighbors and family members). The names of children and parents who moved to 15 other states during the investigation were sent for review. 0-24 mo Reports of infant tem- perament, behavioural problems, and m aternal reaction to b ehavioural problems At each of the assessments, the mothers were interviewed concerning common infant behavioral problems, such as feeding difficulties and crying, and how the mothers re- sponded to these problems.

Journal of the American Medical Association 1997; 278: 64 4-652 PICO Tabell 5 : Beskrivelse av PICO i The Memphis Trial ( Kitzman 1997 ) PICO P inclusion criteria Recruiting: Between June 1990 and August 1991 1290 consecutive women from the obstetrical clinic at the Regional Medical Center in Memphis were invited to participate in the study. - Women less than 29 weeks pregnant were recruited if they had no previous live births, no specific chronic illnesses thought to contribute to fetal growth retardation or preterm delivery (eg, chronic hy- pertensive disorders requiring medical treatment, severe cardiac disease, large uterine fibroids) - and at least 2 of the following sociodemographic risk conditions: unmarr ied, less than 12 years of education, and unemployed. setting Public system of obstetric care in Memphis, Tenn. Urban area. [We hypothesized in the current trial that effects of the program on maternal caregiving and childhood injuries would be greater for women with few psychological resources, where psychologi- cal resources were defined in terms of women's intellectual functioning and mental health, in addi- tion to their sense of control.] actual sample Eighty -eight percent (1139/1290) of the women completed informed consent and were randomized to 1 of 4 treatment conditions described below. Ninety two percent of the women enrolled were Afri-can American, 98% were unmarried, 64%were aged 18 years or younger at registration, and 85% came from households with incomes at or below the federal poverty guidelines. Compared with women who refused, those who agreed to participate were more likely to be African American than non- African American (89% vs 74%; P<.001); younger (average age, 18 vs 19 years; P= and non- high school graduates P=.01). A total of 1139 primarily African- American women at less than 29 weeks' gestation, with no previous live births, and with at least 2 sociodemographic risk characteristics (unmarried, <12 years of education, unemployed). [At registration, women were interviewed to determine standard socioeconomic conditions, their mental health, \"personality characteristics,\" obstetrical histories, health- related behaviors (cigarette smoking, alcohol and illegal drug use), and social support. Women also completed brief tests to esti- mate their levels of intellectual functioning. \"Women's pre- pregnancy weights and heights were also determined by self -report. The last weight s recorded in the prenatal record before delivery were used to calculate pregnancy weight gains.] [A variable was created to index women's psychological resources measured at registration. It was based on the summed z scores of their intelligence,\" mental health,\" and sense of mastery/self -effi- cacy.] I The experimental home -visitation program was carried out by the Memphis/Shelby County Health Department. The nurses completed an average of 7 home visits (range, 0- 18) during pregnancy and 26 home visits (range, 0- 71) during the first 2 years post -partum. They followed a detailed visit -by- visit protocol to guide their efforts to help women improve their health -related behaviors; care of their 13 children; and life -course development (pregnancy planning, educational achievement, and participa- tion in the workfor ce). Women in treatment 4 (n=228) were provided the same services as those in treatment 3; in addition, they continued to be visited by nurses through the child's second birthday C Women in treatment 1 (n=166) were provided free round -trip taxicab transportation for scheduled prenatal care appointments; they did not receive any postpartum services or assessments. Women in treatment 2 (n=515) were provided the free transportation for scheduled prenatal care plus developmental screening and referral services for the child at 6, 12, and24 months of age. Those in treatment 3 (n=230) were provided the free transportation and screening offered in treat- ment 2 plus intensive nurse home -visitation services during pregnancy, 1 postpartum visit in the hos- pital before discharge, and 1 postpartum visit in the home. NB: For the evaluation of the prenatal phase of the program, treatments 1 and 2 were combined to form a single comparison group and then contrasted with treatments 3 and 4, a group that was visited by nurses during pregnancy. For the postnatal phase of the study, treatment 2 was contrasted with treatment 4. An exception: Table 4: Comparison groups were treatment groups 1 and 2; nurse- visited groups, treatment groups 3 and 4. O Participating women were interviewed by research staff members at the time of registration (before their assignment to treatments), at the28th and 36thweeks of pregnancy, and at the sixth, 12th, and 24 th months of the child's life. Medical and social service records were abst racted. At registration, women were interviewed to determine standard socioeconomic The outcomes included pregnancy outcomes, birth outcomes, child injuries and hospitalisation out- comes, child mental and behavioural outcomes, and mothers' medical and social outcomes. Utfall The Memphis Trial ( Kitzman 1997 ) OUTCOMES MEASUREMENTS POINT OF TIME BIRTH OUTCOMES Obstetrical and newborn records were abstracted directly and verified against an on -line perinatal database from the University of Tennessee.

(Ultrasound was performed on all subjects at registration for pre- natal care.) If LMP and ultrasound converged within 14 days, then LMP was used for estimating gestational age. When LMP and ultrasound dif- fered by more than 14 days, ultrasound was used as the estimate. When ultrasound was not done before 26 weeks' gestation, or LMP was unknown, the record was reviewed by 2 clinicians, independently and unaware of treatment condition, to determine the most reliable esti- mate of gestational age. 0 mo 5-min Apgar score 0 mo Low birth weight {<2500 g) 0 mo 14 IUGR,\u00a7 % Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR): cases with birth weights less than 10th percentile for gestational age. 0 mo Preterm (<37 wk) 0 mo Indicated preterm delivery Preterm birth was divided into 2 categories: (1) spontaneous preterm birth after preterm labor, with or without prem- ature rupture of the membranes, Or (2) indicated preterm birth performed for maternal or fetal complica- tions. 0 mo Spontaneous preterm de- livery 0 mo Breastfeeding Attempted, duration 6 mo CHILD DEVELOPMENT Beliefs associated with child abuse, Bavolek to- tal score Mothers completed interviews that assessed (....) and their beliefs about children associated with child abuse and neglect (belief in physical pun- ishment, unrealistic expectations, lack of empathy, and role reversal).\" Mothers and children were observed while the mothers Bavolek SJ.

Women were allowed to enroll at any time before delivery. setting Denver Metropolitan area actual sample A total of 735 women were randomized into the control and treatment groups. Women could refuse participation actively or passively (not respond before they delivered). Com- pared with active refusals (n=244) and passive refusals (n=199), those who accepted were more likely to be Hispanic (45% accepted vs 37% active refusals and 39% passive refusals), and less likely to smoke cigarettes (27% accepted vs 44% active refusals and 32% passive refusals). These groups were similar on the other major sociodemographic characteristics, such as maternal age, language preference (English vs Spanish), and marital s tatus. At registration, interviews were conducted with participating women to determine their socioeco-nomic conditions (eg. maternal education, household annual income, housing density), mental health, personality characteristics, obstetric histories, psychoactive drug use, conflict with partners, conflict with their own mothers, and experience of domestic violence. Women c ompleted brief tests to measure their intellectual functioning 1 and supplied urine samples that were assayed with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry for cotinine and cocaine metabolites. Cocaine, marijuana, and alcohol use were too infrequently occurring to serve as valid outcomes to assess changes in women's substance use. Individuals with creatinine- adjusted cotinine values 80 ng/mL at intake were designated as smokers. A variable was created to index women's psychological resources measured at registration and based on the averaged z scores of their: 1) mental health, 2) sense of mastery, and 3) intelligence. It was dichotomized at raw score values that corresponded to the 50th percentile of these 3 varia- bles used to construct a corresponding variable which splitted the Denver sample into low (40% of the sample) and higher (60%) functioning groups. 1. Shipley W. A self -administered scale for measuring intellectual impairment and deterioration. J Psychol. 1940;9:371 -377 I There were 2 intervention groups: Women in the nurse group (n=235) were provided screening and referral plus nurse home visitation during pregnancy and infancy (the first 2 years of the child's l ife). Women assigned to the paraprofessional group (n=245) were provided the screening and referral services plus paraprofessional home visitation during pregnancy and infancy. The home- visitation program delivered by both nurses and paraprofessionals had 3 broad goals: 1) to improve maternal and fetal health during pregnancy by helping women improve their health - 19 related behaviors; 2) to improve the health and development of the child by helping parents pro- vide more competent caregiving; and 3) to enhance parents' personal development by helping them plan future pregnancies, continue their education, and find work. Visit -by-visit guidelines and detailed objectives provided direction to the visits. Visitors adapted the program to the needs and interests of families. Nurses were required to have BSN degrees and experience in community or maternal and child health nursing. Paraprofessionals were required to have a high school education but were ex- cluded if they had college preparation in the helping professions or a bachelor's degree in any dis- cipline. Both groups were required to have strong \"people skills.\" C Women in the control group (n=255) were provided developmental screening and referral services for their children at 6, 12, 15, 21, and 24 months old. They also were interested in detecting effects that were limited to half of the total sample that would be at higher risk (such as mothers with low psychological resources). For mother -child inter- action, home environment, and c hild outcomes, treatment group contrasts are reported for the low psychological resources group as well as the whole sample. Because of constraints of sample size and cost, the study was not designed to make direct comparisons between paraprofessionals and nurses. Planned contrasts focused on the test of nurse versus control and paraprofessional versus control. They nevertheless conducted secondary analyses that compared their effect sizes. O The multiplicity of settings in which participants obtained hea lth care in Denver and low rates of state -verified cases of child abuse and neglect in the target population made it impossible to use medical and child- protective- service records to assess obstetric, newborn, childhood- injury, and child maltreatment outcomes in the current trial. They therefore focused greater attention on meas- urement of infants' early emotional development, as infants' emotional communications are con-nected to their being abused, neglected, and reared by depressed mothers. The outcomes included in the study are; end- of-pregnancy assessments (prenatal use of tobacco, preventive services (mental health + legal aid + drug/alcohol treatment + child birth classes + rent and utility assistance + education and employment) and emergency services (emergency housing + emergency food banks)), maternal life course outcomes (educational achievement, participation in the work force, use of welfare), mother -infant interaction and quality of the home environment, child emotional , mental, and behavioural development.

PICO Tabell 13 : Beskrivelse av PICO i studien fra Nederland (Mejdoubi 2013) PICO P inclusion criteria Recruiting: a 2\u00bdyear period from 2007 to 2009 -Women were actively recruited with a two- stage selection procedure. -During the first stage, women were selected by general practitioners, midwives and other profes- sionals on the following criteria: maximum age of 25 years, low educational level (primary school or prevocational secondary school), maximum 28 weeks of gestation, no previous live births, understanding of the Dutch language. During the second stage women were interviewed by VoorZorg nurses, and an inclusion criterion was that women r eported at least one of the following additional risk factors: no social support, previously or currently experiencing domestic violence, psychosocial symptoms, unwanted and/or unplanned pregnancy, financial problems, housing difficulties, no education and/or employment alcohol and/or drug use. When a potential participant did not meet all of the inclusion criteria for the first stage, but had mul- tiple risk factors, the VoorZorg nurse presented the case to an independent expert committee, which decided on inclusion or exclusion. 23 setting 20 municipalities in the Netherlands actual sample Out of prior evaluation, it is known that about 50% of the women that were recruited in the first stage were excluded after the interview by the VoorZorg nurses in the second stage because they did not meet the second stage criteria. A total of 460 parti cipants were eligible and randomly assigned into the control or the intervention group. The number (%) of participants recruited by the expert committee was 77 (16,7%). At baseline, interviewers collected demographic information including age, ethnicity and education level at 16 to 28 weeks of pregnancy. All eligible women were randomized after stratification by region and ethnicity (Dutch, Suri- namese/Antillean, Turkish, Moroccan, Cape Verdean or other). Ethnicity classification was per- formed by the VoorZorg nurse based on participants' self -reports. At inclusion, participants were on average 19.4 years old and were included on average at 19.8 weeks pregnancy. The difference between control and intervention group was not significant for any of the var iables. Data were collected at between 16 and 28 weeks and at 32 weeks of pregnancy, at 2, 6, 12 and 24 months post birth. Trained female interviewers were available in each region and women were interviewed at home. All questionnaires were validated or were applied in other studies and pub- lished in the literature. The interviewers were independent from the VoorZorg nurses. Women were usually interviewed by the same interviewers at each data collecting moment. The interviews were conducted in private if p ossible. I Prior to this study, the NFP was translated into Dutch and culturally adapted to accommodate the needs of pregnant women in the Netherlands and to be integrated into the Dutch child health care system. Women in the intervention group (n=237) received the VoorZorg programme and were offered, in addition to usual care, approximately 10 home visits during pregnancy, 20 during the first year and 20 during the second life year of the child by trained, special ised VoorZorg nurses. The duration of each visit is between one hour and one and a half hour. The VoorZorg nurses were certified nurses working in Youth Health Care organizations and re- ceived specialised training (according to the NFP). The VoorZorg trainings also included training on how to reduce smoking with the V -MIS a nationwide smoking cessation programme1, and how to promote breastfeeding. According to the protocol, six domains were discussed during the home visits: (1) the health status of the mother, (2) the child's health and safety, (3) the personal devel- opment of the mother, (4) the role of the mother, (5) the mother's relation with her partner, family and friends and (6) the use of (health) care organizations. 1. deVries, H., Mudde, A., Leij s, I., et al., 2003. The European Smoking prevention Framework Approach (EFSA): an example of integral prevention. Health Education Research 18, 611 -626. C All women received usual care provided by the Dutch Youth Health Care Organizations (n=223). Every pregnant woman in the Netherlands receives maternal health care by a midwife. The care- giver (midwife or obstetrician) offers health education, performs physical examinations and moni- tors the development of the fetus. In the Netherlands, every newborn will automatically be regis- tered in a Youth Health Care organization (ambulatory well -baby clinic) to monitor the health and development of the child, and parents are supported in their parenthood. From 2002 onwards the V-MIS was disseminated among all midwives in the Netherlands. The V -MIS aimed at smoking cessation and is adjusted for pregnant women. O The trial outcomes included; maternal cigarette smoking at 16 -28 weeks and 32 weeks of preg- nancy and two months after birth as well as maternal smoking near t he child, adverse pregnancy outcomes, birth weight and gestational age, breastfeeding, child development at 6, 18, and 24 months of age and intimate partner violence. Number of risk factors for child abuse such as demographic factors (age, ethnicity, whether the pregnancy was wanted, whether women received financial help or housing assistance from the 24 government), depression, domestic violence, and substance use were al so measured by self re- porting. Not all the outcomes are included in the analyses of this study. This study just used four data col- lection moments (16 -28 wk, 32 wk, 2 mo, 6 mo) for the analyses.

Women were identified and approached via local maternity services and recruited usually at their home by locally based researchers. actual sample (only in table) I Adapting the programme for delivery in England as the Family Nurse Partnership involved adoption of young maternal age as a criterion for programme eligibility. This was selected as a proxy for low income and associated with long- term child outcomes that would be easily measurable in clinical practice. Programme materials were adapted to reflect a UK English speaking clientele. Three addi- tional requirements for FNP as introduced in England were the provision of regular psychological support via specialist supervision to Family nurses, the provision of safeguarding supervision and systems and the incorporation of FNP into local clinical governance arrangements. Following a pro- gramme of model improvement particularly on client retention led by the Prevention Research Cen- tre at the University of Colorado, Denver Motivational Interviewing was introduced as a core model element and a central part of the Family Nurse training when introduced in England. This aims for nurses to use a mainly guiding communication style with clients. + usual care (see below) C Usual care: All participants (both groups) were eligible to receive usually provided publicly funded health and so-cial care. This included the HCP (universally offered screening, education, immunisation, and sup- port from birth to the child's second birthday) delivered by either family nurses (FNP group) or spe- cialist community public health nurses (usual care group), and maternity care appropriate to clinical need. 28 O Primary endpoints were biomarker -calibrated self -reported tobacco use by the mother at late preg- nancy, birthweight of the baby, the proportion of women with a second pregnancy within 24 months post-partum, and emergency attendances and hospital admissions for the child within 24 months post-partum.

Each visit typically lasts 60-90 min. PH Ns use visit -to-visit guidelines that were adapted for Canadian settings. Beyond their intensive NFP education, PHNs also receive regular individual and team reflective supervision and support to ensure fidelity to essential elements of the NFP program model. 32 C Within BC's universal healthcare system, all trial participants, including those receiving NFP, are eli- gible to receive existing services (usual care) provided in their Health Authority. Existing health ser- vices for pregnant women and young children vary across BC but may include: primary healthcare services, provided by physicians and also by midwives in some circumstances; specialist physician services; public health programs including pregnancy screening and outreach, prenatal classes and brief forms of home visiting by (non- NFP) nurses or paraprofessionals; and a variety of targeted and universal parenting and early child development programs. Health Authorities also provide adult mental healthcare including substance misuse and harm reduction services. In BC, all basic public health services are typically provided at no cost. O One primary outcome indicator has been identified: the average number of physician encounters per child for (intentional and unintentional) injuries, measured in community/outpatient, emergency and hospital settings from birth through to age two years. Four secondary outcome indicators have also been identified: prenatal nicotine and alcohol use; child cognitive development (language and cognitive abilit y) at age two years; child behaviour (inter- nalizing and externalizing problems) at age two years; and the incidence of subsequent pregnancies by 24 months postpartum.

RCT 1 - The Elmira Trial (New York) Recruitment: April 1978 - Sept. 1980 N=400 No information No information No information 36 RCT 2 - The Memphis Trial Recruitment: June 1990 - August 1991 N=1139 For all calculations, = 0.05 (2 - tailed) and = 0.20 were used. Sample size was estimated so that it would be sufficiently large (after attrition) to detect program effects that were limited to one half of t he total sample defined as being at higher risk according to characteristics such as moth- ers' having few psychological re- sources. 1468 for the prenatal phase and 734 for the postnatal phase of the study. Smaller sample was estimated for the postnatal phase based on larger treatment effects for postnatal outcomes than for prenatal outcomes in the Elmira study. No (prenatal: 72% of esti- mated needed sample size, postnatal: 91% of estimated needed sample size) RCT 3 - The Denver Study Recruitment: March 29, 1994, through June 15, 1995 N=735 For all calculations, = 0.05 (2 - tailed) and = 0.20 were used, assuming effects in the range of 0.30 SD's between each treat- ment and control. To detect ef- fects that were limited to half of the total sample that would be at higher risk (such as mothers with low psychological resources), they had estimated power to de- tect differences in the 0.42 SD range 750 (allows for 20% attrition rate) Recruitment: Analysis: Prenatal: 2\u00bdyear pe- riod from 2007 to 2009 N=460 For all calculations, = 0.05 (2 - tailed) and = 0.20 were used. A sample size of 57 smokers per group were estimated in order to detect an aver- age decrease in smoking by 4 cigarettes a day (8 SD) during pregnancy. They esti- mate that 25% of all women smoke at the start of the pregnancy, hence a total esti- mated needed sample size was 456 with a 1:1 group rati o Recruitment: yes; Analysis: No (analyzed: 188 arm, 217 inter- vention arm = total: 405) RCT 5 - Eng- land Recruitment: June 16, 2009, and July 28, 2010 N=1645 For all calculations, = 0.05 (2 - tailed) and = 0.10 were used. For each outcome measure, the expected improvement for the NFP arm relates to a small standardised difference (approx. 0.2 or odds ratio 0.6). Allow for a pregnancy loss of 1.5%. 1418, aimed to recruit 1600 pregnant women to detect differences between the two arms of 10% (40% to 30%) in the pro- portion having any emergency attendance or emergency admission to hospital within two years, and of 7.5% (20% to 12.5%) in the proportion with a second pregnancy within two years. This takes into account anticipated pregnancy loss and lo ss to fol- low up. Recruitment: yes, (1645).
