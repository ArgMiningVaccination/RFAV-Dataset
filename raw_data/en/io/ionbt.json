Two of the most come models of health and healing are Western Medicine and Eastern Medicine. These two approaches are vastly This relevant data about Native American substance abuse is just a remark that these communities still have a long way to go in terms of health and healing treatment, but it shows that even though they have communities ravaged by alcohol, drugs and diseases like smallpox they are still here and will make their voices heard. For over a decade, acute and chronic back pain has been treated with opioid analgesics also known as opiates or narcotics (such as Percocet or Oxycontin), and nonopioid analgesic, including NSAID's (such as Naproxen and Ibuprofen). On average, 182,727,272 opioid analgesic prescriptions are dispensed annually (Dal Pan, 2016). Unfortunately, each of which is accompanied by potentially serious adverse effects. Opioids serious side effects including respiratory depression, drowsiness, nausea, constipation, addiction, and ultimately death. Although constipation does not sound like a serious side effect, it does pose the potential for serious consequences. Because of the depressed peristalsis of the gastrointestinal tract or ileus the patient can develop constipation or Throughout the span of mankind's history, Ancient Egypt and Ancient China was two of the oldest and most convoluted civilizations. In worldwide history, Ancient Egypt and Ancient China differs in most factors such as social, economic, and political which shaped their developments. These distinctions decide their positioning in headway all throughout world history. Ancient China evolutionized more than Ancient Egypt, and it''s discoveries had an essential impact on how the world functions from the past till today. Countless scientists in history have conducted experiments to make contributions and advancements in every field of scientific study imaginable. Although new knowledge is always appreciated, there are rare occasions when a discovery is made that can impact the way we once perceived our body and mind. When groundbreaking discoveries are Tai chi is a centuries old mind and body exercise that was developed in China. Tai chi has currently gained more popularity America. In the article \"Easing Ills through Tai Chi\" by Nell Porter Brown, he discusses researchers studies on the benefits of tai chi for overall health. The article begins by quoting a Harvard Medical School instructor and tai chi advocate Catherine Kerr on \"Doing tai chi makes me feel lighter on my feet. I'm stronger in my legs, more alert, more focused, and more relaxed\u2014it just puts me in a better mood all around.\" Nevertheless, tai chi is not a magical cure-all according to Catherine Kerr; and the possible physiological benefits of tai chi is still rudimentary. However, from Catherine Kerr's personal encounters with Evaluating a chronic pain condition from a biological perspective is limiting, and often fails to fully explain the patient's symptoms. In contrast to the biomedical model, which explains pain purely in terms of pathophysiology, the biopsychosocial model views pain, suffering and disability, as the result of dynamic interactions among biological, psychological, behavioral, social, cultural and environmental factors. Consequently, assessment requires not only the examination of the biological dimension, but of the psychological and social dimensions as well. A patient's experience of pain and response to any treatment for pain are affected not only by biologically determined nociceptive (nervous system transmission) processes, but also by psychological factors such as mood (for example, depression, anxiety) and appraisals (thoughts and beliefs about the pain), as well as by psychosocial factors such as the responses of others (for example, family, friends, An acupuncture is a complementary medical practice that entails stimulating certain points on the body, most often with a needle penetrating the skin, to alleviate pain or to help treat various health conditions. Acupuncture is used to treat other musculoskeletal conditions and pain conditions, including knee pain, low back pain, neck pain, morning sickness, headache, sprain...etc. Western medicine is increasing the lives of many in different ways using advances in the medical field. Western medicine is the process of looking at the body like a machine it finds a problem and fixes that problem. Today Western medicine is superior and eastern medicine is considered taboo. Eastern medicine looks at the body as a garden and instead of giving you medication they try to start at the root of the problem by talking about what's going on in your life. The Chinese practice and exercise of Falun Gong has a short history. But it plays an important role in China for political reasons. The history of Falun Gong is only ten years old. But the ideas and practices is based on a tradition throughout the entire history of the Chinese civilization. The practice is a different form of qigong. The cultivation of qi or the energy that flows throughout the human body and the universe, has been a theory in many different practices of Chinese culture. Even the traditional Chinese medicine is partially based on the theory of qi. During the ten years history, Falun Gong has developed millions of participants and followers. It also got a lot of attention from many others including the Chinese government. However Analgesics are required to manage acute or chronic pain. The nociceptive pains are managed by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Normally pain produced during any injury in road accidents, rail accidents, tsunami, flood, terrorism and war are acute severe pain and an analgesic is required to manage them .The preferred analgesic is an opioid. Morphine, a proto type of opioid has various adverse effects like physical dependence, constipation, vomiting, respiratory depression. Among the opioids, buprenorphine is used for the development of an analgesic autoinjector which has the advantage among other opioids like better pharmacological effect, lesser physical dependence and ceiling effect of respiratory depression (Rosenblum et al,2008) Acupuncture for back pain is proven to be an effective therapy when performed by experienced acupuncturists. Many studies have shown that acupuncture can alleviate chronic back pain and enhance well-being in general. The studies also show that acupuncture techniques provide better results in relieving back pain than physical therapies and medications. Today, the medical world recognizes two tips of medicine, the conventional medicine known as Western and the Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM). Although, they are by logic completely opposites in practice the have some similarities. The first one, is accepted in most of the advance countries. Though, the second one is having a lot of attention not just from de common people but from the biomedical system as part of their usual treatments. That is why the differences and similarities between Chiropractic as part of the CAM world and the Biomedical Model are getting smaller and closer together. Complementary and Alternative medicine (CAM) consider all forms of therapies outside the field of medical practice. CAM is attracting more attention within the context of health care provision and health sector reform.Use of CAM remains common in developing countries and is increasing knowledge and concern in developed countries.Cultural beliefs and practices often lead self-care, home remedies or consultation with traditional healers particularly in far as in rural and Bedouin communities. (16) In a cold winter day, have you ever observed white smoke come out from your mouth when you exhale? Have you ever thoroughly felt the force pressing on your skin when wind blows? These are some of the states that \"qi\" appears in our daily lives. In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TMC), qi plays as a fundamental component from time to time explaining its ideas. Theories of both Chinese and Western medicine exist for helping people maintain good health and away from deceases. Western medicine relies more on scientific proof \"Western medicine places strong emphasis on the physical structures of the body, which are made up of different organic and inorganic substances, proteins, tissues and cells.\" (Shen Lung Ltd, 2002) Unlike western medicine, TMC originates and relies very much on Chinese philosophical theories. And the theory of qi is one of them. This essay will be explaining what qi is in Chinese medicine, including its general concept, movement and flow in human body, functions, what would be "}
