It's based on scientific research showing that thoughts, emotions, and relationships all influence our health and well-being. As Hippocrates once wrote, \"The natural healing force within each one of us is the greatest force in getting well.\" This is the essence of mind-body therapy. Mind-body therapy can help anyone live a less stressful and more fulfilling life, but it's particularly effective in helping people who have been diagnosed with a medical condition, including: - Chronic stress - Chronic pain - Headaches - Fibromyalgia - Chronic fatigue - Cancer - Nausea/vomiting related to chemotherapy - Heart disease - High blood pressure - Sleep problems - Diabetes - Gastrointestinal conditions - Menopausal symptoms - Coping with medical condition If you have been diagnosed with a medical condition, it's important for you to know that mind-body therapy is not about eliminating symptoms or curing your condition. It's about reducing or managing those symptoms that can be changed through mind-body methods, increasing your acceptance of those aspects of your condition that cannot be changed, and creating a life that is vital and meaningful. It's also important for you to know that mind-body therapy is meant to be coordinated with your standard medical treatment. You should not discontinue your standard medical treatment without consulting with your medical provider, and you should not begin mind-body therapy without consulting with your medical provider. Mind-body therapy involves two phases: - The assessment phase focuses on understanding the various psychological and psychosocial factors that are influencing your health and well-being, and which factors may support or interfere with your medical treatment. This phase typically involves completion of psychological testing and a few sessions with me. Depending on your situation, I also may ask for your permission to consult with your medical doctor so we can coordinate treatment. At the end of this phase, we will develop a personalized treatment plan to help you reach your treatment goals. - The intervention phase focuses on helping you reach your treatment goals. Some of the methods used in mind-body therapy include psychotherapy, positive psychology interventions, meditation, mindfulness training, relaxation training, progressive muscle relaxation, autogenic training, and guided imagery. If faith or spirituality is important to you, we also can discuss how spiritual practices may improve your health and well-being. Your medical condition is only one part of the complete experience that is your life. Mind-body therapy can help you change the way you relate to your condition so you can live your life fully.
