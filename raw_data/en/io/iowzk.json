But, we forget that we can frequently impact our health in a positive way, or heal what ails us with things found right in our pantry or the local grocery store. Natural remedies can come in many forms including food, herbs, vitamins, minerals and more. Many people in the health community have long known of the amazing power of turmeric and others are finally starting to catch on. Turmeric is a plant in the ginger family and is commonly ground up and used as a spice or seasoning, commonly found in curry. But, turmeric is not just a delicious seasoning, it has amazing healing powers for a wide variety of ailments and illnesses.](https://www.healthforlifend.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/clinical-nutrition.jpg) Turmeric has been used in homeopathy for centuries, treating a variety of conditions including Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, cancer, asthma, allergies, digestive issues, cough, skin diseases, and more. It also is used to reduce inflammation and as an antiseptic. Turmeric, or curcumin, is being shown to treat some of the biggest health concerns in America, including cancer, cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer's disease, as [Vitality](http://vitalitymagazine.com/article/turmeric/) points out \"Curcumin's role in cancer prevention is largely due to its antioxidant actions, which enable it to protect cells from free radical damage. Oxygen radicals and other types of reactive oxygen molecules have been experimentally shown to disrupt many functions in living cells, largely due to their ability to damage cellular DNA. It is currently thought that damage to cells by free radicals may lead to cancer, and studies have also shown that decreased levels of antioxidants are associated with an increased risk of developing cancer. Another benefit of turmeric is that it can help prevent oxidation of cholesterol in the body, which means it can protect against cardiovascular disease. Research has shown that oxidized cholesterol is what damages blood vessel walls and contributes to the plaque formation that can lead to heart attack or stroke. Thus, by preventing oxidation of cholesterol, curcumin can reduce the progression of heart disease... The production of beta amyloid plaques is known to play a role in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease, and researchers have found that curcumin inhibits amyloid plaque formation and even dissolves amyloid fibrils more effectively than anti-inflammatory drugs. They also found that curcumin crosses the blood-brain barrier and prevents amyloid fragments from clumping together into plaques. Studies in mice have also found that curcumin may be able to slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease by interrupting the destruction of the myelin sheath that protects nerves in the body.\" Turmeric can be incorporated into your daily health routine in a variety of ways. As mentioned, turmeric is a delicious spice and can be included in dishes such as curry, vegetable side dishes, relish, chutney, or on chicken or fish. Further, drinking turmeric tea is great for your health and can be bought from the store ready to be added to hot water or you can make your own turmeric tea with fresh turmeric. Turmeric can also be added to other drinks such as coffee or mixed with coconut milk for a soothing bedtime drink. Further, by consulting your naturopathic physician you can discuss supplements that contain turmeric or other ways to incorporate turmeric into your health routine so that you can maximize your health and treat illnesses or other conditions naturally.
