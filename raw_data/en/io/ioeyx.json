Several organs and processes are involved such as bone marrow, lymphocytes, the spleen, lymph nodes, and the thymus gland. White blood cells such as neutrophils, macrophages and dendritic cells identify what is not our body and destroy those cells. Eastern medicine focuses on building up the body's internal defense system so that the microbe has no chance of getting a foothold. Strengthening the immune response involves building the Defensive Qi, an energetic layer of Yang (warm, invigorating) energy that lives between the skin and the muscles. Since Defensive energy depends on sufficient strength and warmth of the body, this explains why we need to keep our body warm in fall and winter and get enough rest to keep colds at bay. When the Defensive energy is strong we either don't catch the cold or flu going around, or if we do catch it, our body has the strength to fight it off quickly. One recent study presented by the Sleep Research Society concluded that those who sleep only 5-6 hours per night have a greater risk of catching a cold. The lymph system acts as the body's internal vacuum cleaner, cleaning up all the microbes and waste materials and flushing them out. Since the lymph system does not have a pump, it requires exercise or therapy such as massage, cupping, or skin brushing to move the lymph to promote proper drainage. For this reason, it is so important to get some type of regular exercise to avoid lymph stagnation which can weaken immunity. There are also foods and herbs that can support the strengthening of the Yang/Defensive energy as well as improve blood circulation to support lymph drainage. Foods that Strengthen Immunity: Green leafy vegetables (kale, spinach, collards, broccoli, cabbage, parsley), mushrooms (shitake, reishi, chaga, oyster, (such as kombucha, sauerkraut, kimchi, miso, tempeh, pickles, yogurt without sugar), coconuts and coconut oil, berries, chlorella, garlic, ginger, green tea. Herbs that Strengthen Immunity Licorice (avoid if blood pressure is high), tusli, honeysuckle, chrysanthemum, elderberry, black pepper, cinnamon, cloves, oregano, yarrow, tumeric, echinacea. Foods that Weaken Immunity Sugar, artificial sweeteners such as aspartame, sucralose, processed fats such as margarine, trans-fats, fried foods, rancid oils, preservatives, artificial colourings and flavourings, rancid oils, red meat, alcohol, drugs, processed foods, and foods that are not fresh. Regular acupuncture treatments can also build up immunity using point combinations to strengthen your Defensive energy, your warming invigorating Yang energy, as well improving circulation of blood and lymph depending on what each individual requires. Wishing you health and happiness! Cynthia References: - Aric PhD2 Prather AA, Janicki-Deverts D, Hall MH, Cohen S. (November 2016). Behaviorally assessed sleep and susceptibility to the common cold.
