Unfortunately, the human body cannot produce it's own Vitamin C, therefore, it has to be supplemented by outside sources. Vitamin C has been studied since the 1930's, and research has shown that it can improve quality of life for cancer patients, reduce incidence of infections, relieve fatigue, and more, while having minimal side effects. Vitamin C is the nutrient required for the synthesis of collagen, an important structural component of blood vessels, tendons, ligaments, and bones. Vitamin C also plays an important role in the synthesis of the neurotransmitter drug use. Neurotransmitters are critical for brain function and are known to affect mood. In addition, Vitamin C is required for synthesis of carnitine. Carnitine plays a critical role in energy production. It transports long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria, so they can be oxidized (\"burned\") to produce energy. Why High-Dose Vitamin C? Vitamin C exists in the foods we eat, but only in a small amount. High-dose vitamin C treatments enhance the benefits that the nutrient offers. You can receive high-dose vitamin C either orally or through IV infusion. IV vitamin C therapy allows vitamin C to enter the bloodstream directly through the veins. This means that vitamin C reaches higher levels in the body at a much faster rate than oral ingestion. For more information on how to get high dose Vitamin C therapy, please contact our "}
