Virus -like particle (VLP) 23 vaccines form the basis of two of the most successful licen sed vaccines (against hepatitis B 24 virus (HBV) and human papillomavirus). They are produced by recombinant expression of 25 viral structural proteins, which self -assemble into immunogenic nanoparticles. VLPs can also 26 be modified to present unrelated antigens, and here we describe a universal 'bolt -on' vac cine 27 platform (termed VelcroVax) where the capturing VLP and the target antigen (hapten) are 28 produced separately. We utilise a modified HBV core (HBcAg) VLP, with surface expression 29 of a high-affinity binding sequence (Affimer) directed against a SUMO tag and use this to 30 capture SUMO glycoprotein from the arenavirus, Jun\u00edn virus (JUNV) Using this 31 model system, we have solved high-resolution structure s of VelcroVax VLPs , and shown that the VelcroVax -JUNV gp1 complex induces superior humoral immun e responses compared to 33 the non -complexed viral protein. We propose that this system could be modi fied to present a 34 range of haptens and therefore form the foundation of future rapid -response vaccination 35 strategies. 36 37 .

Vaccines have been developed for more than 20 40 different pathogens, and more than 15 additional organisms are recognised by the World 41 Health Organi zation ( WHO ) as priority pathogens with epidemic or pandemic potential. 42 Although the WHO endeavours to accelerate the development of vaccines for these priority 43 pathogens for use in low- and middle -income countries (LMICs ), there are significant 44 challenges to their development and deployment1. These include safety , efficacy and the need 45 to maintain a cold chain when delivering vaccines to remote areas . Importantly, the availability 46 of vaccines in endemic regions is essential to control the spread of pathogens and facilitate 47 the prevention of future global pandemics. 48 The list of pathogens with epidemic or pandemic potential varies among global authorities . 49 The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) priority list includes some new 50 world arenaviruses , including Jun\u00edn virus (JUNV) , which causes a potentially lethal 51 haemorrhagic disease known as Argentine haemorrhagic fever (AHF)2,3. JUNV is transmitted 52 via rodents ( Calomys musculinus ) and contracted via contact with infected excretions or 53 aerosol s. Outbreaks of AHF in the 1960s and 1970s resulted in thousands of deaths and had 54 case fatality rates between 15 -30%4-6. Total cases decreased in the following decades and 55 have fallen substantially since the introduction of a live attenuated vaccine in affected regions 56 of Argentina6-8. Despite the success of this vaccine, as with a ll attenuated virus vaccines, there 57 remain safety concern s regarding the potential for reversion to a pathogenic form . 58 The a dvancement of technologies used for vaccine production and purification have 59 contributed to the generation of safer vaccines. For example , virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines 60 for hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human papillomavirus (HPV) have shown exemplary safety 61 and efficacy9-10. Most recently , recombinant non -replicating viral vectors and RNA vaccines 62 have been produced rapidly and also show impressive safety and efficacy profiles11-13. 63 Critically, in contrast to attenuated vaccines, inactivated, subunit, , RNA or 64 toxoid vaccines are non-replicative , so do not pose the risk of reversion to a pathogenic form. 65 This makes recombinant technologies the most attractive approach for the development of 66 safer next -generation vaccines. 67 The efficacy of subunit vaccines can be enhanced when the subunit exists as a nanoparticle . 68 Nanoparticles may be naturally occurring (VLPs), artificially or modified biological 69 chimera s17-19. Indeed, chimeric VLP technology has allowed the deployment of the first 70 licensed anti -malaria vaccine, Mosquirix18,20. The success of this vaccine suggests that a 71 chimeric VLP approach is both tractable and suitable for improving responses against 72 .

The approach we have pursued relies upon the surface display of a 75 capturing molecule ( e.g. antibody, nanobody) on a nanoparticle carrier , which is able to bind 76 and display an antig en of interest (hapten) tagged with an appropriate sequence. Poorly 77 immunogenic haptens displayed on nanoparticles are more effectively recognised In addition , nanoparticle size (30-100 nm) can influence T helper bias and T helper 79 epitopes from protein -based nanoparticle s can contribute to anti -hapten immunity , thus 80 humoral responses generated are likely to be higher affinity and more diverse22-26. 81 Here , we describe a vaccine system in which a carrier nanopart icle and hapten are produced 82 separately. We have developed a modified HBV core (HBcAg) VLP , termed VelcroVax a SUMO -Affimer . Affimers are produced by pha ge display approaches, 84 are small (~13 kDa) and can be expressed in a range of systems27. We used th ese VLPs to 85 capture the SUMO -tagged JUNV glycoprotein Using this model system, characterise 86 VelcroVax structurally and functionally, using comparative immunisation trials to determine 87 whethe r JUNV gp1 coupling to VLPs alters the immune response generated. We propose that 88 this system may be modified for a range of haptens and could form the foundation of future 89 rapid -response vaccination strategies. 90 91 Methods: 92 Generation of HBcAg VLPs in yeast 93 Genes encoding either HBcAg or VelcroVax were introduced downstream of the AOX1 94 promoter within the pPinkHC expression vector (ThermoFisher Scientific ). The VelcroVax 95 sequence consists of a fused HBcAg dimer with the SUMO -Affimer sequence introduced 96 within the first major immunodominant region ( MIR) of this dimer. A Gly -Ser linking sequence 97 was used to provide flexibility to this domain , and for consistency this Gly-Ser linker was 98 present in all HBcAg subunits used here. Similar to previously describe d protocols28, plasmids 99 were linearised with AflII and electroporated into PichiaPink strain 1 (Invitrogen), then 100 transformed yeast were plated on adenine dropout (PAD) media and incubated at 28\u00b0C for 3 - 101 5 days. To screen for expression, colonies were selec ted at random and inoculated into 5 mL 102 YPD media (10 g/L yeast extract, 5 g/L peptone, 20 g/L Dextrose) before incubation at 28\u00b0C, 103 250 rpm for 48 hours. Cells were pelleted at 1,500 rcf and resuspended in 1 mL YPM g/L 104 yeast extract, 5 g/L peptone, 2% v/v methanol). Cultures were incubated at 28\u00b0C, 250 rpm for 105 72 hours, and supplemented with 1 or 2% v/v methanol every VelcroVax and HBcAg .

Cells were collected at 48 hours and assessed for scFv production 107 by western blot. 108 For large -scale production , a glycerol stock of VelcroVax - or HBcAg -expressing P. pastoris 109 was used to inoculate 5 mL YPD and incubated at 28\u00b0C for 48 hours at 250 rpm before 110 inoculation into 200 mL of YPD and incubat ion for a further 48 hours at 28\u00b0C, 250 rpm. Cells 111 were pelleted at 1,500 rcf and resuspended in 200 mL YPM ( 1 or 2% v/v methanol, as above) 112 before incubation at 28\u00b0C, 250 rpm for 72 hours. Media w ere supplemented with methanol 113 every 24 hours. Cells were pelleted at 4,000 rcf and resuspended in 30 mL EDTA -free 114 breaking buffer (50 mM Na 3PO 4, v/v glycerol, pH 7.4) with inhibitor cocktail (Roche). 116 VLP purification and quantitation 117 To isolate VLPs from P. pastoris , cells were disrupted at 40 kpsi and supplemented with 1 mM 118 MgCl and 250 units denarase (c -LEcta) before incubation at room temperature for 2 hours 119 with agitation. Samples were clarified at 4,000 rcf and clarified supernata nt was precipitated 120 overnight at 4\u00b0C with 20% v/v saturated ammonium sulphate solution (structural 121 8% w/v PEG -8000 (immunogenicity and antigenicity studies). Precipitated material was 122 pelleted at 4,000 rcf for 30 minutes and re -suspended in 30 mL PBS. Insoluble material was 123 removed by centrifugation at 10,000 rcf . The s oluble material was pelleted through a 30% 124 sucrose cushion at 150,000 rcf for 3.5 hours. Pellets were resuspended in 1 mL PBS and 125 separated on a 15-45% sucrose gradient at 50,000 rcf for 12 hours. 1 mL fractions were 126 collected manually (top down) and assessed for the presence of HBcAg -reactive proteins by 127 western blot with mAb 10E11 using standard protocols . The protein content of fractions was 128 assessed directly by BCA assay (Pierc e, ThermoFisher Scientific) , or the VLPs were 129 concentrated, and buffer exchange d using 100 k mwco PES concentrator columns (Pierce, 130 Thermo Scientific) before quantification by BCA assay . To purify VLPs for structural analysis, 131 this protocol was slightly mod ified, as described in Snowden et al . (2021)29. 132 Electron microscopy 133 To prepare samples for negative stain EM, carbon -coated 300 -mesh copper grids (Agar 134 Scientific, UK) were glow -discharged under air (10 mA, 30 s) before applying 3 \u00b5L sample for 135 30 s. Excess liquid was wicked away, then grids were washed two to four times with 10 \u00b5L 136 distilled H 2O. Staining was then performed with 1 - 2% uranyl acetate solution (UA). UA was 137 applied (10 \u00b5L) and immediately wicked away, then an additional 10 \u00b5L UA was applied and 138 allowed to incubate for 30 s prior to blotting and leaving to air dry. Imaging was performed 139 using either (i) an FEI Tecnai G2 -spirit with LaB 6 electron source, operating at 120 kV and 140 equipped with a Gatan Ultra Scan 4000 CCD cam era, with a calibrated object sampling of 141 .

Briefly , ultrathin 144 continuous carbon -coated lacey carbon 400 -mesh copper grids (Agar Scientific, UK) were 145 glow discharged in air (10 mA, 30 s), then 3 \u00b5L sample were applied to the grid surface for 146 30 s in a humidity -controlled chamber (8 C, 80% relative humidity). Excess liquid was 147 removed by blotting (1.0 - 4.0 s) before plunge freezing in liquid nitrogen -cooled liquid ethane 148 using a LEICA EM GP plunge f reezing device (Leica Microsystems, Germany). Imaging was 149 performed using an FEI Titan Krios transmission EM (ABSL, University of Leeds) operating at 150 300 kV, with a calibrated object sampling of 1.065 \u00c5/pixel. Full data collection parameters are 151 provided i n Table S1. 152 Image processing 153 Image processing was performed using the Relion 3.0 and Relion 3.1 pipeline s30,31. 154 MotionCor232 was used to correct any motion -induced blurring in raw micrographs, then CTF 155 parameters were estimated using Gctf33. A small subset of VLPs (both T = 4 and T = 3*) was 156 manually selected and used to generate 2D class averages, used as templates for automated 157 picking of the entire dataset. Initially, ~250,000 particles (including contaminants and 158 erroneously selected are as of carbon) were extracted and 2 down -sampled for 2D 159 classification, with CTFs ignored until the first peak. All classes resembling VLPs (~13 0,000 160 particles) were taken forward for additional 2D classification without CTFs ignored until the 161 first peak, at which point two independent particle stacks were created and re -extracted 162 without down -sampling: one for T = 4 VLPs and one for T = 3* VLPs (each containing ~50,000 163 particles). 3D refinement was performed separately for each particle stack, based on ini tial 164 models generated de novo in Relion, with symmetry imposed (I1 for T = 4, C5 for T = 3*). 165 Where appropriate, m ap resolution and quality were improved by iterative cycles of CTF 166 refinement, Bayesian polishing and 3D refinement with a solvent mask applie d and flattened 167 Fourier shell correlation (FSC) calculations. Maps were sharpened using a solvent -excluding 168 mask and a nominal resolution determined using the 'gold standard' FSC criterion (FSC = 169 0.143) (Figure S2, Table S 2), then l ocal resolution was calculated and a local resolution - 170 filtered map generated in Relion. 171 For T = 4 VLPs, focussed classification was performed in an attempt to resolved Affimer 172 density, using a protocol described previously29,34 -36. Briefly, SPIDER37 was used to generate 173 a cylindrical mask which was manually placed above a four -helix bundle using UCSF 174 Chimera38. A soft -edge was added to the mask in Relion. T = 4 VLP particles and their 175 associated orientational information from a symmetrised 3D refinement were use d to generate 176 .

This data was 177 then subjected to masked 3D classification without alignments, with a regularisation parameter 178 of 40. 179 Model building and refinement 180 Atomic models were built into the density maps for both T = 4 and T = 3* VLPs. Firstly, a 181 homology model was generated using SWISS -MODEL39. Copies of this model were fitted into 182 density for each quasi -equivalent position within the T = 4 and T = 3* VLP asy mmetric units 183 using UCSF Chimera38, and unresolved segments of the peptide backbone were removed. 184 Models were then inspected and manually refined in Coot40 before automated refinement in 185 Phenix41 to improve model -to-map fit and atomic geometry. This process was repeated 186 iteratively, with at least one iteration performed with a symmetrised atomic model to avoid 187 erroneous placement of atomic coordinates in density from adjacent asymmetric units. Mode l 188 validation (Table S2) was performed using Mol Probity42. 189 Structure analysis and visualisation 190 Visualisation of structural data was performed in UCSF Chimera38, UCSF ChimeraX43 and 191 PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 2.1, Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC). RMSD 192 calculations were performed using the 'MatchMaker' tool in UCSF Chimera, with default 193 settings. 194 Generation of recombinant JUNV gp1 195 The sequence encoding a mino acids JUNV gp1 (GenBan k ACO52428) amplified into a pHLsec vector44 containing a C -terminal SUMO hexahistidine tag. gp1-SUMO construct was transfected into 198 human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells, grown in roller bottles f or transient expression45. 199 Four days post -transfection, cell supernatant was supplemented with NaCl (700 mM), Tris 200 pH 8.0 (20 mM) and imidazole (15 mM). JUNV gp1 was purified by immobilized metal affinity 201 chromatography, using a 5 -mL HisTrap Excel column (Cytiva), followed by size -exclusion 202 chromatography (SEC) with a Superdex 200 increase 10/300 GL column (Cytiva) equilibrated 203 with 15 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 200 mM NaCl, and 0.5 mM EDTA. The JUNV gp1 containing peak 204 was further purified over a 1 -mL HiTRAP Q (HP ) column (Cytiva) using a 30 mM Tris pH 8.0 205 running buffer and a linear, 0 -500 mM NaCl gradient. The JUNV gp1 was re -purified by SEC 206 (as above). Following concentration, protein samples were snap -frozen and stored at -80 \u00baC . 207 208 209 .

Plates were 211 coated with 50 \u00b5L 2 \u00b5g/ mL of wt HBcAg VLP, VelcroVax or PBS and incubated overnight at 212 4\u00b0C. Plates were blocked with 2% skim -milk powder in PBS 0.1% Tween -20 and JUNV gp1 213 was added to wells at 1000, 500 and 250 ng/ mL, PBS was used as a negative control. Plates 214 were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour before being washed. The presence of JUNV gp1 was 215 determined using a 1:2000 dilution of mouse anti -JUNV gp1 ( incubation , plates were washed and 50 \u00b5L of anti -mouse HRP was added to wells 218 (Sigma) . Plates were incubated for a further hour at 37\u00b0C, before a final wash step and the 219 addition of 100 \u00b5L/well Sigmafast OPD (Sigma). After 15 minutes , 50 \u00b5L of 3M HCl was added 220 to wells to stop the reaction and the OD was determined at 492 nm. Data was graphed as mean with SEM (GraphPad Pri sm). 222 Immunisation 223 Groups of 7 female BALB/c mice were purchased from Charles River UK at 5 weeks of age. 224 Mice were housed for 2 weeks before the initiation of experimental procedures, at which point 225 a sample of pre -immune sera was collected (approximately 50 \u00b5L total blood volume) via the 226 tail vein. Mice were then immunised three times at two -week intervals subcutaneously in the 227 rear upper flank with a total volume of 100 \u00b5L per dose. Vaccines were composed of 1 \u00b5g of 228 VLP (HBcAg or Velcro Vax) and 1 \u00b5g of JUNV gp1 in the presence of 2.5 nmol CpG ODN1668 229 (Invivogen). Samples were assembled 24 hours pre -immunisation to facilitate SUMO -linked 230 conjugation of JUNV gp1 to VLP and stored at 4\u00baC until used. All vaccine components were 231 tested for endotoxin content and immun isations contained less than 2.5 EU/dose (Pierce LAL 232 Chromogenic Endotoxin Quantitation kit, Thermo Scientific). Serum samples were collected 233 on days 13 and 27 (as above) ( Fig S5 ). On day 41 final blood samples were taken via cardiac 234 puncture while mice we re euthanised under sodium pentobarbitone. All animals were housed 235 under specific pathogen -free conditions and monitored for wellbeing. All animal procedures 236 were performed in strict accordance with UK Home Office guidelines, under licence 237 PP2876504 grante d by the Secretary of State for the Home Office which approved the work 238 described, in accordance with local ethical guidelines and internal committee approval for 239 animal welfare at NIBSC. This study conforms to all relevant ethical regulations for animal 240 work in the UK. 241 Antibody titr ation and isotyp ing 242 Antibody titres were assessed by indirect ELISA. To this end, 96 -well EIA plates were coated 243 with 50 \u00b5L 2 \u00b5g/ mL target protein. Serum samples were assessed against HBcAg, VelcroVax 244 .

Plates blocked with 2% skim -milk powder in PBS 0.1% Tween -20 before 245 the addition of duplicate dilutions of antisera at 1:250 -4000 or a PBS -only negative control and 246 incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour. Plates were washed and 50 \u00b5L of rabbit anti -mouse HRP was 247 added at 1:2000 dilution (Sigma). Plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour, washed and 248 incubated with 100 \u00b5L Sigmafast OPD (Sigma) for 15 minutes . Reactions were st opped with 249 the addition of 50 \u00b5L 3M HCl and optical density read at 492 nm. Data was graphed as a box 250 and whisker plot and the mean OD from PBS -negative wells depicted as a dotted line along 251 the graph for reference (GraphPad Pri sm). 252 To determine the isoty pes of antibodies generated by immunisation , plates were coated and 253 blocked, as above. Sera were diluted 1:125 and 50 \u00b5L of sera or a PBS -only negative control 254 were added to duplicate wells, before incubation at 37\u00baC for 1 hour. Plates were washed and 255 50 \u00b5L of isotype -specific goat anti -mouse antibody was added at 1:1000 dilution (Sigma). 256 Plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour before being washed and adding 50 \u00b5L of anti -goat 257 HRP (Sigma). After a final 1 -hour incubation, plates were washed and developed w ith OPD, 258 as above. The OD 492 nm of negative control wells (no sera) was deducted from the isotype - 259 specific signal and mean OD graphed on a bar chart (GraphPad Pri sm). 260 Generating pseudovirus 261 Previously described protocols were used to generate JUNV pseudovirus with minimal 262 modification46. Briefly, HEK293T/17 cells were seeded at 30% density and incubated overnight 263 to allow growth to 50 -60% confluence at time of transfection. The following day D NA 264 transfections were carried out by combining 1 \u00b5g p8.91 plasmi d, with 1.5 \u00b5g Pcsflw47 and \u00b5L of Opti -MEM (Gibco) in a standard microcentrifuge 266 tube, separately 12 \u00b5L of 1 mg/ mL 25,000 mw linear PEI was diluted in 100 \u00b5L of Opti-MEM 267 (Gibco). Tubes were incubated at RT for 5 minutes before PEI mix was added to DNA. The 268 combined mixture was incubated at RT for 15 minutes before being added dropwise to culture 269 media. Plates were incubated for 72 hours at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO 2, at which point media was 270 harvested and filtered through a 0.45 \u00b5m PES filter. 271 Pseudovirus titration 272 Harvested cell supernatant containing JUNV pseudovirus was titrated as previously described 273 with minimal modification using RD cells46. Briefly, in a 96-well white plate (Greiner Bio -One) 274 50 \u00b5L of pseudovirus -containing supernatant was added per well following a 2 -fold serial 275 dilution. Dilutions were added to wells containing 1x104 RD cells/well and incubated for 72 276 hours at 37\u00b0C , 5% CO 2. The relative luminesce nce units (RLU) were measured using the 277 Bright -Glo (Promega) luciferase system. 278 .

Within each dimer t he C -terminal end of 290 one monomer is in proximity to the N -terminal end of the other partner (Fig 1A). The genetic 291 fusion of these monomers using a sequence e ncoding a Gly -Ser linker ensures that the 292 genetically fused pairs will dimerise within the assembled VLP, termed tandem HBcAg 293 (tHBcAg) . We inserted a sequence encoding a SUMO -Affimer into the major immunodominant 294 region (MIR) of the first HBcAg monomer within the tandem construct (Fig 1B). This 295 organisation ensures that within each HBcAg dimer, one MIR will contain a SUMO -Affimer 296 and the other will not , functionally minimising the likelihood of steric clashes within this regio n. 297 This construct, with the SUMO -Affimer within the MIR of the first HBcAg monomer within a 298 fused dimer , is the first example of the VelcroVax system . 299 To determine whether the introduction of a SUMO -Affimer sequence within the MIR of a 300 tandem HBcAg construct was compatible with particle formation , we utilised P. pastoris as an 301 expression system. Samples of wt HBcAg or VelcroVax were produced in P. pastoris and 302 separated along a 15 -45% sucrose gradient (Fig 1 C). Western blot analysis using anti -HBcAg 303 antibody 10E11 indicated that both wt HBcAg and VelcroVax particles were present within the 304 gradient . For b oth particle types , signal peak ed around fraction 8 , indicating that both wt 305 HBcAg and VelcroVax effectively form VLPs in this system . Particle morphology was 306 confirmed by negative stain EM (Fig S1). 307 Structural characterisation of VelcroVax 308 To characterise VelcroVax and assess the impact of SUMO -Affimer insertion , we 309 generated high -resolution structures of VelcroVax VLPs . Notably, as a result of the tandem 310 arrangement of VelcroVax, the T = 3* configuration does not conform to icosahedral 311 .

Each VelcroVax subunit comprises two connected HBcAg monomers, only o ne of 312 which is modified with an Affimer, generating an imbalance between what would be true 313 icosahedral asymmetric units (Fig S3A). As such, this configuration was termed T = 3* rather 314 than T = 3, and five -fold (C5) symmetry was imposed during image proces sing rather than 315 icosahedral symmetry (I1), which was imposed for the T = 4 VLP. Freshly purified VLPs were 316 used for cryoEM data collection, and structures were determined for both T = 4 (at 2.9 \u00c5 317 resolution) and T = 3* (at 3.6 \u00c5 resolution) configurations (Fig 2, Fig S2) . 318 In general, VelcroVax showed a high level of structural similarity to unmodified HBcAg. For 319 comparison, the atomic model for T = 4 VelcroVax was aligned with the best -matched subunit 320 from a 2.8 \u00c5 resolution cryoEM structure of a T = 4 HBcAg VLP (PDB: 7 OD449). An RMSD 321 value calculated between equivalent C atoms was only ~1.5 \u00c5, and visual inspection 322 revealed a high degree of overlap (Fig 2A). Most of the variation appeared to localise to the 323 four-helix bundles, as might be expected given the proximity of this region to the inserted 324 Affimer in VelcroVax . 325 Although the majority of the VLP was well resolved, d ensity for the SUMO -Affimer was not 326 evident in reconstructions of either T = 4 or T = 3* VelcroVax VLPs . However, at low contour 327 levels , weak, diffuse density was visible above four -helix bundles . For both T = 4 and T = 3* 328 VLPs, maps low -pass filtered to 10 \u00c5 revealed additional density above the four-helix bundles 329 consistent with the expected size of the Affimer (Fig 3), confirming that Affimers were likely 330 present, but were not resolved to high resolution. 331 In an attempt to resolve Affimer density , data for the T = 4 configuration of VelcroVax was 332 subjected to symmetry expansion and focussed 3D classification, using a mask to isolate the 333 region above the four -helix bundle. However, while there was considerable variation between 334 classes, none of the classes contained well-resolved Affimer density (Fig S4), confirming the 335 high level of variability in Affimer positioning. Because of its unique symmetrical properties 336 and therefore much more limited chance of success, focussed classification was not attempted 337 for T = 3* da ta. 338 Generation and capture of JUNV gp1 339 To determine whether VelcroVax retained a functional Affimer and thus was a suitable 340 candidate for future immunisation work , we investigated the ability of VelcroVax particles to 341 capture a SUMO -tagged antigen. Given its importance as a target for neutralising antibody 342 response s50-54, we elected to use the gp1 subcomponent of the arenavirus gp1 spike from 343 JUNV as a candidate immunogen. We firstly produced and purified C-terminally SUMO - 344 tagged JUNV gp1 from HEK293T cells . The glycoprotein was purified with successive rounds 345 .

The binding of SUMO -tagged JUNV 347 gp1 to VelcroVax was assessed by indirect ELISA . After coating EIA plates with PBS, wt 348 HBcAg VLPs or VelcroVax overnight, wells were blocked, and glyc oprotein was added. A 349 JUNV gp1 specific antibody was used to detect the glycoprotein within each well. No JUNV 350 gp1 was detected in the wells coated with PBS, or wt HBcAg. However, wells coated with 351 VelcroVax bound JUNV gp1 in a concentration -dependent man ner (Fig 4C). 352 Comparative immunisation 353 To compare the immunological consequences of immunisation with free glycoprotein with that 354 presented on VLPs , immunisation trials were carried out in BALB /c mice. To this end, two 355 groups of 7 mice were immunised three times at two -week intervals with JUNV gp1 mixed with VelcroVax . Immunisations were administered subcutaneously in 357 the presence of 2.5 nmol CpG ODN1668 and serum sampl es were collected between boosts, 358 and two weeks after the final dose was administered (Fig S5). 359 Serum samples collected at completion of the immunisation series were assessed for the 360 presence of IgG antibodies directed against HBcAg, one unmodified HBcAg monomer subun the antibodies generated wt HBcAg recognise d VelcroVax particles 364 poorly immunised with wt HBcAg and JUNV gp1 did not generate 365 anti -gp1 However , mice immunised with VelcroVax and JUNV gp1 generated 366 antibodies which efficiently recognise d JUNV and VelcroVax but not wt HBcAg (Fig 5a) . 367 To better understand the T helper (Th) bias of the immune responses generated we carried 368 out antigen -specific isotyping of immune sera. Plates were coated with antigen and blocked 369 as described above. Antisera were added to wells and incubated before the addition of 370 isotype -specific detection antib odies. Both HBc Ag and levels of both 371 IgG1 and IgG2a , suggest ing a balance between Th1 and Th2 type responses (Fig 5B). 372 Interestingly, despite the balanced response generated against HBcAg in the HBcAg 373 immunisation group, the unbound JUNV gp1-specif ic antibodies induced were almost 374 exclusively IgG1, indicating a strong Th2 bias directed against the glycoprotein . In contrast 375 the anti -JUNV gp1 antibodies generated by VelcroVax -JUNV gp1 immunisation were 376 balanced between IgG1 and IgG2a (Fig 5B), a potentially important characteristic for the 377 development of effective viral vaccines. 378 We further assessed whether there was an isotype -specific bias in the responses against the 379 peptide or glycan component s of JUNV gp1.

While deglycosylation 381 reduce d the overall reactivity of antisera with JUNV gp1, there was no significant shift in the 382 isotype preference (p = 0.3437) (Fig S6). No direct neutralisation of pseudovirus was detected 383 using sera from either immunisation group at 1:100 dilution (Fig a higher serum 384 concentration (1:10) limited neutralisation was detected in some serum samples, and t he 385 VelcroVax group showed higher direct neutralisation at 1:10 dilution compared to the wt 386 HBcAg immunisation group (P = 0.01) , although mean neutralisation was just 24.89%. 387 Additionally, neutralisation not total titre (Fig S7B & S7C) 388 or isotype (qualitative). 389 390 Discussion: 391 There is a global need for rapid development of vaccines that are adaptable to emerging 392 pathogens and deliverable at low cost for use in LMICs. One approach to achieve this goal 393 relies upon the development of a common carrier protein modified to present different haptens . 394 Thus, a single carrier may be utilised as the foundation for vaccines against a range of 395 pathogens , reducing vaccine development time and cost. To this end, w e synthesised a carrier 396 nanoparticle based upon the HBcAg protein , containing an adapter sequence to allow the 397 post-purification coupling of haptens to VLPs . This nanoparticle forms the basis of a modifiable 398 vaccine strategy . In addition to characterising the nanoparticle structurally, w e selected JUNV 399 gp1 as an exemplar hapten and determin ed the functional implications of hapten 400 on JUNV gp1 immunogenicity. 401 are formed from monomers assemble d into dimers, with 90 ( T = 3) or 120 ( T = 402 4) of these dimers assembling to form particles approximately 30 and 34 nm in diameter, 403 respectively55. These particles are arranged with e xternal facing N -termini, a long helical 404 region followed by a flexible surface exposed loop (MIR), and another helical region leading 405 to an internal facing C -terminal end (Fig 1A) . The genetic fusion of two monomers results in a 406 tandem HBcAg construct56, and the introduction of an anti -SUMO Affimer27 into the first MIR 407 of thi s tandem construct forms the basis of our VLP capture system, VelcroVax (Fig 1B). 408 Expression of HBcAg or VelcroVax in P. pastoris results in the efficient formation of VLPs , 409 each having diameters consistent with the formation of both T = 3 and T = 4 symmetric 410 particles (Fig 1C, Fig S1) . 411 There are several published structures of wt and mutant HBcAg particles ; however, no high- 412 resolution structures exist of t andem HBcAg VLPs. Using VelcroVax particles produced in 413 P. pastoris , we generated high -resolution structures of T = 3* and T = 4 symmetric particles , 414 with the proportion s of both particle configurations found to be approximately equal . The T = 415 .

Both the T = 3* and T = 4 418 reconstructions had clearly resolved density for residues corresponding to the helices of both 419 HBcAg molecules within the tandem VelcroVax sequence . Unsurprisingly, given the presence 420 of flexible linking sequences, the SUMO -Affimer, the second MIR, and the internal Gly-Ser- 421 linker lack ed defined density. The fact that each fused dimer could occupy one of two 422 orientations, leading to four unique arrangements per asymmetric unit for the T = 4 particle, 423 also likely contribut ed to the poorly defined density of these regions (Fig S3 B). Focussed 424 classification y ielded no improvement in Affimer density, and particles were distributed 425 relatively evenly between focussed classes, suggesting a high level of variability and flexibility 426 in this region , as expected (Fig S4). When a low -pass filter was applied to both T = 3* and T 427 = 4 reconstructions, amorphous density was present above the four-helix bundles of the 428 capsid, consistent with the presence of the Affimer (Fig 3). Given the difficulty in resolving 429 flexible/mobile regions of the VLP at high resolution , we were unable to determine structurally 430 whether Affimers displayed on the surface of particles retained a native fold. 431 Therefore, t o determine whether Affimers expressed in the context of VLPs retained 432 functionality we mixed SUMO -tagged JUNV gp1 with Velcr oVax and assessed binding by 433 ELISA (Fig 4). After confirming binding between VelcroVax VLPs and JUNV gp1 , we carried 434 out immunisation trial using the complexed particles . The gp1 of JUNV forms a 435 subcomponent of the trimeric gp spike displayed on the enve lope surface and facilitates 436 recognition of transferrin receptor 1 during host -cell entry57,58, suggesting it may be suitable 437 for the generation of directly neutralising antibodies . Importantly, rabbits immunised with 3 438 doses of JUNV gp1 and adjuvant ( 80 \u00b5g/dose, GERBU 90% 439 neutralisation 1:20 serum dilution59. Another study suggest ed JUNV gp1 can elicit directly 440 neutralising antibodies in mice , though this required three doses of 50 \u00b5g JUNV gp1 in the 441 presence of complete Freund's adjuvant54, which is approximately 50x the glycoprotein 442 amount used here . Together these data suggest that antibodies directed against JUNV gp1 443 can be induced , though this does not appear to be particularly efficient and may require 444 prese ntation as a part of the higher order gp . A commonality among JUNV neutralising 445 antibodies is the presence of receptor -mimicking tyrosine residues (Ng et al, 2020). 446 Interestingly , these tyrosine residues primarily arise in the C DRH3 region of neutralising 447 antibodies, and these regions have the potential for greater diversity in species which utilise 448 somatic gene conversion during antibody maturation60. Somatic gene conversion has been 449 well documented in birds, sheep and rabbits ; however , in huma ns and mice this mechanism 450 has not been extensively reported61 and its relative role is unclear.

Their 454 size (30 -100 nm) facilitates improved recognition, uptake and enhanced antigen 455 presentation16,23,24, and their repetitive structure enhances the crosslinking of receptors on B 456 cells, which functionally improves signalling and is coupled with a shift in the cytokine milieu 457 leading to a more balanced Th1/Th2 type response26. While the antibodies generated from 458 immunisation only neutralise d pseudovirus at low levels (Fig S7), the coupling of JUNV gp1 to 459 VelcroVax both increased anti-JUNV gp1 antibody titres and generated a balanced Th1/Th2 460 response, as indicated by antibody isotypes (Fig 5). The stimulation of IgG2 antibodies has 461 been associated with viral clearance in vaccination for influenza and thus the stimulation of 462 Th1-type antibody may be desir able in vaccines seeking to limit disease severity62. As is the 463 case with most peptide immunogens, t his balance was not observed for the uncoupled JUNV 464 gp1 immunisation group where anti -gp1 antibodies were predominantly IgG1 (Th2) (Fig 5b). 465 Similar to previous studies using JUNV gp1 as an immunogen , vaccination with JUNV gp1 466 coupled to VelcroVax failed to induce high -titre directly neutralising antibodies . Importantly, 467 the broad response generated by the VelcroVax -JUNV gp1 complex indicates a more effe ctive 468 presentation of the target antigen when compared to unbound antigen. This broad response 469 is generally desirable and , similar to responses directed ag ainst other viruses, may contribute 470 to immunological protection in the absence of efficient direct neutralisation62,63. We therefore 471 propose that the VelcroVax platform offers an adaptable system for future VLP vaccine 472 applications. 473 474 475 476 477 478 479 480 481 482 483 .

(A) Schematic illustr ating how 839 the tandem nature of VelcroVax does not conform to icosahedral symmetry in the T = 3* 840 arrangement. Each VelcroVax monomer is formed from a tandem HBc subunit (green) linked 841 by a flexible linker (beige) and a single Affimer (orange). This does not fit within the strict 842 asymmetric unit (pink) of a true T = 3 VLP. (B) VelcroVax subunits can be incorporated into 843 the asymmetric unit (here, T = 4) in either direction, leading to variation in the position of the 844 Affimers.
