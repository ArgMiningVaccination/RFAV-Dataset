Am I required to be vaccinated in order to keep providing care to my recipient? Yes, all workers in in-home direct care settings, including IHSS and WPCS providers, are required to be vaccinated, to reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19 to vulnerable populations, unless you meet one of the exceptions criteria listed below. II. What are allowable exceptions to the vaccination requirements for IHSS and WPCS providers? The exceptions apply to the following workers: 1. Any IHSS or WPCS provider who is a family member to their recipient, OR 2. Any IHSS or WPCS provider who provides services to a recipient with whom they live, and only provides WPCS or IHSS services to that one household. If the provider works in multiple households, then this exception does not apply. Providers may also fill out a [COVID-19 Vaccination Exemption Form](https://www.cdss.ca.gov/Portals/9/IHSS/Emergency/COVID19-Vaccine-Exemption-Form-IHSS-WPCS-Providers.pdf) for either religious or medical exemptions, of which copies should have been mailed to you or your recipient along with notification of the vaccination requirement. In these cases providers should: 1. Complete a COVID-19 Vaccination Exemption Form, signed by the provider, which attests to a religious exemption, OR 2. Complete a COVID-19 Vaccination Exemption Form, signed by the provider, which attests to a qualifying medical reason. In order to be eligible for a medical exemption, the provider must also submit to the recipient, a written statement by a physician, nurse practitioner, or other licensed medical professional under the license of a physician that indicates the provider's inability to receive a vaccine, and the duration for which that inability is probable (or whether duration is unknown, or permanent). The statement does not have to name the specific medical condition, as that is private medical information. III. What is required if I have an exemption and don't get vaccinated? Unvaccinated workers who have an allowable exemption must abide by the following: 1. The unvaccinated provider must be tested weekly for COVID-19. Providers who need to obtain a COVID-19 test may search for a testing site by going to the link below and entering their address to find a local testing site: [https://www.arcgis.com/apps/Nearby/index.html?appid=43118dc0d5d348d8ab20a81967a15401](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/Nearby/index.html?appid=43118dc0d5d348d8ab20a81967a15401) 2. The unvaccinated provider must wear a surgical mask, or higher level respirator at all times while in the home. Providers can reach out to their local Public Authority for access to protective equipment. Providers are responsible for maintaining records of their weekly testing results, and must provide them if requested by the recipient. IV. When should I be vaccinated by if I do not qualify for an exemption? All IHSS or WPCS providers should have the first dose of either a one-dose or two-dose regimen of any COVID-19 vaccination by November 30, 2021. V. Where do I find information about qualifying vaccinations and which are available? All COVID-19 vaccines that are currently authorized for emergency use, along with educational resources, can be found at the following links: World Health Organization's COVID-19 Vaccines: [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/covid-19-vaccines](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/covid-19-vaccines) U.S. Food and Drug Administration COVID-19 Vaccines: [https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid- 19/covid-19-vaccines](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid- 19/covid-19-vaccines) VI. I've already been vaccinated, how do I report my vaccination status? The recipient, as the employer, may request documentation demonstrating that a provider has been vaccinated, at which time you must show proof of vaccination either with your paper vaccination card issued at the time of vaccination, or your digital vaccination card which can be accessed "}
