Did what it supposed to do !! Great flavor. William K W. Like the product. Not real fond of the Steviol glycoside taste. Nick s. Been taking the hydration first thing in the morning, then the energy about an hr later !! Crushing the day Mar C. I decided to try something new for sustainable energy instead of 2 to 3 monsters a day and I couldn't be happier that I made the switch to your energy enhancer. Living in Wyoming, we are pretty active all year long and some days , you just need that little extra boost. From working fulltime, running kids to jujitsu, 4H and scouting, it keeps you going. I love the fact these aren't powder packets and that I can easily mix these with anything. I don't get jitters or a crash and I feel like I've gained more mental clarity with the switch. Back to flinging arrows and prepping for the season, thanks Protekt! Jim T. First thing in the morning! Clean good energy! Great product! Faye T. Experienced great energy for a 78 year old woman Jonathan D. This stuff is so good it has me hitting 98 yards with a 9mm! CINDY H.

I felt better with more energy and loved the taste. Lori S. good flavor and do like the boost. Matthew B. My daughter and I are both using this product and love it. BETH W. I love Protekt's Energy. It isn't like some that give you a jolt of energy and you're done, it leaves a calm energized feeling that lasts for hours but has never interfered with my sleep and that is usually an issue for me. There is nothing harmful in their product so it's safe, clean, energy plus. I'm under a naturopath's care and they love it as well as their other products. It's hard to find something so safe and such high quality, Being liquid means it's more readily absorbed in your system, so fast absorption means fast results. :) I highly recommend the energy. Glen M. Product tastes great. Is significantly less expensive than big brand energy drinks. I can tell it works better than energy drinks. It has a longer lasting assist. And more importantly, it is very diabetic friendly. John I. It's replaced multiple daily energy drinks, combined with a focus pill and I've never felt better and more productive in my work day. Trevor B. I love this stuff. Prolonged energy all day with no crash. Take it every day, as well as the Brain function supplement. Chris L. Excellent energy booster William K W. The drink definitely gives you energy during a workout. I'm not a fan of Stevia so it leaves an after taste I'm not fond of but that is only a personal preference and not a knock on the product. I heard about it on Jack Carr's Podcast with Nick and I thought I would give it a try. Joseph M. Found out about protekt through a vendor at TAC. He hooked me up with some free samples. Since running out I had to order more. The energy is just the right amount to get me through the day. It's the first energy product I've had that I don't get the jitters or crash but still get energized. It's slightly more expensive than I would like but to me it's worth the price point. Overall great product! Amhara S. Tastes great so easy to use. The packs are durable enough to throw in my pack and ruck around. Definitely a future customer here. Thank you. Jennifer G. Feel like I get more sustained energy throughout the day, less \"lows and highs.\" Flavor is great, easy to mix in my water for a workout or anytime in my morning. Ordering more. Jonathan D.

Love the flavor, love that it's liquid and no powder to disolve! Matt L. These products together are like a 1-2 punch. The energy blend gives me great focus and doesn't make me feel jittery. Mike S. Great flavor compared to the competitions IF THERE IS ONE nancy m. Love the energy formula. It helps fuel my workouts on days that I'm feeling tired. Kyle O. These are great. I am currently working as a travel RN and I keep these in my bag with me at all times. I'll have them before working out/exercising, during a night shift, or anytime I'm traveling far distances. They are convenient being in single serve package and they deliver enough caffeine to keep me going when I need it. I will continue to keep these in my toolkit of supplements.

Felt no tiredness afterward and felt energized for several hours. I have tried others with crash always following. Jeff B. Used this product during a week of snow skiing in Colorado. Did not cause any stomach issues and provided the energy I needed to navigate the slopes for 6 days, average of 5 hours each day. Customer Expensive. But worth every penny. I stick with coffee in the morning but combine the Energy, Hydration with Lypo-Spheric Vitamin C in a shot of water before or after lunch. It helps me concentrate which is important in a fast paced analytics data scientist job. Jessica C. Tastes great and comes conveniently packaged. No bad aftertaste like other brands I have tried.

Tastes great and really long lasting energy. Rachel R. I recieved a free sample via mail. LOVED it. Ingredients are NONE of the yucky stuff (did you know that several artificial sweeteners are linked with dementia??: https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/could-artificial-sweeteners-be-bad-for-your-brain-2017060711849 so many things to look out for and these checked out clean). OMG love the black cherry flavor (I got lemon, orange, grape & black cherry samples + liked the last 2 flavors best) & seems vegan-safe!! :D I'm a PhD student and this kept me going during a Monday, so I think it passes the energy test XD Kriss K. Got a sample in the mail. The taste was great, not too bitter or too sweet. The smell put me off at first, because it had a plasticky scent. Didn't taste like that at all. Gave me a good boost of energy at midday so I could stay active and focused. Would recommend! Kenneth S. Love this product highly recommend Michelle l. I got these for my son.

Energy is a part of my life now. Protect is the best and the whole wide world should now that get it and love it. Mandy S. Greetings! I received my Sample Packets today from PROTEKT. I was excited to try the 'ENERGY' first. SO easy to use...simply add the liquid from the packet to 16 ounces of water. The Black Cherry flavor is fresh and tasty. With all natural ingredients (and the list of ingredients is short!) just made me healthier as I drank it! I was able to keep up all afternoon with my rambunctious 8 year old granddaughter. I can't wait to try the other 3 packets. Protekt sent a total of 4 packets to try : Energy (Black Cherry) Immunity (Orange) Hydration (Lemonade) Rest (Mixed Berry) I have recommended Protekt already to my daughter! I also would recommend this product to ANY ONE who likes to stay active (I am a 60 year old, active Mom and Grandma!) Thank you for the samples! SO nice to 'try before I buy' Jessica G. Love this product and the clean energy it gave me, it was great tasting as well. I felt energized but not jittery. Melissa Used the energy sample packet after receiving in mail after a workout & needed to do some house cleaning, gave me the pick me up and re-energizing I definitely needed the rest of the day! Awesome product Christine S. We received a sample of the Protekt Energy Liquid supplement. It really have me energy! It tasted great and lasted the entire bottle. My workout was better than it's ever been! Irish P. Beyond expectations. I've tried multiple brands but this one actually tastes good. And no after taste. Tastes like real coconut water. I loved it and helped me to get thru the day. Jacqueline N. Great flavor! Made me feel energized. Not dull at all. Trevor \\. I really liked the Energy supplement. Didn't feel jittery or have a big crash so that was nice. It just felt like one of those days when you're feeling good and are ambitious and ready to get a lot done. I only tried the black cherry flavor and I wasn't a big fan of the taste. It wasn't horrible, just not great. I'm sure that's just a preference though. Otherwise I would have given 5 stars. Will definitely try more flavors! Tamara O. This product has a great taste. Most of the time, you can taste the artificial flavors, in other energy drinks. Pleasant taste. I felt a energy \"boost\" that didn't make me crash. I would recommend this product to my family and friends. Gabriel A. Great tasting product, will be back for more Gabriel A. Great tasting product that actually does what it is advertised to do! Pleased with the results, will be back for more Frankie W. If it had CBD in it , it'd be best ever! Jennifer G. I recently sampled the liquid supplement drink enhancer by PROTEKT in ENERGY and was quite impressed! The flavor was AMAZING without that unsightly aftertaste...always a plus! Obviously, extremely easy to use but perfect to take on the go anywhere. Most importantly, to me anyway, is that it does what it advertises....and it certainly did as I began to feel more energetic as time passed! PROTEKT has me sold...& they DEFINITELY have a new customer! @protekt John M. Ive been using this energy supplement before all my outdoor climbing projects and the results are amazing! I love the Pina Colada flavor! Kevin L. This is the one energy \"drink\"/supplement that I've had that doesn't make me feel like I'm gonna have a panic attack. It genuinely just makes me feel energized for the day Kim D. Got a sample of this in orange and when I first opened it, the smell brought me back to my 80's childhood and I immediately thought Tang! Thankfully this tasted nothing like 80's Tang and gave me the afternoon boost I needed to get through the day. I really enjoyed it and will be purchasing soon. "}
