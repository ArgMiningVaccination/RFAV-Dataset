While some bacteria in the mouth is inevitable and [even beneficial](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/beat-bad-breath-keep-mouth-bacteria-happy/), problems including tooth decay and gum disease can arise when this excess bacteria is left unchecked. More specifically, when particularly destructive or odor-emitting species are not controlled, they out-compete their more symbiotic neighbors. Because the goal isn't to completely sterilize your mouth but rather to reign in the bad bacteria, traditional [chemical-laden toothpaste and mouthwash](http://www.consumerreports.org/beauty-personal-care/why-is-triclosan-in-toothpaste/) may not always be the right solution. Following are five natural (and non-toxic) ways to manage your oral ecology, beat bad breath, and enjoy a fresh mouth. 5 Natural Remedies for a Fresh Mouth Oral Probiotics The necessity of healthy gut bacteria is widely accepted amongst both scientists and the general public. The idea is to limit so-called \"bad\" bacteria while strengthening \"good\" gut bacteria colonies through probiotic foods. The same basic principles apply to oral hygiene. By helping \"good\" bacteria in your mouth out-compete their less desirable foes, you reap the benefits of better breath and healthier teeth. Green Tea Green tea is widely lauded for its many health-promoting qualities, including its antioxidative and mineralization-boosting qualities. In fact, [research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4138486/) shows that a naturally occurring [flavonoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavonoid) called [catechin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catechin) in green tea has antimicrobial properties that can help control the microbes in your mouth. Oil Pulling Oil pulling is a traditional form of folk medicine practiced by many cultures around the world to cure everything from headaches to tooth decay. While modern [science is still on the fence](http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/oil-pulling-ancient-practice-now-a-modern-trend-1.2664794) about the effectiveness of this ancient practice, there is evidence to suggest that it could be [useful for managing oral hygiene](http://www.bbc.com/news/health-19435442). Swish some coconut oil in your mouth for 10 minutes a day to take the fight to destructive Streptococcus mutants without the need for harsher chemicals. Or, try [neem oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neem_oil) for it's antiseptic, antifungal, and antipyretic properties. Tongue Scraping Much of the bad odors associated with [halitosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halitosis), or chronic bad breath, can be [found on the tongue](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-bug-responsible-bad-breath-found-idUSTON77980320080407), particularly near the back. Hence, the technique of [tongue scraping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue_cleaner) was born. By physically removing a portion of the bacterium and fungi, and the scraps of food debris that fuel them, regular tongue cleaning can eliminate bad breath without resorting to any chemicals at all. Tea Tree Oil Tea tree oil purported to treat everything from acne to obesity has experienced an explosion in popularity in the recent decade. [Recent studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3800405/) indicate that tea tree oil can also be used to effectively treat chronic periodontitis which is triggered by the loss of balance between periodontopathic bacteria and your body's immune response. Tea tree oil has a broad-spectrum antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effect that can potentially alleviate chronic periodontitis. Dental / [Cosmetic Dentistry](https://artlabdentistrywoodlandhills.com/cosmetic-dentistry-5-questions-you-must-ask-your-prosthodontist/) As with any dental treatment, there is no silver bullet. There is no magical cure-all for every ailment. However, when these natural remedies are used in combination with each other, and with dentist-recommended routines, healthy teeth and gums are within reach.
