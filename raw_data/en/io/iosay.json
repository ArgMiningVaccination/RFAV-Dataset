We have also shared a number of resources from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), including their website for parents, [healthychildren.org ](https://healthychildren.org/english/pages/default.aspx) [[Espa\u00f1ol ].](https://healthychildren.org/spanish/paginas/default.aspx) Questions about sending your child to school or child care safely? - AAP [COVID-19 Resource Page](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/health-issues/conditions/COVID-19/Pages/default.aspx): learn more from pediatricians about COVID-19 and how you can protect your family - CDC [COVID-19 Parental Resources Kit](https://www.cdc.gov/mentalhealth/stress-coping/parental-resources/childhood/index.html) - CDC [Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children Associated with COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/mis/mis-c.html) [VDH COVID-19 FAQs](https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/covid-19-faq) - Guidance for Sports Participation For School and Child Care Program Facilities [VDH provides K-12 schools and child care facilities across the Commonwealth with free at-home diagnostic test kits to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. ] During the 2022-2023 school year, VDH provided COVID-19 testing support to 76% of public school divisions (101) across the Commonwealth, as well as 74 private schools and 2 independent schools. K-12 Schools Schools may send the test kits home with families to conduct testing at home or conduct testing on-site if they have the resources to do so. To request test kits for your school, email [testinginfo@vdh.virginia.gov](mailto:testinginfo@vdh.virginia.gov). Schools will receive [Quidel Quickvue At-Home OTC COVID-19 test kits](https://quickvueathome.com/#about_the_test) and should review the [Emergency Use Agreement](https://www.fda.gov/media/147247/download) and [Instructions for Use](https://imgcdn.mckesson.com/CumulusWeb/Click_and_learn/QuickVue_OTC_COVID-19_Test_Healthcare_Provider_IFU.pdf) prior to receiving their test kits. Childcare Facilities Child care facilities may send home tests for students (aged 2+), staff, and parents to have on hand if they need to consider testing. To request test kits for your child care facility, please reach out to your [local health district](https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/health-department-locator/). Child care facilities will receive [Orasure InteliSwab](https://inteliswab.com/) [ COVID-19 at-home rapid antigen test kits](http://%20covid-19%20at-home%20rapid%20antigen%20test%20kits/) and should review the [Emergency Use Agreement](https://www.fda.gov/media/149908/download) and [Instructions for Use](https://inteliswab.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/InteliSwab-COVID-19-Rapid-Test-IFU-rev-02-23.pdf) prior to receiving their test kits. - For more information on expiration dates please refer to the [InteliSwab COVID-19 Rapid Test 9-month to 12-month shelf life extension](https://www.fda.gov/media/161057/download)document. Increasing ventilation in indoor spaces is one way to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in schools. The following resources offer information on how to reduce potential airborne risk of COVID-19. If a building has been closed or unused for a period of time, there is an increased risk of exposure to hazards including Legionella bacteria and lead. Follow the EPA's guidance for [Water Quality in Closed/Reduced-use Buildings](https://www.epa.gov/coronavirus/information-maintaining-or-restoring-water-quality-buildings-low-or-no-use) to reopen school buildings. For School and Child Care Administrators - A VDH and DOE [tabletop training exercise](https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/emergency-preparedness/training-education/)is a scenario-based training for K-12 schools - American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) [Guidance for Safe Schools](https://services.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/clinical-guidance/covid-19-planning-considerations-return-to-in-person-education-in-schools/) For School and Child Care Nurses Schools and child care programs should notify parents and families of a case of COVID-19 in a member of the school or child care community. Contact tracing should be continued in partnership with local health departments when there are outbreaks or when sustained transmission is thought to be occurring within the school or child care program (see School and Child Care Administrators section for template letters). Schools and child care programs should continue to communicate isolation recommendations to the school or child care community. Reporting Requirements Schools and child care programs are subject to Board of Health disease reporting regulations. Any person in charge of a school, summer camp, or child care center is required to report suspected outbreaks of any illness that might be spread from one person to another. Schools should refer to the Virginia Administrative Code [12VAC5-90-90](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/admincode/title12/agency5/chapter90/section90/) or the [VDH outbreak reporting website.](https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/clinicians/disease-reporting-and-control-regulations/#outbreak) If a known or suspected outbreak of COVID-19 occurs among students or staff, the school, child care program, or summer camp should call their [local health department](https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/health-department-locator/) to discuss the situation. A COVID-19 outbreak is defined as 3 more cases within a 14 day period. However, schools may consider a lower threshold for reporting (e.g., 2 cases regardless of level of disease in the community). Early reporting to help public health authorities helps ensure early detection of outbreaks and timely intervention to help prevent the virus' spread. The local health department will work with the facility to provide disease control and prevention recommendations to slow or stop the spread of COVID-19. Schools, child care programs, and summer camps may also use the [VDH outbreak reporting tool](https://redcap.vdh.virginia.gov/redcap/surveys/?s=M3YRJPNRHP) to report suspected outbreaks of COVID-19 or other communicable diseases. CDC recommends that healthcare personnel in schools and child care settings, including school nurses, follow the [Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Healthcare Personnel ](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/infection-control-recommendations.html).
