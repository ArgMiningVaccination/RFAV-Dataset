The nex t block starts on Tuesday instead of the normal Monday. Please note thi s when making any plans. Schedule Changes: Changes are not permitted without the approval of the course co ordinator. If you need to be absent during a bl ock for any reason you must fi ll out the standard absence form in advance and have it signed by the Associate Dean for Student and Academic Affairs. If you have an emergency or become ill, you need to notify the appropria te people of your absence as soon as possible. You are respo nsible for contacting Jolene Bun ce, to schedule make up days of rotations if needed. 6 7 CCVM Student Policies Absence Policy- Year 4 This policy is also listed on the CCVM website. http://vetmed.oregons tate.edu/students/ current/absences Students in both elective and re quired clinical rotations are a llowed to have no more than 0.5 days of excused absence per 1-we ek block, with a maximum of 5 e xcused days of absence during the senior year. The follo wing are considered EXCUSED ab sences: 1. Job interviews 2. National or State licensing boards 3. A medical or family emergency 4. Scheduled medical appointments 5. Military or legal obligation su ch as subpoena or jury duty Other personal circumstances nec essitating absence from the blo ck will be considered UNEXCUSED, unless the course lea der and duty clin ician to which the student is assigned deem it appropriate to classify as an E XCUSED absence. Except for em ergencies, students must complete a Request to be Absent Form (available in the dean's o ffice) for ALL anticipated absences. The form should be completed and returned to the Asso ciate Dean for Student and Academic Affairs. Except in emergencies, if not submitted at le ast 1 week prior to the absence, the absence will automatically be considered UNEXCUSED. When a student has gr eater than 0.5 days of excused absence/1 w eek of block time or ANY unexcused absence the student will be expected to make up that time along with any after-hours emergency time associated with the block. If, in the opinion of the course leader, absences were such that the student's learnin g opportunities were sufficientl y reduced by the absences, the student may be required to repeat the entire block. Until absen teeism is made up the student shall receive a grade of INCOMPLETE. Grading Students will receive a letter grade for each required block, b ased on criteria established by the instructor(s). Unsatisfactory performance, a grade of a \"D\" or \"F\", will require repeating the block satisfactorily before graduation. Repeat tardiness or une xcused absence without the instructor's permission may also result in a student needing to retake part or all of a block at the instructor's discretion. Pet policy Dogs, cats, and other pets, by University rules, are not allowe d in buildings unless they are part of the teaching program, or here as a patient. Animals here for teaching purposes and appointments must be properly housed within the Teaching Labora tory or Veterinary Teaching Hospital. Please leave your pets at home. Pets are not allowed to be kept in vehicles in the College's parking lots. 8 Pregnancy, Disabled and Seriously Ill Students The veterinary curriculum is bot h mentally and physically rigor ous. Veterinary students are potentially exposed to materials and procedures that may result in physical or psychological injury. Traumatic injuries are an inherent risk of your chosen profession whether it be by direct contact with animals or equipment necessary to diagnose and tre at disease or as a result of exposure to potentially hazardous chemicals or agents. Physical , academic and emotional stressors are also present that may lead to psychological distr ess. Injury may be increased when a student is pregnant, trying to become pregnant, disabled and/ or seriously ill. The CCVM realizes that individuals, who are pregnant, may becom e pregnant, are disabled or seriously ill have the right and responsibility to make decisio ns for themselves concerning their condition. The CCVM may not discrim inate against these individu als based on their condition and the student should expect a ppropriate consideration from fe llow students, staff and faculty. The CCVM will provide reasonable accommodations to all students regardless of disabilities to the extent possible in classes and clinical rotations consisten t with Oregon State University policies, state and federal law unless their presence constitut es a risk to the health and well-being of fellow classmates, staff, house officers or faculty. This ri sk will be determined by the Associate Dean of Students and Department of Clinical Sciences Chair. The following recommendations are for students who are pregnant, attempting t o become pregnant, disabled (temporarily or permanently) or seriously ill: 1. The student should notify his/her healthcare provider of their condition and of the curricular requirements to develop a plan that is appropriate f or the student's condition. The healthcare provider may cont act the Associate Dean or Depar tment Chair to assist in this assessment. 2. The student should provide the As sociate Dean with a signed sta tement from the healthcare provider that defines the risks that the student is exposed to 3. The student should notify the Asso ciate Dean of his/her pregnan cy, disability or illness as early as possible so steps can be taken to decide the best cour se of action for the student. The student will work with their healthcare provider and the As sociate Dean of students then may elect one of the following: 1. Continuation as a student with no change in sche dule or activit ies and a written acknowledgement of the risks involved 2. Continue as a student with sched ule and/or activity changes and a written acknowledgement that program com pletion may be delayed and haza rds may still exist 3. Withdraw from the DVM program permanently or request readmissio n through the Student's Progress Committee If the student elects to complet e the program they understand t hey must complete all standard graduation requirements accordin g to the schedule developed wit h them by the Associate Dean of Students If a student believes that his or her disability requires an ac commodation to meet the standards set forth in this document, he or she should contact the Associ ate Dean for Student and Academic Affairs at the time he or she begins the program or, i f that is not feasible, at the 9 earliest possible date to ensure that the College and student h ave ample opportunity to discuss the accommodation request. Security The College's security policy requires all students and employe es to wear an ID badge while in the buildings. Visitors must ch eck in at the Dean's office rece ption desk and receive a visitor's pass. Employee and student badges are coded to open the locked external and internal doors in Magruder Hall. Several exterior do ors of Magruder Hall (with th e exception of the north and south entrances by the bike racks are open to the public from 7 :30am - 5pm. Unauthorized people, non-veterinary students and the general public are not allowed to be in the building outside of regular working hours. Even during regular working h ours several areas of the building are restricted from the public. Should you encounter a nyone with whom you are unfamiliar, politely ask them if you can be of any assistance a nd make sure they are not left unattended in the building. Please Contact Dr. de Morais, Dr. S emevolos, or Campus Security if there are any problems. There is a phone at the south entrance by the VDL main entrance for after-hours use. This bell rings in four places: the VTH reception area, the equine and bo vine stall areas, and outside the student/house officer sleeping rooms in the hallway. If you hea r this phone ring please respond as quickly as possible. Any security problems should be investigated and reported as so on as possible to Dr. De Morais (VTH) or Dr. Semevolos (student/general). Keys or codes issued to students must be protected from loss or theft in order to assure security for areas such as the pharmacy, operating rooms, and medical re cords rooms. If ke ys or codes are lost or stolen, this should be immediately reported to the supe rvising individual. Emergencies In case of emergency, please call: Ambulance 9-911 (dial '9' first when using a university phone) Campus Dispatch 7-7000 ( For any facilities-related emergencies) Campus Security 9-911 City Police 9-911 Fire Department 9-911 Dr. De Morais Semevolos (541) 737-7666 ( For student or academic-related emergencies) Policy on Drug and Alcohol Use Students shall not use non-physician prescribed controlled or p rescription drugs or chemical substances or be under the influence of alcohol or other drugs of abuse during any time when the student is, or may be, in a work or educational environment. Al so, students are advised to avoid drugs that interfere with menta l alertness and capacity when in a work or educational environment. Violation of this rule may result in dismissal fro m the program. 10 OSU CCVM Professional Code of Conduct for Students This Code of Con duct is a set of guidelines for professional be havior and conduct for students in the Carlson College of Veterinary Medicine. As members of the v eterinary profession, students should reflect the honor and di gnity of the profession, maintai n an environment conducive to learning for themselves and others, and provide service to the community. The Code of Conduct is intentiona lly general in order to provid e guidance for professional behavior without specifying ever y action that might be consider ed unprofessional. The guidelines are based on the Principles of Veterinary Medical Et hics published by the AVMA https://www.avma.org/kb/policies/p ages/principles-of-veterinary -medical-ethics-of-the-avma.aspx They are not intended to supersede or modify the Oregon State U niversity Student Conduct Regulations http://studentlife.oregonstate.edu/sites/studentlife.oregonstat e.edu/files/final_code_of_student_conduct_up dated_1_25_18.pdf A violation of the Code of Conduct will be considered grounds f or dismissal. The Student Progress Committee will review all violations and make recommen dations to the Dean. Students will treat each other, faculty and staff with respect, fairness, and courtesy. Students will consider the welfare of the patient first with de cisions regarding patient care transcending personal, profes sional, or academic gain. Students will earn the respect of their colleagues and the publ ic through courteous verbal exchange, considerate treatment, professional appearance, profe ssionally acceptable treatments and the utilization of current and valid scientific knowledge. Students will maintain an appropriate learning environment at a ll times and give instructors the respect of their attention. Students should respect the ri ghts of other students with regar d to access to learning and learning aids. Students should strive to contin ually improve their knowledge a nd skills as well as the knowledge and skills of those around them. Students will be honest in all matters with all people associat ed with the educational program and their colleagues. Students shall observe all laws and uphold the honor and dignit y of the veterinary profession. Examples of unprofessi onal conduct include, but are not limited to the following: Verbal or physical abuse of faculty, staff, patients, clients o r students, or knowingly publishing or circulating false information concerning any indi vidual in the College. Failure to maintain patient and client confidentiality by shari ng or releasing any case information including photographs and recorded images without s pecific approval from the client. 11 Use of non-physician-prescribed controlled or prescription drug s or chemical substances or being under the influence of these or alcohol whi le in a work or educational environment. Knowingly producing false eviden ce against any other person or giving false statements or charges in bad f aith against any other person. Falsification, fraudulent use or misuse of application material s or forms used by the CCVM for admissions, evaluation of performance or evaluation of conduct. Falsification, fraudulent use or misuse of clinical records, va ccination certificates, prescriptions or other forms used in the practice of veterinary medicine. Abuse, neglect or improper care of any animal. Conviction in a court of competen t jurisdiction of a felony or on any charge involving moral turpitude (moral depravity). Engaging in any facet of the practice of veterinary medicine or surgery prior to graduation unless under direct supervision of a legally license d veterinarian. These practices shall be defined according to state practice acts. Falsifying medical records or any document relating to the trea tment, care, health or disposition of any animal in the College. Stealing or misappropriating any item or making unauthorized us e of any item, public or private at the Carlson College of Veterinary Medicine, or ot her departments on campus, for example: drugs, boo ks, instruments, microscopes. Student Duty Hours The Carlson College of Veterinary Medicine recognizes the impor tance of the health, safety, and well-being of veterinary students. It is clear that students ne ed adequate time for rest and personal care in order to optimize learning , student safety, and patient care. The following guidelines have been developed to help define th ose needs and suggest how to me et them. Limiting required duty hours does not imply that students should cease providing essen tial patient care services. Priority must always be given to patient care and avoiding transfer of r esponsibilities to others at inappropriate times (e.g., during an operative procedure, in th e midst of a rapidly evolving clinical event). Ultimately, senior clinicians have the authority to det ermine if a student may be excused or if their presence is require d to maintain patient care. 1. It is the responsibility of the students to inform the service faculty when they have been in the hospital after regular business hours. It is the responsibility of the faculty, residents, and staff to allow and encourage students to l eave the hospital to rest and attend to personal needs. 2. Continuous on-site duty should not exceed twenty-four consecuti ve hours. Students may remain on duty longer at their discretion, with service faculty approv al, to participate in didactic activities, transfer care of pati ents, and to maintain continui ty of medical and surgical care. Faculty or resident approval must be confirmed before leaving t o avoid disruption of patient care. 3. Students should be provided a reasonable amount of time to eat or attend to personal care at least once every six hours. However, sufficient time to leave the hos pital to eat may not be available. 4. Weeknight treatment duty or on-ca ll duty should be scheduled no more frequently than every third night, averaged over the length of the rotation, unless s tudent numbers preclude this. Students should not trade shifts that result in consecutive nig hts on treatment duty or on-call. 12 5. Adequate time for rest and personal activities should be provid ed. Optimally, this should be a minimum of 8 consecutive hours w ithin a 24 hour period unaffect ed by daily duties, after-hours duties or in-house call. 6. Regularly-scheduled in house dut y hours, should be limited to e ighty hours per week, averaged over the course of the length of the rotation. Policy on Social Network Use Posting of material relating to a ny client, patient, College-ow ned or research animal in any form to any public or social networking site is forbidden. Visual im ages such as photographs of surgery, rectal examination and necropsy that veterinary studen ts are accustomed to could be upsetting to many in the general public. In addition, these ima ges could be copied and misused by other groups, resulting in permanent harm to veterinary educ ation programs. Therefore, no pictures of any animal within th e college may be posted to any web site without the prior approval of the Associate Dean f or Student and Academic Affairs . No picture of any hospital client may be posted without the written approval of t he client involved. Students are required to maintain and re spect client and patient confide ntiality and to respect the dignity of all animals and their owners. Failure to comply with this po licy will be considered a violation of the Professional Code of Conduct. The use of personal cell phones a nd other personal electronic d evices should be limited to break periods unless being used specifi cally for rotation related tas ks. Be respectful and professional when using your devices. Limit di stractions during your schedul ed shifts, rounds, appointments, and meetings. Honesty in Academic Work The administration of the classroom rests with the instructor. Immediate action should be taken when evidence of academic dishonesty comes to the instruc tor's attention. The instructor may impose any grade penalty up to and including an \"F\" grade after informing the student. The instructor must report the incident and the action taken to the Department Head and then to the Associate Dean for Student and Academic Affairs . Grade penalties imposed as a result of academic dishonesty may be appealed by the stude nt. Examples of academic dishonesty include, but are not limited to : Receiving or giving unauthorized aid on examinations or any oth er work which is required to be accomplished individually. In general, students may not w ork together on graded course work without the specific permission of their instructor . If students are unsure of the limits of permissible collaboration, they must seek clarificati on from the instructor. Using unauthorized materia ls during examinations. Removing an examination from th e examination room without the i nstructor's consent. Denying others the opportunity to prepare for upcoming exams. Plagiarizing, defined as the una cknowledged use of the words or ideas of another. Using false excuses to obtain ex tensions of time deadlines, or providing false information or fabricated documents or data to the University. Altering a graded exam and submitting it for re-grading. 13 The students in the Carlson College of Veterinary Medicine are on an honor system during examinations. They are asked to sign and abide by a Student Hon or Code Agreement. The faculty may or may not proctor examinations but are available t o answer questions and assist with the evaluation process. If a student knows or suspects ano ther student has committed acts of academic dishonesty, s/he is expected to report the incident to the instructor and the Associate Dean for Student and Academic Affairs. 14 15 Lois Bates Acheson Veterinary Teaching Hospital Dr. Helio de Morais Director, Lois Bates Acheson Veterinary Teaching Hospital Hospital Mission The mission of the Oregon State University , Lois Bates Acheson Veterinary Teaching Hospital (VTH) is to provide superior clinical instruction as part of a professional veterinary curriculum; to provide high quality patient care and customer service; to s erve as a referral and consultation center for veterinary practitioners as well as governmental and non-governmental agencies; to conduct original clinical resear ch on emerging animal and human health concerns; and to offer an intellectual and academic atmosphere that supports the pract ice of innovative veterinary medicine.

Technical staff manages the Diagnostic Imaging Services areas. Many VTH activities are organized and fac ilitated by the veterinary tech nicians and service area staff. Safety The OSU VTH realizes the importance of a safe work environment. The training for and practice of veterinary medicine is associated with physical and emotional hazards. Individuals who are pregnant, anticipate a pregnancy, are disabled or serio usly ill should review recommendations under the previous CVM Student Policy section. Policies are in place to minimize injury to our students. In the event of a life-threate ning injury emergency services (9- 911) should be called. There are several faculty and staff trai ned in basic CPR that you may notify over the loud speaker if necessary. Someone should stay with the injured until emergency services arrive. Some specific, relatively common, injuries are discussed below. Bites: It is important to remember that all bites should be reported t o a service veterinary technician who will aid in completing necessary paperwork. A po licy on animal bites, as well as bite report form, is available in the Appendices. Immediately, all bites should be washed with soap and water for a minimum of 5 minutes and encouraged to ble ed. Do not massage the wound. It is recommended that stu dents see their healthcare pro vider or Student Health Services for further recommendations. The appendix also contains materia l students should read on rabies. Sharps: Needle stick and other sharp inju ries are common in veterinary practice. Students should read the Sharps Injury policy in the appendix. For life -threatening injuries see above. For non-life-threatening injuries wash it with warm soap and wa ter for five minutes, encouraging bleeding. Do not massage the wound. Wrap and dress as appropri ate. Seek medical care as previously directed. Infectious Disease: As veterinary students you will be exposed to or potentially ex posed to many infectious and zoonotic age nts. A comprehensive infectious disease policy for the hospital is in the appendix that covers personal safety as well as indiv idual diseases. Students should read up on ssp. Campylobacter, Gi ardia, Yersinia, scratch ), leptospirosis, brucellosis, Q fever, tuberculosis, anthrax, Lymes Disease, equ ine encephalitides, West Nile fever, and Herpes B virus (primate contact) as they may come in to contact with individuals that are or potentially are infected with these zoonotic organisms. Radiologic Risks: Students may be exposed to sever al radiologic risks including r adiation (radiograph, CT, MRI, fluoroscopy) and radionuclides. Students should adhere to the principles of ALARA. Students who are pregna nt or may be pregnant are refe rred to an earlier section on safety for pregnant persons in the CCVM Student Policies. Addit ional safety information will be obtained during your diagnostic imaging rotation and orientatio n. The Appendix contains additional information regarding radiation exposure and ALARA. Chemicals: Chemicals are used to clean, disinfect and treat our patients. Students should familiarize themselves with the risks of exposure to chemicals in their environment. MSDS sheets are available in the VTH for all chemicals used and can be found in the hospital laboratory 19 area. If you have questions reg arding chemical exposure please ask a service technician or clinician. Controlled Substances Controlled substances are those substances that fall under the jurisdiction of the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), which is part of the U.S. Department of Justice, who enforces the Controlled Substance Act, and therefore depict Federal regulati ons surrounding the use and accountability of. Controlled substances carry diversion and ab use potential, with different scheduling of the substances, whi ch make them high-priority to many regulations in healthcare practices. The primary goal of the DEA is to prevent diversion and abuse of these substances while ensuring adequate supply of controlled substances are met for the country's legitimate medical, scientific, and research needs. All employees and students within the Veterinary Teaching Hospi tal, which fall under the DEA registration of the Acheson Teac hing Hospital Pharmacy, are sub ject to Title 21 United States Code (USC) Federal Controlled Substances Act. All definitions, rules, and regulations can be found at the following website: http://www.deadiversi on.usdoj.gov/21cfr /21usc/index.html . Therefore all employees and stud ents must maintain appropriate scope of practice in veterinary medicine when using controlled substances. This means that appr opriate protocol and use of controlled substances are warranted in patient therapy, in term s of prescribing, administering, and dispensing for legitimate medical purposes. Controlled substances will require strict accountability, secur ity, and documentation in all areas of the hospital, therefore a \"clos ed-system\" concept is warrant ed. This means that all records must be accurate and a reflection of secure physical inventory for all audit purposes. Students will, at times, be handling controlled substances and will be g ranted this authority under their respective VTH clinical practitio ner and under their direct sup ervision. Students, in this regard, will be held responsible in abid ing by all measures that fall u nder the Controlled Substance Act. Students are not allowed to acce ss areas that contain controlle d substances within the VTH, veloped positive-swill help in maintaining compliance for accou ntability and accuracy of, for example, serving as witnesses to controlled substance transacti ons from the Cubex\u00ae machines or preparing written prescription orders for controlled substances signed by the VTH practitioner. If diversion is suspected, severe penalties can follow per Fede ral regulations, such as civil, criminal, or loss of licensure and in turn, punishments around the veterinary collegiate program as deemed necessary. Controlled substances are divided into five schedules, determin ed by current accepted medical use in the U.S. and relative abu se potential and likelihood to cause dependence. Please familiarize yourself with the fo llowing examples (definitions a re paraphrased): C I: high potential for abuse, lack of safety o Example: heroin C II: high potential for abuse a nd may lead to severe psycholog ical or physical dependence o Examples: hydromorphone, morphine, fentanyl 20 C III: have potential for abuse less than C I / C II, may lead to moderate or low physical dependence / high psychological dependence o Examples: buprenorphine, k etamine, APAP-codeine C IV: have a lower potential for abuse relative to C III o Examples: butorphanol, midazolam, diazepam C V: have a lower potential for abuse relative to C IV o Example: codeine syrup 21 Large Animal Services Veterinary Teaching Hospital Guidelines and Procedures Introduction The primary mission of faculty , staff, and students is quality patient care. The provision of excellent service is fundamental to the Veterinary Teaching Hos pital (VTH). The VTH is expected to function and provide services in a manner similar t o a successful private practice and this requires the attention of everyone to all aspects from pat ient care, client relations, and general order and cl eanliness. The workload and schedule is dem anding at times. Your performance under stressful situations will help you develop ne cessary skills and habits. Hospital Hours Regular business hours: Monday through Friday 8:00 am - 5:00 pm After-hours: Monday through Thursda y 5:00 pm - 8:00 am Friday 5:00 pm - Monday 8:00 am Holidays (Hospital closed for regular receiving): Martin Luther King, Jr. Day Memorial Day July Fourth Labor Day Veteran's Day Thanksgiving Christmas Eve Christmas Day New Year's Day General Guidelines and Hospital Procedures Dress Code: Clean and appropriately worn clothes are required at all times. Name tags are to be worn in the VTH at all times. You are required to carry a st ethoscope, thermometer, pen light, a watch (digital or second hand) and bandage scissors in the VTH. It is your responsibility to purchase and launder purchased clothing. We ask that each of you procure two pair of Big Dutch bib overalls or coveralls (Pella Products, Inc., 835 Broa dway, PO Box 217, Pella, Iowa 50219; telephone 515-628-3092). If, as a class , you would cooperate and order the same style and color in quantity, there is a discount available from Pella Products, Inc. You do not have to buy from this company, but the color, quality, and style must be the same. Shoes should be of a 22 type that can be dipped into an tiseptic solutions and sufficien t to reduce injury if stepped on by an animal. Scrubs are required in surgery. Surgery scrub suits will be worn in the operating rooms together with shoe covers at all times. Caps and masks wi ll be worn as required. Surgical scrub suits are not to be worn out of the operating room unless under coveralls or lab coats. For field service you will need cover alls and boots (spare coverall s should be available to replace dirty ones). Upon return from a field service call, students mu st change their clothes and sanitize or change boots before working in the VTH. This dress code requ irement is designed to present students as professionals. No other type of clothing will be al lowed for 4th year students in the hospital. Professionalism and Conduct: Be punctual and dress and behave in a professional manner. Address all Veterinary Teaching Hospital Clinicians as Doctor; and if you have a preference for the way you would like to be addr essed (e.g., Mr. Smith, Ms. Jo nes, etc.,) tell people. Discussions regarding cases in t he presence of the owner or cli ent are encouraged only when prompted by the clinician in charge. Medical Records: Because our program is concerned with detailed case material, e xtensive records and information are required. Fill out the required for ms completely and with the information required. Clearly record all procedures on the dail y progress sheet so that the staff may see that relevant charges are made. Any supplies used shoul d be recorded on appropriate forms. Completion of the medical record is the responsibility o f the student, veterinary technician and clinician overseeing the case so be sure you are familiar with the portions of the medical record that are your responsibility. Client Confidentiality: Information regarding clients and their animals is confidential and available only to the owner or hi s/her designated agent, or ref erring veterinarian. Patient information is to be released only by a clinician or by written order of the same. Any photographs or video taken must b e approved by the owner/agent on the Authorization and Release form. Patient Care: Students are required to participate in the full regimen of tre atments for assigned patients. This includes after-hours care as necessary. All pati ents should be handled with care, and if aggressive behavior is noted, please call attention to t his so that injuries to oneself and others can be prevented. Clinici ans should be called to assist you with handling unruly cases. If you ever feel uncomfortable handlin g a patient or performing a procedure, notify a clinician immediately. Halters are to be l eft with the patients, but lead ropes, blankets, bandages, etc., should be returned to the owner or carrier when the patient arr ives. All animals should be weighed on admission and discharge and details recorded. If own ers require \"blanketing\" of their animals, we will be respons ible for returning this equipm ent to them at discharge. We are in the animal care profession, but do receive requests to accep t animal donations for teaching uses. Any person asking to donate animals should be directed to Large Animal Reception. Procedures: Certain diagnostic or treatment procedures, e.g. rectal examina tions, intravenous injections, and the passage of nasogastric tubes, should be per formed only in the presence of a clinician. If you have any ques tions regarding the procedures y ou are performing as a clinical student, stop and ask a clinician. 23 Hospital Equipment: All equipment should be cleaned and broken equipm ent is replace d by a veterinary technician before st oring. Return all equipment, sup plies, and drugs, to their correct locations when you have finished using them. It is VTH policy t hat no equipment or supplies be used by students for personal r easons. This policy applies to e venings and weekends. There are no exceptions to this policy. Facilities: The Hospital reception area, student computer area, and student break rooms are the designated places for students to remain unless busy with patie nt care. Please respect others by leaving these areas clean. SafetyProcedures Your safety is our primary conce rn. There are numerous opportun ities for injury in the VTH. Animal Handling Risks: When dealing with animals, anythi ng can happen, a nd you should be alert and prepared at all times. If you are unfamiliar with the demeanor of any specific animal, work in pairs or talk to the clin ician-in-charge before doing a nything. Animals are not to be left unattended while restrained in stocks, chutes, or when tied up. They react differently to restraint. Be alert. Always be aware of an avenue of escape. Keep the stal l door closed enough so as not to encourage bolting by your patie nt. Do not completely close o r lock the stall door when working inside sta lls with animals. Never enter a bull or stallion's stall alone. Veterinary technicians and clinicians (not stall cleaners) are available t o help. You should make sure that you have had proper instruction before working with unfamiliar animals. Do not hesitate to ask. If utilizing an assistant, make sure your assistant is aware of the potential hazard and knows how to restrain the animal. Environment and Equipment: Do not shout or make lou d noises in the hospital, as it frighte ns animals. Avoid running in the hospital. Remove debris from floo rs to prevent accidents. When spraying water in the VTH be aware of electrocution risks. Do n ot spray water on electrical outlets, light sockets, or electrical insect/fly killers. Human food and drink are not permitted in the hospital animal areas. Many of the restraining chutes have hard projections that are a t head height; look where you are going and watch what you, the anim al, and other people are doin g. Equipment used for treatment or restraint of large animals may also break, malfunc tion, or simply be inadequate at times, and you should never use equipment unless you are fully aware of its proper operation and limitations. Wear ear protection when using noisy equipment. We ar ear protection when using noisy equipment. Injuries: If a life-threatening injury o ccurs dial 9-911 and send someone to meet the emergency vehicle. In addition, if you are injured during the assigned ti me in the hospital this must be reported immediately to the atte nding clinician, service area s upervisor, Hospital Director and Chair of the Department of Clinical Sciences. Sharp objects (needles, scalpel blades) should be carefully han dled and discarded in designated 24 disposal containers. Do not to recap needles. For sharps injuri es and animal bites the wounds should be immediately cleaned w ith warm running water and soap for several minutes followed by an antiseptic solution such a s povidine-iodine or chlorhexid ine. A bandage should be applied as necessary. Students should co ntact the Student Health Servic es at (541) 737-9355. An Accident and Illness Form form needs to be completed and is located in the small animal h ospital outside small animal reception. A technician supervisor (Alisa Kraxberger, Robyn Panico, Dave Meyer) can assist in completing the paperwork. Specific informa tion on sharps injury and reporting can be found in the appendices Sharps Safety Plan and Sharps Injury Log . Animal bites follow the procedure above. Animal bites should also be r eported to the Benton County Health Department (541) 766-683 5. For additional information on animal bite injuries and rabies, please read appendices Animal Bite Procedure , Animal Bite Reporting Form , Compendium of Animal Rabies , and Human Rabies Pr evention Program . Appropriate paperwork must be completed. You may refer to the appendix on Accident Reporting Procedures and Accident and Illness Form . Infectious Disease: See the Large Animal Infectious Disease Protocol in the appendices for a full discussion of infectious dise ase and risks in the large an imal hospital. Consider the infectious agent(s) that are a concern and avoid contaminating yourself, the patient or other patients with that agent. Conside r things like keeping the stal l clean and clear of manure, avoid walking in manure and avoid trac king manure into feed. Thorough ly clean shoes with a brush and disinfectant when you accidentally get fecal matter on shoe s or where required in the facility. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment as indicated by the risk of exposure and transmission of infectious agents. This may include gloves, a g own, mask/goggles and boot covers/plastic booties. Exam gl oves should be worn when working with all patients. Wash Your Hands between patients. Frequent hand washing has been proven to be t he most important component to prevent the spread o f infectious diseases. Hands s hould be scrubbed for at least 15 second, when treating animals with known infectious diseases, remove soiled garments and plastic booties. Do not share equipment between an imals unless it has been cleaned and disinfected. PatientAdmission Patients are admitted only by prio r arrangement with the clinic ian or VTH reception staff. Admission (or discharge) of patie nts after-hours is not encoura ged unless prior arrangements have been made or an emergency situation exists. Do so only whe n authorized by the clinician- in-charge. All required forms to be filled out and signed are i n the reception area. Make sure that these forms are completely filled out. Weigh animals on admissi on and record the time and date of admission. Take as much history as possible from the owner o r agent, or as directed by clinicians. With emergencies, common sense takes precedence ove r paperwork, which can be postponed until emergency treatment is instituted. Remember to complete the paperwork as soon as time permits. Do not allo w a client or agent to leave b efore signing the required forms, especially the Authorization and Release form. Deposits are req uired for treatme nt. Clinicians and reception personnel will provide this function during offic e hours. Clinicians or technicians perform this duty overnight or during weekends. Unloading (or loading) patients is the responsibility of the ow ner/hauler. Responsibility for 25 animals or people injured during unloading or loading may be pl aced upon a volunteer helper. If help is requested by the owner/hauler, contact the clinician. M any animals behave badly when being unloaded or loaded from trailers. You may show the client the entrance but they must unload their animal themselves. Keep the halter on the animal and give owner the lead shank and any other tack not required. Any tack kept should be clearly identified with the owner's nam e, stall number, a nd case number. Patient's tack is hung on the stall door Assign stalls after the clinician has ascertained that no infec tious disease is present. In the latter case, the animal will be placed in an isolation stall. If in do ubt, confer with the clinician or technician. Each animal should b e clearly identified on admissi on to ensure proper treatment. Food and water should be given according to the clinicians inst ructions. Place a stall card an necessary instructions on the stall door. Patient Discharge No patients will be discharged unless specifically authorized b y a clinician. All documents and invoices must be completed and si gned before discharging the pa tient. Clinicians (clinical fellows, residents, faculty) must review discharges prior to th eir distribution to owners or referring veterinarians. When di scharging patients, make sure t hat the written discharge instructions concerning the patie nt are clearly u nderstood by t he client as well as signed by the clinician and client. The date and time of discharge and patien t current weight should be recorded in the medical recor d. A copy of the signed discharge should accompany the owner. All billing/payment instructions and details mu st also be provi ded. The client must pay in full or have made prior arrangements with Mandy Seals, Client Services Coordinator, for other than full payment. The client will receive an invoice during regular busi ness hours. Those discharged after hours will receive an electronic invoice or hard copy inv oice by mail. Patients slated for discharge should be ready to go home, i.e., they are to be groomed, and are to look presentable. Make sure the client is given any tack, shoes or equipment that belongs to them. Check the front of the stall, feed room and large animal reception for any belongings. Be sure that any medications to be dispensed are labeled properly and given to the client. Mark the stall with a card that says 'Clean and Disinfect' or a lternatively turn the stall card and write on it. Additional Information VTH Policies, Procedures Organizational Charts, and SOPS are av ailable on the Veterinary Teaching Hospital intranet site. http://128.193.215.68:12469/vth-policies/_policies_main.htm . 26 Large Animal Clinic After-Hours Responsibilities After-Hours Student's Role The after-hours students play a c rucial role in maintaining cli ent services and patient care outside of regular hours. The duties of these students are to monitor a nd treat patients, identify and report patient status changes, and assist in emergency cases. S tudents are expected to be punctual and available in Magruder Hall during their entire ass igned periods. Remember that after hours provides valuable lea rning experiences in medicatio n administration, patient assessment and monitoring, organi zation and team work. You are a valued member of the team and we appreciate your help. After-HoursSchedule There will always be one or more in-hospital clinicians and one field service (RVP) clinician on call. The hospital typically has a House Officer scheduled as p rimary on-call with a Senior Clinician available as back up. You should be aware of their in tended whereabouts and of any required treatments, admissions, discharges, before the clinici ans depart each day. The clinician and House Officer on duty may be reached by telephone if needed . A roster of on-duty emergency House Officers is located on the reception area bulle tin boards. There are lists of clinician phone numbers in the reception area as well as in str ategic locations in the hospital. Remember the doors are locked outside of business hours so keep your access badge with you. Duties Telephone Responsibilities: After-hours students and technicians are responsible for answer ing the hospital \" back\" telephone line (541-7 37-6845) when on duty. When the VTH rece ption area closes, phone calls from clients and referring veterinarians ar e routed through the primary veterinary clinician (house officer) on duty. If that clinician needs to contact the hospital he/she will phone on the back line. This hospital number may be answer ed on the phones in the hospital and communication room telephones by punching *7. Please answer clearly, \"OSU Veterinary Teaching Hospital. This is (your name) speaking. May I help you?\" A clinician will notify you about the case, its es timated time of arrival, and will let you know about any special requirements or equipment to have on hand. In addition to preparing yourself to receive this case, please also notify the duty tech nician as soon as possible so that they may prepare for the patient's arrival. Non-business and non-emergency ca lls are not to be made from VT H business telephones. Personal calls may be placed f rom lines other than 737-6845. Wh en using the telephone, please be as brief as possible. Do not g ive out individual office numb ers or clinician cell phone 27 numbers to clients or referring veterinarians. When placing calls remember the following: For on-campus calls dial: 7 + the 4 digit number. For local calls dial 9-541+ the 7 digit number. For 1-800 calls dial 9-1-800+ the 7 digit number. For long distance calls dial 9-1- + the 7 digit number and th en the approved long distance code. After-hours call boxes are mounte d on the wall outside the VDL reception area and at the north gate by the small animal hospital. If either box is used, it rings on the hospital \"back-line\" at 7- 6845. You can then look at the live feed of the camera monitori ng the north large animal hospital entrance and determine if the North or South gate shou ld be opened. The gates now also have a sign on them labeling them as \"North\" or \"South\" so you can ask the client which gate they are at. The North gate button is located within the commun ications room and the South gate button is located next to the bov ine scale. The reception at th e call boxes is less than ideal. This means the telephone will often ring and there appears to be no one at the other end, or you may simply hear a vehicle running. The client may also be unable to hear you in some circumstances. Be aware that even if you don't hear a voice, there is likely s omeone waiting at the gate. The back line will also ring with clients bringing specimens/an imals to the VDL/necropsy after hours. If you are unsure of how to deal with this , please notif y the technician who will meet the client by VDL and complete the a ppropriate paperwork, prior to placing the specimen in the correct location in the VDL. Once you let a client through th e gate, remember that reception is locked, and someone will need to meet them at the reception door to let them in. Admissions and Discharges: Please refer to the LA VTH Guidelines and Procedures for genera l information on patient admission and discharge. In most instanc es a clinician will be present at the time of client arrival. If th e clinician has not arrived, h ave the owner unload the animal only if the clinician has said to do so. If not, utilize this time t o obtain a good history. This is the client's first impression of OSU-VTH so ensure that you are dre ssed appropriately and act professionally. The usual rule s about giving opinions, criticiz ing treatments, or giving advice also apply here. Many clients will not know if you are student, staff, or faculty. Identify yourself before proceeding with collecting a history or perform ing a physical examination. After-hours, a veterinary technician or clinician will generate a case number, complete a financial estimate and collect a deposit for services. The stud ent will aid in filling out the Client Information form as well as the A uthorization and Release form. Alert the on-call clinician of any 'walk-in' emergencies. In the event an animal arrives dead, the on-call clinician is s till called for instruc tions. If he/she feels it is necessary, they will contact the pathologist or ins truct you to do so. The details regarding the pathologist on call are posted inside the front V DL door and in hospital Reception. 28 The number for the emergency cell phone carried by the on-call pathologist is located on the door to the necropsy cooler and on the white board in the hall outside of the Equine Minor Treatment room. The pathologists must be notified of every spec imen placed in the cooler, however the clinician present will typically do this. Medical Records: SOAPs are required for cases a dmitted to the emergency service at the end of your shift and until the case is transferred to another service . You are responsible to write records, SOAP's, and treatment sheets. Remember to have a clini cian check the treatment sheet prior to administering medications. You are also responsible to turn in any requests or lab work between 7:30 and 8:30 am. In most cases, if a patient goes to s urgery, the student who received the case will go to surgery with them and scrub in. In some ins tances, when it is close to the end of a shift, the emergency student starting at 10pm weekdays/8pm weeknights may scrub in instead. This decision is at the discretion of the clinician on duty, however it is okay to remind the clinician that it is nearing the end of your shift as somet imes they lose track of time. Every effort will be made to ensure you have adequate time away from the hospital as long as patient care is not compromised. The student who scrubs into the case i s responsible to have a surgery report in the record within 24 ho urs of the completion of the s urgery. Final surgery reports are to be submitted electronically. Ensure you also provide the new st udent a full description of the case, and ensure records are comp lete for your involvement prio r to leaving. Record all medications used and all medicat ions and supplie s checked out o f pharmacy. Remember that the SOAP is the medical record. Everything from the examination, di agnostic test results, medications etc. must be accurately recorded here. Please ask y our house officer or clinician if you are unsure of specific details. Patient Care: If you admit a case, you are the student responsible for the ca se during your duty hours or until the case is officially transferred to another se rvice. This will us ually occur at transfer rounds the following m orning. The primary on-call clin ician (resident or clinical fellow) and the emergency clinician or surgeon will challenge you to ta ke an active role in these cases. If you demonstrate you are prepared before case arrival, you will be more likely to be given more responsibility. However, if time is of the essence, and the cli nician takes charge of the case, make sure you understand the whys in the case management and as k questions at an appropriate time. If a case requires emergency surgical care, the 5-10 pm or emergency student scrubs in for the surgery and the on-call backup student will provide support . You also should not leave the following morning until you have d iscussed the case with the ho use officer/emergency clinician in person, your paperwork is com pleted, medications for the day have been made, and the flow sheet has been approved by the house officer. If you do not hav e a patient, please assist other students with their 8 am treatments and do not leave until you have received permission from the house officer/emergency clinician on duty. Critical care cases are your primary responsibility and the on- duty clinician, resident or clinical fellow is primarily responsible for decisions regarding their c are. Always call the clinician designated if the parameters (written on the stall-side treatme nt sheet) for clinician contact are met or if there are other pa tient changes that concern you. Remember to use your best judgment and call earlier if you have questions or concerns eve n if the parameters have not been reached. Clinicians would rather that you call too early, than too late. If you are uncertain whether to call a clinician, the duty technician is a valuable resource in making this decision. Never underestimate the value of a physical examination and con sider the information a clinician 29 may need when on the phone with y ou (i.e. always perform a phys ical examination prior to calling unless the situation is emergent or dangerous). The clinician/house officer to call is the person listed on the treatment sheet. If you do not get an answer, leave a voicemail, and call again. Keep calling. If the house officer does not respond, or you need an immediate response in an emergency, call the senior clinician on the case. If neither one can be reached, you may call the emergency clinician on dut y. As with other cases, treatment s hould not be instigated, altere d, or discontinued without consultation with a clinician unless you are dealing with a lif e-threatening emergency. This is the time in your clinical training to take initiative , however, please do so under the guidance of the clinician in charge if at all possible. The location and us e of emergency medical kits will be shown to you during orientation. Large animal emergencies can b e dramatic, and your safety is always top priority. Take care not to get yourself into a situa tion where your safety may be at risk, and do not hesitate to call for help (clinician/technicia n) prior to entering a stall. Treatment sheets and flow charts are set up by the daytime serv ice and are to be followed exactly unless instructions change. Comple te regularly scheduled BID tr eatments. These are the responsibility of medicine or surgery students assigned to the case, but may be performed by the ER and backup students or technicians as a courtesy. After-hour s duty students may relieve block students of thi s responsibility but only with mutual agre ement among concerned parties. A walk through and visual examina tion should be performed on all hospitalized patients by the ER student at regular hourly intervals. Investigate all concerns b y reading the medical record. Weekend treatments are given in the same schedule as weekdays. The time at which you begin morning treatments on weekdays w ill depend on your caseload. Ho wever, you should begin treatments early enough, with SOAPs completed, to be free to pa rticipate in rounds by 8:00 am. When you are present in the hospital after hours, you need to b e able to hear changes with patients such as fluid pumps b eeping. As such, while you may us e personal electronics for entertainment during quiet times , headphones are not to be worn , and any sound must be quiet enough that you can hear noises from patient stalls. Remember that late night/early morning is the most common time for medication errors to be made. Double check everything be fore you administer it, and alw ays ask a technician or clinician if you are uncertain. Remember th at nothing opaque goes into a vein. If a medication is not prepared and ready for a patient , double check with the technic ian/other students that they have not given it and forgotten to sign. If not, contact the student on the case to ask if they drew the medication up. Only once these av enues are exhausted, should yo u prepare the medication/get a medication from pharmacy. Rounds: Attend clinic rounds and be prepa red to discuss any cases under your care. This essentially means all hospitalized cases. To be prepared, read the medical records for all cases and understand the case management decisions that have been mad e. Use the veterinary literature, colleagues, faculty, and internet in your quest to learn from these cases. Use discretion and judgment when discussing the se cases with faculty. Remember , owner information is strictly confidential and not to b e shared with other owners an d non-VTH veterinarians. Pay attention to presentations during rounds of all hospitalized pa tients. If the reasons behind the management of the case are not apparent, challenge yourself to discover them by reading the record and the literature, and by having constructive discussio ns with colleagues and faculty or the emergency clinician. Be organized and ready for roun ds presentations if you are tran sferring a case. You should have 30 your SOAP, and all laboratory results available. Present the ca se in a logical manner- Signalment, history, ph ysical examination fi ndings. After this it is usually logical to present in the order tests were done; i.e. blood gas analysis/CBC/serum ch emistry results, then per rectum findings, belly tap results etc. Update on surgical findings ev en if you were not scrubbed into the procedure. Summarize medications administered (dose in mg/kg, r oute of administration, frequency) and know WHY you are giving these. Summarize how the patient progressed overnight, and your morning physi cal examination findings. Be p repared with your plan for the day. Professionalism: Give the after-hours duty techni cian your full cooperation. The after-hours duty technician reduces your overnight stays by 50%. Regarding client questions, do not get trapped into trying to answer qu estions that you do not feel co nfident about. It is better to refer questions than to speculate. Please take time to locate the dut y technician at the start of your shift. They can update you on any special considerations such a s patients to discharge, emergencies coming in, or critical cases that need extra attent ion. They may direct you to divide the cases so that one person deals with isolation cases and one with hospital cases. At the end of your shift, please check in with the technician again. This is the time to update them on any patient concerns that have arisen recently, let them know which treatments you finished/did not finish, and make sure they are aware you are leaving. Your know ledge of the cases is valuable- take a few minutes to update the emergency student taking over from you. SleepingQuarters During large animal rotations stu dents may spend long shifts in the hospital. This may put them at risk during the commute home. The sleeping quarters are inte nded to provide a safe alternative for students and ho use officers who may be too tire d to commute home. There is one room provided for living quarters to be shared between after-ho urs students and house officers. There are four beds located in these quarters. The room is equi pped with a bed, bedding, and a wash basin. Showering and bathroom facilities are the student l ocker rooms across the hall from the living quarters. This is a shared space so please respect o thers and keep the area clean. Linens can be placed in the provided bins in the student/facult y locker rooms for washing. All belongings must be removed from the room at the end of occupanc y. Dogs, cats, or other pets are not allowed. Flip the sign on the door to \"occupied\" when y ou enter so anyone else entering knows to be respectful. The sleeping quarters are to be utilize d only at the end of your shift. While you are on duty in the hosp ital, you are expected to be a wake and present in the hospital at all times, for patient and personnel safety. Grades After-hours duties are incorporated into your other grade rotat ions. Grading is based on attendance and professionalism as well as performance during ro unds, quizzes and discussions with faculty and staff. Perfect attendance is mandatory. Absenc es that are not preauthorized will result in a failing grade. Tardiness can result in a drop of a full letter grade. The after-hours schedule is made by Alisa Leeper, Large Animal Technician Super visor. Students may swap shifts, however they must be chan ged on the posted after-hours schedule. When switching shifts, 31 it is vital that you consider your schedule in full. The large animal hospital is busy after hours and frequently takes in emergencies, often more than one per ni ght. Expect to be called in when you are on back up. Therefore, do not make alterations that lea ve you with multiple shifts and back up shifts consecutively. Whe never possible, inform the on- duty house officers and clinicians of changes, difficulties and absences. 32 VMC 732 & VMC 752 Large Animal Clinical Medicine I and II Guidelines and Procedures Course Coordinator: Dr. Erica McKenzie Course Instructors: Dr. Erica McKenzie, Dr. John Schlipf Objective To expose students to Large Animal Internal Medicine cases, man y of which are received on a referral basis. Phone numbers re levant to operations in the lar ge animal hospital are found in the General Information After-hours D uty sections of this manual. I. Operation of the Medicine Service A. The medicine service handles out- patient and in-hospital cases requiring primarily medical management. B. Cases may be referred or transferred to other services as appro priate. 1. Cases requiring surgical procedures or evaluation for lameness disorders will be addressed by the surgical service. 2. Reproductive cases will be addressed by the theriogenology serv ice, in conjunction with the medicine service, unless surgery is required. If these patients require hospitalization, they will typically be managed by the medicine service with close consultation with the theriogenology service. 3. Some cases may involve one or mo re services, and the medicine s ervice may also consult with other services on specific cases as appropriate. C. Students assigned to medicine are permitted to observe therioge nology or surgery cases if there is no conflict with medicine cases and if clinician appro val is given. D. We have support services as liste d below. Requisite forms or el ectronic submissions should be filled out completely at the time of sample submissio n or request and a copy left in the Hospital record. 1. Pharmacy: For prescriptions make sure to provide a case number and appropriate details. Forms available in the large animal hospital and Pharm acy should be dated, marked as in- or out-patient, and fully filled out. Stickers ou tlining patient information are available in the client record and should be ap plied to all submissions. Please see the pharmacy section of the manual for additional in struction on pharmacy prescriptions and order forms. 2. Radiology and ultrasound: Imaging requests are submitted via th e VetHosp program. Requests should be submitted by 4:30 pm. Imaging and rarely, MRI. Imaging scheduling/plan is arrange d after an imaging request is submitted. Submission re quirements are discussed dur ing orientation to clinical rotations. Where necessa ry (CT scan), anesthesia reque sts may also be required. Ultrasonography is typically performed by the medicin e service and does not require a request form. 3. Endoscopy: Will be performed by the medicine service, typically with standing sedation. No request form is nee ded unless general anesthesia i s involved. 4. Clinical pathology and Diagnos tic Services: Requests are submit ted via the VetHosp program. Requests should be subm itted by 4:30 pm. Take the appr opriately protected sample(s) directly to veterinary diagnostic laboratory receivin g. Special and outside laboratory tests may be submitted via the VetHosp program. Some may require additional forms but should be r outed through VDL receiving. As k the clinician or technician for help submitting unc ommon \"outside lab\" samples. Some tests including blood gas analysis, gluc ose or lactate measurement, k etones, PCV and refractometry total protein measurement can be performed by stu dents in the 'technician lab'. You will be shown how to use this equipment a t orientation, but do not hesitate to ask for help if needed. 5. Necropsy service: a) Take carcass to cooler or necropsy floor as required by VDL per sonnel. Identify carcass with tag and client details, and intended purpose i.e. necropsy/teaching necropsy/disposal. b) Submit information with a complete and thorough history to VDL receiving after confirming adequate complet ion of the form with the house officer and faculty member on service. Incomplete history is a common problem on these forms which is detrimental to the necropsy process, and every effort should be made to provide as complet e a history as possible. DO NOT click the \"import case history\" button. Try and attend necropsies on patients tha t you were involved with-this is an excellent learning opportunity. E. At present: 1. This service handles all internal medicine cases including: a) Gastroenterology (nonsurgical), including colic cases presentin g in-hours until diagnosed as requiring surgical intervention. Colic cases prese nting after-hours are currently received by the surgical service. b) Respiratory diseases (until or unless identified as surgical in nature) c) Neurologic diseases d) Urinary tract diseases (until or unless identified as surgical in nature) e) Dermatological disorders f) Endocrine disorders 34 g) Metabolic/nutritional diseases h) Toxic diseases i) Infectious diseases j) Miscellaneous undiagnosed conditions k) Almost all neonatal animals under two weeks of age 2. The medicine service provides bas ic assessment of cardiology ca ses and requests an in-hospital consult from the car diology service for echocardiog raphy. The medicine service can perform procedures including resting ECG, exercisin g or long duration ECG, and conversion of atrial fibrillation. 3. The medicine service commonly pro vides assessment and managemen t of ophthalmology cases. Where necessary, we can request an in-hosp ital consult from Dr. Maxwell, a practicing veteri nary ophthalmologist currently located in Corvallis. II. Procedures and Policies of Medicine Service A. Attendance and duty 1. Students are expected to be present and properly attired on all weekdays from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. or until case work is complete. Earlier atten dance is frequently required to ensure cases are appropriately assessed before hosp ital receiving commences. Appropriate footwear is essential and students shoul d wear coveralls. Sleeveless shirts and baseba ll caps are not appropriate. Fingernails should be clipped short and jewelry removed. False nails ar e not acceptable on this rotation. You should be prepared to perform a per re ctum examination on any day, and nails that are not clipped will result in you being unable to take part in this exercise. Clothing and personal appearance are not only important for the impressi on we have on our clients, but also for safely per forming procedures on client an d teaching animals as well as avoiding loss of valuable items. 2. Treatments must be completed and charts filled in before 8:00 a .m., unless otherwise instructed. All treatment sheets must be prepared by rounds the night before, and signed by a clinician PRIOR to any treatments being performed. 3. Night care, if necessary for cases requiring close and constant observation such as critically ill foals, may be assigned to students on the servic e on a rotating basis. This is rare. 4. After hours will consist of one student scheduled from 5pm to 1 0pm each night. This may be either a Medicine or Surgery student. The emergency stud ent(s) will relieve the 5-10pm student at 10 pm on w eeknights and at 8 pm on weeken ds. In addition, one primary and one secondary Back -Up student will be scheduled . If needed due to high hospitalized caseloads, or emergency cases presenting to t he clinic, the primary back up student will be called in to help. If further help is n eeded, the second back up will be called in. Back up students are scheduled from 5 pm to 8 am. The large animal hospital is frequently busy afte r hours, and back up students s hould be prepared for the fact that they are often ca lled in. If you have been in the clinic overnight, please 35 notify your clinician the following day. If deemed appropriate and if it will not compromise patient care, you will be sent home for self-care, h owever this cannot happen if clinicians are unaware that you were present overnigh t. B. Equipment to be carried 1. Stethoscope 2. Watch with a second hand or digital equivalent 3. Thermometer 4. Penlight or some other light source 5. Scissors (bandage \u00b1 suture scissors) 6. A cell phone should be carried a fter hours for safety reasons C. Records All records for each case will be completed by the student assi gned. These will be examined by the clinicians and ho use officers. Discharge report s will be examined by the house officers and the clinician in charge, so please ensure th ey are completed with sufficient time prior to discharge for them to be looked at by both parties. D. Relations with clients 1. Students should not discuss diag nosis, treatment, or prognosis with the owner or their representative, unless given permission for this to occur or wi th a house officer or clinician being present. Pleas e do not give clients your person al cell phone number. If a client contacts you through your personal phone, notify your House Officer or Clinician immediately. 2. Do not argue with a clinician about a diagnosis or treatment in front of a client; please discuss it in a private fashion at an appropriate time. 3. Do not take photos of cases without client consent, and do NOT post any photos of any client or their animal on social networking sites or blogs . Consent for photography can be obtained on t he Authorization and Release do cument. The hospital also has signs requesting that clients do not take pho tos within the hospital to protect staff/student/patient c onfidentiality. If a client asks to take your photo and you are not comfortable with this, speak up. If a client takes your photo without permission, politely request they delete it, or speak to a clin ician who will do this for you. 4. Client visitation: Please meet the client promptly in the waiti ng room when you are paged and take them back to thei r patient. Explain that they ne ed to stay with their animal and are not to wander the hospital or look at other anim al's records. You do not have to stay with the client for the entire visit, but be a vailable and walk by them frequently. Notify a clinician of their arrival. If you have co ncerns (i.e. a client visiting patients or looking through treatment sheets of patien ts that are not their own), please notify a clinicia n. Do not discuss another patient - if asked, politely 36 answer that you are unfortunately not allowed to discuss anothe r case due to client and patient confidentiality rules. E. Emergency situations 'Emergency' refers to a situation which demands immediate actio n. These situations are usually unforeseen and, unfortuna tely, often come at inconvenie nt times. As veterinarians and veterinary stu dents, it is our obligation to treat emergency situations whenever they arise. With emergency cases, if you are the first person to greet the client, please instruct them to unload their patient and to bring them immediately to the de signated area for that patient's triage. Also, alert a technician and/or clinician of their arrival immediately. If the client indicates it might not be safe to unload the patient due to fractures, aberrant behavior, or neurologic disease, please wait for appropriate as sistance. There is always room for controversy as to what constitutes the true emergency situation. Several broad categories can be classified as true emergencies: 1) severe respiratory compromise; 2) cardiac arrest; 3) massive hemorrhage or trauma; 4) rapid-acting poisons; 5) 6) pen etrating wounds of the thorax or abdomen; 7) acute overwhelming bacteremia or toxemia; 8) massive or compound musculoskeletal i njuries; 9) coma and loss of consciousness; 10) severe GI signs (i.e. colic); 11) co ntinuous seizures; 12) multi- animal involvement. III. Procedures with Each Case If you wish to have a Real Time Assessment (RTA) performed, you MUST notify/request this from the clinician/house officer prior to the case arrival . If this is not done, your request will later be declined. A. New case: Clients must initiate a dmission of patients at the re ception area to complete admission documents/releases, etc. 1. Take a history from the client un der the supervision of a house officer and/or clinician; record on case report form. In emergent situations- take a brief, pertinent history and collect the full history at a later time, or assign a second student to complete the history while you assist with immediate patient tr iage and stabilization. 2. Perform a physical examination u nder the supervision of a house officer and/or clinician; record on physical examination and physical diagnosi s form. 3. Discuss findings; determine a problem list. 4. Discuss each problem in regard to differential diagnosis and pa thophysiology. 5. List differential diagnoses. Keep physical diagnosis form in th e case record. 6. Discuss diagnostic procedures and rule-outs or confirmation tes ts for each differential diagnosis. 7. Perform tests or take samples un der the supervision of the hous e officer and/or clinician. Fill out necessary la boratory or procedure request f orms. 37 8. Discuss possible further action or immediate treatment with the clinician and house officers. 9. Administer treatment under supervision; record on daily progres s notes. 10. When test values are available, d iscuss the meaning and implica tions of each result. 11. Reach primary diagnosis; record. 12. Discuss treatment regimen. 13. Administer treatment. 14. Discuss cost of care and prognosis with clinicians. B. Hospitalized cases 1. Each morning: a) Examine the animal. b) Record temperature, pul se and respiratory rate and perform a fu ll physical examination. (1) Appetite and water consumption (2) Amount and character of manure (3) Any changes in the case, especially related to the problem the animal presented for (4) Other subjective observations for each system (5) Other objective findings for each system (6) Assessment of case (7) Plan for the day's treatment c) Administer medication. Record any supplies/pharmaceuticals employed on Daily Progress Chart; and initial. 2. At other times: a) Monitor as predeterm ined in discussion. b) Administer drugs as prescribed by clinician. 3. At discharge: a) Return any medications or supplies for client credit. b) Be sure the animal is cleaned and groomed; and reweigh the anim al. c) Prior to arrival, discuss instructions for owner with clinician . 38 d) Create a document (well in advance of the discharge time) encom passing discharge instructions, or a cas e summary in the event of eutha nasia of a hospitalized patient, for the owner and/or referring veterinari an, which should be reviewed and approved by the clin ician. Ensure reception knows the day and approximate time that the animal will be discharged. e) Give instructions to owner in presence of clinician, or listen to instructions as given by the clinician. f) Reports and discussion with the referring veterinarian will be made by the senior clinician or house officers but s tudents should be involved in these discussions. g) Turn the stall card over and write C/D on it to notify animal a ttendants of departure h) Take the treatment sheets, place in file folder, and take to re ception- let them know animal was discharged. 4. Restraint and handling of patients: a) Most animals admitted to the VTH have good temperaments and can be easily handled. However, good judgment and caution should be used when handling any animal, and proper restraint methods should always be used. T h i s m a y include the use of appropriate sedation. In animals with questi onable temperaments, consult a senior c linician or house officer and n ever handle such animals alone. Never assume cattle are safe to be in a stall wi th - consult with a clinician to decide an appropriate handling plan. This also app lies to unusual species such as camels. Compassion and empathy for the patient' s condition are mandatory! NEVER strike an animal for disciplinary reasons, and be aware of your position relative to theirs in a stall at all times. Label the stall of any patient that has a difficult temperamen t everyone is alerted. Ask for a ssistance before entering these stalls. Do not g et between a mother and its offs pring regardless of species. b) Some animals require special equipment for safe restraint. This equipment can cause injury if not properly us ed, so if not com pletely familia r with it you s hould ask a clinician or caretaker for assistance. Such equipment inc ludes: squeeze chute, hydraulic chu te, tilt tabl e, head gates, bull leads, tra nsporter chute, equine stocks and cross ties, twitch, hog holder, etc. c) When handling adult horses, a ha lter and lead must be used at a ll times. Do not ever tie a horse and never exit the stall (no matter how briefl y) without removing the lead rope, as both situations can result in significant pat ient injury. Also, please ensure that the stall door is completely shut and latche d when exiting the stall (again, no matter how briefly). d) Never assume a foal is halter trai ned, even if it is wearing a halter. Please speak with a technician/clinician regar ding proper handling tips for foals. Please ensure a 'foal handling sheet' is placed on the front of any stall con taining a foal. Foot baths should also be placed in fro nt of all foal stalls and cha nged at least twice daily, more often if they become unclean. 39 IV. . Equipment and Drugs A. All equipment must be cleaned and returned to its proper place after use. B. The student is responsible for cleaning up the treatment area a fter use. 1. Clean up manure, blood and discharge. 2. Used instruments should be retur ned to central services for re- sterilization. 3. Instruments from cold trays should be cleaned up and returned t o the tray. C. Pharmaceuticals and supplies for each case will be checked out of the Pharmacy or from ward stock, depending on the item needed. Ensure that the appro priate paperwork is completed so the owner can be ch arged appropriately i.e. comple te the \"red sheet\" for ward supplies that do not come from cubex or the pharmacy D. At each treatment area there should be: 1. Diagnostic equipment, including sample containers. 2. Diagnostic drugs, including local anesthetics. 3. Sedatives and drugs used for restraint. 4. Emergency treatment drugs. E. General care of the equipment: 1. Within our clinical areas, there is a great deal of specialized medical and surgical equipment. Like all equipment, it is expensive, and yearly cost s for replacement from breakage and abuse continue to grow. When handling equipment, w e suggest that you: a) Handle it as if it were your own (WITH CARE!). b) Clean all soiled equipment before replacing it. If equipment ne eds to be sterilized or ultrasonically cleaned, take it to central services and make sure that it will be returned to correct area. c) Replace all equipment following use. d) Clean and disinfect examination tables, counters, and carts fol lowing use. e) Report defective or broken pieces of equipment to the senior cl inician so that it may be taken to Central Services for repair. f) Please ask a staff member for instructions before attempting to utilize any equipment with which you may not be familiar. g) Place trash in appropriate receptacles, even if it is not your trash. h) Clean up the surrounding area when vacated! Place manure in the appropriate can; hose the floor to ensure that the area is clean and ready for the next client. i) Avoid spilling lubricant or mineral oil on the floor as it make s the floor slick and 40 V. Rounds dangerous for horses and humans; clean up immediately if a spil l occurs. A. Combined rounds (transfer rounds) will be held on certain days with students from the surgery and medicine services, usually to address emergency cas es that have arrived out of hours and which need to be assigned to another service. Stud ents assigned to each case should be prepared to disc uss them briefly and succinctly. Any daily changes in the case should receive particular emphasis. B. Other mornings, or following combined rounds, the medicine serv ice will hold their own rounds with a more in-depth discussion of their cases. C. Necropsy rounds are on Wednesdays at 8:30 a.m. for one hour and will include discussions of the previous week' s necropsies. Necropsy rounds will be followed by medicine rounds. D. Senior papers are on Thursdays at 8:00 am for one hour and incl ude in depth topics that are researched and prepared by your peers. Senior papers will b e followed by medicine rounds. E. 'Grand rounds' are held each Friday morning at 8.30 am in which one or more interesting cases are presented by each active service and an i n-depth discussion and/or clinicopathological conference is held. Discussion with clinici ans/house officers regarding what might be an appropriate case or topic to present is advised. There must be a minimum of two students presenting each week. DO NOT wait unt il the final weeks of rotation to sign up as students on two week rotations will need these times. VI. Instruction In Addition To Casework A. Discussions will be held in all blocks at the discretion of the clinicians and based on the students' request and time. Feel free to ask if you have a part icular topic you would like to learn about, every effort w ill be made to accommodate this. B. Students should perform the pro cedures on the general procedure s list and mark the date and place they were completed. VII. Non-case Related Time will be Spent in a Productive, Educationa l Manner A. Complete procedures required for graduation. B. Special short seminars with clinicians on selected problems. C. Practice examination skills and common procedures on normal ani mals. D. Review cases on other services, i.e., surgery, theriogenology. E. Observe necropsy of cases or pathology rounds. F. Auto-tutorial programs in the library. G. Library study- notify clinicians of your whereabouts if you int end to go to the library H. Special assignments may be made if necessary. Inform your clini cian of what you are doing 41 VIII. Preparation Review of common medical conditions in large animals and their treatment prior to this rotation is highly recommended. Knowledge of the principles of fluid th erapy and antimicrobial use is critical. Throughout your rotati on you can expect to be constan tly questioned regarding large animal medicine and physiology, es pecially relevant to a case y ou are managing. Therefore additional or review reading during your rotation is strongly r ecommended. A student library containing relevant internal medicine texts is located in the c omputer room to provide you ready access to applicable texts. Texts must not be removed from that room. Large animal medicine notes and lecture slides are available on the student share dri ve (T drive) in folder named \"Clinical Course Handouts\". ADDENDUMS How to write a SOAP for LA Medicine S (Subjective): On day 1: You write your SOAP to cover the intake. This is wher e you write your history on the patient. On subsequent days: TAKE HISTORY O UT! The same information does not need to be revisited m ultiple days in a row. Now you w rite your subjective thoughts on the patient (attitude, appetite, behavior, etc) and how the pat ient progressed overnight. Also include here how much manure was produced and how much water wa s consumed (in liters) over the previous 24 hours. O (Objective): This is where you write all your physical examination data. Ple ase divide it into separate systems categories as follows: VITAL SIGNS: the significant re sults of any diagnostics that have been performed that morning: CBC/chemistry: PCV/TP: Venous blood gas: A (Assessment): This is where you can provide a 4-5 (or more if needed) sentenc e paragraph (NO lists) on your assessment of h ow the patient is progressing today. You can describe laboratory results and how they have improved or declined and h ow they relate to patient progress to demonstrate your und erstanding of disease processes and what the important concerns are AT THIS POINT IN TIME. 42 P (Plan): This is where you write the pla n for the day. Again, things sho uld be written in lists in a sensible manner. Usually as follows: MONITORING: 1. PE q X hours 2. Any additional monitoring MEDICATIONS : (list in ORDER: IV, IM, SQ, PO, Topical) 1. Drug A (concentration): dose (in mg/kg), frequency, route 2. Drug B (concentration): dose (in mg/kg), frequency, route DIAGNOSTICS: 1. Test A 2. Test B THERAPIES/TREATMENTS/PROCEDURES: 1. Ultrasound A 2. Flush B, etc ADDENDUM: This is written at the end of the day. This is where you discus s the results of any tests that come back AFTER the 8 am SOAP and any significant occurrences that h ave happened throughout the current day. How to write a discharge statement for LA Medicine Complete the listed sections below as instructed. If animals ar e deceased or euthanized, the words 'Discharge Statement' at the top of the template document should be replaced with 'Case Summary' Chief Complaint: Write the main complaint the animal is presenting for according to the client, e.g. 'Irregular cardiac rhythm' or 'acute colic' History: Describe the signalment of the animal in question (name, age, s pecies, breed) and the circumstances about why they presented. Prior information from referring veterinarians such as their examination or diagnostic findings, any medications given by the client or vet and other specifics about the current condition should be written here. Y ou can also report the status of other animals on the property and the current diet and manageme nt conditions for this patient. Physical Findings: Describe the initial assessment - attitude, body condition scor e and weight if available, vital signs, relevant normal findings of examination (heart and lung sounds, GI sounds, digital pulses etc.) and any ab normalities on examination. Diagnostic Tests: These are usually best listed in order of occurrence. We do not want long lists of terms and numbers that client s will not recognize or underst and. For example, indicate that 'a complete blood count was performed, and changes were identified including a high fibrinogen 43 (an inflammatory protein) and a high neutrophil (white cell) co unt, consistent with chronic inflammation or infection'. Write only clinically significant findings of laboratory work and diagnostic procedures and attribute the meaning to them in a manner that the client c an understand. Diagnosis: List one or more final diagnoses that were achieved during the visit and indicate if the problem was resolved. e.g 'A cute colic, resolved with medic al management' Case Assessment : Do not reiterate the entire hi story. Restate why the animal p resented and the major findings of the examinat ion and diagnostic procedures tha t culminated in the specific diagnosis. Then describe how the case was managed including wha t treatments were given and why (details such as doses are u sually excluded). Then summariz e how the animal responded to treatments and if the problems resolved or are continuing at th is time. A segment educating the owner about specific disease conditions, su ch as recurrent airw ay obstruction, pigeon fever, colic or other disorders and methods of preventing them is usually re levant to finish up the case summary. Treatment Recommendations: individually list ALL medications that the animal is to receive at home, including dose (in tabl ets or mls), route and frequenc y of administration, and how long the medications are to be given f or. Also indicate possible sid e effects that the owner should monitor for in this section. Dietary and exercise recommendations can also be made in this s ection, as can recommendations for quarantine. Follow up: indicate if re-evaluation is needed by OSU or the owner's veter inarian, and what specific tests or procedures are needed and approximately when they should be scheduled. Also instruct the client to call with any questions or concerns. If results are not expected to be available for some tests or procedures at the time of writing, indicate that they will be transmitted at some point when they are available. Finish by thanking them for bri nging their animal into the hosp ital, express sympathy if their animal was euthanized or deceased, and instruct them to call wi th any questions or concerns. 44 VMC 734 & VMC 754 Clinical Surgery I and II Guidelines and Procedures Course Coordinator: Dr. Stacy Semevolos Course Instructors: Dr. Jill Parker, Dr. Katja Zellmer, Dr. Mic hael Huber, Dr. Troy Holder, Dr. Kirsty Husby Introduction The clinical surgery block will expose the student to large ani mal surgical problems and procedures -- both routine and ad vanced. A variety of clinical cases will be seen in this block. The surgery section also assumes primary responsibility for see ing lameness cases, athletic injuries of all types, some medicine cases, a variety of post-s urgical medical problems, diagnostic work-ups, and consulta tions on the majority of clini cal cases admitted to the VTH. The lecture and laboratory instruction that you have received w ill now be seen in practice. Remember that the practice of s urgery is not only \"cutting and suturing\" -- first a proper diagnosis must be made and suitab le treatment must be considere d. The actual surgical procedure is often the easiest s tep in the treatment sequence. Post-operative care often determines the outcome of a case and must be rigorously attende d to. Orientation will commence at 8:00 a.m. the first morning of eac h block -- meet at Hospital Reception. The following are som e guidelines and procedures to help you understand how the surgery section operates. Not a ll points are covered; remember that when in doubt -- ask! Objectives Exposure to clinical cases will be used to develop clinical dia gnostic abilities, decision making processes, and technical skills based on the student's didactic and laboratory training in large animal surgery. The student will be expected to review surgical anatomy, surgical procedures and diagnostic methods for the specific clinical cases encounte red. Participation in clinical rounds will be used to develop dialogues among clinicians and s tudents regarding clinical decision making, treatment opt ions, prognosis a nd client costs of treatment, among other topics. Maintenance of complete case records by the student will be emp hasized by perio dic reviews of surgery reports and case record entries by faculty and other cl inical staff. Technical skills such as administration, selection and do sing of medications, bandaging, placement of intravenous catheter diagnostic methods (suc h as nerve blocks) and other pr ocedures will be supervised by the clinical and technical staff at levels consistent with the student's abilities. Admitting a Case (During Regular Hours) Clients should check in at the Reception desk and fill out nece ssary forms, including the Client Information Form. When the chart is ready, you will be called t o see the case. The next step is recording the medical history and performing the physical exam. The appropriate physical examination form should be filled out (i.e., Lameness Examinati on, Colic Examination, General Physical Examination , etc.). Typically, you will then discuss t he history and physical exam findings with the clinician, resident, and/or clinical fellow, followed by your diagnostic plan. 45 The diagnostic plan will become e vident as the examination prog resses (e.g., if a lameness -- nerve blocks and/or radiographs will be considered; if an elect ive surgery case -- hospital admission and pre-operative work-up will be required). Pre-Operative Work-Up In most cases, elective procedures will be identified and surge ry scheduled for the following day. Filling out the pre-anesthesia checklist form will aid you in p reparing the case for surgery. All elective cases going to surgery must have: 1. A CBC and musculoskeletal profile submitted. Some clinicians pr efer the complete large animal profile, or only PVC/TS depending on the case--so ask. 2. A tetanus toxoid booster (if >6mo nths since last booster-ask cl inician). 3. Weight recorded. 4. A general physical examination completed. 5. Shoes removed? Ask clinician. 6. The surgical site clipped and some preparation. Ask clinician. 7. Been groomed. 8. Held off feed usually beginning m idnight the night before. Ask clinician. 9. Scheduled for surgery using a su rgery request form turned into Shawn Davis. 10. Anesthesia request turned in (Vet Hosp). 11. Order pre-operative medications (ask clinician)-may include ant ibiotics, anti- inflammatories, etc. Some cases will require a bath, bandaging to reduce edema, spec ial diets, etc. Food animals will be held off feed and water up to 24 hours or more while most ho rses are held off feed for 12 hours prior to surgery. Suckling animals are not held off feed except in special situations. It is your responsibility to ask the clinician about any questi ons regarding the pre-operative work-up. Surgery The scheduled surgery time is when the patient should be walked into the induction stall. Frequently, this requires that the case be in the final prepara tory stages for 30 to 60 minutes. Horses are led outside the induction area, cattle are readied i n their pen, the transporter, or the surgery chute. Prior to surgery a horse must have: 1. Its mouth rinsed. 2. Its tail wrapped. 3. Its feet picked out and scrubbed with a brush to remove all mat erial. 4. A final grooming prior to mov ing to the induction stall. 46 Cases being induced in Surgery Room 1 (with the tilt table) wil l need a tail rope and shipping boots applied. These will be ava ilable in the induction stall. During this final preparation ti me, it is convenient and expedi ent to be dressed in your surgical scrub suit. The scrubs are available in the surgery locker room s; the student color is blue. You must wear coveralls over the scrubs when wearing them anywhere other than the surgery suite. If your scrubs are soiled, you will not be allowed to enter the surgery area. Keep the scrubs clean for surgery. Access to the surgery suite is th rough induction stalls (with a case only) or past the locker area on the south side of the surgical suite. Whenever entering this area, you must wear proper attire \u2014 this means clean shoes and clean scrubs. Entry to an operatin g room is permitted only with shoe covers, cap, mask, and scru bs. These items are available i n the surgery suite ante-room or laid out in the induction stall for the student leading in a pa tient. Orientation to operating room p rocedures and responsibilities w ill be conducted the first day of the block. Students attending a surgical case must be conversan t with the diagnosis, approach to be utilized and associated anatom y, alternative techniques, complications to be expected, patien t after-care, and approxi mate cost for the procedure. You will be expected to utilize your knowledge, textbooks, and current literature to learn as much a bout each procedure as possible. You will also be expected to use and develop your hands-on surg ical skills under the surgeon's supervision. Recovery from anesthesia is the responsibility of the student a nesthetist, anesthesiologist, and surgery team. No animal is ever to be left unattended until it can stand and walk steadily on its own. A patient is returned to the stall only after the surgeon or anesthesiologist determines that it is safe to do so. Food is withhe ld for 1-2 hours post-recovery to prevent esophageal obstruction. The student surgeon is responsible for filling out and placing in the surgeon's or resident's mailbox a completed surgery repor t within 24 hours. The procedu re should be described in a concise, yet complete, style. It ems to include: position (i.e., lateral recumbencey), type of tourniquet (if used), incision site, approach, findings at the surgical site (including size of mass, condition of tissues, etc.,) des cription of implants, closure b y layers (suture materials and pattern). The resident or surge on will cr itique and approve/rej ect your report. Post-Operative Care All instructions for case care are the responsibility of the su rgeon. Any changes in treatment will also be approved and recorded in the case record. Prior to discharge of a patient, the animal must be presentably groomed, and the case record must be completed with explicit discharge instructions, bill, report to the referring veterinarian, and discharge medications. Records and Forms The case record is a medical and legal document; and it is an i ntegral part of your learning experience, a follow-up necessity, and a research tool. All ent ries should be neat, succinct, and signed. Refer to the case record for any changes in therapy or diagnostic plan by the clinician. The case record can become burdens ome if you don' t keep up with the paperwork on a regular basis. Daily SOAPs of cases shoul d be completed before rounds a re scheduled to begin (by 8am). 47 Charges must be made for all supplies not charged through the P harmacy and for professional services. The number of forms we use may at first seem overwhel ming, but they are necessary for cataloging diagnostic, ther apeutic, and progress informatio n on each case. They also serve to organize and record the charges g enerated. You should be aware of (and discuss with the clinician) all charges \u2014 this will be of great assistance to yo u in practice and will make you aware of the cost of supplies, d rugs, and daily care of patient s. Surgery Rounds Surgery rounds are held as scheduled by the clinician-in-charge ; some rounds are in combination with the medicine service. In addition, surgery, medicine and c linical services students will attend pathology rounds one morning (currently Wednesday) each week. Routine treatments must be done and recorded by 8: 30 a.m., before rounds. You are expected to be prepared to present and discuss cases assign ed to you. The following are to be included in the case presentation: signalment (breed, age, sex), presenting complain t, history, diagnostic procedures and work-up, diagnosis, treatment and/or surgery, progress and outcome, including fees/costs. More detailed discussions will take place with new cases. Comme nts on daily case progress should highlight any changes since previous rounds. Grand round s presentations will be held on Fridays from 8:30-9:30am to expos e all students and clinicians to cases of special interest. The Inevitable List of Do's and Don'ts 1. Clinicians or technicians will supervise intravenous injections , bandage changes, passage of a nasogastric tube, or other non-routine treatments. As your technical skills improve, less direct supervision of the se functions will be necessary. 2. Rectal examinations are to be performed only when directed and supervised by a clinician. 3. Be careful around horses \u2014 most will stand quietly for routine procedures such as the insertion of a rectal thermometer, but some will object violent ly. Always work in pairs (or seek the aid of one of the technicians) when giving injecti ons or working on an uncooperative animal. 4. If you have any questions regarding a case, reach the clinician in charge of the case or, if unable, contact the emergency duty clinician. 5. The job is never done until everything is cleaned up and the pa perwork is done. Remember if you don't complete your paperwork in a timely manne r, it will be redirected to you. We all like to go home at the end of the day. However, due to the nature of our profession, this is not always po ssible. Students should be pre pared to work after-hours on any given day. 6. We are working with the public. It is the animal owner, not the animal, who pays the bills, gives us praise, or voices their disfavor if things don' t go right. Reserve controversial comments to private discussion with the clinician and the rest of the section. Owners have a right to privacy regarding the condition their an imal is in. What is said on rounds and in communication with the client and referring veter inarian is to be moderated by the attending clinician. 48 Emergency Duty and Weekend Treatments Emergency duty is part of the surgery rotation for both Surgery I and II students. After hours duties are scheduled by the LA technician supervisor (Alisa Lee per). These duties include treatment shifts, emergency duty and backup duty. Please refer to the Large Animal Clinic After-Hours section of this hand book for more details. Weekend rounds are held at a time set by the clinician on duty (usually 8:30 or 9:00 a.m.). The surgery service generally has a large caseload, hence we request that all students on the service com e in and do morning treatments. With the approval of the clinicia n in charge, students on the s urgery rotation can arrange to care for each other's cases on weekend if necessary. Additional Training As time allows, informal laboratory periods for additional trai ning on nerve block techniques and other diagnostic procedures will be provided. \"Mini-seminars\" w ill, at times, be conducted to discuss areas of students' interests. Evaluation and Grades A Surgery Block Evaluation form (see appendix on-line) with con structive comments will be used to formulate an A through F grade. The following scale wil l be used for these grades: A F <70 Students should expect one or more unannounced written or oral examinations covering their clinical block instruction. All active clinicians on the servic e participate in the final course evaluation. Our Teaching Hospital requires a continuous flow of suitable ca ses to achieve its functions. To maintain this, we need the cooperation and confidence of referr ing veterinarians and animal owners. This involves attention to every detail. Sometimes the most insignificant detail, left undone, will result in the loss of a client or referral. As a s ervice profession, we are required to be concerned with animal owner's problems, and to maintain a pr ofessional and polite approach to these problems and their solutions. 49 VMC 735 and VMC 755 Rural Veterinary Practice I and II Course Coordinator: Dr. Jorge Vanegas Course Instructors Dr. Jacob Mecham, Dr. Joe Klopfenstein Objectives It is the objective of the Rural Veterinary Practice (RVP) bloc k to provide instruction and clinical experience in food animal and equine general practice, including herd health management and production. It w ill also provide the senior vete rinary students instruction and clinical experience in large and small animal Theriogenology. While most of this experience will take place on the farm, some cases will be handled at the hospital, especially small animal theriogenology related cases. Guidelines and Procedures Attendance : Since instruction is largely dic tated by case material availabl e, attendance is mandatory. There are legitimate reasons for being absent, and these will be eval uated on an individual case basis in accordance with the STUDENT MANUAL . When possible, a REQUEST TO BE ABSENT form should be submitted to the dean's office 6 weeks prior to a planned absence. An unexcused absence is grounds for receiving a grade of INCOMPLETE for the block. Smoking is prohibited while working in the client's housing facilities and in the amb ulatory vehicle. Appointments : 1. The Rural Veterinary Service DOES NOT USE Vet Hosp to set up re gular appointments. Visits are scheduled using an RVP Outlook calendar. Appointment s are identified in the Outlook calendar with a different color category for each of th e sections of the service (Food Animal: green, Equine: blue and Theriogenology: red). Our daily schedule is available in any of the computers in the RVP office. Clinicians and VTH receptionist will try to update the calendar as reg ularly as possible with inform ation about the planned farm calls so the students can prepare ahead of time on the dif ferent procedures that may be performed, as well as necessary supplies and equipment. 2. RVP appointments gener ally occur during the same hours as the h ospital operations, i.e., 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Monday thr ough Friday, but patient care, records management, etc. may require additional time before and after regular busin ess hours, including weekends. Promptness for farm calls is important, and failure t o be available on time may result in students being le ft behind and an unfavorable eva luation. 3. Students are also responsible fo r restocking the truck after ea ch call to ensure that appropriate supplies and equipment are available for the next c all and during emergency hours (truck should be restocked before leaving at the end of t he day). 50 Dress Code & Equipment: Students must supply their own coveralls, boots, stethoscope an d thermometer. Coveralls required for hospital assignments are also appropriate for fiel d calls. Boots are mandatory and must be of a material that is easily cleaned and disinfected af ter each call (usually at the client's facility). An extra pair of clean coveralls should be immediate ly accessible, as they are frequently soiled while working and many days we visit differen t farms during the same trip. We rely on the students having their basic tools with them at a ll times during the rotation. Emergency Duty: 1. RVP provides emergency service at any time of the day; thus the schedule posted on the calendar may change on short noti ce and several times throughou t a day . Therefore, students are encouraged to bring a packaged lunch to eat in bet ween farm calls (in the truck) as we may be unable to return to the VTH until the end o f the day. Some days may be filled with lots of calls and others may be slow, we don't h ave much control about that, although we try to even out the load throughout the week. 2. RVP has an emergency service that allows clients to be served 2 4/7. After-hours and weekend calls are rotated among c linicians. Both RVP I and II s tudents will be assigned to be available for emergency du ty on a similar rotating basis. Students assigned to emergency duty are required to be readily available while on du ty, to carry the student emergency cell phone to be located and able to arrive at the ho spital within 20 minutes of being contacted by the emergency clinician. Client Communications: While on the service, certain basic rules of conduct are expect ed from the students: respect to clinicians, staff, fellow students and clients. This rotation i s an excellent opportunity to test your skills with supervision by a faculty member. Own your cases but do not make diagnoses or recommendations to the client with out the clinicia n's prior app roval. Discussion of a case is always encouraged, however argum ents or voicing strong disagree ment with the clinician in front of the client are unacceptable. There is always time for further discussion later. Avoid making negative comments about a nything but especially manageme nt procedures, facilities, conformation, etc., in the presence of the client. Hospitalized Patients: The students are responsible for the patient records, medicatio ns, etc., as with any other hospitalized patient (i.e. LA surgery or LA medicine blocks). T reatments and patient record entries must be accomplished prior to 8:00 a.m. each day. Rounds : Attendance at hospital rounds will be encouraged whenever the c aseload permits. Since much of the farm work is scheduled first thing in the morning, rounds o r discussion periods in RVP will usually be held in the truck duri ng trips to farms. However, yo u need to be aware that you are being evaluated constantly on your knowledge, technical skills and deportment. You can be questioned on any procedure and any subject you are supposed to know at any time during your 51 interaction with the clinicians. Grading : At the conclusion of the block, the students will receive a let ter grade. This grade will be determined by discipline knowle dge, technical ability, deportme nt, service responsibilities, attendance and an exam. There is a multiple-choice question exa m similar in format and content to past NAVLE questions that will comprise 10% of the final gra de for the block. The exam will be made available by our technici an (Betsy Snyder), and needs t o be completed by 8.00 a.m. of the Monday following the block. 52 VMC 729 Clinical Theriogenology Guidelines and Procedures Course Coordinator: Dr. Charles Estill Course Instructors: Dr. William Whitler Course Objectives Objectives for this course are to provide instruction and hands -on experience in basic and advanced reproductive procedures in our main domestic species, including the dog, cat, horse, cow, sheep, goat, camelid and pi g. Procedures and discussions i nclude reproductive physiology, breeding management, breeding soundness examination, inseminati on timing and techniques, embryo transfer, in vitro fertilization, semen collection, eval uation, and and freezing, assisted breedings, pregnancy diagnosis in fertility management, diagnosi s, treatment and prevention of periparturient disorders, and dystocia. Specialized laboratory and imaging techniques include colletion and interpretation of vaginal cytology samples, endoc rine testing, microscopic and computer-assisted semen evaluation, processing and freezing of semen, ultrasonography of the male and female reproductive tracts, vaginoscopy, and hysterosc opy. Description of course This course will be a one-week core rotation for 4th year professional veterinary students. Students will be assigned to clin ical cases under the supervisi on of staff Theriogenologists, and participate in routine veterinary procedures including physical exams, history taking, and at least some of the reproductive procedures listed above. They will add itionally be required to read supplemental material and presen t case and topic presentations. Every student will make a formal rounds presentation (30 min) to other students and faculty at l east once during the course. Emergency coverage will be shared with students on the Rural Ve terinary Practice rotation. Learning Outcomes Explain the normal estrous cycle of a variety of domestic speci es.

CVM General Laboratory Protocols 1. Familiarize yourself with the lo cation of emergency exits, fire extinguishers, fire alarm pull stations and first aid kits a nd emergency assembly points. a. If the fire alarms sound when you are in lab, leave the area im mediately and proceed towards the nearest emergency exit; go to the assigned assembly area and check in with your instructor or other designated assembly leader. b. If fire starts unexpectedly in your lab, immediately contact the instructor . i. If you have been trained to use an extinguisher, you may attemp t to put out the fire as long as it does not place you in da nger of being trapped in a b urning area. Stay between the fire and the exit at all times. ii. When using a fire extinguisher, aim for the base of the fire an d sweep the extinguisher back and forth until the fire is out. c. If the room fills with smoke, drop to the floor and quickly cra wl to safety. If the fire is not put out quickly, leave the ar ea and pull an alarm station o r call 911 on the way out. 2. Smoking, eating and drinking are NOT PERMITTED under any circumstances in the laboratory or in any areas where animals are housed or examined . a. Many of the chemical reagents used in the lab are flammable, to xic and/or carcinogenic substances. b. Animals may be shedding zoonotic pathogens. c. Storage of food or drink for huma n consumption in laboratories or animal holding and treatment areas is not allowed. d. Empty coffee cups, water bottles, glasses or soda cans are also prohibited. e. Contact with your mouth and eyes should be avoided. Leave the l aboratory to adjust contact lenses or apply makeup or lip balm. 3. Laboratory attire includes a lab c oat or coveralls, close-toe s hoes, safety glasses, and gloves. Wear your lab coat, coveralls or other protective outerwear (as appropriate for the lab) at all times when you are in lab or ha ndling animals. Protective outer wear will protect you and your clothing from spilled chemicals, stains, pathogens, or oth er destructive toxic substances. a. Laboratory attire i. Short pants are not recommended, due to the danger of chemical splashes on bare skin. Sandals or other open-toe footwear are not permitted, aga in due to the danger of spilling corrosive substances or infectious materials on bare f eet and risks associated with animal work. ii. Full length laboratory coats with full length sleeves are appro priate for formal laboratories. Appropriate protective outerwear when handling an imals may be lab coats or overalls as determined by the instructor. iii. Remove your protective outerwear when it becomes soiled and alw ays before you leave the lab area. Remove soiled outerwear inside out without touching soiled areas and either discard or sequester ( bag) for transfer to washing f acilities. 54 iv. If you must take potentially soiled outerwear elsewhere for lau ndering, do so only after securing it in a plastic bag to prevent contaminants from leaving the laboratory area on the clothing. Empty the b ag directly into a washing mac hine and launder in soap and hot water. Never wear soiled protective outerwear into public corridors or other public areas. b. Safety glasses i. Wear safety glasses, goggles or other eye protection at all tim es when you are in the lab. Eyes are vulnerable to mech anical, infectious and chemical damage. These glasses will protect your eyes from splashe s or splatters of ch emicals and infectious materials, as well as many physical hazards. ii. Safety glasses must provid e side-splash protection, iii. Individuals that wear prescripti on glasses will need to obtain safety glasses that fit over prescription glasses or obtain prescription safety glasses . c. Nose and mouth protection i. Nose and mouth protection may also necessary if splashes are li kely. A surgical type mask is appropriate for preven ting contact with the nose or mou th. You will be informed by your instructor if this is required d. Gloves i. Wear gloves when handling hazardous chemicals, live cultures or vaccines, animal secretions, excretions or other potentially infectious material s, contacting potentially contaminated surfaces or equipment, and when cleaning or disinf ecting surfaces or equipment. ii. Wear gloves for any invasive pro cedures such as necropsy or sur gery, or when touching non-intact skin or mucous membranes. iii. Gloves must be removed before tou ching \"clean\" surfaces like re frigerator or incubator handles, doorknobs, and faucets. Gloves must be remov ed before leaving the lab work area, and should be removed inside out and placed into appropriate trash receptacles. iv. Always wash your hands after removing gloves. e. Hair i. Students with long hair should tie it back or in some way bundl e it, so that it does not interfere with work or contaminate the work area. 4. Keep your work area clean and organized while you are working. a. Wipe down the bench tops or other work areas with disinfectant or cleaner before and after each lab exercise to ensure a clean work space. Do not as sume that the person who used the area before you cleaned it effectively when they were finished. b. Other required cleanup of lab work areas will be explained by y our instructor. Keep equipment and labware clean and secured when not in use. c. Some instruments are delicate and must be handled carefully and properly cleaned after each use. Your instructor will demonstrate and/or instruct you regarding the proper use and care of any equipment or supp lies to be used during lab exe rcises. d. Coats, books and other items must be stored in assigned areas w hile laboratory activities are in progress. This is to protect these items from spills, sp lashes or other mishaps as well as to help maintain a tidy work space. e. Some experiments may require the u se of open flames. Pay close attention when using 55 open flames in the lab. i. Be very aware of the proximity o f flammable substances, and nev er allow them to contact the flames. Labs often will use flammable solvents, suc h as alcohol used in staining procedures. ii. Never use flammable chemicals when flames are present. Not all flammable substances are lab solvents (e.g ., hair; see 3.e. above). Pay c lose attention to what items are hot. Burns can occur wh en students grab ring stands, beakers or other items which have been heated and not all owed to sufficiently cool. To ngs, hot pads, and other devices are available for manipulating hot items as neede d. iii. Never leave an experiment unattended while it is heating. 5. Report any accident, no matter how minor, to your instructor at once . 6. Follow proper procedures for the disposal of liquid and solid w astes. Your instructor will advise you of the proper method of disposal of experimental was tes and materials for your laboratory. a. Only paper may be discarded into the \" regular trash .\" All used materials with a medical appearance and all infectious or potentially infectious wastes must be discarded into the biohazard trash. This trash is decontaminated by autoclaving be fore being discarded or is incinerated. b. Chemical waste i. Some chemical wastes must be collected in specific containers f or proper disposal. Your instructor will tell you when this is necessary. ii. Read the labels on chemical reagent bottles, medications or vac cines carefully: make sure you have the correct subst ance before you begin to weigh, pour, pipette or withdraw. Help keep reagents pure by not cross-contaminating th em with dirty instruments or needles. Scoops and spatulas should be carefully cleaned in-between each use. iii. Hazardous volatile chemicals shou ld be handled in a chemical fu me hood. iv. Antineoplastic drugs and other particulate hazardous chemicals should be handled in a Class II Biological Safety Cabinet. c. Microbial waste i. Microbial cultures are disposed by autoclaving or incineration. Hard sided waste receptacles with autoclavable bags are available in the laborat ory. ii. Never pour bacteria or other microorganisms or hazardous chemicals do wn the drain or in the ordinary paper trash. d. Sharps . There is a University policy on the handling of sharps as def ined by the State of Oregon. See http://oregonstate.edu/ehs/sites/default/files/pdf/sharpsmanage mentplan7- 10.pdf . Oregon regulations require that sharps be discarded in commer cially available red or orange, leak-proof, rigid, pu ncture-resistant containers and must have the universal biohazard symbol. Ask your instructor if you are unclear if a p articular item should be disposed of as a sharp. i. Sharps include: a) Syringes removed from their original wrappers 1) No matter what their purpose, nev er throw used syringes into th e regular trash or biohazard non-sharps solid waste receptacles. 56 b) Used microscope slides. c) Used glass culture tubes that have not been decontaminated. d) Used hollow-bore needles or needle - syringe units. e) Suture needles f) Cannulae g) Lancets. h) IV tubing with needles attached. i) Scalpel blades or disposable scalpels. j) Vials containing mod ified live vaccines. ii. DO NOT RECAP NEEDLES BEFORE DISPOSAL into the sharps container. Needles must not be bent or broke n prior to use or disposal. In exceptional circumstances, if re-sheathing CANNOT be avoided, a re-sheathin g/removing device, forceps, hemostat, or a one-handed technique must be used. Unde r no circumstances may a needle be re-sheathed using two hands. iii. Do not fill sharps containers above the manufacturers marked li ne. Check the sharps container before use to ensure it is not overfilled. If the clo sest sharps container is full, contact your instruct or for a new container. a) Never attempt to retrieve any items from a sharps container. b) Never attempt to press down on the sharps or shake the containe r to make more room in the shar ps container. iv. Used sharps must never be carried by hand or on a tray, they mu st be disposed of directly and immediately into a sharps container. v. It is the responsibility of the person(s) using the sharp to di spose of it properly. e. Waste glass (non-sharps). Most laboratory glass not defined as a sharp can be discarded to the landfill in a hard-sided container such as a cardboard b ox. i. Broken beakers, flasks, pipets, test tubes etc. ii. Empty medicine vials (except modified live vaccine vials). f. Never place solid wastes of any type in the sink drains: this will cl og the P-traps under the sinks. 7. In the event of an accident a. Spills of Blood or other Biological Materials i. Notify persons nearby of the presence of a spill, so they can a void the area ii. Immediately leave the vicinity of the spill and notify the instructor . The instructor will oversee cleanup of the spill: iii. When cleaning up a biological spill a) Get out the spill kit (if available) and don a pair of gloves. b) Pick up any broken glass or other solid materials with the tong s or forceps. c) Cover the liquid area with paper towels or other absorbent mate rial. d) Flood the area with bleach or other disinfectant. e) Scrape up the absorbed spill with a dust pan; discard to the bi ohazard bag. f) Disinfect the entire area again, wipe dry with paper towels. g) Discard used paper towels and gloves to the biohazard bag. h) Wash your hands with soap and warm water. iv. If a splash involving live cu ltures, blood, body fluid or secre tions, or liquid chemicals get into your eyes, mouth or nose, go immediately to the eyewas h station and flush 57 for 15 minutes with running water. b. Animal bites i. Serious zoonotic diseases may be present in pet animals, wild a nimals and especially non-human primates . If you are bitten by an animal, promptly wash the bite with soap and warm water, tr eat with antisept ic from a fir st aid kit, and seek medical attention if needed. Notify the instructor . ii. Attempt to determine the vaccination status of the animal. iii. In the State of Oregon, all anim al bites must be reported to th e local Health Department with in one working day. c. Chemical spills i. Notify the instructor. ii. When cleaning up a chemical spill a) Get out the spill kit (if available) and don a pair of gloves. b) Pick up any broken glass or other solid materials with the tong s or forceps. c) Cover the liquid area with paper towels or other absorbent mate rial. d) Scrape up the absorbed spill with a dust pan; discard as instru cted. e) Wash your hands with soap and warm water. iii. If a corrosive liquid like an acid, base or solv ent gets on you r skin, quickly rinse the skin with copious amounts of running water and inform the instructor. d. Needle-stick or other Sharps Accidents; co ntact with non-intact skin i. Inform the instructor. ii. Wash the affected area with soap and hot or warm water. Treat w ith antiseptic from a first aid kit. iii. Serious injuries or those involv ing modified live veterinary va ccines may need medical attention; seek the advice of the Occupational Medicine professionals in Student Health Services. 8. Physical Injuries a. Physical injuries are an occupational hazard of veterinary medi cine. Injuries such as bites, scratches and kicks are common. You can reduce your risk by proper use of restraining devices, protective clothing, footwear (reinforced toes when working with large animals are recommended), and eye protection. b. Your instructor will demonstrate proper handling and approach o f animals. c. Report all injuries to your instructor. Course specific risk assessment There are many risks associated with the practice of veterinary medicine. While it is not possible to identify all the risks associated with a particula r activity, the following are known potential hazards when participating in this course. 1. Known chemical hazards in this c ourse: tranquilizers, povidone iodine, chlorhexidine, isopropyl alcohol, formalin hazards in this courses: radiographs of pregnan t dogs, cats, goats, pigs. 3. Known physical hazards in this course: cattle, horses, alpacas, sheep, goats, dogs, cats, OB wire. 58 VMC 782 Large Animal Emergency Care Guidelines and Procedures Block Objectives Course Coordinator: Dr. Kirsty Husby 1. To provide students additional in struction in emergency and cri tical care of large animal species. 2. To improve patient care and minimize judgmental errors by reduc ing afterhours commitments for block students a nd providing alert, rested stud ent care providers. 3. To reduce the hours which student s in the Large Animal Medicine and Surgery blocks must devote to afterhours live-in duty. Duty and Instructional Schedule Students will spend one week in this course. The block starts o n Sunday night at 8 PM. If there are not concurrent emergencies, you will be met by the house of ficer (resident or clinical fellow) on duty near that time on Sunday so they can familiarize you wi th protocol and orient you to hospitalized cases. After Sunday, weekday shifts be gin at 10PM. The final shift on Saturday begins at 8PM. Each shift ends the following morning after case transfer at rounds (usually by 9:30 am) or by permission of the house officer ( 8 AM) if there are no new case s and there have not been any major changes associated with hospitalized cases. To reiterate, the house officer on duty from the night before will determine student dismissal, and thus it is incumbent on the house officer to arrive between 7:45 and 8:00 am. (In the event the house offic er is not available, then the senior clinician on medicine or surgery can make the decision.) If yo u experience difficulties with this system, please contact Dr. Husby. On weekdays, the emergency student will arrive in time to be ch anged into clinic attire and to be ready to assist the evening technician with 10 PM treatments. D uring the week (Sunday through Thursday nights, and Friday un til Midnight), a n ight technician is often on duty and if permitted directly by the technician, st udents may find some time to rest during their shift. However, please do not rely on rest ing during the rotation. The emergency student shall plan to rest sufficiently so that he or she will be awake and alert for the entire duty period. If a night technician is not available, a b ackup student or technician is called to provide support. The backup student will be allowed to rest preferentially since he or she has clinic duty during the day. On occasion when there is no night technician scheduled, t he emergency student will be up during the entire rotation. Orientation Ideally, all students will have had a previous daytime clinical rotation prior to the emergency care block. Students will be oriented to hospital functions on Sunday at 8pm of each block. The House Officer on duty for Sunday or the Emergency Clinician wil l meet with you for this purpose. 59 It is strongly recommended and it is the student's responsibili ty to attend one block orientation (LA Hospital) prior to the emergency rotation. Students are req uired to read all sections of this manual for additional orientation. Some instructional materials are to be found in a Hospital Manual located in the Communications Area of the LA Hospital. If the student has not had previous clinical duty at OSU prior to the start of the emergen cy care block, that student should advise the house officer or Emer gency Clinician providing orien tation on the first evening (Sunday 8pm). Students should c onsider arriving 1 to 2 hours ea rly to work with experienced students and to receive additional orientation from the night t echnician. Instructors Dr. Husby is the instructor in c harge. House officers (resident s and clinical fellows) will function as the daily i nstructors to interface with students. A dditionally, students will also interact with medicine and surgery clinicians, the on-call anes thesiologist, the evening and night veterinary medical technicians, and all faculty attending morni ng Veterinary Teaching Hospital rounds. Topics to be Covered This rotation is case driven. Consequently, as in practice, stu dents should be prepared for any type of case presentation. All previous veterinary experience, classes, discussions, notes, journals and texts are prerequisites. Remember that logical th inking, knowledge, and experience are the keys to case management of patients with multiple diffe rential diagnoses and long problem lists. Examples include c olic diagnosis, treatment of e ndotoxemia, severe trauma, dehydration, fluid therapy, correction of acid/base imbalances, casting and stabilizing fractures, interpreting laboratory data, performing laboratory tests avail able to the practitioner, oxygen therapy, and neonatal care. Students completing the course should be able to evaluate and s ubsequently develop a treatment plan, calculate fluid therapy needs, insert intravenous cathete rs, administer o xygen, support fractures, and in other ways care for the critically ill emerge ncy patient. Library and Reference Materials The veterinary college library has several texts on critical ca re medicine, and the more common veterinary journals which contain articles on emergency care an d treatment. A hospital library, made up of pertinent texts donated by previous classes, is avai lable on the shelves of the large animal hospital communications ro om. Please leave the books in the hospital. Grades Attendance is required for each night of this block. Any absenc es need to be excused. If a student misses more than two shif ts, regardless of the reason, a recommendation will be made to retake the block. Letter grades are assigned by the instructor (Dr. Husby), with input from the hospital staff. Letter grade (wit h +/- scale) for the course wi ll be based on student performance, records, and attendance. 60 61 Small Animal Services Veterinary Teaching Hospital Guidelines and Procedures Appointments & Admitting The Small Animal Hospital is primarily a referral hospital and appointments are made by the Reception staff according to hospital guidelines. The SA Hospit al is open Mondays through Friday, from 8:00 a.m. until 6:00 p.m. Appointment schedules va ry by service area. Appointment scheduli ng is accomplished via an electronic schedu ling program that can be viewed on line. Printed copies of the receiving schedules are a lso posted daily outside the door to the client services area. All appointment entries, changes a nd cancellations must be performed by the Reception staff. Recheck or recurring appointments are s ometimes scheduled as drop offs between 7:30 and 9:00 a.m. but new clients cannot be admitted b y this mechanism. Clients dropping off a pet must have a scheduled visit through the Rece ption staff and the client must be greeted by the technician or student assigned to the case. During regular business hours, the student will facilitate the hospitalization process by escortin g the client to the SA Reception desk to finalize the admissions process and to leave a deposit based on the content of the written estimate form. Estimates are the responsibility of the service technicians and attending clinician and are derived from the SA fee code schedu le which is available on line. Discharges Hospital discharges are preferably accomplished in the afternoo n from 1:00 to 5:30 p.m. Hospital discharges must be coordinated with the service techni cians and Reception staff. It is the responsibility of individual services to make certain that all hospital charges are entered prior to the time of discharge. No patient should be discharged with out the knowledge and approval of the attending clinician. Patie nts should be clean and approp riately groomed prior to discharge. In addition, all dispensed medica tions should be retrieved, wel l in advance of the discharge time, from the VTH Pharmacy or hospital . A written discharge form, signed by the attending clinician, is required for all patients discharged from the hos pital. A copy of this discharge form should be faxed to the referring veterinarian on the day of dis charge along with any other information as indicated by the supervising clinician. Student involvement in these processes is determined by the partic ular clinical rotation. After Hours Duties The student is referred to the Small Animal After Hours Duties section of this manual for an explanation of their duties outside of business hours. The Smal l Animal Hospital does not provide afterhours emergency services for new clients, but day emergencies are scheduled with the approval of the supervising clinician who is responsible fo r coordinating the visit through the Reception staff. It is sometimes necessary for existing client s to bring their pet for urgent care outside of normal hours. These visits are appropriately schedul ed only with the approval of a supervising clinician. Students assigned to the rotation are re sponsible to assist in the management of such cases as requested and without hesitation. T he Urgent Care service will receive new and existing client emergencies from 9 am to 4 pm M onday through Friday 62 excluding holidays. This servi ce will transfer all cases to an appropriate service by 5 pm that day. More details regarding the Urgent Care service may be found in the VMC 791 & 792 Small Animal Internal medicine section of this manual. Student Involvement Students assigned to a clinical rotation are required to partic ipate in patient admissions, assessment, hospitalization, care and discharge. The exact role of the student may vary depending on service and patient. Students should never operate independently of the supervising clinical faculty mem ber and should never initiate t reatment or a procedure except under the direction of a veterinary technician or attending cli nician. Students are required to take an active role in filling out all required hospital forms and maintenance of the medical record . Detailed information regardi ng these procedures will be provided during the orientation to each service area rotation. All hospitalized patients must have a hospital ID collar with the own er's name and clinic number le gible. The kennel assigned in the hospital should also be clearly identified and tagged with rega rd to feeding and any other special annotations (feeding instructions , special care, etc.) The medi cal record should be placed in the location that corresponds to the animal's cage or run when not in use by other services so it can be located when necessary. The student, technician, intern, res ident and clinical faculty that received the patient are responsible for the animal's care incl uding cage set up, maintenance and cleaning. All animals with intrave nous catheters must be housed in the intensive care unit for continuous monitoring. Clinical Attire and Student Conduct Professional appearance should be maintained at all times. This includes good hygiene and cleanliness. Jeans, t-shirts, tank tops, shorts or open toed sh oes are not permitted in any area of the Veterinary Teaching Hospital where you may interact with th e public. Name badges should be worn at all times during work hours, and a white laboratory coat should be worn. It is important to behave professiona lly to our clients and referring DVMs. Students should be professional in their conduct a nd mindful of how their remarks might be perceived by the client. It is not appropriate to discuss or criticize case management b y a colleague (referring veterinarian) in the presence of the owner. The owner's privacy must also be protected and cases should not be discussed inappropri ately with anyone other than the hospital staff and attending clinician(s). Such discussions are best accomplished during cli nical rounds. Students are referred to the OSU CVM Professional Code of Conduct under CVM Student Policies for more information. Food and drink are only allowed in designated areas of the VTH where animals are NOT handled or housed. Water in closed or capped containers is okay. Attendance: Attendance is mandatory. Please see the Year IV Absence policy in the CVM Student Policies section of the manual. Be punctual. Hours will vary between services so make sure you know what regular and af ter hours duties you have duri ng your rotation. If you are ill, it is your responsibility to contact the supervising clinician and/or technician. IF you are going to be late for or absent from afterhours duties you must call i nto the ICU (541) 737-4825 and speak to an ICU technician or small animal rotating intern. 63 Equipment For all rotations you are require d to bring a st ethoscope, band age scissors, penlight and thermometer. For surgery you sh ould also bring suture scissors Safety Procedures: There are many inherent dangers working with animals particular ly in a hospital environment. Please be m indful at all times of your ow n safety, the safety of others around you and the safety of your patients and clients.

For the purposes of this document, 'veterinary personnel' refers to all personnel that w ork in a veterinary clinic. This includes non-clinical staff, as in many situations these indivi duals may still have periodic direct or indirect contact with patient s and pathogens within a clinic . INTRODUCTION Infection prevention and control strategies are designed to pro tect patients, owners, veterinary personnel and the community. A si gnificant percentage of hospit al-associated infections (HAIs) in veterinary clinics can likely be prevented with proper compl iance to basic, practical infection control practices. A systematic approach to infection preventio n and control requires all veterinary personnel to play an active role in protecting every person and animal associated with the veterinary clinic, patients or veterinary personnel. Veteri nary personnel need to follow infection prevention and control protocols at all times and use critical thinking and problem solving in managing clinical situations. When an infectious disease that potentially poses a risk to oth er animals visiting or housed at the VTH is included on the list of potential differential diagnoses the following steps must be taken. **Communication and diligent hand washing are essential for pr eventing potential transmission within the hospital** GENERAL COMMUNICATION Inform the I NFECTIOUS DISEASE CONTROL OFFICER , SENIOR CLINICIAN (s), H OUSE OFFICER (s), and T ECHNICIAN SUPERVISOR anytime a known or suspect contagious animal enters or is identified in the hospital. GENERAL PRECAUTIONS 1. Because of the potential for disease transmission FOOD IS NOT PERMITTED in the Veterinary Teaching Hospital where animals are examined, treate d, or housed. 65 2. Food storage is NOT ALLOWED in any refrigerator or freezer used for medications, animal samples. Water bottles and coffee cups are not allowed in the VTH or the corridor adjacent to the VTH. 3. All multiple use areas where animals are examined or treated sh ould be cleaned and disinfected immediately after use by personnel responsibl e for the patient irrespective of infectious disease status of the individual animal. 4. Exam rooms must never be left di rty with the intent to return l ater. If the emergency nature of the case does not allow this, request help to ensure the room i s cleaned. 5. Traffic between the SMALL and LARGE animal areas of the hospital as well as entry to the main areas of the College through the VTH should be kept to a m inimum. 6. Students are expected to have a d igital thermometer, stethoscop e, and penlight. USE of THERMOMETER COVERS is MANDATORY 7. It is the responsibility of the PRIMARY CLINICIAN on each po tentially INFECTIOUS DISEASE case to review the B IOSECURITY SOP and to institute containment procedures before admission to the SA VTH. 8. All patients housed in general wards with MULTIPLE -DRUG RESISTANT BACTERIAL infections (e.g., MRSA/MRSI) shou ld be moved to a designated is olation area or discharged immediately and treated as an out patient, following approval by the senior clinician. HANDHYGIENE It is recommended to carry out hand hygiene procedures: 1. Immediately before any direct contact with a patient, 2. Before any clean care or any invasive procedure, 3. Between contaminating care and cl ean care or an invasive proced ure with the same patient, 4. Following the last direct contact with, or care given to a pati ent, 5. After any contact with body fluids, 6. Before putting gloves on for care, 7. Immediately after removing gloves, 8. Before eating food 9. Before and after personal body f unctions, such as using the toi let 66 WEARING OF GLOVES 1. Gloves are ALWAYS to be worn when there is a risk of contact with blood or any ot her product of human of animal orig in, the mucosa or non-intact ski n of a patient, in particular during care with splatter or spl ashing risks (e.g., blood sampl ing, insertion and removal of venous or urinary catheters, etc.) 2. Gloves MUST also be worn during the manipulation of biological sampling tubes, and soiled linen and equipment. They are systematically worn during ANY ca re for which the caregiver's hands have any lesi ons (cuts, wounds, abrasions or dermatosis). 3. Gloves are to be changed BETWEEN any two patients or activities (including those involving the same patient). 4. Gloves should be worn just befor e the contact, care or treatmen t. 5. Gloves should be removed as soon as the care has been completed , and be disposed of before the wearer touches the surroundi ng environment or other animal. 6. Disposable gloves should NOT be washed and reused. MASKS 1. Surgical splash-resistant mask with safety goggles or a full-fa ce visor MUST be worn with cases involving a known or suspected Zoonotic diseases; particu larly when there is a risk of blood or biological fluid splatte ring and/or exposure to microo rganisms that can be communicated by aerosols 2. The mask must always be worn in such a manner as to cover the n ose, chin and mouth, and must be hermetically applied to the face. It must not be reposi tioned or worn around the neck. PROFESSIONAL AND PROTECTIVE OUTERWEAR a. When working the clinical environm ent or whenever there may be contact with an animal, \"street\" clothes should always be covered by protective outerwe ar. Neck ties (except bow ties) should not be worn. b. Jewelry, wrist-bands and watches that interfere with hand washi ng and disinfection should not be worn (simple wedding bands and watches with metal or rub ber straps are acceptable). c. Examples of protective outwear include: LAB , SCRUBS , AND STERILE OR NON- STERILEGOWNS . d. Three options for clothing exist for those working in the small animal clinic in direct contact with animals: a. A white coat worn over regular \"street clothes\". 67 b. A white coat worn over patterned scrubs. c. Scrubs tops and bottoms e. WHITE COATS must be removed when you leave the VTH and cannot be worn in ot her areas of CVM outside the VTH. f. Students must always have a minimum of 2 sets of standard attire available. a. Lab coats should be washed regul arly while on rotation, and esp ecially when changing services. g. Protective outerwear are to be changed daily and whenever they are soiled or a case with a potentially infectious condition is handled (e.g. coughing dog, parvo suspect, open wound). h. They SHOULD NOT be worn OUTSIDE the hospital work environment. Ideally, uniforms should be laundered on site or by a professional laundry servic e. i. A gown or a disposable plastic a pron is used to protect the gar ments whenever: a. There is a risk of splashing or aerosolization of blood or biol ogical fluids b. During the direct care of a patient requiring additional contac t precautions such as handling animals with suspected or confirmed infectious disease s and/or that are housed in isolation. j. DISPOSABLE GOWNS should only be used ONCE and NOT be reused, and reusable fabric gowns should be laundered after each use. k. SCRUBS should NOT BE TAKEN HOME by personnel to be washed, rather they should be washed onsite, with other clinic laundry. a. Ideally, scrubs should be washed at the end of each day and whe never they become visibly soiled. b. A specific set of scrubs should be designated for use during su rgery only c. Designated surgery scrubs should be covered with a lab coat out side of the surgical suite. FOOTWEAR 1. CLOSED TOED FOOTWEAR must be worn at all times to reduce the risk of injury from dropped equipment (e.g. scalpels, needles) , scratches from being steppe d on by dogs, and to protect the feet from contact with potentially infectious substances (e .g. feces, discharges and other body fluids). 2. DESIGNATED FOOTWEAR or DISPOSABLE SHOE COVERS are required in areas where infectious materials are expected to be present on the floor, in order to prevent their sp read to other areas. 68 a. Designated footwear or disposable shoe covers may be required f or patients with infectious diseases that are kept on the floor (e.g. in a large dog run) or that may contaminate the floor around thei r kennel (e.g. an animal with severe diarrhea). b. Such footwear must be removed as the person leaves the contamin ated area, and should be immediately disposed of in the garbage (if disposable ), or left at the entrance of the contaminated area on the \"dirty\" side. FOOTBATHS 1. Footbaths or foot mats are used to decrease (but do not elimina te) microbiological contamination of footwear. 2. For the OSU SAVTH footmats and/or bath will be utilized at mini mum: a. At the entrance of the ISOLATION WARD (174 D) when occupied by animals with infectious diseases. b. At the entrance of the OVERNIGHT STAT LAB to be utilized by personnel from the large animal clinic when bringing samples over to evaluate in t he STAT lab. c. Inside ICU as part of BARRIER -CONTROLLED NURSING PRECAUTIONS for infectious patients assigned to Semi-Isolation. The foot bath will be plac ed at the tape used ot cordon off the barrier nursing are, and will be utilized as the Entry Control Point for entering and leaving the area. VTH OPERATIONS ADMISSION OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE PATIENTS GENERAL PRINCIPLES 1. Avoid bringing aggressive or potentially infectious animals in through the main reception area; place these animals directly in an EXAM RM 6 (172 H) or ISOLATION ROOM (174 D) . 2. Patients with known or suspected infectious diseases should ent er through Entry Control Point 1 ( ECP 1 ) located at the SOUTH end of the main reception area. 3. Animals known to be housed in ISOLATION should enter through the rear entrance of ECP 2 . 4. If they must come through the main entrance, carry the animal o r place it on a gurney so that it can be taken directly into the designated room. PROCEDURE 1. Identified at the time of first contact by phone or receptionist : 69 a. Patients with known or susp ected contagiou s diseases SHOULD NOT be brought into the main SA VTH reception area. These patients should be admitt ed through: i. The side door / ECP 1 (located at the south end of the reception area SEE ATTACHED MAP) and placed directly into EXAM ROOM 6 (172 H), or ii. The I SOLATION ENTRANCE / ECP 2 (located at the REAR of the VTH) where they can be triaged and held in Isolation Rm 174 D until furthe r notice. b. Patients with known or suspected infectious diseases should NOT be allowed to proceed further into the hospital, especially ICU, unless the p atients are in immediate need of stabilization. c. Parvovirus suspects should be tested BEFORE ENTERING THE HOSPITAL if at all possible. All dogs < 1 YR OF AGE , especially those with gastrointestinal signs of vomiting or diarrhea, should be considered as parvo suspects. d. Contact the senior service clinician or Infectious Disease Prog ram Manager to determine if the animal needs to be immediately placed in isola tion or if another type of restriction is warranted. 2. Identified in the EXAMINATION ROOM by the admitting service: a. Leave the animal in the examination room and contact the senior clinician and the technician work leader who will assign cleaning staff to disinf ect the room. b. Place a sign on the room to prevent anyone else from entering. Signs are available in each examination room. c. Do NOT allow the patient to proceed further into the hospital, especia lly ICU, unless the patient requires immediate need of stabilization. 3. Identified AFTER ADMISSION : a. The animal must be transported on a cart, dedicated to that ani mal. b. Contact the senior clinician, the Patient-Service Coordinator, and the technician work leader. 4. If the main reception area has been used for triage of a patien t with a known or suspected contagious disease, it should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfe cted immediately. 5. If moving within the hospital at the time it is determined the animal has a zoonotic infection, either place the animal directly in isolation or if you are uns ure, return the animal to its current cage and contact the tr eating technician assigned to th e patient, the technician supervisor / work leader and/or the senior clinician. ADMITTING ANIMALS from S HELTERS , HUMANE SOCIETIES , and SIMILAR FACILITIES 1. Should be considered HIGH RISK from an infectious disease standpoint. 70 2. All animals from such facilities sh ould be examined immediately upon arrival without coming in contact with other an imals in the waiting/reception a rea. 3. Animals from these facilities shou ld be housed separately from other patients. a. This may involve utilizing FULL ISOLATION in RM 174 D or at least SEMI- ISOLATION in a separate ward; separate area of a ward or leaving empty ca ges between those animals and othe r patients can be used, depending on the degree of separation required for the diseases of primary concern. 4. Animals with clinical signs compatible with an infectious disea se including, but not limited to, fever, oculonasal discharge, coughing/sneezing, diarrhea an d potentially infectious skin conditions SHOULD NOT be admitted for elective procedures. 5. For ELECTIVE PROCEDURES (e.g. spay, neuter), all anim als should be appropriately vaccinated for their age and treated for relevant intestinal pa rasites and ectoparasites. ANY TIME A PATIENT WITH A KNOWN OR SUSPECTED CONTAGIOUS DISEASE IS ADMITTED OR ENTERS THE SA VTH, THE INFECTIOUS DISEASE CONTROL OFFICER MUST BE NOTIFIED . INITIAL EXAMINATION 1. Wear appropriate protective outerwear, and wash hands before an d after examination of individual animals or animal groups (eg, a litter of puppies). 2. Wear facial protection if a zoonotic respiratory tract disease is suspected. Potentially infectious animals will be examined in a designated examination room ( EXAM RM 6) and remain there until diagnostic procedures and treatments have be en performed. 3. At-risk patients (those whose vaccine status, clinical signs or signalment indicate that they may have a contagious pathogen) should be evaluated in EXAM RM 6and enter through the side doors ( ECP 1 ) located at the south end of the reception area. 4. If another examination room is inadvertently used, it should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected and allowed to dry for 24 hours before use. 5. A RECORD LOG should be maintained to annotate when infectious diseases have been admitted into the examination rooms. 6. The Infectious Disease Control Officer shall also be notified t o determine when the examination rooms may be used again for non-infectious animals. OUTPATIENT TREATMENT 1. If the patient requires OUTPATIENT therapy only , this should be performed in the EXAM RM 6 or the contagious patient may be admitted through I SOLATION (ECP 2) and treated in the ISOLATION Ward. 71 2. The patient should NOT be allowed to progress further into the hospital, particularly the ICU. TRANSPORT 1. Patients with known or suspecte d contagious diseases should be moved about the hospital (e.g. to radiology, etc) on a GURNEY . If the patient has a bout of diarrhea or the gurney or on the floor while being transpor ted, someone should immediatel y clean it up and disinfect that area. 2. When moving contagious / zoonotic patients from ICU or Isolatio n to the outside, the appropriate designated routes will be used to minimize contamin ation and spread of disease throughout the hospital (Refer to INFECTIOUS DISEASE PATIENT FLOW MAP). HOUSING 1. OSU SAVTH maintains a dedicated ISOLATION WARD (RM 174D) for caring for and housing animals with potentially contagious infectious diseases thereby reducing the risk of direct or indirect infection of other hospitalized animals or c linic personnel. 2. CAGE RESTRICTION with BARRIER NURSING within a separate ward or a partitioned area of an existing ward may be used in lieu of FULL ISOLATION for select animals. 3. Clinicians will refer to the OSU SAVTH ISOLATION SOP to determine the appropriate level of Isolation required. 4. Changes to the location of housi ng or level of isolation restri ction for any patient deemed to have a known or suspected infectious disease MUST be approved by both the Senior Attending Clinician and the Infectious Disease Control Officer. IDENTIFYING INFECTIOUS DISEASE PATIENTS 1. Each patient with a suspected or known infectious disease will have the appropriate color- coded kennel card placed on their cage / kennel and the appropr iate color identification color attached to them. i. RED KENNEL CARD / ID NECKBAND : Animals with KNOWN highly contagious or zoonotic disease . Red cards should be used for animals in Small Animal ISOLATION (RM 174 D) or Barrier Nursed . ii. YELLOW KENNEL CARD / ID NECKBAND : Animals SUSPECTED to have contagious disease or animals at increased risk for acquiring infectious disease, housed in general hospital population. iii. ORANGE KENNEL CARD / ID NECKBAND : Animals at high risk of developing an infectious disease (Immunocomprom ised) requiring special precau tions such as 72 barrier nursing (e.g., Patients receiving chemotherapy or other immunosuppressive drugs). iv. WHITE KENNEL CARD / ID NECKBAND : Animals with no historical, laboratory, or physical examination evidence of infectious disease. 2. If YELLOW or RED kennel cards are used the suspect agent MUST be marked on the b ack of the card. 3. If an animal should develop an infection of any kind while hosp italized the clinician must complete a SUSPECTED NOSOCOMIAL INFECTION FORM (Appendix 8 in the Infectious Disease Control Manual) and subm it it to any member of the Infe ction Control Committee CLEANING AFTER EXAMINATION 1. Immediately clean and disinfect the examination room, gurney an d any hospital surfaces or equipment contacted by potentially contaminated patient or pers ons (including examination tables and doorknobs). 2. If the examination room cannot be immediately disinfected, then : i. Close off exam room ii. Place a \" DO NOT USE EXAM ROOM , SPECIAL DISINFECTION REQUIRED \" sign iii. Notify SAC TECHNICIAN or PATIENT SERVICE COORDINATOR of the suspected agent and do not use the room until a technician has removed the sign and adequate cleaning/disinfection occurs. DISCHARGE OF CONTAGIOUS PATIENTS 1. ISOLATION - Patients housed in RM 174 D are to be discharged through ECP 2 located at the rear entrance of the VTH. 2. Other patients hospitalized for co ntagious diseases should be d ischarged through either the ISOLATION (ECP 2) or through EXAM ROOM 6 and then ushered out the VTH side access door or ECP 1 (see INFECTIOUS DISEASE FLOW MAP for ECP access routes). INFECTIOUS DISEASE CONTROL - POLICY AND PROCEDURES PATIENT FLOW AND HOSPITAL ZONES IMPORTANCE Control of the passage of infectious and/or contagious organism s from staff to patients and patient to patient is critical to patient care. Many of the pat ients at the OSU SA VTH are critically ill or potentially imm une suppressed, all feasible m easures should be taken by all staff and students to avoid the possibility of nosocomial infection i n hospital patients 73 Some animal patients are presented with organisms that represen t a significant health risk to students and staff handling the animal. Protocols for the handl ing and management of animals with potential zoonoses are described in section 3. HOSPITAL ZONES The OSU VTH may be viewed as containing SIX SPECIFIC ZONES , each of which has requires different approaches to the tran smission and management of infe ctious disease organisms. The six zones include: 1. GENERAL HOSPITAL ZONE - LOW RISK 2. DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING -INTERMEDIATE RISK 3. ONCOLOGY WARD - M EDIUM RISK 4. INTENSIVE CARE UNIT - HIGH RISK 5. ISOLATION WARD - EXTREME RISK 6. STERILE SURGICAL SUITE - NO ACCESS ZONE GENERAL HOSPITAL ZONE 1. Inclusive of the Hospital Reception, the consultation rooms, ge neral treatment area, all corridors, endoscopy suite, cardiology suite, fluoroscopy suite , the dog ward, large dog ward and cat ward represent one zone of the hospital. 2. Animals accommodated in this zone are assumed to be at LOW risk for contracting or transmitting organisms to or from other patients. 3. Animals with immune compromise or immune suppression should NOT be accommodated in these ward areas if feasible. 4. Patients and staff will often transit this zone to other region s of the hospital. Patients with potentially contagious diseases should be moved through this zo ne in a manner and at times that minimize contact with other animals and staff. 5. Animals with open or draining wo unds should be transported thro ugh the general hospital zone area on a gurney whenever possible. Following use to transport an animal with an open or draining wound, the gurney should be cleaned with a quaterna ry ammonium compound disinfectant before use with any other patients 74 DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING 1. Diagnostic Imaging is a core serv ice of the OSU VTH, and as suc h it is inevitable that students, clinicians and staff fr om the Large and Small Animal services will mingle in this area. Diagnostic Imaging should be considered a transitional ar ea for infectious disease control, and viewed as potentially contaminated that carries an INTERMEDIATE RISK. 2. Animals hospitalized in the General Hospital zone may enter the Diagnostic Imaging zone without need for additional precautions. 3. Animals hospitalized in the ICU or Oncology zones requiring dia gnostic imaging should, where possible, be taken to the Diagnostic Imaging zone at the end of the day , when staff and patient movement is at the lowest. 4. The staff of the Diagnostic Imaging zone should receive prior n otice regarding patients that are at risk for infectious complications or contracting nosocom ial disease, to allow suitable disinfection/cleaning of the imaging room to be used. 5. Movement of animals from the Isolation Ward zone to Diagnostic Imaging should be carried out at the end of the day, unle ss urgently required for patient care. 6. The staff of the Diagnostic Imaging zone should receive prior n otice regarding patients that are housed in the Isolation Ward zone to allow suitable disinfe ction/cleaning of the imaging room used before other patient procedures are carried out. ONCOLOGY WARD 1. Animals housed within the oncolog y ward should be considered at MEDIUM risk for immune suppression and contracti ng nosocomial infections. 2. Staff, clinicians and students sh ould minimize entry into the o ncology ward. The oncology ward should only be entered for direct manipulation of patients and the administration of chemotherapeutic drugs . For occupational safety as well as infectious control purpose s, gloves and disposable gowns should be worn while handling anima ls in the oncology ward, these items should be disposed of in the biohazard bins in the oncology ward. 3. Disposable gowns should be disposed of if contaminated with uri ne, feces, blood or chemotherapeutic agent as per the ONCOLOGY SERVICE SOP' S. Disposable gowns from the oncology ward should not be worn into the General Hospital Zone , to minimize potential introduction of infectious organ isms into the oncology ward. 4. Oncology cases will typically be day-stay visits, thus owne r visitation is unlikely. Critically ill oncology cases will be moved to the ICU, where owner visita tion may occur as described 75 INTENSIVE CARE UNIT (ICU) 1. Animals housed in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) are considered to be at HIGH risk of contracting nosocomial infections, due to greater potential for immune suppression in these patients. 2. Students and staff should avoid transiting the ICU area unless it is directly essential to patient management within the ICU. ICU technicians should remain within the ICU area and not assist with patients in the gen eral hospital zone or diagnostic imaging unless th is is critical to patient care. Students and staf f should avoid congregating in t he ICU area. ISOLATION WARD ZONE 1. The Isolation Ward is a single purpose isolation facility for t he hospital care of canine and feline patients with presumed contagious diseases and carries a n EXTREME RISK. 2. Animals housed in the Isolation Ward should be considered a sig nificant potential source of infectious organisms that may affect other patients within the hospital. Great care should be taken to avoid contact between animals in the isolation ward an d animals in the remainder of the hospital. 3. All examinations and, where feas ible, all treatments for animal s hospitalized in the isolation ward should be carried out within this area. An adequate supply of bandaging, intravenous fluid, catheterization and diag nostic sampling materials will b e maintained within this ward. 4. Medications for use on individual patients in the isolation war d should be dispensed prior to entry into the isolation ward environment. Bulk bottles of medi cations should not be transferred to the isolation ward from the general hospital env ironment or from the isolation ward back into the general hospital zone. 5. Patients admitted to the isolation zone should enter the buildi ng via the rear door entrance to avoid contamination of the general hospital environment. 6. Disposable gowns, gloves and shoe covers are provided in the is olation zone; these protective items must be used when treating animals within the Isolation Z one, and must be disposed of in the bins within the isolation ward. 7. Disposable gowns should be disposed of if contaminated with uri ne, feces, or blood. Disposable gowns from the isolation ward should remain within t he isolation zone and must not be worn into the General Ho spital Zone, to minimize potenti al introduction of infectious organisms into the General Hospital Zone area. 8. Owners may visit patients hospita lized in the Isolation Zone at the end of the day . Owners will be provided with and must use suitable protective items su ch as gowns, gloves and shoe 76 covers. Owners of animals in the Isolation Zone must enter and exit the hospital via the rear entrance, and should not be allo wed access to the remainder of the hospital at the end of their visit. Students and/or clinical staff responsible for patients in the Isolation Zone should accompany owners during the visit to ensure compliance. STERILE SURGICAL CORE 1. The sterile corridor area of Surgery is specifically and highly isolated from the remainder of the hospital traffic. Specific protocols for entry to the steri le surgical core are provided in the SURGICAL SERVICE SOP manual. 2. No individual shall enter the sterile corri dor under any circumstances without donning appropriate protective clothing. PASSAGE OF STAFF , STUDENTS AND PATIENTS BETWEEN ZONES 1. Students responsible for the care of patients in the Isolation Zone shall not also be responsible for care of patients within the ICU or Oncology zon es, but may be responsible for care of patients in the General Hospital zone. 2. Students on surgical rotations may be responsible for the care of surgical patients in the ICU, General Hospital or Oncology zones, but shall not be responsibl e for patients hospitalized in the Isolation zone. 3. Wherever possible, students and staff shall minimize movement i nto and between the ICU zone and the General Hospital zone. Movement of staff and students between the isolation zone and the ICU should be avoided . 4. Staff and students exiting the Is olation zone must ensure that they have removed and disposed of all outer garments, shoe covers, leashes etc from t he Isolation zone before entering the general hospital zone treatment areas. Hands shoul d be washed before leaving the Isolation zone. Stethoscopes , thermometers, reflex hammers and all other items used in diagnostic assessment of patients in the Isolation zone should be thoroughly cleaned and swabbed with 70% alcohol before u se on patients in the other ho spital zones. 5. The Isolation zone is visible via windows at the end of the lar ge dog ward and from the adjoining corridor. Quick checks of patient's mental state can be made through these windows without requiring entry into the isolation ward. 6. Students and staff from Large Animal Medical or Surgical servic es shall not enter the Small Animal ICU or Oncology zones wh ile wearing overalls or protecti ve overboots that have been worn in the Large Animal hospital wards. 7. Passage of students and staff between the Large and Small Anima l Hospitals should be minimized. 8. Students and staff from the Small Animal hospital delivering pr escriptions to the hospital pharmacy or diagnostic samples to the Veterinary Diagnostic Lab oratory should travel via 77 the front of the hospital, avoiding passage through the Large A nimal hospital general corridors CLIENT VISITATION FOR PATIENTS WITH INFECTIOUS DISEASE 1. ISOLATION WARD: As a policy, clients should not be allowed to directly handle or enter the ISOLATION WARD when visiting hospitalized patients in RM 174 D. Exception may be made for end-of-life situations. 2. ICU: (Refer to \"I CU VISITATION POLICY \" located under ICU P OLICY section for general guidlines) a. Clients visiting patients in the ICU will exit through the rear entrance of the VTH at (ECP 2 ) in order to minimize the spread of contamination. 3. SEMI-ISOLATION / BARRIER NURSING : Restriction cages are \"off limits\" to visitors. Only personnel immediately concerned with the restricted patient sha ll be allowed entry. Some visitations may occur with proper senior clinician and area sup ervisor approval. 4. All visitations are to be scheduled at END OF THE DAY and will be no longer than 15 minutes in duration. 5. The attending clinician or house officer MUST be present during the visit. 6. Clients will abide by all policies and procedures regarding han dling of infectious disease patients to include use of appropriate hand hygiene, personal p rotective wear, and barrier precautions. ISOLATION PROCEDURES FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASES - SMALL ANIMAL TYPES OFSEGREGATION : LOCATION FULL ISOLATION RM 174 D CONTACT / SEMI-ISOLATION Barrie rNursing / Cage Restriction LIMITED MOVEMENT Minimize movement between kennels & runs; Minimize relocation Clinicians and students will refer to the OSU-VTH I NFECTIOUS DISEASE CONTROL MANUAL for isolation precautions to be taken as per DISEASE -SPECIFIC ISOLATION PROTOCOL TABLES A daily ISOLATION HOSPITALIZATION FEE will be incurred.

IMPORTANT : ICU is for housing and providi ng care for patients that are d eemed critical, immunocompromised, or that need post-operative recovery monitor ing. It is NOT a General Treatment area. Care for patients housed outside the ICU are no t to be brought into ICU for treatments (e.g, bathing, bandag e changes, etc) or diagnostics, unless approved by ICU Technician. D AILY ICU H OSPITALIZATION CHARGES START AT 10 AM. ALL PATIENTS MUST BE DISCHARGED BEFORE 10 AM TO AVOID INCURRING A DAILY ICU HOSPITALIZATION FEE . 80 ADMITTING PATIENTS TO THE ICU 1. Clinicians and students from the PRIMARY ADMITTING SERVICE will maintain primary case management for their patients admitted to the ICU. 2. Whenever possible, the staff in the ICU should be advised at least ONE HOUR prior to admission of a patient into the ICU. a. A student, house officer, or faculty member must round with the ICU technician regarding the case on admission. This includes any animal admit ted following sedation or anesthesia. 3. Upon Admission to the ICU, students from the admitting service MUST complete the ICU STUDENT SET-UP CHECKLIST (BLUE SHEET ). Once complete, the checklist must be signed off by an ICU technician 4. The service admitting the patient is responsible for all patien t set-up (e.g. cage, medications/therapeutics, records, equipment). Set-up includes all patients having: a. All collars and harnesses (not necessary for patient monitoring and treatment) removed b. An I.D. NECKBAND with the Patient / Client Sticker c. An appropriately sized, adequately furnished (pads, mats, towel s, absorbent pads) kennel. Dogs should not be left outsi de of cages or in 'pens' d. A fully COMPLETED CAGE CARD o Patient's name o Case # o Assigned student name, o Attending clinician name o Primary Service (e.g., IM, Sx, Cardio, etc.) o Primary complaint or diagnosis e.

ALL patients hospitalized in the ICU with EXTERNAL (CPR) orders or under SEIZURE WATCH should have an intravenous catheter placed. a. This is to ease the administration of appropriate pharmaceutica ls should an arrest or seizure occur. b. Exceptions to this are animals in which catheter placement is c ontraindicated due to underlying disease. i. Exceptions must be approved by the SUPERVISING FACULTY on the service and noted on the ICU or ders in the remarks. c. Animals that are DNR do not have to have an intravenous cathete r placed. A NESTHETIC RECOVERIES in the ICU 1. ANESTHESIA PERSONNEL are responsible for monitoring patients UNTIL EXTUBATION 2. SURGICAL STUDENTS are responsible for monitoring patients until a rectal temperature of 99o F or axillary temperature of 100o F is achieved a. ICU technical staff are committed to ALL patients housed in the VTH, depending upon the number of ICU patients currently present, may not be a vailable to assist with monitoring patients during the immediate recovery period. 3. Recommended Post-Operative BASELINE MONITORING : a. TPR with temperature acquired EVERY HOUR until maintained at 99 F without a heat source for TWO consecutive hours b. Mucous Membranes / Capillary Refill Time c. Thoracic auscultation d. Pulse quality (strength, regularity, synchronicity with heart rate) e. Mentation f. Doppler blood pressure (until value > 90mmHg is achieved on 2 consecutive readings obtained no less than 15 minutes apart) ADMITTING PATIENTS WITH KNOWN OR SUSPECTED INFECTIOUS DISEASES OR CHEMOTHERAPY 1. Follow appropriate guidelines as outlined in the VTH I NFECTIOUS DISEASE MANUAL 82 2. At minimum, any contagious patie nt admitted to the ICU will und ergo barrier nursing protocols. Proper hand wash hygi ene and wear of PPE will be pra cticed. 3. Personnel allowed to handle cont agious patients will be limited to only those necessary to provide patient care. This should ideally include only the prim ary student and one designated ICU technician. 4. Care and handling of contagious patients should be conducted at the end of the shift or after attending to all other patients in the ICU. 5. Each contagious patient admitted to the ICU will receive the ap propriate color coded neck band and cage card , be assigned their own INFECTIOUS DISEASE KIT, and have their cage clearly marked with appropriate Signage indicating the infectious disease and precaution needed. 6. All Chemotherapy patients will ha ve their cages CLEARLY identif ied and must be handled in accordance with the VTH SOP for \"SAFE HANDLING OF CYTOTOXIC DRUGS \" ISOLATION PATIENTS (174D) 1. ICU staff (technicians, students) are NOT PERMITTED to handle animals in isolation during their shifts. 2. EXCEPTION to this rule may occur during a critical emergency such as card iopulmonary arrest. 3. If the PRIMARY SERVICE has hospitalized a patient in isolation, THE PRIMARY SERVICE is responsible for ALL of the patient's care. 4. THE PRIMARY SERVICE may utilize ICU students, \"after-hours\" students, and ICU technicians for after hours, but it has to be in a manner in wh ich they will not be returning to patients in the ICU. For example, a. If an individual is completing their ICU shift then they would be free to treat an isolation patient, or b. If there are 2 students or one student and two CVT's on overnig hts, then one student may be committed to th e isolation patient. 5. It is the PRIMARY SERVICE' S RESPONSIBILITY to organize and communicate care for their patient's housed in Isolation. CARE of PATIENTS HOUSED in the WARDS 1. The ICU staff's primary responsibility is dedicated towards pro viding the appropriate LEVEL OF CARE to the more critically ill patients housed in the ICU. 83 2. The attending clinician for a patient hospitalized in wards is responsible for rounding their patients care to the ICU intern at 6PM (Monday - Friday). Weeke nd and holiday patient rounds will be at 9AM. 3. Patients housed in the Wards after-hours should be limited to o nly those patients that: a. Have a STABLE CONDITION and b. DO NOT REQUIRE HANDS -ON INTERVENTION or continual observation (e.g., hourly seizure watch) by the ICU Staff throughout the night 4. In an effort to ensure better quality of care is provided to al l patients, the following actions should be practiced and ob served by all Services: a. You must round your patient to the ICU staff if they are spendi ng the night in wards b. Each patient in wards is required to have a completely filled o ut ward's treatment sheet, including doctor signature. c. Students are responsible for the 7 AM and 7 PM treatments of their Wards patients 7 days a week d. Students are responsible for their DAYTIME TREATMENTS of wards patients during regular business hours. This includes end of day treatments (7P M) such as feeding patient and walking them. e. Students are res ponsible for MORNING treatments of wards patients regardless of whether it is scheduled at 6 am, 7 am or 8am as well as being r esponsible for completing END OF DAY treatments that are scheduled from the hours of 5- 7 pm . 5. Wards treatments between 11 PM to 7 AM (or first morning treatment conducted by the student) should be LIMITED. a. Ward patients that require more frequent (< Q 4 HRS), hands-on treatments between 10 PM and 7 AM are advised to be hospitalized in the SA ICU overnight to ensur e treatments will be completed. Prior coordination with the ICU t echnical staff is required before moving Ward patients into the ICU. i. Not all patients in the Wards will always need to be transferre d into the ICU every night. Transfer of patient s into the ICU is not necessary for patients that just require a walk-by obser vation (except seizure or resp iratory watches) ii. Transfer into the ICU is advise d primarily for patients that re quire: 1. Frequent treatments (e.g., < Q 4 HRS) 2. Hourly seizure or respiratory watches 84 iii. Students from the Primary Care S ervice are responsible for tran sferring patients into and out of the ICU to include cage set-up and cle aning. b. EXCEPTIONS may be made for situations where moving patients into the ICU w ould cause more harm than good to either the Ward patient or ICU pat ients (e.g., highly anxious, continuous barking, etc) or when the number of Wards p atients requiring treatments does not preclude completion of their treatments in a timely manner (e.g., only 1or 2 Ward patients). Prior coordination with the ICU staf f should be consulted to determine this exception. i. When patients that require treat ments are kept in the Wards ove rnight, than treatments should be limited to NO MORE frequent than Q 4HR. ii. In addition, it is advised to coor dinate treatments by scheduli ng them to occur during the prescribed 1-hr blocked times of: (11PM-12AM) and (3-4 AM). iii. Coordinating treatments during these blocked pe riods will allow the ICU student to anticipate and prepar e for the treatments as well as reduce the number of trips to the Wards req uired through the night. Overal l, this coordinated scheduling will help facilitate the ease of accompl ishing treatments. iv. If treatments are scheduled outside the prescribed treatment bl ocks (noted above), then it cannot be guaranteed that the treatments will b e completed. **PATIENTS TRANSFERRED INTOTHE ICU OVERNIGHT CAN HAVE THE TREATMENTS SCHEDULED AT ANY TIME , NOT NECESSARILY DURING THE BLOCKED HOURS NOTED ABOVE CHARGING FOR WARD PATIENTS Transferred to ICU for Overnight observation and care: 1. Ward patients housed overnight in the ICU may be charged the sa me level of hospitalization as if they remained in the Wards. 85 DAILY ICU RESPONSIBILITIES CASE RESPONSIBILITIES: ALL Services that have a patient in the ICU are required to per form the following: 1.

In addition, students on small animal ho spital rotations will also be scheduled for on-call shifts in which they may not be in the bu ilding but must be available in case their services are needed. Th e students on th e Small Anima l Hospital Intensive Care Unit and Hospital Services Rotation (VMC 797) will be assigned the o vernight shifts Monday through Saturday. The monthly schedule will be posted on the bulletin b oard outside the ICU in the hallway across from diagnostic imaging. Any changes to the post ed schedule must be initialed and approved in advan ce by an ICU technician. The following rules apply to any shift that a student may be as signed in the ICU: 1. The student must report to the ICU on time for their designated shift and must stay until the shift is completed unless released by the ICU technician. A n ICU shift is completed when the next shift's students and/or technicians have complete d rounds on each of the hospital patients. 2. Attendance is mandatory. All misse d and incomplete shifts (excu sed and unexcused) will be made up prior to receiving a diploma. An incomplete grade wi ll be assigned until all shifts are made up. In the event of an emergency or illness, th e student is required to contact the ICU technician or inte rn on-duty. This should be do ne by calling directly into the ICU (541-737-4825). Fellow students cannot approve absences . Any missed shifts will be reported to the schedu ling ICU technician who will revi ew the upcoming schedule and assign make-up shifts. These shifts may be assigned during the same block or any subsequent block in addition to normally scheduled shifts and d uties. 3. Students will be required to sign in and out on the attendance sheet located in the ICU for all after hours shifts. This sheet is located on the bulletin b oard outside of the ICU. 4. Students should report for their shifts with clean scrubs and a stethoscope. 5. Any on-call student must be immediately available by phone for the entire shift. Students are responsible for updating their phone numbers in the ICU as needed. Students must be within 20 minutes travel time to the ICU when on duty or call. 6. During after hours, unauthorized p eople (including friends and family) are not allowed in the small animal hospital. On occasion it may be necessary to h ave food or supplies dropped off to students working after hours but extended stays are not permitted. 7. The primary duty of after hour care will be exemplary patient c are followed by hospital maintenance. It is expected that the students on duty will work with each other and the technician to complete all necessary tasks. If all work has bee n completed, additional 96 time may be spent studying, practicing emergency medicine and c ritical care techniques or going over use of equipment. 8. Absolutely no unprofessional behavior will be tolerated. This i ncludes sleeping, watching movies and using the internet for non-veterinary relat ed purposes. No food or drinks are allowed in the ICU or Tech Station. All personal ite ms should be left in one of the rounds or communications rooms. 9. There is a zero-tolerance policy for drugs and alcohol. If a st udent arrives for a shift and appears to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol, it is th e immediate responsibility of the other students and technicians on-duty to contact the inter n on-duty. 10. If any patient is housed in the small animal hospital, regardle ss of resuscitation status or level of care, two people must be present at all times. If all patients have been discharged from the hospital, students may leave. The technician or intern on duty is responsible for contacting students that no long er need to arrive for their shi fts. A veterinary technician or intern must remain in the ICU at all times in case of after hours calls from the switchboard even if no patients are hospitalized. Students and interns sent home will remain on-call in case an emergency admission occurs. 97 VMC 791 and VMC 792 Small Animal Internal Medicine I & II Course Coordinator: Dr. Jana Gordon Course Instructors: Dr. Helio de Morais, Dr. Jana Gordon Course Objective: To give students hands on practi cal experience in managing smal l animal internal medicine cases. Specifically students will: Take clinical histories Perform physical examinations Create problem lists Compile lists of differential diagnoses Formulate diagnostic/therapeutic plans Obtain samples for diagnostic tests (e.g. blood, urine etc.) Perform diagnostic procedures Interpret laboratory results Discuss treatment options and plan s with the clinician/owner/re ferring veterinarian Generate medical records Discharge patients Follow up on cases once they have left the hospital Participate in daily case and/or topic rounds Participate in after-hours care of patients Dress Code: Students should maintain a pro fessional appearance. A white lab coat and name tag or some form of identification should be worn. Each student should also have a pen, calculator, thermometer, stethoscope, scissors (bandage and suture), hemost ats, and pen light. A professional appearance is manda tory and no jeans, t-shirts or open toed shoes should be worn. Food and drink are on ly allowed in conference rooms or lounge a reas where animals or laboratory specimens a re inadmissible. Professional Conduct: As representatives of the veterinary profession, it is importan t to maintain not only a professional appearance but demeanor as well. The student must consistently demonstrate appropriate behavior in all settings when in the veterinary teaching hospit al and interacting with faculty, staff, fellow students, clients , referring veterinarians and th e general public. This includes the assurance of maintaining client and patient confidentia lity inside and outside of the veterinary teaching hospital. If the student fails to do so their grade ma y be affected and they may be dismissed from their duties, may h ave to repeat a portion or al l of the rotation, and may fail the course. Inappropriate behavior should be reported to a service technician, house officer or faculty member immediately. 98 Rotation Schedule: The rotation begins at 8:00 a.m. on the first day of the block, or elective week, and ends at 8:00 a.m. (after treatments are complete) on the first day of the fo llowing block, or week. Students should expect to be present until at least 5:30 pm each evening . Students with after-hours obligations to the ICU will be dismissed at 5:00 pm. The rotati on includes after hours, weekend and holiday responsibilities. This includes regu larly scheduled and call duty. There will be a general small animal medicine or ientation the first morning of the block at 8 am that is required for all students. During the first week there will also be an o rientation for the preventive health portion of the rotation. Students will be assigned cases with an intern, resident or fac ulty DVM as primary clinician. Once assigned to a case and clinic ian, the student retains his/ her responsibilities to the case for the duration of the rotation. Each student is responsible for a ssigned cases until the animal is released or reassigned to other students. Rounds: In general, morning rounds will be held at 8:30 am (Monday-Frid ay). These will be discussions regarding hospitalized patients or topic rounds on small animal medicine topics. When presenting a case please use the standard protocol of name, sig nalment, history (including a brief diagnostic and therapeutic hist ory), problem list, differential list, assessment and plan. Students may request topics for discussion otherwise topics will be assi gned. When scheduled, students are expected to attend senior pap ers in lieu of morning rounds on Thursdays. Students are also required to attend gross necropsy rounds in lieu of morning rou nds on Wednesdays. Afternoon rounds will be held at the discr etion of the supervising clinic ian but will generally be at 3:30 pm. Student Assessment: Students in the core rotation w ill receive an A, B, C, D or F a nd students in the elective rotation will receive a pass or fail based on the following criteria: Attendance Knowledge base Clinical performance Communication Professionalism Rounds participation Other. A copy of the student rotation evaluation form can be located i n the on-line appendix. Student participation is vital to the success of any program. S tudents are encouraged to actively investigate the cases they are caring for. These cases provide the opportunity to learn about a variety of disease processes as w ell as their diagnosis and tre atment. Current College policy states that students are not able to miss more than 0.5 days/we ek of their rotation (e.g. 2 days for a four week VMC 791 rotation). If they do then they may be aske d to make up any additional time. All absences must be excused. Please see the attendance p olicy to review excused absences. Unexcused absences will need to be made up. Any unexc used absence may result in a 99 lower grade or an incomplete. If students are going to be late for or miss the rotation then they should contact the Dean's offi ce and the course coordinator. Students are also required to com plete their after-hours duties . Any after-hours duties missed, excused or unexcused, must be made up prior to receiving their diploma. Missed shifts may be made up during the same rotation or subsequent rotations at the discretion of the scheduling technician. If a student is goi ng to be late or miss an after-h ours shift they must contact the ICU (737-4825) and speak either to a technician on ICU duty or the intern on duty. If a student arrives for their shift intoxicated, or is deemed by the techni cian or intern on duty to be incapable of completing their shift for whatever reason, they will be sen t home and the shift will be repeated at a future date. General Operation of the Small An imal Internal Medicine (SAIM) Service Personnel and Organization: The small animal internal medici ne service provides referring v eterinarians and the community with access to advanced diagnostics and therapeutics in small a nimal internal medicine. The internal medicine service consists of small animal internal med icine faculty, internal medicine residents, small animal rotati ng interns, and veterinary techni cians. Regular working hours: 8:00 am to 5:30 pm Monday through Friday. Students are expected to be present and in proper attire, weekdays from 8:00 am to 5:30pm or until case work is completed . It may be necessary to come in earlier in the morni ng to complete patient evaluatio ns and records on time. Students are expected to meet with the clinician on weekends to assess h ospitalized patients, contact owners, and write records. Appointments/Receiving: We receive regularly scheduled int ernal medicine appointments o n Monday through Friday from 9:30 am to 1:30 pm. Additional ap pointments are scheduled at th e discretion of the supervising clinician. Students are also responsible for receiving appointm ents for the Preventive Health Clinic which runs Monday through Friday. These appointments are for vaccinations, parasite prevention, micro-chipping, and other wellness services offered to students, staff, and faculty of the CVM. They should not involve other complex medical or surgi cal problems, and if problems are found, another appointment ma y be scheduled through the app ropriate service. We will provide limited wellness exams fo r dogs and cats that may inclu de evaluation for, and monitoring of, chronic diseases as well as age-related diseases and conditions. Appointments are overseen by a house officer on internal medicine. Admitting cases: The student will take the record i nto the examination room with the patient and start by taking a history. This should include a complete general medical history . A history sheet has been provided to assure a complete hi story is taken. If the animal i s presenting for a recheck, please review the previous record prior to examining the patient. The student will perform a physical examination. This may include a fundic, otic and rectal examina tion as deemed appropriate. The weight, BCS and a pain score should be entered in the medic al record. A limited physical 100 examination may be performed in t he case of aggressive animals. The student should also generate a problem list, a lis t of differential diagnoses and a tentative initial plan (space is provided in the medical record) and then discuss it with the cl inician. The clinician will then assess the animal and discuss the case with the client. Procedures: Procedures will be performed, when possible, by the student but must be under the immediate supervision of a clinician or li censed veterinary technician. S ome procedures may be performed by the intern, resident or facult y supervisor of the case as de emed appropriate for the procedure and case. Patient Care: All patients admitted to the ICU and in the wards should be pla ced in a clean, appropriately sized cage. Animals should be placed on grates or absorbent bedding a s indicated. All patients should have an id neck band with the case number, name of patient (fir st and last) and date. A cage card should be completed and placed on the cage with a patient stick er, the name of the clinician, the student's name and the presenting complaint or diagnosis. There are laminated tags available to hang on the cages in ICU for special instructions. The animal's belongings and medications are placed in a designated, labeled box. Please remove all collars as they can be a choking hazard. All medications and supplies necessary for after-hours treatmen t must be in the ICU or wards and accessible to the after-hours staff prior to the treatment time. If there are any specialized diagnostics or therapeutics (che st tube, abdominal lavage cathe ter, jugular catheter) the patient might have, make sure the after-hours staff is comfortable perf orming these diagnostics or therapeutics. The patient infor mation should be placed on the a ppropriate hospitalization board in the general treatment area and/or ICU. One student will have primary r esponsibility for writing up the record and providing the daily care of each patient. Each student is expected to be familiar w ith every in-hospital case on the service. Students retain case responsibility for each patient f or the duration of t he hospital stay, including weekends. Students may not delegate their case respon sibilities to other students without prior approval by the clinician. Cases should not be tr ansferred among students except for reasons constituting excused absences. If case responsibili ties are transferred or shared for any other reasons, the primary care student's grade may be affe cted. Every morning (prior to morning rounds) students must treat, TPR, weigh, perform a phys ical exam and provide general patient care on each case in the hospital under their care. The se findings; along with notation of appetite, character of bowel moveme nts and urination, and any o ther pertinent observations must be written in the record as part of the \"SOAP\" evaluation of ea ch of the animal's problems. A SOAP should also be completed in the afternoon for hospitalized patients in the standard SOAP protocol or utilizing and addendum. Review and check ICU patien ts first. Students with patients in ICU must have their cage cl eaned, orders written, medication s ready, and ot her supplies available by 8:30 am. Students ar e responsible for the 7-8:00am treatments of ICU patients and 7-8am and 7-8pm treatments of wa rd patients. Students also take care of their wards patients during regular business hours. Please keep the animals clean at all times. All patients should have water at all times unless the treatment plan includes \"not hing per os\" (NPO). Cats should have boxes with the appropriate litter type unless indicated ot herwise. If a special diet or quantity or frequency of feedings is required, it must be noted on the cage card and written in the 101 orders. If the student feeding the animal does not want the rou tine feedings by the kennel staff, this must be noted this on the cage card. Animals must be walke d on a leash in the designated fenced area outside. You are expected to clean up any urine, fe ces, or other materials deposited by your patient. Records: Students are responsible for filling out the history form, phys ical examination form. SOAPs are completed in the electronic medical records system. These will be completed by the student in charge of the case and should be in the format of the problem o riented veterinary medical record (POVMR). The medical record is a legal document and may be prov ided to owners or referring veterinarians at their request. There should be two SOAPs per d ay or a single SOAP and an addendum. The morning one is ge nerally the more detailed one, o utlining a plan for the day and should be completed prior to morning rounds. The afternoon one can be a brief update, or addendum, but should also include analysis of new test results and how they alter the plan. The student must also update client and referring veterinarian comm unications as needed and indicated by the primary clinic ian. The clinician will fill in the master problem list. The student/clinician/technician will fill out and submit other for ms (e.g. anesthesia request, laboratory forms, radiology requests) as needed. Records must be completed before morning rounds or by 8:30 a.m. if the patient is in ICU. The record sho uld remain with the patient, particularly with ICU patients. For hospitalized patients, new orders should be written and reviewed with the clinician before 8:30 each morning. Communications: In general, students will be in charge of client communications after the initial contact between the clinician and client. Any co mmunication should first be dis cussed with the clinician in charge of the case. The client c ommunications should be recorde d in the computer under case communications. Students may also be responsible for communicat ing with referring veterinarians and these communications should also be recorded in case communications. For any hospitalized patient, the st udent should communicate with t he owners at least daily and the referring veterinarian on admission and at discharge. Any chang es in medications or new prescriptions called in to a pharm acy should also be documented in case communications. Treatments: Morning treatments must be comple ted before morning rounds or b y 8:30 am if the patient is in ICU. All treatments should be en tered into the medical record o n the pink sheet, SOAP and/or treatment sheet. Drug therapy mu st include drug name, dose, rou te and frequency. As mentioned previousl y, students are respon sible for their initia l morning treatments in ICU and all of their treatments in the wards during regular business days u p to 7 pm. ICU and after hours students are responsible for wards treatments on evenings (afte r 7 pm), weekends (after initial morning treatments) and holidays (same criteria as weekends). S tudents may be required to assist in these treatments under some circumstances. Pharmacy Prescriptions: Fill out forms completely with patient sticker, weight, date, c linician's name and signature. All prescriptions must include the drug name, concen tration, total amount prescribed, and directions inclu ding amount in mg and either nu mber of pills/capsules or 102 volume. Prescriptions should be submitted by 5:30 pm on the day they are needed. Narcotics must be on their own prescription and only one narcot ic can be on each prescription. You are not able to obtain more than 24 hours' wo rth of narcotics from the pharmacy at a time. Drugs cannot be returned to the pharmacy fo r patient refund unless they are in their original pack aging unopened and have not left the hospital and return is within 7 days of visit. Pills, capsules or liquid that has been removed from its original container cannot be returned for refund. Medications brought into the hos pital by owners are generally not permitted for use. Any medications brought in to the hospital with the patient should not be utilized unless: The Pharmacy is unable to acquire the medication through normal distribution channels or within an acceptable time frame, The medication is date sensitive and is not typically stocked i n the Pharmacy, The medication is a compounded medication that cannot be made i n the Pharmacy, The medication is very expensive and would prevent the owner fr om affording required care. Exception to policy requires the following stipulations before receiving a patient-owned controlled substance into the VTH the sen ior faculty clinician must: Validate the prescription order by making every reasonable atte mpt to contact the DEA registrant that originally presc ribed the CS or the pharmacy th at filled the Rx order. Verify that: The medication is in a prescription container that is properly labeled and legible. The medication inside the container can be identified and verif ied. The medication is not deteriorated, expired or adulterated. The medication is appropriate for the current therapeutic condi tion(s). Radiology and Ultrasound: Forms are submitted electronically and must be submitted by 4:3 0 pm on the day of the procedure. Appointments should not be made for diagnostic imagi ng until the patient is admitted to avoid late and no show appointments with diagnostic imaging. Make sure you consider time to acquire, admit and obtain seda tion. Special procedures such as nuclear scintigraphy, fluoroscopy, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging should also be discussed with diagnostic imaging. Endoscopy: Discuss any endoscopic procedur es with the clinician and veteri nary technician. These procedures may or may not be performed the same day the patient is admitted. Appropriate anesthesia request forms must be submitted the day prior to the procedure. These procedures require preparation. A gastroduod enoscopy only requires a 24 ho ur fast (water can be given) but a colonoscopy a 24 to 48 hour fast followed by 24 hours of enem as and saline cathartics. It is 103 important to communicate with the clinician and client effectiv ely to make sure animals are adequately and safely prepared for these procedures. Anesthesia: Requests are submitted electroni cally and must be submitted by 4:00 pm the day prior to the procedure. After hours and same day requests should be hand wri tten and placed in the box outside of anesthesia. A member of the anesthesia technician or faculty should be consulted regarding same day and after hour's availability. Case Transfers: Occasionally it is necessary to obtain a consult or transfer fr om another service area on a case seen through the internal medicine service. Sometimes consults are necessary on hospitalized patients and at other times the consult may be completed after the patient has been discharged. Records must be completed by the internal medicine service prio r to complete of transfer and the clinician as well as technician on the service contacted. There are consultation forms that should be completed and posted in the consulting service box, with the medical record (unless an ICU patient) and any referral information. Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (VDL): All laboratory tests should be d ocumented on the pink patient o rders sheet. Take all submissions, with appropriate paperwork filled out, to the VDL office. They will accept submissions M-F 8:00-4:30. Any tests that are shipped out to re ferral labs must be submitted by 11:30 am and should be evaluated by the internal medicine techn ician for accuracy prior to submission. VDL fees may be entered into the computer by the se rvice technician, students or clinicians but the student is responsible for recording procedu res in the record and notifying the technician of tests requested. Necropsy & Care of Remains: Refer to policy notebook located in the small animal treatment room. All submissions to VDL for necropsy and cremation shoul d be under the guidance of a ve terinary technician. We hope the block will be an enjoyable learning experience. Stu dents should not hesitate to ask for assistance or clarification of policies and procedur es. Textbooks : provided on service OSU Student, Faculty and Staff Preventive Health Program The students, faculty and staff at Oregon State University are able to participate in a preventive health program for dogs and cats offered through the internal m edicine service at the small animal teaching hospital. The following companies have gracious ly donated their products to our program: Pfizer\u00ae/Wyeth\u00ae/Fort Dodge\u00ae Bayer\u00ae Merial/Boehringer-Ingelheim\u00ae 104 Physical examination Vaccinations Heartworm testing FeLV/FIV testing Fecal evaluation Parasite prevention Microchip placement Basic wellness Enrollment: Veterinary students, faculty a nd staff may enroll up to 6 dogs and/or cats in this program. Preventative Health privileges are limited to animals that are personally owned and that live at the person's reside nce. A patient/doctor relations hip must be established in all cases and pet ownership must be attested to when the names and case n umbers are registered with the veterinary teaching hospital. Once designated, the animals elig ible for the program will not be changed, except if ownership is transferred or the animal dies. No substitutions will be allowed. Upon the animal's death or transfer of ownership, the animal's spot on the discount list may be replaced with another animal. Once an animal is deleted from th e discount list, it cannot be put back on the list. Those violatin g this policy may have discount privileges perman ently removed. Services are limited to those de scribed above. Animals evaluate d through the preventive health clinic are only approved for testing and treatment offered thro ugh the preventive health clinic. Evaluation for other stable dise ase conditions may be performed through the preventive health service at the discretion of the attending veterinarian as long as that condition has been previously documented in the med ical record. New, complex or pa tients that have experienced a change in status will require a r egularly schedul ed appointment through the appropriate service area. For example, if your pet is on thyroid supplementation fo r hypothyroidism, refills and monitoring can be obtained through the preventive health clinic . But if your previously stable hypothyroid dog now has an inguinal mass to be evaluated an app ointment through the small animal internal medicine service is required. Care guidelines r egarding well ness and life stages follow AAHA and AAFP guidelines and should be reviewed by small animal medicine students prior to participating in the preventive health clinic. These g uidelines can be found in the appendix of the senior manual. Medical Records: A medical record must be complet ed for every animal enrolled in the preventive health program. Medical records should be completed prior to the day of evaluation. All pertinent records, including previous laboratory tests, mus t be available to dispense medications (e.g. heartworm test performed prior to filling a p rescription for heartworm medications). A one-time medical records fee will be applied to every pet enrolled. Physical Examinations: A physical examination will be performed or supervised by a veterinarian on every pet enrolled in the program prior to vacc ination or dispensing of certain 105 medications. An annual preventive health physical examination a nd heartworm test is required prior to dispensing heartworm medications. A physical examinati on is required just prior to administration of any vaccine. A physical examination is not re quired prior to dispensing flea and/or tick preventative as long as a preventive health exam ha s been done in the last 12 months. Vaccinations: Oregon State University (OSU) rea lizes that each animal has a d ifferent level of immunity and exposure to infection and that a single vaccinatio n protocol may not be adequate for all cases. The College of Veterinary Medicine (CVM) also re alizes that administration of biologics is associated with risk to the animal. The CVM has ad opted the recommendations of the AAHA and AAFP regarding the use of core and non-core vaccin ations. It is with these recommendations that the following protocols were developed. Core vaccinations for the dog. Puppy vaccinations will begin at 6 to 8 weeks of age and consist of a modified live virus (MLV) distemper, parvo and adenovirus- 2 (DAP) vaccine given every 3 - 4 weeks to age 16 weeks. These puppies should then receive su bsequent vaccinations every 3 to 5 years. Adult dogs (> 16 week s of age) that present for ini tial vaccination, will receive an initial dose of MLV DAP and subsequent booster at one year then every 3 to 5 years. A killed rabies vaccine will be offered to dogs. Dogs can be vaccinated as early as 12 weeks of age. A booster should be given to dogs a t 1 year and subsequently at 1 to 3 year intervals depending on county of residence. Benton Co unty requires vaccination for dog s for rabies and a 3 year vaccine is appropriate. Non-core vaccinations for the dog. A MLV avirulent bacteria com bination CAV-2, parainfluenza virus and Bordetella bronchiseptica intranasal vaccine will be offered as another non-core vaccine for puppies and dogs at high risk (e.g. boardi ng). It is recommended this vaccination be given 72 hours prior to boarding. This vaccinati on can be given to puppies as a single dose as early as 3 weeks of age and then yearly or more frequently if at risk. Adult dogs (> 14 weeks) require a single do se to be protective and subsequ ent vaccinations are given annually or more frequently if at risk. Vaccination for leptos pirosis will also be offered as a non-core vaccine but is strongl y recommended because of increas ed cases of canine leptospirosis in the state of Oregon. Dogs that engage in outdoor activities such as hiking, camping, swimming in streams or are exposed to rivers and lakes are at more of a risk. This vaccine is a subunit vaccine that contains four serovars of Leptospira spp . L. pomona, L. canicola, L. grippotyphosa and L. icterohemorrhagiae. There have been very few reactions to this vaccine to date and this is believed to be due to the fact that it is a subunit vs. whole bacterin vaccine. This vaccine can be given to dogs 12 weeks of age and older usi ng an initial vaccination followed by a boos ter 2 to 4 weeks later and annual boosters. D ogs > 16 weeks of age receive a single injection followed by a bo oster 2 to 4 weeks later and a nnual revaccination. There have been a few reports of canine influenza in the state of Oregon. It does not appear that the number of cases has increased. We do no t carry the killed canine influ enza vaccine at this time. Vaccination recommendations are si milar for parainfluenza, CAV- 2 and B. bronchiseptica . The vaccine may be given to puppies 6 weeks of age or older. Regard less of age an initial vaccine followed by a booster at 2 to 4 weeks is required. Core vaccinations for the cat. Kittens can be vaccinated with a MLV panleukopenia, herpes and calici virus vaccine as early as 2 weeks of age (if healthy and at high risk) but most kittens will 106 begin vaccinations at 6-8 weeks of age followed by additional v accinations every 3 to 4 weeks until 12 weeks of age. These kitte ns should then receive subseq uent vaccination every 3 years. Adult cats (>16 weeks of age) that present for initial vaccinat ion will receive two doses of MLV vaccine 3 - 4 weeks apart and subsequent vaccination every 3 ye ars. A killed rabies vaccine will be offered to cats. The rabies vaccine is not considered c ore for cats by the AAFP but because Benton County requires vaccination of cats we have incl uded it in this section. Cats can be vaccinated as early as 12 week s of age for rabies. The felin e rabies vaccine is a non-adjuvant canarypox vector vaccine and must be repeated annually. Non-core vaccinations for the cat. The feline leukemia virus (F eLV) vaccine is not considered core for indoor cats but is reco mmended for outdoor cats or cat s at risk of infection. All kittens and cats should be tested prior to initial administration. Kitt ens will be vaccinated for FeLV using either a non-adjuvant canarypox vector vaccine given subc utaneously or an alternative depending on availability of vacci ne. The initial vaccination will be given to cats/kittens 9 weeks of age or older followed by another vaccination 3 to 4 we eks later then annual vaccination. Vaccines will be administered on the distal extremities subcuta neously as follows: DAP - left hind limb Leptospirosis - left forelimb FPHC - tail (1st vaccine) FeLV - tail (3rd vaccine) OR left hind limb distal to stifle Rabies (cat) - tail (2nd vaccine) OR right hind limb, distal to stifle in cats Rabies (dog) - right hind limb Heartworm Disease Prevalence: Heartworm infection ( Dirofilaria immitis ) in dogs has been diagnosed around the globe, including all 50 of the United St ates. In the United States, it s territories and protectorates, heartworm is considered at least regionally endemic in each of the contiguous 48 states, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Island s, and Guam. Heartworm transmiss ion has not been documented in Alaska; however, there are regions in central Alaska that ha ve mosquito vectors and climate conditions to support the transmission of heartworms for brief periods. The greatest numbers of cases are seen in the southeastern U.S. and the Mississippi Riv er Valley. There is an apparent high level of prevalence documented in northern California. 107 Heartworm life cycle: Mosquitoes are the intermediate hosts and more than 70 species are capable of transmitting the disease. Transmission can occur anytime infected mosquitoes are active and feeding. The dog is the definitive and primary host for heartworm, however, other s pecies such as coyotes, wolves, foxes, ferrets, bears, cats, wild felidae (mountain lions bobca ts, tigers, etc), marine mammals (seals, sea lions, etc) can also get infected (although less co mmonly). Rare instances of transmission of microfilaria from infected bitches to fetuses v ia the placenta and from dog to dog via blood transfusion can occur. However, these microfilariae w ill not develop into adult worms. Presence of these microfilariae can confound a diagnosis and ma y serve as a potential source of microfilaria that could be transmitted by feeding mosquitoes. Microfilariae reside in the bl ood of most, but not infecte (307-322 \u00b5m x 6.8-7.0 by two molts (approximately 2 weeks), infective third-stage larvae (L3s) are present in mosqu ito mouth parts. Development may be slower at cooler temperatures and ceases at temperatures bel ow 57\u00b0F but the presence of microenvironments in urban areas suggests that the risk of hear tworm transmission never reaches zero. Development progresses in the mosquito relative to ambien t temperature; if ambient temperature increases, development will resume. L3s (1,000 \u00b5m x 40 \u00b5m) are deposited on the skin of the dog during subsequent feeding and migrate through t he bite wound into the host. Most L3s molt to fourth-stage larvae (L4s) 1-3 days after infection. L4s migrate through tissues for several weeks. A fin al molt to the sexually immature adult stage occurs approximately 2 months (50 to 70 days) after infection. The young adults (2-3 108 cm in length) enter the vascular system and are carried to the heart and pulmonary arteries, arriving as early as 70 days aft er infection. Rarely, ectopic i nfections of the eye, central nervous system, peritoneal cavity, system ic circulation, or skin have b een reported. Final maturation and mating occurs in the pulmonary ves sels. By 4 months after infec tion, the worms in the pulmonary arteries are around 10- 15 cm in length. Fully mature adults at 6.5 months after infection reach lengths of 15-18 cm for males and 25-30 cm for females. Canine hosts typically demonstrate microfilaremia 6 to 7 months after infection (prepa tent period). Heartworms live approximately 5 to 7 years in the dog. HEARTWORM IN DOGS: Diagnosis: Most dogs diagnosed with heartwor ms are asymptomatic however, c ough, weight loss, exercise intolerance, dyspnea, collapse (due to arrhythmias-hypoxia), as cites, and hemoptysis can be seen as the disease advances. On physical exam a split second heart sound (due to pulmonary hypertension) and a right-sided heart murmur (tricuspid regurgi tation) pneumonitis. Ju gular venous distension/pulsations (due to hi gh right heart pressures) can a lso be noted (easier to see in a shaved neck). Eosinophilic, mix ed and granulomatous pneumonia c an occur, particularly in dogs. Pleural effusion is a rar e finding in dogs with just hear tworm infection. Some dogs develop renal glomerulonephritis , proteinuria (secondary to ant igen-antibody complex deposition), hemolytic anemia and amyloidosis. Thromboembolism may also occur. The onset and severity of diseas e in the dog is mainly a reflec tion of the number of adult heartworms present, the age of the infection and the level of a ctivity of the dog. Dogs with higher numbers of worms are genera lly found to have more severe heart and lung disease changes. Until the number of mature heartworms exceeds 50 in a 25kg dog, nearly all of the heartworms reside in the lower caudal pulmonary arteries. Large burdens of heartworms result in their presence in the right chambers of the heart. In such infe ctions, the most common early pathological changes caused by h eartworms are due to inflammato ry processes that occur in and around the arteries of the lowe r portion of the lungs in respon se to the presence of heartworms (vascular endothelial cell damag e, smooth muscle hypertrophy an d fibrous tissue proliferation); all these changes in the lungs m ay lead to pulmonary hypertensi on and secondary tricuspid regurgitation/insuffici ency. Later, the heart may become enlarg ed/hypertrophic due to pressure overload and right-sided heart failure may occur. A very active dog (e.g., working dog) is more likely to develop severe disease with a relatively small number of heartworms than an inactive one (e.g., a lap dog). Caval syndrome occurs in a sma ll number of cases, typically ass ociated with large numbers of adults in the pulmonary arteries, right heart and caudal vena c ava. Worms found in the right heart (right ventricle and right atrium) may interference with the tr icuspid valve function. This results also in right-sided heart failure. Other associated findings in clude: pallor, weak pulses, tachycardia, and sudden collapse, hemoglobinemia and hemoglobin uria, and DIC. Dogs with caval syndrome are typically ver y sick and it is considered an emergency. 109 Rarely, ectopic infections of the eye, central nervous system, peritoneal cavity, systemic circulation, or skin have been reported. Dogs on heartworm prevention should be checked annually for the presence of circulating heartworm antigen to verify that they are being protected, and in areas where resistance may be a possibility it may be prudent to test outdoor dogs twice each y ear (see Prevention below). Recent work has shown that there are isolates of heartworms that are c apable of developing to adults in dogs receiving routine prophylaxis with any of the available ma crocyclic lactones. Antigen tests detect a glycoprotein found predominantly in the reproductive t ract of the female worm (gravid uterus). Only mature i nfections (older than 6 months typically) with at least one female worm are usually detected. Low worm burden s (fewer than two adult female s) and infections with only male worms may not be detected. Microfilaria tests in combinati o n w i t h t h e a n t i g e n t e s t s a l l o w for greater sensitivity. The earliest that heartworm antigen an d microfilariae can be detected is about 5 and 6 months, respectively. Antigenemia usually precede s but sometimes lags the appearance of microfilariae by a few weeks. There is no need or justification for testing a dog for antigen and microfilariae prior to 7 months of age. Whether scr eening a population of asymptomatic dogs or seeking verification of a suspected heartw orm infection, anti gen testing is the most sensitive diagnostic method. The high incidence of amicrofila remic infections (no circulatin g L 1 - L 2 ) h a s l e d t o i n c r e a s e u s e of tests targeting adu lt worms. ELISA and immunochromatographic tests are available for detecting circulating heartworm antigen. Each testing format ha s proven to be clinically useful. The current generation of heartworm antigen tests identify most \"occult\" (adult worms present but not circulating microfilari ae) infections consisting of at least one mature female worm and are nearly 100% specific. Currently there are no verified tests capable of detecting infections consisting of only adult male worms. False-negative and false-p ositive results can occur and unexpected test results should be repeated. If the results are still ambiguous, confirmation by a reference laboratory is recommended to confirm the result. In c ases of minimal exposure/prevalence like Oregon s tate (and in dogs with no trav el history to endemic areas) it is recommended to confirm all positive antigen tests in asymptomat ic dogs prior to any adulticide therapy. Concentration tests fo r microfilariae, thoracic radiog raphy to detect signs of heartworm disease, or ultrasonographic visualization of worms may also va lidate weakly positive antigen test results (see below). The color intensity of a positive ant igen test result (e.g IDEXX SNAP\u00ae test, Witness HW) cannot reliably be used to determine the level of worm burd en. As said 110 above, false-negative test resu lts occur most commonly when inf ections are light, female worms are still immature, only male wo rms are present, and/or the tes t kit instructions have not been followed. Positive antigen tests regardless of its high sensiti vity should be interpreted carefully, taking other relevant clinical i nformation into consideration. In general, however, it is better to trust rather than reject positive antigen results. Microfilaria testing should be done in tandem with antigen test ing to determine whether this life- cycle stage is also present in dogs. The modified Knott test re mains the preferred method for observing morphology and measur ing body dimensions to different iate D. immitis form non- pathogenic filarial species such as Dipetalonema reconditum (slide is examined under 100X for detection of microfilariae and under 400X to observe characteri stics of the microfilariae). All dogs should also be tested for microfilariae, as microfilaremia validates serologic results, is diagnostic should a dog have antigen-antibody complexes (no ant igen detected on antigen tests), identifies the patient as a reservoir of infection, and alerts the veterinarian to a high microfilarial burden, which may precipitate a severe reaction following admin istration of a microfilaricide (e.g milbemycin). Microfilaria tests are insensitive methods by themselves. Reduced microfilaria test sensitivity may occur due to variations in microfilaria co ncentrations based on time of day and season, variation of circulating numbers of microfilaria (h ighest in summer and afternoon/evening). A dog may have a negative microfilaria test when: single sex adult infections, elimination of microfilariae by administration of m onthly preventives, host immune responses, occurrence of circulating antigen prior to microfila riae production (in rare cases, the appearance of microfilariae ma y precede antigenemia.), and true occult infections. Other methods less preferred for detection of microfilaria are: direc t examination of fresh blood or blood treated with an anticoagulant, examination buffy coat in a microhematocrit tube, and concentration using a stained or unstained Mi llipore filter. In instances of noncompliance or changing the brand or type of heartworm preventive, it is important to determine the heartworm status of the dog. The dog should be antigen and microfilaria-tested prior to sta rting or changing products. In positive cases and when noncompliance/change of product has occurred, preventive therap y should be restarted and the dog should be retested 6 months l ater; a positive test at this time would most likely be due to an infection acquired before starti ng preventive therapy. Another antigen test should be repeated in 6 months and then annual testing thereafter. If the lapse is... Then... Neve r been on preventative Always test before dispensing <5 months, previously o n preventative Testing is ideal Dispense heartworm treatment and test 6 months later >5 months, previously o n preventative Always test before dispensing As said above areas such as Orego n where the prevalence of hear tworm disease is low it is important to confirm positive antigen tests with other diagnost ic aids (in the symptomatic or asymptomatic dog). A CBC may suggest signs of albu minuria. Radiography provides the most objective method of assessing the severity of heartwor m cardiopulmonary disease secondary to heartworm infection. Typical (nearly pathognomonic ) signs of heartworm vascular disease are enlarged tortuous, and often truncated peripheral i ntralobar and interlobar branches of the pulmonary arteries, particularly in the caudal lobes. These findings are accompanied by variable degrees of pulmonary parenchymal disease. The earliest and most subtle pulmonary arterial changes are most commonly found in the dorsal caudal w edge of the diaphragmatic lung lobes. As the severity of infection and chronicity of disease p rogress, the pulmonary arterial signs are seen in larger branche s. In the worst cases, eventual l y t h e r i g h t h e a r t e n l a r g e s (evidenced by a reverse \"D\" shape to the heart) and right-sided heart failure may occur (see above). Additional radiographic findings may include lymphadeno pathy and pleural effusion (uncommon in dogs). Heartworm associated lung disease is descri bed as a cause of chronic respiratory signs in dogs and cats some of which fail to have t he classic cardio vascular changes on imaging. On electrocardiography evidence of right ventricula r enlargement can be found. can provide def inite evidence of heartworm inf ection, as well as allow for assessment of cardiac anatomic and functional consequences of t he disease. Echocardiography is not an efficient method of makin g a diagnosis in lightly infect ed dogs (worms are often limited to the peripheral branches of the pulmonary arteries). When hea rtworms are numerous, they are more likely to be present in the main pulmonary artery, right a nd proximal left interlobar branches, or within the right side of the heart. When significa nt infection is present right heart enlargement/hypertrophy, pulmonary artery enlargement and tricu spid regurgitation may be seen. Prevention: Heartworm infection is prevented by the routine administration of a number of macrocyclic lactone preventives. Uninfected dogs should ma crocyclic lactone preventives all year-round. Preventives will not only protect dogs against infection but will also diminish the risk of infection in other dogs and secondary spreading of the disease in the population. It is extremely important, however, to do annual antigen testing on d ogs receiving preventives to verify that they are not becoming infected despite precautions. Annual testing will ensure that infected dogs are detected and treated as soon as possible. For dogs living in highly endemic large twice-a-year testing is advised. These preventives (+/- a dditives) vary in their claims against (hookworms, roundw orms, whipworms) and e xternal parasites (ticks and fleas) and are available in different formulations (tablets, to picals and injectable preparations). Macrocyclic selamectin (topical), and moxidectin (topical injectable). the dose of ivermect in, selamectin, milbemycin and moxidectin in the commercial heartworm preparations are low enough to be used safely even in dogs with the MDR1 mutation (Australian Shepherd, Collie and other herding breeds and their crosses). It is only when the drugs are used at high doses, such as those used to treat mange (50 times higher dose than the heartworm prevention dose), that dogs with the mutation will de velop neurological toxicity (http://www.vetmed.wsu.edu/ depts-VCPL/drugs.aspx ). Genetic testing for the mutation may be offered to the client if there is significant cause for concern . 112 Treatment: Medical management consists of killing adults with an adulticid e followed by a microfilaricide. Dogs with severe pulmonary hypertension and caval syndrome may have worms surgically extracted. Dogs with heart failure are stabilized prior to trea tment. Stabilize dogs presenting with clinical heartworm disease. Any or all of the following may be medically indicated: corticosteroid therapy, fluid therapy, diuretics, vasodilators, and positive inotropic agents. Dogs receiving a macrocyclic l actone should be maintained on pr eventive if it is already being administered. If a dog is not receiving a macrocyclic lactone p reventive, administration of preventive should be instituted as soon as any severe medical c ondition has been stabilized. The purpose of preventive use is to prevent infection with new larv ae if the dog is bitten by more infected mosquitoes because the treatment with melarsomine for removal of adult worms will not kill newly introduced larvae. Als o administering a macrocyclic lactone preventive 2-3 months prior to administering melarsomine will make young worms (<4mon ths) more susceptible to die. CAPC (Companion Animal Parasite C ouncil) recommends treating in fected dogs with adulticide promptly, as soon as medically practical. Delaying treatment wh ile maintaining dogs on preventives may contribute to selection for resistance, and all ows pathology to progress. Infected dogs are staged into 1 of 3 classes based on clinical signs: as ymptomatic or mild disease (stage 1), moderate disease (stage 2), or severe disease (stage 3). St age 1 dogs may not be treated (clinician\u00b4s preference) and melarsomine is the most common adu lticide used. For Stage 1 and 2 dogs, melarsomine dihydrochlori de (2.5 mg/kg) can be administer ed intramuscularly twice over a 24-hour period, followed by at least 1 month of strict exerci se restriction. This treatment regimen will kill greater than 90% of the worms present and cle ar a similar percentage of dogs of their infections. If the dog is not antigen negative in 4 month s, the treatment can be repeated. The prescribed meth od for treating Stage 3 dogs is to administer melarsomine dihydrochloride (2.5 mg/kg) intramuscularly once, followed in 1 month (or longer if the dog's condition dictates) by two intram uscular injections (2.5 mg/kg each) 24 hours apart. Any excitement or exercise beyond sl ow walking for should be restri cted for at least 1 month following each set of injections (this is ESSENTIAL for minimiz ing cardiopulmonary complications such us PTE); avoi d overheating is also recommend ed. This treatment regimen will kill up to 98% of the worms present. The greater efficacy obtained using the 3-injection regimen developed for Stage 3 do gs makes this approach the trea tment of choice for even Stage 1 and 2 dogs. Other, off-label regimens for administration of m elarsomine dihydrochloride are not recommended. Melarsomine is not proven effective against he artworms younger than 4 months of age. Because dogs may have been bitten over a period of months by infected mosquitoes, the worms in a dog ma y be of different ages within a given season, and thus, melarsomine treatment may not be completely effective in all si tuations. This may necessitate additional therapy or alternate therapeutic strategies. All dog s that are treated with melarsomine should be antigen tested 4-6 months after completing therapy to determine if infection has been cleared. If positive recheck 1 to 2 months later. Microfilarici des (if present after treatment with melarsomine) are started 1 month after the adulticide therapy a nd the dog should be retested in 4 weeks (see treatment protocol attached). In cases where melarsomine thera py is not possible or contraind icated, the use of a monthly heartworm preventive along with d oxycycline at 10mg/kg BID for a 4-week period might be 113 considered; an antigen test shou ld be performed every 6 months and the dog not considered cleared until 2 consecutive negative antigen tests have been ob tained; if the dog still antigen positive after one year, repeat the doxycycline therapy (restri ct (the \"slow kill\" method) IS NOT RECOMMENDED especially in light of resistance. It has be en demonstrated that repeated macrocyclic lactone administration over a period of ti me to infected dogs increases the proportion of circulating microfilariae that possess resistance markers (i.e., application of long- term drug pressure will select for survival of drug-resistant m icrofilariae). If the \"slow kill\" method is the only medically acceptable option, microfilariae s hould be eliminated prior to exposure to preventive doses of macrocyclic lactones. Topical m oxidectin/imidacloprid is label approved in dogs (FDA) for removal of microfilariae when used m onthly. Pretreatment with antihistamines and glucocorticoids is advisable in the face of high microfilariae burdens to minimize potential reactions. Depending on the macrocyclic lactone used, as many as 20% of do gs infected with heartworms will continue to have circulating microfilariae for at least a year or longer when receiving monthly preventative (even after adulticide therapy has been su ccessfully completed). Current protocols utilizing do xycycline in combination with regular pre ventive doses of macrocyclic lactones have essentially elimina ted the need for post-adulti cidal elimination of microfilariae (see treatment protocol attached). Most inc luding D. immitis , harbor bacteria belonging to the genus Wolbachia (Rickettsiales). Although more research is needed, initial data suggest that the treatmen t of dogs with doxycycline prior to adulticide therapy may reduce the gross pulmonary pathology tha t occurs as a result of thromboembolic shower of dead worm fragments, aid in the suppre ssion of microfilarial numbers after adulticide therapy, and interfere with the abilit y of the microfilariae to infect other dogs after they have passed t hrough a mosquito host. Public Health: Dirofilaria immitis is of public health concern even though the number of reported cases is small (more than 100 human cases of pulmonary dirofilariasis have bee n reported in the U.S in the last 50 years). Prevention is best accomplished through mosquito aba tement programs (including screening outdoor kennels), and by using mosquito repellents, w earing protective clothing, and remaining indoors during mosquito feeding periods. Reducing the prevalence of heartworm infection in the definitive canine host will also reduce transm ission risk for humans. HEARTWORM IN CATS: Heartworm infection is less common in cats and they have lower worm burdens (usually 1 or 2 worms), fewer larva developing into adults a longer prepatent p eriod (7-8 months) and shorter survival times of adult worms (2 -3 years). Pathologic findings are similar to dogs. The clinical importance of heartworms is amplified in cats because even a sm all number of heartworms are potentially life-threatening. Although live adult worms in the pulmonary arteries cause a local arteritis, some cats never manifest clinical signs. When clinic al signs are evident, they usually develop during 2 stages of the disease: 1) arrival of heartworm s in the pulmonary vasculature (immature adult worms 3-4 months post infection), and 2) death of adult heartworms. The initial phase is often misdiagnosed as asthma or allergic bronchitis, h owever it is part of a syndrome 114 known as heartworm associated respiratory disease (HARD). When the adult worms begin to die (second stage) pulmonary inflammation and thromboembolism may o ccur (which usually leads to fatal acute lung injury). Clinical signs associated with heartworm disease in cats can be vague or can consist of predominantly respiratory, gastrointestinal (e.g, emesis), and occasionally neurological. Most commonly cats have clinical signs of chronic respiratory diseas e (tachypnea, intermittent coughing, and increased respiratory effort). Chronic cor pulmon ale and right-sided heart failure may also occur. Radiographic findings are variable and include peribronchial infiltrates, interstitial disease, consolidation and pleural effusion. Cauda and seen. Chylot horax and hydrothorax are someti mes found. Fewer microfilaria circulate for shorter periods making tests f or microfilaria insensitive (if you are looking for microfilariae do Knott\u00b4s or Millipore test). An tigen tests underestimate prevalence because of early inf ection, resolved infection, low worm burdens, immature females, and all male infections. The cu rrent generation of available an tigen tests can identify infections with a single mature female worm and are nearly 100% specific; however male infections and immature females infections can occur in cats as said above dec reasing the utility of the antigen test for detecting infection. Antibody test have the advantage of being able to detect infection by both male and female worms. The sensitivity of the antibody tes t is variable and depends on larval stage, age of the worms, etc. (see American Heartworm So ciety guidelines). Antibody tests overestimate prevalence because of persistence antibodies despite clearance of infection. Since both juvenile and adult worms are capable of causing clin ical disease in the cat, both antibody and antigen tests are useful tools and when used toget her increase the probability of making appropriate diagnostic d ecisions. Adult worms can often be identified on echocardiogram. The diagnosis is most commonly made when a cat from and endemic area manifests the appropriate clinical signs, has radiographic find ings consistent with infection and a positive antibody/antigen test. Treatment is not recommended for asymptomatic cats. Adulticide therapy (melarsomine) can be considered when respiratory signs cannot be controlled with ant i-inflammatories (prednisone), however, there is insufficient experience with melarsomine at t h i s t i m e a n d i t s u s e i s N O T recommended (preliminary data suggests that melarsomine is toxi c to cats at doses as low as 3.5mg/kg). Surgical extraction can be considered in heavily inf ected cats. Preventatives are similar to dogs (milbemycin oxime, ivermectin, selamectin) and monthly prophylaxis should be considered in endemic areas (should be started in kittens at 8 weeks of age). 115 Table 1 .

Viral Disease Affecting Cats Feline Upper Respiratory Disease Several infectious organisms ha ve been recognized as causing th e sights of feline upper respiratory disease. The two major viral causes are feline cali civirus (FCV) and feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1), which is the cause of feline viral rhino tracheitis (FVR). The most common bacterial organisms asso ciated with feline upper respira tory disease are Bordetella bronchiseptica and Chlamydia felis; whose prevalence varies by region and, while they can cause clinical signs on their own, are often seen in coinfections with FCV or FHV1. Other viruses (cat pox, FeLV and FIV) can manifest with clinical sign s of respiratory disease however they are also usually the result of co-infection with FCV or FH V-1 (or both). Feline Calicivirus Feline calicivirus is a non-enveloped, single-stranded RNA viru s from the Caliciviridae Family. This virus can infect all felids but is most commonly seen in y oung kittens as they lose their maternal antibodies or in group situations. There are calicivir uses that infect dogs that are genetically distinct (canine calicivirus) and indistinct from F CV raising the possibility of transmission between dogs and cats. Since FCV is a single-stran ded RNA virus it is capable of genetic heterogeneity, which can affect its antigenicity and ma y be responsible for the variable presentation seen with this viru s. Infection is typically direc t from actively infected or carrier cats via oral, nasal or conjuncti val secretions. The virus typi cally replicates in 2 to 5 days in the oral and respiratory tissues. The virus can also replicate in t he synovium, viscera and urinary bladder. Clinical signs of FCV infection include depression, fever, ulce rs of the tongue, lips or nose, hypersalivation, nasal discharge and occasionally lameness. The oral ulceration begins as a vesicle and heals over 2 to 3 weeks. Lesions in the lungs are l ess common but may include a focal alveolitis that can develop into an interstitial pneumoni a. Sneezing, conjunctivitis and nasal discharge also occur as bacterial colonize the upper resp iratory tract membranes. Lameness, which is less common, is the result of synovitis. In most cases, with supportive care, signs typically resolve in 7 to 10 days. Morbidity can be high, up to 100%, however mortality is generally low with kittens under 6 months at a higher risk. Les s commonly, outbreaks of more pathogenic forms of FCV with high mortality rate, coined virule nt systemic feline calicivirus (VS-FCV), have been observed whe re clinical signs include respi ratory tract infection, pneumonia , coagulopathies, high fever, and icterus. In practice, definitive diagnosis is not often necessary in the presence of the appropriate history, signs and signalment but in some instances (cattery outbreak, m onitoring patient progress) 117 diagnosis may be desirable. Viral isolation using PCR is now re adily available through commercial laboratories with res ults in 2-7 days (laboratory de pendent). Samples collected for PCR are deep pharyngeal and conj unctival swabs. The Idexx lab, for example, offers a feline Upper Respiratory Disease Re alPCR panel which includes Bordetella biopsies can also be perfo rmed however samples are more difficult to obtain. Treatment consists primarily of supportive care. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are indicated for secondary infections. Cleaning of secretions, nutritional suppo rt (strong smelling foods, appetite stimulants, enteral feeding devices), and nebulization (nebuliz er, steam room) may also be indicated. Systemic antiviral agents have thus far proven ineff ective against FCV and/or (in the case of ribavirin, which is eff ective against FCV) quite toxic to cats and should not be used. Immune modulation with human inte rferon and recombinant feline- origin interferon have been investigated however results thu s far have shown questionable e fficacy. L-lysine supplementation has been recommended as it inhibits arginine, w hich is required for viral replication, however it's efficacy in FCV infected cats has not been proven. Most cats will eliminate the infection and do well if given app ropriate supportive care however, approximately 80% or more of cats that survive acute FCV infect ion will become chronic carrier cats. These cats actively shed virus continuously from their or opharynx, for months to years, and can be clinically asymptomatic. It is estimated that 25% of cli nically healthy breeding cats and approximately 10% of healthy household cats are FCV carriers. R epeated outbreaks in a multi- cat household or population of c ats suggests a carrier cat is p resent. Chronic carrier cats may experience recrudescence of clinical signs, including sneezing episodes, nasal discharge, and chronic gingivitis which may respond completely to antibiotic t herapy only to return 3-5 after discontinuation of antibiotics. D ue to genetic heterogeneity, c ats are susceptible to re-infection. Vaccination against FHV-1/FCV in duces what is called \"nonsteril e\" immunity. This means that vaccination (intranasal or SQ) will prevent or lessen clinical signs, but will not prevent infection nor the establishment of a chroni c carrier state. Vaccination a lso does not prevent virus shedding. By contrast, cats vaccinated and immunized against pa nleukopenia are completely protected in the event of subsequent exposure, this is called \" sterile\" immunity. The FCV vaccine has to take into account the g enetic heterogeneity and since th e result is multiple strains it may be difficult to guarantee protection with a single serovar. Instea d they have selected a few of the more common isolates to formulate the vaccines. Modified live v accines are capable of inducing mild disease (mild upper respiratory signs, transient lameness) , particularly in kittens, and approximately a third of cats vaccinated with intranasal vaccin e develop post-vaccine sneezing. As with any inactivated vaccine, the adjuvants may cause fever, lethargy, injection site reactions and, rarely, sarcoma formation. Intranasal may provide a more r apid onset of act ion (72 hours after a single dose vs. 6-7 days with SQ) and have rarely been associated with oral lesions. This virus is inactivated by many commonly used disinfectants. The current AAFP recommendations for vaccination against FCV/FH V-1/FPV are as follows: 9 weeks, 12 weeks, 15-16 weeks, 1 year booster (12 months followi ng last dose of initial series), 118 booster every 3 years. The third vaccination at the 15-16 week mark was recommended based on maternal antibody interference lasting to 12-13 weeks of age an d interfering with immunization against FPV. The duration of immunity in adult, vaccinated cats has been shown to be at least 5 years. If intranasal vaccines are used a parenteral FPL vaccine is still recommended. Feline Herpesvirus-1 FHV-1 is a double-stranded DNA virus from the alphaherpesvirus subfamily. Since it is a DNA virus it does not have the genetic heterogeneity of FCV so its isolates are similar and vaccine composed of a single serovar. This virus is also found in all f elids but primarily the domestic cat. As with FCV, young cats or cats in group settings are most susc eptible. Route of infection is the same as FCV as it primarily rep licates in the upper respiratory tract and very rarely causes a viremia with more generalized dis ease. Generally speaking, FHV- 1 causes more severe upper respiratory signs (more pronounced nasal discharge, conjunctivi tis), and the cats feel more ill than FCV. Ulcerative keratitis (linear dendritic ulcers) and uv eitis can occur and may be quite severe. Oral ulcers, skin ulcerations, neurologic disease and p ulmonary infection occur rarely. FHV-1 has also been implicated in fading kitten syndrome. Acute infection typically begins as intermittent sneezing which progresses over 2-5 days and lasts 1 - 3 weeks but may result in permanent damage to the nasal turbinates and chronic nasal disc harge. Definitive diagnosis is not frequently clinically important, as discussed above. PCR panels are available and can be performed on deep pharyngeal and conjuncti val swabs if warranted. Treatment is focused primarily on supportive care; including br oad spectrum support and hydr ation support as indicated. Cleaning secretions and humidification can also be of benefit. In cats who develop ocular lesions antiviral topical ophthalmics can also be used. Antiviral medication, specificall y famciclovir, has recently been recommended by opthalmologists fo r cats with severe ocular lesi ons and may shorten the course of the disease although this ha s not yet been widely studied. F amciclovir is well tolerated by cats however the optimum duration of treatment is yet unknown. L-lys ine supplementation has been recommended, as discussed above, ho wever there is conflict amon gst studies regarding its benefit and the cost can vary si gnificantly. Immune modulating interferon (human or recombinant feline) treatment has not shown any benefit. After primary infection, reinfec tion is rare but FHV-1 however, all kittens that recover from acute FHV-1 infection are expected to become chronic carrier ca ts. Healthy appearing carriers maintained in the population serve as reservoirs and can spread virulent virus to susceptible kittens, as well as adult cats, through direct cat-to-cat conta ct or fomite contamination. Chronic carrier cats have a latent infection and shed the virus sporadi cally (versus the continuous shedding of FCV). Stress has b een shown to induce shedding and recrudescence of clinical signs in carrier cats. FHV-1 is less stable in the environment than F CV and susceptible to most disinfectants. Vaccination against FHV-1 is dis cussed above as FHV-1 vaccines are most often combined with FCV vaccination. 119 Feline Infectious Peritonitis FIP is caused by feline coronaviruses, which are large envelope d positive-stranded RNA viruses and is an important cause of death in young cats, particularly in catteries and shelters. Seroprevalence of feline corona virus is 25% in single cat house holds and 75 to 100% in multi- cat households. FIP can occur in cats of any age but is more pr ominent in those less than 3 years old, especially between 4-16 month s of age. There are two bioty pes of feline coronavirus; the highly pathogenic FIPV and the feline enteric coronaviruses (FE CV). FECV is ubiquitous in cats and typically causes a mild gastroenteritis. FIPV is a mutation from FECV which occurs within the intestinal tract of the infected cat during the initial inf ection when replication of FECV is very high. The mutation which causes affinity for replication i n macrophages, allowing for systemic spread of the virus, has been identified however mutat ion still does not guarantee development of FIP. Chronic stre ss appears to increase the rate of FECV replication, leading to a greater chance of mutation. These viruses are highly infective and the transmission route i s fecal-oral. Some strains remain infective for several weeks in the environment however they are susceptible to most disinfectants. Clinical FIP is determined by virus levels, viru lence factors and host factors. Host factors which may play a role, especially if present at the tim e of infection, include immunosuppression, overcrowding , stress and genetic factors. Pu rebred cats are at a higher risk. Most infected cats shed the virus intermittently but some shed chronically and remain reservoirs for infection; this is particularly important in group settings . FECV replicates in enterocytes and destroys the villus tips. Cl inical signs may include mild fever, small bowel diarrhea, and v omiting. When FECV mutates to virulent FIPV it can multiply in macrophages and infected macrophages are deposited in the en dothelial lining of small venules. This is a key point relating to the pathogenesis of di sease. Because of the virus' associate with macrophages, systemic disease (FIP) is more like ly to occur if the infected cat develops a strong humoral respons e to pathogenic FCOV and an in effective cell-mediated immune response. Clinical FIP is an immune-complex disease. Wit h strong cell mediated immunity (CMI) the virus is eliminated or a latent infection oc curs. If there is no CMI, pyogranulomatous vasculitis results. Tiss ue damage occurs due t o an inflammatory response in perivascular locations initiated by antigen-antibody-complement complexes. Subsequently, pleural and peritoneal effusions may develop (wet form). If the re is partial CMI, viral replication slows and granulomas form (dry f orm). The dry form can develop into the wet form. General clinical signs of FIP include an antibiotic non-respons ive fever, weight loss, anorexia and lethargy. In the wet form, d yspnea (due to pleural effusion ), progressive, non-painful abdominal distention (due to as cites) and pericardial effusion are seen. In the dry form any organ may be affected. Icterus, splenomegaly, renal failure, re nomegaly, abdominal masses, coughing and/or dyspnea may be seen. Ocular involvement is comm only noted in the dry form and may cause anterior uveitis, retinal detachments and hemorrh age. Neurologic signs may include multifocal progressive signs such as ataxia, seizures, nystagmus, tremors , hyperesthesia, decreased proprioception and behavioral changes. FIP is one of the most common causes of neurologic disease in cats. Solitary intestinal masses can deve lop which may cause intestinal obstruction. 120 Clinicopathologic findings include a mild to moderate regenerat ive anemia, lymphopenia, and and hyperproteinemia due to hyper-gammaglobulinemia Serum albumin to globulin ratio ( A:G ratio) has good diagnostic value, and at values above 0.8, FIP is extremely unlikely. Azotemia, proteinuria, elevated live r enzymes and coagulopathy may also be observed and are the result of secondary organ damage. CSF analysis in cats with neuro signs may show hyperp roteinemia, increased neutrophils and incr eased lymphocytes (however this not consistent). FIP effusions have a higher diagno stic value than blood tests. The effusions typically have a very high protein content (>35 g/l) but a low cellularity (<5000 nuc leated cells/ml), consisting primarily of macrophages and ne utrophils, and are clear to yell ow and may contain fibrin clots. When sufficient cells are present, the presence of viral antige n in macrophages confirms the diagnosis with a very high positive predictive value (PPV). The A:G ratio can also be measured in effusions; this test has a hig h PPV if the ratio is <0.4 and a high negative predictive value (NPV) if the ratio is >0.8. The demonstration of feline coronav irus-specific antibodies in the itive-str is only meaningful when the titer is high (1:1600), w hereas the absence of antibodies has a good NPV. Serology (immunofluorescence, ELISA, rapid immunomigration), is commonly employed in the diagnosis of FIP however positiv e results only indicate exposur e to feline coronavirus. Most tests can be run on blood as well as effusion. Negative antibod y titer helps to rule out FIP as less than 4% of cats with FIP will have a negative antibody titer. T here is still no test available to differentiate between strains a nd recent FIP vaccination can al so result in a positive titer. Very high titers (1:1600) in combination with other tests which sugg est FIP indicate an increased likelihood of FIP, unless obtai ned from cats in an endemic envi ronment. Positive CSF serology (>1:25) in cats with neuro signs may help to sup port diagnosis of FIP. Serology results should not be compared between laboratories due to different methodologies used. Real-time RT-PCR is a sensitive method to detect virus RNA in a variety of samples (feces, blood, effusions, and tissues) of feline coronavirus-in fected cats and those with FIP ; however, these still cannot differentiate between the biotypes. The gold standard for ante-mortem diagnosis is histopathologic exam of biopsy specimens. Characteristic lesions are pyogranulomatous vasculitis. The mos t commonly affected organs are kidneys, brain and eyes; with liver and lungs affected less fre quently. Immunohistochemistry can be used to demonstrate virus in these specimens. Immunocyto chemistry on cells in CSF or effusion may help. A presumptive ante-mortem diagnosis can be m ade based on signalment, housing history, elimination of o ther differentials and a combi nation of clinicopathologic abnormalities. FIP mortality rate is very high, >95%, once clinical signs deve lop. Survival time typically is 5-7 weeks post-diagnosis, although it varies from days to months. S upportive care includes SC/IV fluids, periodic thoracocentesis , +/- antibiotics, medications (to help to suppress vasculitis). Parenteral and or al interferon (human and feline recombinant), as well antivirals, have also been used without p roven benefit. In multi-cat households that are seropositive, the goal is to c ontrol fecal contamination, stress, 121 fomite transmission and other di sease. Cats are grouped at lowe r numbers (<10) with one litter box for 2 cats. It is recommended to keep cats in stable groups of 3-4. Isolating kittens with the queen for 4-6 weeks then separating them from all adult cats ca n prevent infection with coronavirus. Testing and removal is not possible due to the ina bility to differentiate between FECV and FIPV. The prevalence of high frequency shedders in a c attery is the most significant risk factor for FIP incidence, so eliminating these cats could help control disease. These cats are detected by serial RT-PCR evaluation of fecal samples. Cats mus t be positive for > 8 consecutive months. Seropositive cats usually become seronegati ve within 6 months-1year unless exposed to othe r infected cats. Pfizer has developed the only FIP vaccination which is called P rimucell FIP\u00ae. Vaccination is controversial as humoral immune response has been implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease. The vaccine is a temperature sensitive mutant given in tranasally that replicates locally and, because of its temperature sensitivity, cannot spread beyo nd the upper respiratory tract. In seronegative cats, this may decrease the incidence of FIP to so me degree, but one field study showed no significant reduction in the incidence. Vaccination h as led to ADDE experimentally, but not in the field. Currently its use is only recommended in select situations and it is only given to seronegative cats. Two doses 3-4 weeks apart are given to ca ts older than 16 weeks, then yearly boosters. Unfortunately, in a cattery situation, 50% of kittens will have already been infected by 16 weeks of age. The ideal candidate for vaccinatio n would be an uninfected cat going to a cattery, shelter, or multi-cat household where litte r box sharing is likely. Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV) FeLV is an enveloped RNA retrovirus. The virus is fragile, surv iving a maximum of 24-48 hours at room temperature, and is rapidly inactivated by disinfectant s, soaps and heating. There are 4 primary strains of FeLV (\"A,\" \"B ,\" \"C,\" and \"T\"). FeLV-A is the most abundant subtype and is responsible for transmission of the virus between cats. Vaccina tion against subgroup A virus induces immunity to infection with all subgroups. FeLV is trans mitted through salivary contact, including mutual grooming, shared food and water bowls, sexual contact, and potentially vertical transmission (it has been referred to as the \"lover's disease\" versus FIV which is the \"fighter's disease\"). Transmission is oronasal, the virus then replicates in oral lymphoid tissue, infects circulating mononuclear cells, en ters systemic lymphoid centers , epithelial tissues and bone marrow. The virus is shed in saliva, tears, urine and feces and cats can shed virus for months to years. Transmission may also occur through reuse of instruments , blood transfusions and possibly fleas. FeLV susceptibility varies with age and immune status. Maternal antibodies help protect kittens up to 12 weeks of age from infe ction. After infection, around 7 0+% of neonates, 30-50% kittens aged 8-12 weeks and <10- 20% of immunocompetant adults c ats become persistently viremic. The prevalence is curre ntly around 3.5% nationwide but may be higher in certain populations (catteries). The outcome of infection depend s on: 1) the infectious dose 2) immune status 3) age of the cat and 4) virus strain. Clinical sig ns include malaise, lymphadeno pathy and cytopenias. The virus may be eliminated at or before this stage. Cats with an inadequ ate immune response may appear healthy but develop persistent v iremia and shedding. FeLV relat ed diseases may occur months 122 to years later. Most persistently infected cats die within 4 ye ars and typically die within months of developing clinical signs. In some cats, viremia is followed by latent bone marrow infection. Viral DNA inserts into the host genome and replication is suppr essed by antibody. ELISA, IFA and virus isolation on the blo od and marrow are negative. These cats are not infectious. Most latently-infected cats eventually eliminate the v irus. Less com monly cats develop hematopoietic malignancy months to years later . Cats that have recovered from FeLV are more likely to develop cancer than cats never in fected. Redevelopment of persi stent viremia can occur with immunosuppression. Mediastinal lymphoma is common type in FeLV-infected are FeLV+). Multicentric, renal, spinal and alimentary lym phoma can also occur. FeLV- induced leukemia is acu te and may be granulocytic, eryt hroid, lymphoid or megakaryocytic. Despite the name of the disease, leukemia is le ss common than lymphoma or anemia. Pancytopenia may occur due to marrow infiltration, myel odysplasia and my elofibrosis. Anemia may result from lymphoma, leukemia, chronic disease and immune-mediated destruction. Because these animals are immunosuppressed they ar e predisposed to bacterial, viral, protozoal and infect ions. common, and perip heral lymphadenopathy. Diagnosis is made by antigen detection using ELISA and IFA. F eLV diagnosis relies on antigen testing (p27 core antigen) by ELI SA and/or IFA. ELISA is the sc reening test of choice and is sensitive, cheap and rapid. In-house kits are often used. Sensi tivity and specificity are about 98%. ELISA+ cats should be retested 3 months later as there are 2 potential outcomes. They may eliminate the virus or become persistently infected. As an alternative, an IFA can be performed to verify the result. Cats that are IFA+ are persiste ntly infected. IFA checks for viral antigen within cells and can be done on blood or marrow. ELISA+ / IFA- cats may be in the process of eliminating the infection. They should be retested i n a few months. Saliva and tear ELISA's are less sensitive and specific. Treatment is non-specific and su pportive including blood transf usions, antibiotics, glucocorticoids (may further suppress immune system) and chemot herapy for LSA (survival is usually several months to rarely up to a couple of years). Cats with acute leukemia rarely respond to chemotherapy. A variety of antivirals and immunomodu lators have been used with questionable efficacy. Management of the healthy, viremic cat includes warning owners about the potential for spread to other cats in the household. Before removing a FeLV+ cat, all c ats in the household should be tested. All cats in the household should be kept indoors to mi nimize risk of infection to other cats and introduction of other di seases. In catteries, test an d removal programs have been successful. A sample protocol would be to test all cats and sep arate the positive from negative cats. Then, close the cattery and perform routine disinfection. Retest after 3 months and remove positive cats. Retest all cats every 3-6 months. Test, isolate for 3 months and retest all new introductions. There are several commercially-a vailable vaccines including who le killed vaccines, disrupted virus vaccines and gp70 subunit vaccines. Direct comparison is difficult due to many variables. Vaccines are not completely protective as vaccinated cats have developed FeLV. Vaccination is only recommended for FeLV negative cats. Vaccination is recomme nded for outdoor cats and 123 cats in multi-cat households and shelters. Vaccinating older ca ts is controversial because of age- related resistance. Vaccination does not interfere with testing for FeLV. As with any adjuvanted vaccination, there has been assoc iation with vaccine-associated sarcomas. Feline Immunodeficiency Virus FIV is a lentivirus (enveloped RNA virus), in the same family a s HIV, which causes a chronic infection culminating in immunodeficiency. Infection is primari ly through deep bite wounds, with saliva from an infected cat contacting blood of a negative cat (hence the \"fighter's disease\" reference). Other modes of transmission include sexual contact, blood transfusions, and rarely vertically from queen to kitten. Prevalence of FIV varies across North America according to gend er and age, but is highest in middle-aged intact males. There does not appear to be a signifi cant breed predilections. The average prevalence in North America is ~4.6%, though there is s ignificant regional variation. The mean age at diagnosis is 6-8 years (80% of cats are over 2 years of age). FIV infects CD4+ cells, CD8+ ce lls, B cells and macrophages. So me strains can infect cell types such as astrocytes. Clinical signs are related to gradual immun e system dysfunction as well as FIV-induced neoplastic disease. T here are several stages to the course of disease which begins with replication in lymphoid and salivary tissues causing a pea k viremia in several weeks; during which cats may experience mild \"flu-like\" symptoms (fever, leth argy, anorexia, diarrhea) which often go unrecognized. This is followed by an asymptomatic phas e that may last months to years during which cats have a slow dec line in the number of CD4+ cel ls and the CD4+/CD8+ ratio. They may experience mild systemi c inflammation, lymph node dysf unction, and mild to moderate immunosuppression which manifests as intermittent diar rhea and fever, mild hematologic changes, and being more prone to secondary infectio ns (such as URIs and fungal disease) and certain cancers (lymphoma). They may also have del ayed wound healing, lymphadenopathy, and in extreme cases stomatitis or encephaliti s. When CD4+ cell numbers decrease below a critical level (<200 cells/ul in humans), the immune system begins to fail and viremia becomes more pronounced. This is the terminal phase and is associated with fAIDS. This phase may last months to years and some cats never develop terminal disease. FIV diagnosis uses antibody testing. The most common form o f testing is an ELISA. It is important to note that this test will record positive in animal s exposed to FIV, as well as those vaccinated. Cats may take 1-2 months to test positive after exp osure. Kittens under 6 months of age should not be tested, as there may be interference from mat ernal antibodies leading to false positives. Because of the low prevalence of FIV and the high se nsitivity of the test, a negative ELISA result should be considered truly negative. False negativ es are very rare (except in the case of animals tested too soon after exposure). Despite the ve ry high specificity of the ELISA test, FIV is a rare enough disease that false positives are com mon. Any positive result should be confirmed with further testing (P CR or Western Blot). Conflicti ng results should be confirmed by the third testing type. Vaccinated cats may still test Weste rn Blot positive, while they are unlikely to be PCR positive. Treatment of FIV is primary suppor tive through management of se condary infections and 124 keeping cats indoors to prevent exposure to other diseases. Ant ibiotics and antivirals can be used to control most infections. Imm unomodulatory therapy (corticost eroids or interferon) has been used for stomatitis and dermatitis . Antiretrovira l medications have been used with varying efficacy to treat some conditions , usually stomatitis and encep halitis. Cats in fAIDS crises may be treated with antiretrovirals, however, prognosis remains poo r. AZT (zidovudine) has been the most successful. There are medications that are contraindicated in retroviral in fection. The most commonly used medication being Cyclosporine (Atopica) which should be avoided (all cats who are candidates for cyclosporine therapy should have retroviral screening) as i t may lower T-cell counts too far and cause severe immunosuppression. Corticosteroids are often i ndicated in FIV+ may occur at lower-than-normal doses. Vaccina tion for other conditions should be performed only as necessary as there are reports of F IV+ cats developing vaccine- associated disease with the use of modified-live vaccines (espe cially calicivirus). An inactivated vaccine for FIV is available (Fort Dodge); howev er, it is not fully protective. The vaccine is made from FIV strains A and D, may have up to 80% ef ficacy against these strains. Efficacy against other strains (which vary by region) ranges fr om 0-50%. Vaccinated animals will test ELISA+ indefinitely after v accination. Viral Disease Affecting Dogs Canine Infectious Resp iratory Disease (CIRD) Formerly referred to as infectious tracheobronchitis, CIRD is a n acute, highly contagious disease of dogs that is caused by one or a number of viruses and bacter ia. Most of the pathogens are insufficient in themselves to cause serious disease without the additional stress and high contact rates and multiple viral and bact erial pathogens work sequentia lly and synergistically to cause CIRD. The following agents have been i mplicated with most commonly id entified in bold: Viruses Bacteria Canine parainfluenza (CIV) - discussed in greater detail bel ow The most common mode of transm ission is dog-to-dog contact and outbreaks are most common in high-stress, high-density environments, such as pet stores, boarding and grooming facilities, sporting events, shelters and ve terinary hospitals. Aerosolized respiratory secretions and fomite spread may also important, depending on the pathogen. Clinical signs usually develop one to three days post-exposure (up to 10 days), although this is path ogen-specific. Pathogen shedding varies with infectious agent; viral agents typically shed for t hree to 13 days post-infection, H3N8 125 CIV viral shedding ceases after approximately seven days, canin e distemper virus (CDV), canine adenovirus 1 (CAV-1), B. bronchiseptica and Mycoplasma can be shed by recovered dogs for weeks to months. Clinical signs develop because viruses and/or bacteria colonize the upper respiratory tract, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles and pulmonary interstitium. The m ilder clinical signs are typically seen with single virus infections. Co-infection of other viruse s and bacteria tend to create the more severe clinical signs. Si gns may be mild with a self-limit ing cough or more severe (especially in puppies) with fev er, lethargy, anorexia, gagging , retching, pneumonia, mucopurulent nasal and ocular discharge. Death is u ncommon but can occur. Diagnostic testing is indicated affected dogs are not respondin g to supportive care or if dogs are showing systemic signs of disease. Diagnostic testing is also i ndicated in the face of an outbreak. A definitive diagnosis helps guide effective treatment plans an d control measures; however, it is important to note that many of t he pathogens can be found with some frequency in normal dogs (especially in high-density env ironments) so isolating the same pathogen from multiple dogs is used to raise the index of suspicion. Ideally, acutely affected dogs should be sampled prior to treatment. Collection of specimens from multiple dogs (at least 5-10) may increase the chance of positive test results and identification of the true causative agent. Several diagnostic tests are available but sensitivity and specificity will vary depending o n the pathogens involved, the location of sample collection, a nd the timing of collection. Di agnostic options include culture and sensitivity, serology, virus isolation, polymerase chain re action (PCR), and histopathology. Culture and sensitivity is primarily useful for bacterial pathogens that demonstrate antimicrobial resistance (example, Strep. zoo can carry doxycycline resistance genes). Serology's use is limited due to standard vaccination; however, it is useful for CIV diagnosis in na\u00efve po pulations. Virus isolation is uncommonly u sed and is primarily useful in identifying CIV. PCR testing is t he most practical option for v iral detection and respiratory PCR panels are available from most co mmercial laboratories. False p ositives can result from recent vaccination with a modified live virus and some laboratories no w offer quantitative real-time PCR results that can help differentiate vaccination from field strain infection. Treatment is primarily supportive. Antibiotics are given to add ress secondary bacterial infections in dogs with mucopur ulent to purulent nasal or ocula r discharge or evidence of pneumonia. Doxycycline is a goo d first choice in the absence of antimicrobial susceptibility results because of its efficacy against B. bronchiseptica and its good penetration of lung tissue. Remember, doxycycline is bacteriostatic and in cases of more se vere infections and pneumonia bactericidal antibiotics are indicated. Glucocorticoids have be en used at anti-inflammatory doses short term (up to 5 days) to hel p control cough in dogs that do not have evidence of pneumonia however they do not shorten the course of disease. Concurrent u se of glucocorticoids with bacteriostatic antibiotics is not recommended. Anti-tussives ar e not recommended due to retention of pathogens that shoul d be expectorated. Methylxanth ines (aminophylline, theophylline) have limited use as bronchospasm not a typical feature of CIRD. Nebulization of mucolytic agents or glucocorticoids does not appear to be benef icial but aminoglycosides are effective against B. bronchiseptica when nebulized. Stimulation f or barking should be minimized as should tracheal stimulation fo r collars. Hydration and nutri tional support should be initiated as necessary. Oxygen supplementation may be required in severe cas es. 126 Maternal antibodies to CAV-2 and CPiV are absent by 16 weeks of age. Maternal antibodies to CAV-2 may interfere in puppies up to 16 weeks. Maternal antibo dies to CPiV may interfere up to 6 weeks of age. Maternal immunity for B. bronchiseptica is unknown. Dogs that have been infected by the viruses may be immune from reinfection for 1 ye ar. Dogs may be immune from reinfection of B. bronchiseptica for 6 months. There are numerous vaccines available for the dog that protect against the major com ponents of CIRD. According to the 2011 AAHA Canine Vaccination Guidelines , CDV and CAV-2 vaccines (along with canine parvovirus) are cor e vaccines. Non-core vaccinations include CPiV (usually combin vacci nes have the advantage of being able to be administered to puppies 8 weeks or less (as ea rly as 2 weeks vs. 6 weeks for parenteral) because maternal an tibody does not interfere. Vacci nation 3 to 5 days prior to exposure is required for intranasal vaccines to be effective. D uration of immunity following vaccination to CAV-2 and CPiV are at least 3 years but duration of immunity to B. bronchiseptica is 3 to 10 months which explains recommendations to booster eve ry 12 months. Parental vaccines may result in local irritation or granuloma f ormation and require a booster 3 to 4 weeks following the first vaccination. Intranasal vaccines th at contain live, attenuated B. bronchiseptica can cause sneezing, coughin g and nasal discharge. The prognosis is good with mos t dogs developing mild self-limit ing signs. Complicated pneumonias carry a more guarded prognosis, especially in young dogs. Infected d ogs should be isolated and the premises disinf ected. Bear in mi nd that high p ressure washing can aerosolize pathogen particles and further sp read the disease therefore low pressure washing with standard disinfectants is indicated. As with any highly contagious disea se, these dogs pose a risk to other hospitalized dogs so their hospita lization should be limited an d appropriate precautions taken to prevent spread. Canine Influenza Canine influenza is caused by an RNA virus, a type A Orthomyxov irus which originated as a mutated form of equine influenza virus and is now widespread in pet dogs across the continental USA. Peak viral shedding precedes clinical signs, making the pr evention of transmission difficult. Additionally, H3N8 CIV has a shorter incubation peri od than other causes of CIRD. Historically, there has been re gular CIV activity in the NE USA , as well as CO, TX, Las Vegas, and CA. CIV is highly infectious and morbidity rates can be as high as 60-80%. In 80-90% cases, dogs present with mild u pper respiratory signs, but in 1 0-20% cases, severe lower respiratory tract signs are observed and co-infections can be i dentified. Mortality rates are very low for single-agent infections with CIV but can occur, especia lly with co-infections. A new strain of CIV (H3N2) was isolated from Chicago in early 2015. T he strain is closely related to H3N2 Asian influenza strains a nd can infect both dogs and cats. There have been no documented feline cases in the USA. Transmission is via aerosolization and fomites (including peopl e). The virus incubates in 2 to 5 days and about 80% of infected dogs develop clinical signs but all infected dogs shed the virus for 7 to 10 days after the incubation period. Signs are similar to CIRD and may be mild or severe. The majority of dogs de velop a cough that may last 3 we eks and is unresponsive to 127 antibiotics and cough suppressant s. The cough may be dry or moi st. Purulent nasal discharge is common and is secondary to bacterial infection by opportunistic bacteria. Fever is also common. Occasionally dogs will develop tachypnea and dyspnea. Consolida tion of lung lobes may be seen. Ante mortem diagnosis is most of ten made via serologic tests. D iagnosis of CIV can be made by PCR or virus isolation only in the early stages of infection be fore viral shedding ceases; antibody testing is required after viral shedding stops. Antibody titers will begin to rise 10 days after infection. Commercially available PCR panels can detect a wide range of CIRD pathogens from nasal or oropharyngeal swabs, in cluding CIV. False negative PCR results can occur when the specimen is taken after viral shedding has ceased which is comm on because shedding ceases by seven days after infection. The Cornell Animal Health Diagnosti c Center offers virus isolation testing for both H3N8 and H3N2 C IV. CIV infection can also be d iagnosed through Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) testing for anti-CIV antibodie s. Antibodies appear as early as 7 days after development of clinical signs. This test relies on s ubmission of paired serum specimens to demonstrate a rising convalescent titer two to thr ee weeks after the in itial titer. It is still important to view titer results in light of the animal's history and clinical signs. As with other viral respiratory d iseases, treatment is supporti ve to include antibiotics for secondary bacterial infections as well as maintaining hydration and nutritional status. Antiviral agents do not appear effective wi th this disease. Even though i nfection has a high morbidity rate, the mortality rate is less than 8%. Zoetis currently manufactur es separate killed vaccines against CIV H3N2 (currently under conditio nal licensing) and H3N8. They are labeled for vaccination of healthy dogs as an aid in the co ntrol of disease associated wit h canine influenza virus infection. Vaccine selection should be based on the CIV endemic in the reg ion and/or emergent outbreak strain. For initial vaccination, two doses are given 2 to 4 wee ks apart. This vaccine can be administered to puppies as young as 6 weeks of age. Annual boos ters are required. Vaccination for this infection is considered non-core and recommended for i ndividuals at risk of exposure. The virus is susceptible to quarternary ammoniums and bleach. S uspects should be isolated and handled accordingly. Canine Distemper Virus CDV is a morbillivirus in the Paramyxoviridae family of viruses . It is a single-stranded RNA virus, enveloped in a lipid outer membrane that is easily disru pted by any disinfectant with detergent activity. Transmission is via inhalation of aerosoliz ed secretions from an infected animal or contact with infected fomites. CDV replicates in lymp hoid, nervous, and epithelial shed in respirato ry and conjunctival exudates, f eces, saliva, vomitus, and urine of infected animals for 7 to 10 da ys, although some dogs shed viru s for up to 60 to 90 days post infection. The virus is engulfe d by macrophages and carried in the lymphatic system to lymph nodes in the pharynx and lungs, as well as to the tonsils. The incubation period can last between 1 and 3 weeks after exposure. Signs are reflective of CDV's epi thelial tropism and secondary bacterial infections of these tis sues occur as a result. Severi ty also appears to be related to the host immune response. Young and unvaccinated dogs are at the hi ghest risk although outbreaks have been reported in vaccinated animals. CDV infected dogs typically prese nt with fever, lethargy, anore xia, and dehydration. Respiratory signs may include ocular and na sal discharge (m ucopurulent to p urulent), dyspnea and cough. GI signs may include anorexia, vomiting and diarrhea. Neurologi c signs may include blindness, 128 seizures and myoclonus. Neurologic signs may be concurrent with other signs or may present months to years after the initial infection. CDV infection is o ne of the most common causes of seizures in patients under six months of age. Hyperkeratosis of the foot pads, 'Hard pad', and nasal planum are more chronic si gns. Enamel hypoplasia may also occur in young patients. CDV may cause a lymphopenia and t hrombocytopenia. Radiographs m ay initially be a diffuse interstitial pattern that develops into a bronchial or alveolar as secondary bacterial or extensive necrosis occurs. Eosinophilic inclusion bodies can be found in infected cells (WBC, RBC, epithelial cells). The gold standard for diagnosing CDV infecti on is reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, which can be perfor med on any tissue sample. Urine is a good sample for RT-PC R, as the virus may persist lon ger in urine than in other tissues. Immunofluorescent assay techniques (IFA) can be performed on re also be performed and should consist of paired samp les taken while the animal is sick and again during recovery. Treatment is supportive and focused mainly on preventing second ary bacterial infection. Intravenous fluids, antiemetics, prokinetics and nutritional su pport may be necessary for GI signs. Systemic antibiotic ther apy is indicated if bacterial pn eumonia develops. Anticonvulsants may be necessary for neurologic si gns. Isolation of infected in dividuals is important to prevent spread to other patients in the hospital via aerosolized secret ions. CDV vaccination is considered a core vaccine. Vaccination is pr otective and in puppies begins at 6 to 8 weeks of age then every 3 to 4 weeks until 14 to 16 week s of age followed by revaccination at one year then every 3 to 5 years. In adults, a single dose of MLV is given with a booster at 1 year then every 3 to 5 years. The prognosis is guarded for acute CDV infection. Acute encepha litis carries a poorer prognosis. Infectious Canine Hepatitis Infectious canine hepatitis results from adenovirus-1 infection (related to adenovirus-2 a cause of kennel cough). The virus can be inactivated by heat and iodine- based disinfectants. Exposure is via the oronasal route. The virus moves to tonsils, regional LN , via hematogenous spread then to numerous tissues. During acute i nfection, the virus is present in all body secretions and continues to be shed in the urine for up to 9 mos. The virus has a predilection for the liver, attacking the Kupff er cells, as well as endothelial cells. Hepatic necrosis, endot helial damage and DIC Glom erulonephritis and anterior uveitis with corneal edema (blue eye) have also been reported. Most infections are subclinical however severe cases can result in death. Clinical signs vary b ut may include fever, anorexia, hepatomegaly, DIC, jaundice, and abdominal pain with or without effusion. There are several tests specific for infectious canine hepatiti s (IgM, IgG, and ELISA). On a serum chemistry profile the liver enzymes usually are elevated (ALT, AST, ALP, and GGT). Hypoglycemia, hypoalbuminemia, and bilirubinuria may also be ob served secondary to liver failure. 129 Vaccination is typically part of a multivalent modified live va ccination for dogs along with distemper and parvovirus and follows the same protocol. Viral Disease Affecting both Dogs and Cats Canine Parvovirus and Feline Panleukopenia Virus Canine parvovirus (CPV) infecti on is a common, highly contagiou s disease that may be fatal. Feline panleukopenia is less co mmon than canine parvovirus infe ction. These are tiny, resistant non-enveloped DNA viruses that su rvive months, and sometimes ov er a year, on inanimate objects. They are resistant to most disinfectants apart from bl each (1:30 dilution) and glutaraldehyde (requires 10 min contact time). CPV has a high c apacity to mutate and CPV-2c differs by a point mutation (Glu -426) in the DNA chain. Most su sceptible dogs and cats are exposed to and infected by these viruses in their first year of life. Newer strains of CPV-2 may now be causing many cases of feline viral enteritis, which are being increasingly recognized. FPV does not infect dogs. Transmission is fecal-oral via exposu re to feces, vomit or virus persistence on fomites. CPV-2 an d FPV are shed a couple of days before clinical signs and shedding continues for a maximum of 6 weeks after recovery (usu ally 2-3 weeks). CPV-2 enteritis is of highest incidence in the summer. Most infections with CPV-2 and FPV are subclinical. With CPV-2, puppies 6 weeks to 6 months of age are most susceptible due to declining maternal antibody, parvovirus preference for rapidly dividing cells and concurrent presence of intestinal parasites. Rottweilers, Dobermans, Pit Bull terriers and German Shepherds ar e at increased risk. With FPV, the highest morbidity and mortality is in unvaccinated kittens aged 3 to 5 months. Fading kitten syndrome may also occur. Once ingested the virus incubates for 4 to 14 days for CPV-2 an d 2 to 10 days for FPV. The virus then replicates in orophar yngeal lymphoid tissues. Viremi a develops and then the virus spreads throughout the body selec tively damaging rapidly dividi ng cells in particular, the GI epithelium (crypt cells), lymph nodes and bone marrow ( neutropenia, lymphopena). Translocation of intestinal bacteria can result in septicemia, endotoxemia and DIC. Puppies who are infected in-utero or up to 8 weeks of age and may develop v iral myocarditis. Infection of queens early in gestation may result in infertility, resorption or abortion. Kittens infected late in gestation or early in the neonatal period may have damage to th e developing neural tissues (especially the cerebellum), optic nerve and retina. The most c ommon lesion in these cats is cerebellar hypoplasia. Clinical signs may include lethargy, decreased appetite, vomiti ng, diarrhea and abdominal discomfort. Rapid dehydration ma y occur. Pyrexia and leukopenia may be evident. Some animals develop secondary intestinal intussusceptions. Sudden d eath may occur within 1 to 2 days of illness usually due to gram negative sepsis, shock and DIC. Chronic diarrhea may persist occasionally in dogs and cats due to extensive bowel damage and secondary fibrosis. Canine myocarditis may be associated w ith sudden death or congestive h eart failure. Some kittens in a litter may show cerebellar signs once they reach 2 to 3 weeks o f age (ataxia, intention tremors, in coordination, broad-based stance) . These kittens can be accepta ble pets. Forebrain damage may result in seizures and behavioral changes. Neurologic signs in dogs with parvovirus enteritis may result from hypoxia due to myocarditis, intracranial hemorrhage (DIC) or hypoglycemia. 130 Signalment, vaccination history, clinical signs and leukopenia are suggestive. Leukopenia does not occur in all cases. Severe GI signs and leukopenia can also occur with other GI infections, especially salmonellosis. The most common test used is an in-ho use fecal ELISA assay for CPV-2 antigen (also detects some FPV). It is very sensitive and specific. False positive results could occur 5 to 12 days after vaccination (with modified live vaccine). Negative results do not rule out infection. CPV-2 is ofte n not present in the stool up to 5 to 7 days after onset of illness. Virus isolation can be performed on feces or tissues. Jejunum, ileum, mesenteric LN and other hemagglutination, therefore inhibition of hemagglutination by serial diluti ons of antibody can be used to measure the antibody titer to CPV-2. Virus neutralization and ELISA assays are also available to detect antibodies. In-house antibody tests have been developed to CPV-2 and their primary u se is to decide whether to vaccinate animals in which vaccination may not be desirable. Treatment for CPV typically consists of hospitalization and hyd ration and nutritional support. Electrolytes, glucose and total protein are monitored. A recent study showed early enteral nutrition via naso-esop hageal tube 12 hours after admission res ulted in earlier clinical improvement and significant weight gain compared with using NPO until vomiting had ceased for 12 hours. Antimicrobials s hould be given to treat possible sepsis. Ampicillin or cephalosporins may be sufficient for uncomplicated cases. Gram negative coverage can be increased in severe cases with enrofloxacin or gentamicin. Dewo rming and treatment for Giardia may be indicated once GI signs improve. CPV vaccination is considered a c ore vaccination in dogs. Mater nal antibody interference is the primary cause of vaccination failure. Modified live vaccination s produce higher titers more likely to overcome maternal antibody interference at an earlier time point. With current canine parvovirus vaccines, there is now only a short period (few days to 2 weeks) where maternal antibody can interfere with vaccination (i.e. window of vulnera bility). In order to be fully protective, the final booster must be given when the animal is at least 14-16 weeks age. MLV vaccines replicate in the GI tract and are shed in feces but ar e safe. Killed CPV-2 vaccines produce a weaker response. They should not be used in contamina ted environments because the window of vulnerability is too great. Confining puppies until 1 week after the last vaccination helps to minimize exposure during the window of vulnerability. Immunity generated by MLV vaccines is of long duration so after the initial vaccination s eries, boosters should be repeated every 3 years. In susceptible cats, MLV vaccine is given at 6 to 8 weeks then every 3 to 4 weeks with final booster between 14-16 weeks of age. Initial vaccine series is b oostered every 3 years. Initial vaccination in adult cats consists of the MLV vaccine is given twice 3 to 4 weeks apart then every 3 years. Inactivated products are indicated for pregnant queens, colostrum-deprived kittens <4 weeks of age, and immunosuppressed cats. Rabies This is an enveloped RNA virus th at can infect any mammal and i s quickly inactivated by heat, sunlight and disinfectants. Different strains affect raccoons, bats and skunks and when these strains infect mammals other than their common hosts, death occ urs. Typically, infection is via a bite but aerosolization is possi ble. Occasionally in humans the source is unknown and has even 131 occurred as a result of organ transplantation. In Oregon, Washi ngton, and Idaho, bats are the only reservoir species, and other animals (notably bat predator s such as foxes or cats) are only rarely infected as \"spillover\" f rom rabid bat p opulations. In o ther parts of the U.S., skunks, raccoons and foxes are important reservoirs in addition to bats . In many other parts of the world, dogs and other carnivores are the primary reservoirs and dogs a ccount for the most human exposures worldwide. W ildlife rabies has be en increasing and do g and farm animal rabies decreasing in the US, thanks to mandatory vaccination and repor ting protocols. Raccoons account for most feline exposures and there have been more case s of rabies in cats than dogs in the last 20 years. The virus incubates for weeks to up to 2 months in dogs and cat s and time it takes to show clinical signs can vary dependin g on location of the bite wound . Replication begins locally at the site of the bite and then the virus travels to the neuromuscula r junction, the peripheral nerves and finally to the forebrain. The vi rus then causes death or moves to other peripheral nerves and tissues (including salivary glands ). Studies have established t hat, in dogs, shedding begins at most 3 days before signs occur; in cats, it is 1 day before. Sh edding may persist until the animal dies, which is typically within a few days. Little or nothing i s known about the shedding period in other species. The rationale for a 10-day confinement period for dogs, cats and ferrets rests on this observed interval between v iral shedding and onset, padded by a healthy margin of safety. Animals may exhibit one or all th ree of the phases: prodromal, furious/excitative and paralytic/dumb. During the prodrom al phase mild fe ver, behavior al and voice changes may be noted. During the \"furious\" phase excitability, photophobia, hy peresthesia, aggression, pica, drooling, muscle tremors and in coordination may occur. Seizure, coma and death can also occur during the furious phase. The so- called \"dumb\" phase is charact erized by reclusive behavior, salivation, anorexia, a startle response to sudden noise or lig ht exposure and irritation around the site of the bite, resulting in frequent licking and biting of t he area. In the para lytic phase cranial nerve paralysis can occur and deat h within 2 to 4 days from res piratory muscle paralysis. Rabies should be a differential for any acute behavioral change or fla ccid paralysis. Suspects should be handled VERY cautiously with app ropriate personal protective eq uipment and public health authorities should be contacted. MLV vaccines were associated with post-vaccinal rabies in some cats, so dog and cat rabies vaccines in the US are now inactivated. These have been associa ted with a higher incidence of allergic reactions and vaccine-as sociated sarcomas (1:5000 cats ), which can occur months to years after vaccination. Purevax\u00ae (Merial) is a non-adjuvanted, recombinant rabies/Canarypox vaccine that expresses immunogeni c rabies proteins in the host and is thought to be less likely to contribute to vaccine-associated sarcoma formation. In dogs and cats the first vaccination is given at no less than 3 months of age, followed by a booster on e year later, then every 1-3 years depending on the vaccine and the local regulations. Except for Purevax\u00ae (above), 1 year vaccinations are not recommended. Rabies vaccines should be giv en parenterally in the right rear limb. One injection does not give adequate protection. Boo ster vaccinations should be given when vaccination history is un certain. Vaccinated animals should be boostered after suspected exposure to rabies. If a domestic animal is bitten by a wild animal that cannot be tested, that wild animal is 132 considered to be rabid. Bite wounds should be washed under pres sure with large amounts of warm soapy water, a QUAT compou nd, and/or ethanol solution and the following situations considered. Immediate copious lavage is the best way to reduce viral load at the site of the bite and prevent local viral replication. Dogs and cats bitten by rabies suspects are handled differently depending on vaccination status and local public health policy. If an unvaccinated dog, cat or ferret has known contact with a known rabid animal, the bitten animal should be humanely euthan ized under direction of the local public health authority (always consult with them before euthanizing an animal for rabies). If the owner will not permit this, the animal must undergo a su pervised quarantine for 6 months, with the vaccine administered either as soon a quarantine start s or 1 month prior to release. A dog, cat or ferret with a current rabies vaccination that has h ad a known contact with a rabid animal should be revaccinated a nd confined at home for 45 days (indoors, in a fenced yard, or on a leash at all times). All animal bites inflicted on people should be reported to loca l public health officials. Quarantine protocol differs among counties, even within the same state, so it is prudent to stay in contact with public health offices and st ay abreast of local policies s o you can relay accurate information to owners. Typically, if a healthy, vaccinated dog or cat has i nflicted a bite the pet is confined and observed for 10 days, especially if the bite was unprovoked . Again, these bites still require reporting and the quarantine w ill be followed by a public healt h official. If the pet is unvaccinated local policy may requi re the animal to be euthaniz ed and tested or quarantined for 10 days in an approved quarantine facility; this will be at the discretion and guidance of local public health authorities. If the animal is a stray it is typic ally euthanized and tested, regardless of presence or absence of neurologic signs. Any illness or neur ologic signs in quarantined animals should immediately be reported to public health officia ls. Rabies should be a differential for any acute behavioral change or flaccid paralysis. Suspects should be handled VERY cautiously and public health authorities should be contacted. When rabies suspects are euthanized the head should be submitted ref rigerated (not frozen) for histologic diagnosis in which Negri bodies (eosinophilic viral inclusions) are seen within neurons. Fluorescent antibody te sting is more se nsitive and is also done on the brain. Canine Lyme Borreliosis Caused by a spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, that affects dogs, cats, horses, cattle and humans. The incidence is highest in New England, the upper Midwest and mid-Atlantic States. There is a smaller endemic focus on the west coast. The vector is Ixodes scapularis (Midwest) and I. pacificus (West coast). Uninfected tick la rvae feed on small rodents. The nymphs feed on mice or larger mammals such as dogs, humans and deer. Adults feed on large mammals. Ticks acquire infection at any stage and are most likely to acquire i nfection from the white-footed mouse Peromyscus leucopus . Transmission requires 48 hours of attachment. The spiroc hete replicates and migrates away fro m the tick bite site through co nnective tissues. Persistent infection is then established. Most cases of Lyme disease are subclinical. In endemic areas se ropositivity may be as high as 85% but only 5-10% of infected d ogs show signs. Some seropositi vity may result from 133 nonpathogenic spirochetes. Signs result mainly from the host's inflammatory reaction. In dogs, erythema migrans (cutaneous rash seen in man) does not occur. S igns of arthritis, fever, lymphadenopathy and anorexia occu r several months after tick ex posure. A small percentage of dogs may be susceptible to a severe, treatment-resistant arthri tis. Dogs may also develop a severe protein-losing nephropa thy with anorexia, vomiting, leth argy and profound weight loss. Golden Retrievers and Labs seem predisposed. Co-infection with Anaplasma phagocytophilum may occur (i.e. canine granulocytic ehrlichiosis). Diagnosis can be difficult as clinical signs and laboratory abn ormalities are nonspecific. Joint taps reveal a neutrophilic arthritis. Culture from symptomatic animals is diagnostic, but expensive, can take 6 weeks and is insensitive. Skin biopsies c an be useful from around the tick bite site. PCR has variable se nsitivity. Antibody titers can be run but seropositivity does not mean a dog's signs are due to th e spirochete. Paired titers are needed for definitive diagnosis. Vaccination results in false positives using ELISA and IFA. Wes tern Blotting can be used to discriminate between natural infection, vaccination and \"dual s tatus\". The IDEXX SNAP 3Dx test uses an ELISA that detects antibody against the C6 antigen . This antigen is only expressed during active infection and so will only be positive with natur al infection. Doxycycline is the first choice in treatment. Improvement is no ted within the first 24-48 hours. Treat for 4 weeks. Relapse can occur but most cases respond to a second course of antibiotics. The infection is probably not eve r completely cleared. NSAID's may also be used. Immunosuppressive doses of gluc ocorticoids should be avoided. Prevention consists of inspection for ticks, topical ectoparasi ticides and/or amitraz collars. Routine prophylactic use of antimicrobials to prevent disease i s NOT recommended. The risk of humans acquiring infection after a deer tick bite in an endemic area is <2%. Vaccinations do not provide absolute protection. There are 2 vaccines available for dogs: a bacterin and a recombinant OSPA (outer surface protein A) subunit vaccine. All ergic reaction can occur with the bacterin vaccine but the risk is low. Concern exists that v accination may induce autoantibody formation leading to arthritis or glomerulonephrit is. Limit vaccination to outdoor, hunting or field trial dogs in endemic areas. Vaccinate before the tick season and never use the vaccine as a substitute for tick control. Endoparasites Roundworms - Ascarids Toxocara canis and Toxocaris the dog. Toxocara Toxascaris leonina found in cats . Baylisascaris procyonis is an ascarid of raccoons that is occasionally found in dogs. Baylisascaris procyonis occurs in raccoons across the U.S. and Canada, with the highest preval ence in the midwe stern and north eastern U.S. and along the west coast. T. canis can undergo transplacental transmission. T. canis and T. cati are also transmitted in the milk. Infection can also occur by ingestion of ova or ot her hosts. Almost all puppies are born infected with T. canis and produce eggs by 3 weeks of age. Signs are typically seen in young animals and include vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, dull coat and failure to thrive. Occasionally intussusception and intestinal obstruction can occ ur. Diagnosis is made on routine fecal flotation. Pyrantel, pyrantel/febantel, mil bemycin oxime, moxidectin and 134 praziquantel are all effective. Puppies and kittens should be d ewormed with pyrantel pamoate at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 16 weeks of age then at 6 month intervals. T he lactating bitch or queen should also be treated. Zoonosis is a c oncern with visceral larval mig rans in children. Hookworms Ancylostoma caninum is the most common hookworm in the dog and A. tubeforme in the cat. A. braziliiense occurs in dogs in the southern US and Uncinaria stenocephala in the Northern US and Canada. Infection occurs transplacentally, transmammary, v ia ingestion of the third-stage larvae or ingestion of other vertebrate hosts with infective la rvae in their tissues. Infective larvae are often in the dirt and grass of contaminated areas. Clinical findings include vomiting, dark and tarry diarrhea (melena), weakness, pale mucous membranes, d ehydration, anemia and poor growth. Cutaneous lar val migrans also occurs in dogs and cats ( hookworm dermatitis). Diagnosis is made by identification of ova in feces. Treatment is as described for roundworms although some animals need supportive therapy to keep them aliv e until the drugs can kill the worms. Pyrantel pamoate is the t reatment of choice for infected puppies. All dogs in an infected environment should be treated and feces should be removed from the premises promptly. Prophylactic treatment in puppies and kittens can begin at 2 to 3 weeks of age. Hookworms can cause visceral and cutaneous larval migrans in man. Tapeworms Dipylidium caninum is the most common tapeworm of the dog and cat. The flea or, mo re rarely, lice is the intermediate host. Echinococcus granulosus uses dogs as a definitive host (no signs) and humans as definitive hosts (important zoonosis). Very rarel y heavy infestations of D. caninum have been associated with diarrhea, weight loss and failure to thrive in dogs and cats . D. caninum can cause anal pruritis. Proglo ttids may be noted on the perine um or egg capsules demonstrated in the feces. Treat ment is with flea control, fenb endazole, pyrantel/febantel +/- praziquantel, praziquantel of choice. Strongyloides Strongyloides stercoralis can affect young puppies. Infect ion is via ingestion, transmamm ary and skin penetration. Hemorrhagic enteritis can occur and may r esult in death. Baermann funnel technique or fresh smears are pe rformed for larvae. Treatment i s with thiabendazole, fenbendazole or ivermectin. Dogs with diarrhea should be prompt ly isolated from dogs that appear healthy. It is a potential zoonosis particularly if the person is immunosuppressed. Whipworms Trichuris vulpis is reported in the dog. T. serrata and T. campanala occur in the cat (rare in domestic cats in North America). Infection is oral fecal. Infec ted ova are ingested, hatch in the small intestine and larvae migrate to the cecum and colon where they attach to the wall. Clinical signs reflect host resp onse. Dogs may be asymptomatic or develo p large bowel diarrhea often streaked with mucus and fresh blood. Anemia and hypoproteinemia may also develop. Dogs may also develop pseudo-hypoadren ocorticism in which hyperkalem ia, hyponatremia and hypochloremia can occur. Diagnosis is made by identification of ova on fecal flotation. Ova may be shed intermittently and missed on fecal examination. The organism is susceptible fenbendazole, treatment at 3 weeks and 3 months. 135 Ectoparasites Fleas and ticks do occur in the Willamette Valley. Our current protocol for flea and tick control consists of administration of Revolution\u00ae given monthly beginni ng in May through October and Frontline Plus\u00ae from October through April. Revolution\u00ae will co mbat heartworm as well as external parasites in the heartworm susceptible months. Alterna ting with Frontline Plus\u00ae will help avoid/delay the development of resistance in fleas and tic ks. We will also be offering additional types of flea and tic k preventative including Capsta r\u00ae, Program\u00ae, Advantix\u00ae and soft (argasid) ticks. Soft ticks ar e found in the southern US and often colonize the external ear canal where larva and nymphs fe ed off the lymph in the ear canal. Hard ticks are more likely to be parasitic and spread disease. Rhipicephalus sanguineus , the brown dog tick, can transmit babesiosis, anaplasmosis , E. canis, F. tularensis and cause tick paralysis. Dermacentor variabilis , the American dog tick, can transmit RMSF, tularemia, anaplasmosis and cause tick paraly sis. Ticks may cause anemia a s all stages feed on blood and lymph. Treatment options are man ual removal and topical insecti cides. Exercise care when manually removing to ensure the whole tick is removed. Fipronil (Frontline\u00ae ) kills all parasitic stages of ticks within 48 hours of application and has residual activity for one month. Fipronil kills ticks before they attach and has residual activity for 1 month. Amitraz collars (Preventic\u00ae collar) are also helpful in causing ticks to detach as well as prevent attachment. There are various dips and sprays that can also be used. Caution should b e exercised in cats with these products as some cause serious side effects. The premises can a lso be treated with malathion, diazinon or chlorpyrifos. Fleas Ctenocephalides felis is the most common flea of the dog and cat . Ctenocephalides canis, Echidnophaga gallinacean and Pulex irritans may also infest the dog. The flea is an obligate parasite of the dog and cat and infestation is by contact with an infested environment (not directly from another animal). Fleas thrive in moist, warm envi ronments. They can survive on a host for up to 100 days but will die within 2 to 4 days off the host. Fleas serve as an intermediate host for tapeworms so ingestion of an infected flea can lead to infection with tapeworms. Annoyance and pruritus are common complaints. Heavy infestation s can lead to iron deficiency anemia and death, particular ly in young animals. Ctenocephalides cau sed by hypersensitivity to anti genic material from the salivary glands of fleas. Treatment of fleas consists of t reating the pet (adult stage co mposes 5% of total population) and environment (eggs, larvae and pu pa consist of 95% of total popu lation). Lufeneron (Program\u00ae) is an insect development inhibito r given monthly that inhibits chitin synthesis. Chitin is essential for egg and larval development th us this product prevents eggs from hatching and flea larvae from maturing. Lufeneron does not kill adult fleas so it is bes t used in conjunction with an adulticide (Frontline\u00ae, Advantage\u00ae). It will take 1 to 3 month s to benefit from full effects. 136 Lufeneron is available with milbemycin oxime (Sentinel\u00ae) to con trol fleas and heartworm. This product can be used in puppies and kittens form 6 weeks of age. Fipronil (Frontline\u00ae) is an adulticide applied monthly for flea s in cats and every 3 months for dogs. Fipronil is a GABA inhibito r. GABA is an essential neurot ransmitter in the CNS of fleas. It kills all fleas within 24 hours. Fipronil has no effect agai nst eggs or larvae. The spray can be used in puppies form 2 days of age and kittens 7 weeks of age. The topical can be used in puppies 10 weeks and older and kittens 12 weeks and older. Imidacloprid (Advantage\u00ae) is also an adulticide applied monthly that binds nicotinic receptors and disrupts nerve transmission. This product kills all fleas w ithin 24 hours but has no effects on eggs or larvae. It can be used in puppies 6 weeks and older and kittens 8 weeks and older. Nitenpyram (Capstar\u00ae) is an oral tablet that kills adult fleas within several hours. It can be administered as frequently as on ce daily and to puppies and kit tens as young as 4 weeks of age. Best used with longer-acting products. Selamectin (Revolution\u00ae) is a mon thly avermectin that affects c hloride channels in fleas. This product kills adults and prevents eggs from hatching. It is als o used to prevent heartworm infection, control ticks cats it may also treat hookworm and roundwor m infections. This product can be administered in puppies and kittens 6 weeks and older. Flea collars with insect growth inhibitors are also available ( methoprene, nylar-permethrin). Some are adulticides but others only affect eggs and larvae. It is also important to treat the environment. Insect growth in hibitors can be used to render eggs and larvae non-viable (e.g methopr ene, chlorpyrifo s, diazinon and malathion. The re are also newer treatments including borate used on carpet and Interrupt\u00ae (a nematode that kills flea larvae/pupae in grass and soil). The premises should be treated every month until the re is no evidence of fleas then every 3 to 4 months. Steam clean ing and routine vacuuming can a lso assist in the decrease of the environmental burden. C. Felis can transmit many zoonotic agents including cat scratch ). Ingestion of infected fleas by children can result in development of adult D. caninum (tapeworm) 137 Summary of parasiticides Primarily Endoparasiticide y Species D, C 5-10mg/k g Panacu r Fenbendazole A, H, W, T, G D, C 50 mg/kg x 3 d Droncit Praziquantel T, D D, C Not in < 4 wks Drontal Praziquantel Pyrantel pamoate A, H, D, T C Not in < 4 wks or < 1.5 lb Drontal Plus Praziquantel, pyrantel Febantel A, H, W, D, T D Not in < 3 wks or < 2 lb Heartgar d Plus Ivermectin Feline n H , H W M C HWM, not < 6 weeks Sentinel Milbemycin oxime Lufeneron A, H, W D Fleas, HWM, not in < 4 weeks, not in < 2 lb Ivomec Ivermecti n S D , C 200g/kg, repeat 2 weeks, not in collies Tribrisse n TMZ coccidi a D, C 15 mg/kg PO BID x 7 d 138 Primarily Ectoparasiticide Revolutio n Selamecti n A,H( c a t -cats:>8 (cat), Sarcoptes Advantage II Pyriproxifen D cats Fleas Advantage Multi Imidacloprid Moxidectin A, H, W(dog) Imidacloprid Permethrin D>7w e Fleas, ticks, biting lice, mosquitos Capsta r Nitenpyra >2lb -cats: >4 weeks and >2lb Fleas, Works in 30 mins, can be used daily Frontline Fipronil D, C > 8 weeks Flea, tick, chewing lice Frontline Plus Fipronil S-methoprene D, C > 6 weeks Fleas, ticks, chewing lice Progra m Lufenero n D, C > 8 weeks 6 mo injectable for cats Easy Spot Fipronil C>8w e e k s Flea, tick, chewing lice Parasta r Fipronil D Flea, tick, chewing lice Promeris Trifexis Spinosad/milbemyci H, R, W D No cats Flea Promeris Metaflumizone Cf l e a s Vectr a 3D Dinotefuran, permethrin, pyriproxifen D No cats Flea, moquitoes Sarolane r D Flea, (no A = ascarids, H = hookworms, W = whipworms, T = Taenia, D = Dip ylidium caninum, G strongyloides, HWT = heartworm 140 VMC 797 Small Animal Critical Care & Hospital Service Rotation COURSE COORDINATOR : DR. JANA GORDON COURSE OBJECTIVE : To give students hands on practic al experience in managing smal l animal cases in the intensive care unit setting. The veterinary teachi ng hospital restricts after hours emergencies to previously evaluated animals as well as dogs and cats of students, staff and faculty of the College of Veterinary Medicine. Because of this, exposure to routine emergency cases is limited. Specifically students will: PERFORM PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS PERFORM PATIENT ASSESSMENTS ADMINISTER TREATMENTS PERFORM DIAGNOSTIC AND THERAPEUTIC PROCEDURES OBTAIN DIAGNOSTIC SAMPLES INTERPRET DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS RECORD DATA IN THE MEDICAL RECORD PARTICIPATE IN DAILY ROUNDS WITH ICU STAFF REVIEW COMMON CONDITIONS SEEN IN EMERGENCY MEDICINE REVIEW EQUIPMENT USED IN THE ICU. PERSONAL GROOMING : Your appearance should be clean and neat. Long ha ir should be r estrained so that it does not touch the patient, fingernails must not extend beyond the tip o f the finger, no nail polish, minimize jewelry on your hands because it interferes with hand cleaning. Remember to wash your hands thoroughly before and after handling each patient. DRESS CODE: Students should wear clean scrubs , a white lab coat (in case of client interaction) and a name tag. The lab coat is protective clothing and you can expect it to get soiled. Please have an extra clean lab coat and pair of scrubs available. Your shoes should be comfortable. Athletic shoes are acceptable provided that they are clean and in good condition. You MAY NOT wear jeans, open- toed shoes, or sports/beach attire at any time. PERSONNELAND ORGANIZATION : The hospital service rotation provides after hours care for the small animal services. These services include cardiology, internal medicine, oncology and su rgery. These services, their students, interns, residents a nd faculty have primary case resp onsibility. PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT : As representatives of the veterinary profession, it is importan t to maintain not only a professional appearance but demeanor as well. The student must consistently demonstrate appropriate behavior in all settings when in the veterinary teaching hospit al and interacting with faculty, staff, fellow students, clients and the general public. Inappro priate behavior should be reported to a technician, house officer or faculty member immediately and m ay result in lowering of grade 141 (including failure) and assignment of additional duties/shifts . ROTATION SCHEDULE : The rotation will begin Monday morning at 7:30 AM and end the following Sunday morning at 8 AM. Shifts will generally run from 12 AM to 8 AM. There will be a brief orientation on Monday morning at 7:30 AM with the intensive care unit technician. The first shift will s tart at 12 AM Tuesday morning (or midnight on Monday) and the last shift will start at 12 AM Sunday morning (or midnight on Saturday). ROUNDS : Rounds will typically consist of case rounds with the ICU veter inary technicians, students, house officers or faculty from the preceding shift. These rounds will be held at the beginning and end of each shift. Students will be responsible for presenting case s. When presenting a case please use the standard protocol of name, signalment, history, brief d iagnostic and therapeutic history, assessment and plan. The purpose of rounds is to brief students on cases in the ICU and small animal teaching hospital as well as evaluate the student's knowledge of cases and subject matter related to intensive/patient care and case management. PATIENT MANAGEMENT : Patient care is your first priori ty. Be proactive and available to help the ICU staff at all times and with any task. All patients admitted to the ICU and in the ward s should be placed in a clean, appropriately sized cage. Animals should be placed on grates or absorbent bedding as indicated. All patients should have an id neck band with the case number, name of patient (first and last) and date. A cage card should be completed and placed on the cag e with a patient sticker, the name of the clinician, the student's name and the presenting co mplaint or diagnosis. There are laminated tags available to hang on the cages for special instr uctions. The animal's belongings and medications are placed in a designated, labeled box. All me dications and supplies necessary for treatment must be in the ICU or wards and accessible to the student prior to the treatment time. PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT : This is a clinical rotation, so you should take every opportuni ty to learn from the cases that are in ICU. While working in the intensive care unit it is expected th at students will devote their time to the care of animals in the small animal teaching hospital. Any additional time should be utilized to maintain the intensive care unit or for educational purposes related to veterinary medicine. There is no food or drink permitted in the ICU or laboratory ar ea at any time. Take the opportunity to hone your clinical skills by conducting your own physical exam of each patient. It is recommended that at the beginning of each shift you make an assessment of all patients in the wards and ICU. Your initial assessment (hands-o n or utilizing the patient record) might include an evaluation of m entation, mucous membranes, pul se quality, heart and lung sounds as well as activity level. Review the patient's history, pr esenting complaint/problem, and diagnostic findings, then use this information to develop your own problem list, diagnostic p lan, and therapeutic strategy. Familiarize yourself with the patient's condition so you unders tand what to mon itor and why. 142 Look at the monitoring equipment and make sure you are familiar with its operation. If there are any specialized diagnostics or therapeutics (chest tube, abdomi nal lavage catheter, jugular catheter) the patient might have, m ake sure you are comfortable performing these diagnostics or therapeutics. Assessments in comp romised or aggressive animals may be minimal and if there is any concern please contact the supervising house officer or fac ulty. If there is few or no cases in the ICU, use this time to review or learn about Emergency or Critical Care Topics that you are interested in. Regardless the type of practice you pursue, you inherently will deal with some type of emergency at some point in your career. An essential part of your profe ssional development is learning to be an active participant in the learning process. Be proactive and do not hesitate to bring up topics of interest for discussion. Also, do not always settle for \"the way it has always been done \", but rather pursue the evidence behind why we do things the way we do. Feel free to ask any qu estion; however, be prepared that in response to your question that a question may be asked of you. This approach is designed to explore the scope of your knowledge and to help you, if poss ible, to find the answer within your own knowledge base. Whatever, gaps in knowledge remain, we will do our best to fill in or at least provide you with the refer ences needed to fill those g aps in. Don't hesitate to let us know if you have different information on the subject. We try to pro vide you with the references for our statements, whene ver we can, so that you can check it out f or yourselves. Students sometimes think that a teacher will be offended if the student has more or better information than the teacher. This is not the case on this service, as none of u s thinks we know everything. Instead, we appreciate that medic ine is continually revolving a nd, therefore, we welcome novel and better information and experience. However, be prepared for us to ask you for references for your information just as we are ready to provide them for you. HOSPITAL RECORDS : All medical records of ICU patients are to remain in the ICU. R ecords for animals in the wards are in the wards. The ICU patients will have signed (by clinici an), completed orders (including an emergency drug sheet and resuscitation orders) upon admissio n to the ICU and daily by 8 am. Animals in the wards will have ward sheets that are also signed and completed. If they are incomplete then you can contact the student, intern, resident o r faculty member responsible for the case. Please review all orders prior to your shift to make sure you understand them and obtain clarification if necessary. ICU students will be respons ible for recording treatments and observations on orders sheets as well as procedures and supplie s on the ICU charge sheet. Any additional paperwork (labwork, radiology reports, etc) may be m aintained in the appropriate section of the medical record. The ICU student is not responsib le for maintaining SOAP's in the patient's medical record. FACILITY : A clean, quiet, well-organized ho spital is crucial to adequatel y care for our patients. Every effort should be made to maintain a clean organized hospital. Noise an d traffic should be kept to a minimum. Only individuals with a case in the ICU (students, fac ulty, staff) or students and staff working in the ICU should be present in the ICU. Food or drink should remain in designated areas. Basically, no food or dri nk should be placed and/or cons umed where animals or laboratory specimens are housed. This includes ICU and the labo ratory area. 143 It is important to remember that animals carry diseases contagi ous to man, man may harbor disease that can put animals at risk and animals may have disea ses that pose a risk to other animals. The easiest way to think of how you should maintain hy giene is to think of the animal and his cage as a single enviro nment not to be contaminated by or contaminate the area outside the cage. What goes in should be clean and what comes out shoul d not contaminate the environment. You will wash your hands afte r EVERY patient conta ct. You will wear clean gloves with every patient upon entering a cage and remove the g loves upon exiting before closing the cage door so as to not contaminate the environment. When a patient is out in the ICU and contaminates the environment (e.g. use tabletop for treatme nt, urinates/defecates in the ICU) the environment should be disinf ected adequately to maintain cl eanliness and minimize contamination. If you are accessi ng communal areas (medication drawers, bandage material, scrub containers, etc) make sure you are not carrying contamina nts with you (dirty gloves, unwashed hands, dirty scissors, etc). COMMUNICATION WITH CLIENTS AND VETERINARIANS : During the rotation you will likely need to contact the student , intern, resident or faculty member on a case. The ICU orders will have contact numbers in the list of order they should be contacted. The individuals liste d should respond promptly (with in 10 minutes). If they fail to respond please contact the next individual listed. There are ce rtain questions that can be answered by students (clarification of orders, location of equi pment or supplies needed for treatments, etc) but others should be addressed by interns, res idents or faculty. If there is any change in status of a patient the n the intern, resident or facu lty should be contacted. Client and referring veterinarian communications will be handle d by the service in charge of the cas e. Students on the emergency med icine rotation should not advis e owners of specific changes in patients or comment on the treatment of animals to t he owner. Instead, students should contact the supervising clinician. A faculty member, res ident or intern may occasionally ask you to contact an owner or ve terinarian and the emergency m edicine student may do so if comfortable. Any questions the ICU student may not be able to answer, or sho uld not discuss with the owner, should instead be answered by th e supervising clinician. Studen ts should contact the faculty member, resident or intern befor e communicating with the owner or referring veterinarian. When calling a clinician call the number left on the orders fir st. Leave messages if there is no answer. There is a list of phone numbers posted in the ICU with alternate means of contact (cell phone, pager, etc). If a clinician has not returned your call i n 10 minutes and you need assistance please call the intern on duty. The schedule for interns is pos ted outside ICU in the corridor between ICU and radiology. If you are contacting an owner please identify yourself as foll ows, \"Hello, this is (name) from Oregon State University's College of Veterinary Medicine, I am calling regarding.....\" Please record all communications with owners and veterinarians in the electronic medical record. 144 PATIENT VISITATION : Owners may wish to visit with their animals during their hospit alization. Visits should be scheduled by faculty, residents or interns and a member of that service must be present. Visits are not the responsibility of ICU personnel. Visits should take place out of the ICU if possible. Visitation within ICU should take place only with animals in wh ich movement from the ICU would be detrimental to their condition. If the visit is in ICU it must be approved by ICU personnel and should be limited t o 15 minutes. Visitation hours are M - F from 10 am to 6 pm and Saturday and Sunday from 10 am to 8 pm. Please remember tha t patient and client information is confidential so other cases should not be discus sed with clients. STUDENT ASSESSMENT : Students will receive an A, B, C or F based on the following cr iteria: ATTENDANCE KNOWLEDGEBASE CLINICAL PERFORMANCE COMMUNICATION PROFESSIONALISM ROUNDS PARTICIPATION QUIZ SOAP ASSIGNMENT OTHER . Because this is a one week rotation midterm evaluations are not possible. Students should not expect a midterm evaluation and if they are performing poorly t hey may fail (D or F) the rotation and not be notified until after the rotation is completed. It i s very important that you are mindful of the rotation requir ements and assessment methods. Historical ly, students that have failed the rotation (D or F) have done so because of poor attitude, poor w ork ethic and concerns over patient care/decision-making. ATTENDANCE : Student participation is vital to the success of any program. S tudents are encouraged to actively investigate the cases they are caring for. These cases provide the opportunity to learn about a variety of disease processes as w ell as their diagnosis and tre atment. Attendance is vital . Current College policy st ates that students are not able to miss more than 20% of their rotation (1 day for VMC 797 ). If they do then they will be a sked to make up any additional time or repeat the rotation. All absences must be excused. Plea se see the attendance policy to review excused absences. Any unexcused absence may result in a lower grade, an incomplete or both. Students are not able to sell or switch shifts. If a stud ent is more than 15 minutes late for a shift they may have to repeat a shift. If a student is going to be late or miss a shift they must contact the ICU (737-4825). Students are also required to com plete their after-hours duties . Any after-hours duties missed, excused or unexcused, must be made up prior to receiving their diploma. Missed shifts may be made up during the same rotation or subsequent rotations at the discretion of the scheduling technician. If a student is goi ng to be late or miss an after-h ours shift they must contact the ICU 145 (737-4825) and speak either to a technician on ICU duty or the intern on duty. If a student arrives for their shift intoxicated or is deemed by the technic ian or intern on duty to be incapable of completing their shift for whatever reason, they will be sen t home and the shift will be repeated at a future date. SMALL ANIMAL CRITICAL CARE ASSIGNMENT Goals: This assignment is designed to h elp students develop an underst anding of Emergency and Critical Care (ECC) Medicine as it applies to companion ani mals. Students s hould be able to identify clinical manifestations of a certain disease, diagn ose that particular disease, provide suggestions for management of that disease, understand complica tions that arise from the disease or treatment of the disease, and provide prognostic information regarding the disease process. Format: Choose any ECC topic to compose a 2-3 page CLINICAL SUMMARY HANDOUT . The handout will serve as a \" quick-look \" resource for other veterinary students and staff. It should b e designed similar to the format found in the \"5-Minute Consult\" text and consist of concise, bulleted, paragraph statements. The handout is to be typed in a word document using Arial 12-pt font. All topics must be approved by the faculty clinician on s taff prior to starting the assignment.

INTRODUCTION The course is a 4- or 2-week rotation in small animal surgery i n the Veterinary Teaching Hospital. Emphasis will be place d on history taking, physical e xamination, diagnostic techniques, and therapeutics utili zed in the management of smal l animals presented for surgical diseases. One of the faculty surgeons listed above will be in c harge for each week of the rotation. The surgeon in charge may change during the course of the rotat ion. Surgery house officers, technicians and interns are assigned to the service and can als o serve as an asset when you have questions with day-to-day procedu res. This is intended to be a guideline but please be aware that individual faculty surgeons may request some variation to this guide. II. GENERAL INFORMATION Students are expected to be familiar with and adhere to policie s described in the \"Student Manual: Year 4 Instructional Pr ogram\" available from the Dean's office. The following sections from the above referenced manua l are particularly applicable: - CVM Student Policies - Lois Bates Acheson Veterinary Teaching Hospital Overview - Small Animal Services Guidelines and Procedures - Small Animal Infection Control - Intensive Care Unit - Small Animal After-Hours Duty Faculty Office # Dr. Katy Towns end* 737-6841 Dr. Jennife r Warnoc k Biskup 737-4835 * = cours e coordinato r 148 III. EXPECTED LEARNING OUTCOMES 1. Students will be able to explain the general approach to surger y cases, including history taking, physical examination, diag nostic tests and their interp retations, the different therapeutic approaches including non-surgical options, the diff erent surgical options and the prognosis. 2. Students will combine their knowledge of other medical discipli nes with that of surgery. 3. Students will demonstrate appropriate clinical reasoning in dia gnostic workups and a working knowledge of essen tial surgical principles. 4. Client communication is a crucial aspect of clinical veterinary practice and students are expected to take charge in that respect. Most problems arise fr om a lack of communications or miscommunicati on with the clients. Most clien t problems are avoidable by adequate communication. You cannot \"over-communica te\". Note: many surgical procedures that are performed on the small animal surgery rotation in the Veterinary Teaching Hospital are beyond the training level of t he senior veterinary student. The faculty surgeons do not expect the students to be able to perfo rm the surgical procedures and at the same time the senior veterinary students should not expect to be performing the procedures. The decision as to what can be performed by a student remains a t the discretion of the faculty surgeon in charge of the rotatio n. Instead of concentrating on the technical details of a particular surgery, the students are expect ed to learn the indications for the particular surgery, the postoperative care, and the progn osis. As well students are exp ected to learn general concepts in tissue handling, hemostasis, and anatomy for the surgical proce dure. IV. GRADING Grading will be consistent with the description in the \"CVM Stu dent Policies\" section of the \"Student Manual: Year 4 Instructional Program\" available from t he Dean's office. Students will be evaluated by their proficienc y in handling surgical cases, b y their performance at clinic rounds and by their participation in case discussions. Reading assignments, presentations, and quizzes may also form the basis for part of the grade. VI. APPENDIX SUGGESTIONS ON WRITING SOAPs Subjective TPR Eating, drinking, eliminations, changes to treatments Current medications (include doses and frequency) Objective Pertinent Physical examination f indings (don't just copy and pa ste!! Make sure to note the changes, incision status) Diagnostics since last SOAP (bl oodwork, ultrasound, cytology, e tc) Assessment Each problem for the patient should have its own number 149 The first problem should be the surgery Co-morbidities should always be listed as problems New problems since last SOAP should be listed as well Plan Each problem should have its own plan o List the medications for each problem (i.e. a pre-existing card iac condition with medications should have those medications listed under the plan for the heart condition) Plans should include as much as you know, including the dischar ge plan Example: S: No interest in food, drinking some water No V/D/R, normal urination, no defecation No arrhtyhmias noted on Current CRT <2sec EENT: clear OU, mild ceruminous AU, no nasal discharge, moderate dental tartar Integ: ventral abdominal incision is clean dry and intact, hair coat is clean with mild amount of scale on caudal dorsum, multiple small (<2cm) soft mobile subcutaneous masses along and right lateral chest PLN:no peripherallymphdenopathy CV: no murmurs or arrhythmias, adequate synchronous, pulses, soft and quiet bronchovesicular sounds in all fields Abd: slightly tense but nonpainful on palpation, no obvious organomegaly or masses palpable, rectal examination unremarkable GU: unable to palpate kidneys, bladder is small, male castrated MS: ambulatory x4, mildly stiff gait in pelvic limbs NS: alert and appropriate, full neurologic examination not performed 3mcg/kg/hr 0.5mg/kg IV q12 and monitoring of ECG/V/D/R. Continue hospitalization for another 24 hours and consider discharge. If continuing to do well, possible discharge tomorrow morning/afternoon P3: continue IVF at bolus (2mcg/kg) and recheck BP. If still elevated, continue to monitor BP q8. If continuing to be hypertensive, consider urinalysis for proteinuria and other diagnostics for cause of hypertension P5: administer maropitant for possible nausea, may want to consider transitioning to oral pain medications if hypertension not pain related, consider other GI protectants (omeprazole), offer more tempting foods SUGGESTIONS ON CASE PRESENTATIONS New patient: New patients get the traditional history, physical, and diagnos tics with assessment and plan. Give the chief complaint and a brief and pertinent hi story of present illness (i.e. onset, duration, progression, response to treatme nt). Next give important past medical and surgical history as well as travel, medications, and allergy information. The physical exam is reviewed. Only give p ertinent positives and negatives. The assessment and plan should include what you think is wrong and, briefly, why. Then, state what you plan to do for the pati ent, including labs. Be sure to know why things are being done: you will be asked. Follow-up or hospitalized patient: The follow-up presentation differs from the presentation of a n ew patient. It is an abridged presentation, perhaps referencing major patient issues that have been previously presented, but focusi ng on new information about the se issues and/or what has changed. Give the patient's name, age, date of admissi on, briefly review the present illness, physi cal examination and admitting diagnosis. Then report any new finding, laboratory tests, diagnostic procedures and changes in medications. General format of a case presentation: Signalment: species, age, sex, breed Problem or Chief Complaint History (onset, duration, progression) One sentence. Items that are unrelated to the present problem should only be briefly mentioned. For ongoing c are, present other historical items only if there are new complaints. Physical examination findings o Co-morbidities: Highlight the pe rtinent positives and negatives that are germane to the diagnosis and/or plan being suggested. For ongoi ng care, mention only further positive findings and relevant negative fi ndings Diagnostics o Bloodwork, imaging, consults, etc. Surgery 151 o Surgical findings, s amples collected Assessment and Plan: o Describe the main problem list from most important to least. Pr ovide assessment/diagnosis for all of the problems or assess and give differentials for each individual problem if they can't all be accounted. o Provide a specific plan for the patient including additional di agnostics and therapeutics. Be prepared to justify your plan based on current evidence. o Post-operative plan Fluids (rate/hr) Medications (with doses and frequency): group by analgesics, antibiotics, other medication categories Treatments: monitoring, food/water/TPR/walks o Discharge plan Medications (with doses and frequency) grouped by category Activity restriction Monitoring: incision care, specific CS Follow up A Few Practical Tips: 1. Try to be thorough without being long-winded or too detail orie nted. Knowing what constitutes the \"right amount\" of relevant information will obv iously take some practice and experience. 2. Include only the most essential facts; but be ready to answer a ny questions about all aspects of your patient. 3. Beware of jumping back and forth between descriptions of separa te problems. 4. Use the presentation to build your case. 5. Your reasoning process should help the listener consider a diff erential diagnosis. 6. Ask for feedback from your listeners. This will allow you to co rrect errors and improve subsequent presentations.

It provides valuable inf ormation about the logistical aspects and \"nuts and bolts\" of daily r esponsibilities for the rotation . 152 VMC 719 Clinical Cardiology Guidelines and Procedures Course Coordinator: Dr. Nicole LeBlanc Course Instructors: Dr. Kate Scollan Welcome to the Cardiology Service. We hope you enjoy the service as much as we do. During the next 2 weeks you should focus your attenti on on acquiring t hose skills needed to evaluate the cardiovascular system in domestic animals, particularly in thos e animals that are suspect for cardiovascular disease, as well as focusing on the treatment of common cardiovascular disorders. The tools required for this rotation include a sound knowledge base, a functioning stethoscope, your cardiology class notes and l ecture slides, as well as read y access to the literature. It would be helpful if you reviewed your class notes or a reference text book prior to your first day on the rotation. On the first day of the rotation, you will be provide d with this introduction to the service, a list of instructiona l resources for the rotation, a handout of electrocardiograms for you to study and review as a group, a nd a review of common cardiac disorders and their treatment. As you will come to realize, some of the more common errors tha t are made in practice result from failing to recognize the cardi ovascular manifestations of systemic disease and failure to appreciate the systemic manifestation of cardiovascular disease . Try to be consci entious, careful, and considerate when dealing w ith pets and their owners. Goals of the Cardiology Rotation: By the end of this clini cal rotation you should: 1. Be proficient at conducting a t horough cardiovascular physical examination. 2. Be able to record and interpre t an electrocardiogram in dogs, c ats, and horses. 3. Be able to recognize common arr hythmias including heart block, sinus arrest, premature atrial and ventricular depolarizations, escape beats, atrial fi brillation, and ventricular tachycardia. 4. Be able to treat the most common arrhythmias in companion anima ls. 5. Be able to record and interpre t non-invasive blood pressure mea surements in dogs (oscillometric technique) and cats (Doppler technique). 6. Be able to recognize and treat systemic hypertension in dogs an d cats. 7. Be able to recognize normal anat omic structures on thoracic rad iographs. 8. Be able to recognize left and ri ght heart enlargement patterns on thoracic radiographs. 9. Be able to recognize of cardiogenic pulmonary edema on thoracic familiar with the various ec hocardiographic modalities - M-m ode, two-dimensional, color flow and spectral Doppler imaging. 11. Be able to recognize the most co mmon congenital heart defects i n companion animals and know how they are treated. 12. Be able to recognize the most co mmon acquired heart diseases of companion animals and 153 know how they are treated. Service Personnel and Organization. The cardiology service always ope rates as a team comprised of 2 -4 senior veterinary students, the cardiology house officers (D rs. Meghan Allen, and Dr. Eric Owens), the cardiology technicians (Robyn Panico, Amy Berry, and Allison Lake), and tw o board-certified cardiologists (Dr. Kate Scollan and Dr. Nicol e LeBlanc). Questions about rout ine procedures are best directed to the cardiology techni cians. Questions about a parti cular case should be directed to the clinician with primary case re sponsibility, i. e. the reside nt or senior clinician. Questions about the rotation, grading, probl ems, schedule changes, and sp ecial requests should be directed to either Dr. Scollan or Dr. LeBlanc. Rotation Schedule and Hospital Receiving. The cardiology service receives cases every Monday, Tuesday, Th ursday and Friday. Wednesdays are reserved for sp ecial procedures, review sessions , quizzes, and, at times, additional receiving or independent study. There will be an ori entation (8:45 - 9:45 AM) on the first Monday of the rotation. R eceiving on that day will begin at 9:45. On other receiving days, appointments will begin at 9: 00 AM. If you have a hospitalized case, please have the record (SOAP) for that day completed by 8:00 A.M. If you have a case i n ICU, please have the record completed and the ICU orders for that day available for inspect ion by 8 :00 AM. You w ill have a quiz on physical exami nation within the f irst 3 days of the r otation. You will have a quiz on ECG interpretation on the second We dnesday or Thursday of the r otation. Please be prepared by reviewing your notes and any additional handouts you might r eceive. Medical History Taking. In addition to completing the sta ndardized history form in the admission package, certain additional information is often required of the owner. Moreover , always indicate the primary complaint as describe d by the owner to the best of your ability . Always indicate any secondary problems mentioned by the owner. A lso indicate th e duration of any problems noted by the owner. List all medications the owner has admini stered to the p et, the dose of these medications, the duration of tr eatment (starting date and endin g date), and the response to treatment - beneficial or otherw ise. Ask the owner if they gave any medications on the day of presentation and at what time. Also ask how much of each medica tion they have remaining and if they need a refill of their m edications if they are to be co ntinued. Get the name, address, and phone number of the prior veteri narian(s) that have been involv ed in the treatment of the pet. Try to define what the objective( s) of the owner is (are) - exp ectation of a cure, confirmation of a prior diagnosis, concern for other pets in the household, etc . Physical Examination. On day one of the r otation you should know how to conduct a car eful and thorough cardiovascular examination. This should include examination of the systemic veins with particular emphasis on the jugular veins, palpati on and charact erization of the femoral artery pulses (dogs and cats), and auscu ltation of the heart and lungs . We expect you to have reviewed Chapter 2 of your lectu re notes (physi cal examination) before y ou show up for your clinical cardiology rotation. What cardiac conditions cause systemic (ju gular) venous distension (elevated CVP)? Is there a jugul ar pulse in norma l animals? Wh at cardiovascular conditions 154 result in bounding arterial pulses, weak pulses, pulse deficits , and pulsus paradoxus? You should know the location of the t raditional areas of cardiac au scultation and what events are best heard in each location. Is the re an additional area of ausculta tion that is of particular value in cats? What transient heart s ounds are normal for the dog, cat, and horse? What physiologic events cause S 1 and S 2? What are the causes of a split 1st and 2nd heart sound? What physiologic events cause S 3 and S 4 heart sounds? What i s the significance of these sounds in the dog, cat, horse, and cow? In what circumstance are you most li kely to hear a systolic click? What are the common causes of a systolic murmur heard on the ri ght side of the thorax? What are the possible causes of a sys tolic murmur heard best on the left side of the chest? How can you distinguish a systolic ejection murmur from a systolic regu rgitant murmur? What are the distinguishing features of an inno cent murmur? What type of mu rmur is found in a dog with a left to right shunti ng patent ductus arteriosus? Can you list three lesions that would produce a diastolic murmur? In what sp ecies are you most likely to hear a diastolic heart murmur? Reminder - there will be a quiz on physical examination of the cardiovascular system within the first 3 days of the rotation. Consultation with the Clinician. After you have obtained a histor y and performed a physical exam ination, excuse yourself from the examination room. Compose a succinct , written problem list from the history and your physical examination. Construct a list of differential diagnose s and outline your initial clinical plan. This plan might include mor e information gathering (clini cal testing) or you might choose to initiate treatment. Be prepared to summarize the history and your physical examination findings to your clinician. S hare your thoughts regarding your differential diagnoses and your clinical plan. Do not administer treatment or perform additiona l testing until you have (1) reviewed and received approval fo r any procedures or treatments from the clinician in charge of the case, (2) provided the owne r with a written estimate of cos ts, and (3) obtained the written consent of the owner. Hospitalization and Discharge Procedures. An animal is considered admitte d to the hospital if it does not leave the exam room with the owner. All animals left for a day, part of the day, or overnigh t are considered admitted to the hospital. Once admitted, the owner should be escorted to the SA reception desk to complete the admissions process and to leav e a deposit based on the content of the written estimate form. The reception desk needs to know t he students name and the atte nding clinician (resident or faculty member). All admitted pa tients must also be weighed and the weight must be recorded in the record. All admitted patie nts must have a hospital ID co llar with the owner's name and the clinic number clearly legible. A discharge sheet must be compl eted by the admit ting student an d it must be reviewed and signed by the attending clinician befo re the animal can be disc harged from the hospital. Always confirm the time of discharge with the technician and the atten ding veterinarian to ensure that all charges have been entered. Ensure that all necessary medication s have been retrieved from the pharmacy by the scheduled discharge time. You are responsible for the care of the patient from the moment of admission until it is released to the care of the owner. Neglect or abuse of a patient will re sult in a failing grade for the rotation and may also result in additional disciplinary action. 155 Hospital Records. The problem list (blue form) should be kept up to date and shou ld appear at the front of the record. The pink (Hospitalizati on Orders) form should include a record of all tests performed and all treatments administere d. Once you and the primary clini cian reach agreement on a plan of action, additional testing, or t reatment, the resulting orde rs should be written in the record and they should be marked off as the y are performed. The date and t ime of all tests and treatments should be noted. Do not feed the animal, administer treatmen t, or perform a diag nostic test until the clinician approves that specific action. Nex t in the record, is the offi cial Treatment and Progress form (SOAP). There should be at least on e entry for every day the a nimal is in the hospital. The SOAPs form documents your assessment of the animal's condition and its progress while in the hospital. These records represen t your communication to the pri mary clinician regarding the condition and treatment of your p atient. Every patient should h ave their vital signs and body weight recorded on a daily basis. M ake all of your entries logi cal and complete. Do not use vague or unnecessary abbreviati ons. Next in order should be the history and physical examination information follo wed by the results of any and all laboratory test results, ECG report forms, flow sheets, and other miscellaneous forms and re ports. Day Patients. Our goal is to be thorough, effici ent, and offer unparalleled s ervice to our clients and referring veterinarians while maintaini ng a relaxed, open atmosphere. Eff iciency includes timely submission of clinical pathologic and radiographic requests, ch arge entry for procedures performed, pharmacy requests filled and waiting, and typed disc harge instructions ready prior to a client's arrival. In an effort to stay organized we place all of our patients on the dry erase board. After admission to the hospi tal, the procedures that hav e been outlined should be placed under the patient's name and the agreed upon discharge time sho uld be noted. As the procedures are performed a ch eck mark can readily identify what tests have been completed. We generally perform our own E CGs, blood pressure measures and echocardiograms but we ask that after thoracic radiographs have been performed, you pull t hem up on the hospital network for review. This will allow the entire service to benefit from the case that you have evaluated. For each case that you are the primary student it is your respo nsibility to: 1) Present the case succinctly in rounds including pertinent histo ry, physical examination, diagnostic s, therapeutics, and follow-up recommend ations. Radiographs should be available and abnormalities should be wel l understood. 2) Perform follow-up with clients if any diagnostics are pending ( i.e. digoxin level, renal profile). Overnight Patients. Inpatients are infrequent on the cardiology se rvice but nonetheless you should plan to be available throughout the entire rotation, incl uding weekends, unless the faculty member and Department of Clinical Sciences have appro ved prior arrangements. In addition to the responsibilities listed for outpatie nts it is your re sponsibility to: 1) Have your animals SOAPed by 8:00 a.m . Briefly, \"S\" includes sub jective data - Buffy is bright, alert, and responsive a nd displays a good appetite. Her respiratory effort appears to have decreased and her femoral pulses feel stronger. \"O\" inc ludes the results of all objective data - physical exami nation, blood work, thoracic rad iographs, ECG, echocardiography. \"A\" represents the assessment and is the most important part of the 156 SOAPing process. We prefer you to list all of the problems enc ountered and provide differential diagnosis for each problem. If you feel two or mor e problems can be lumped together, great. Explain why y ou feel your assessment is the mo st correct. Example: I believe Buffy is azotemic because she suffers from dilated card iomyopathy with decreased renal blood flow. Evide nce supporting this conclusio n is ... Or I believe Buffy is azotemic following admin istration of ACE inhibitors be cause ... \"P\" is where you list the ongoing plan. Today we will place an artificial pa cemaker to combat Buffy's sick sinus syndrome. Antibiotic prophylaxis (cefazolin at 22 mg/kg IV q. 90 minutes) will be administered a nd post-operative radiographs wi ll be performed. Post- operative recovery will be in the ICU unit with telemetry monit oring. If an animal is admitted to the hospital on Monday, we expect the first SOAP to be complete Tuesday morning at 8 a.m. It should cover the history and diagnostic te sts up until that Tuesday morning while the TPR should be that recorded on Tuesday mornin g. 2) If an animal is to have surgery p erformed it is your responsibi lity to make certain that: a. The anesthesia request is turned in on time. b. The evening technician pulls the food (i.e. put it on the treat ment orders and talk to them face to face, or pull it yourself). c. Prophylactic antibiotics should be in hand the morning of surge ry. d. If required, the patient should be delivered to anesthesia the morning of surgery. * We operate as a team service offering help and respect to eve ryone involved. 3) If an animal is in ICU it is your responsibility to make certai n that: a. The patient has enough medicati on to make it through the night and early next morning (especially if on a CRI). b. The ICU students understand monito ring parameters, especially f or arrhythmias. c. Clients have been contacted twice daily with updates. d. After discharge from the ICU that the record (both the file fol der and metal back), and medications follow th e patient to the ward and that the cage is left clean, fluid bags are discarde d and fluid pumps are replaced. Communication with the Client and Referring Veterinarian. Make sure that you kno w how to contact the owner and the referr ing veterinarian before the animal is admitted to the hospita l. For day cases, the referrin g veterinarian should receive a summary fax before the end of t he day and should receive a phon e call within 24 hours from the time of discharge. Generally, t his is performed by the clinicia n on the case, unless otherwise discussed with you. The referring v eterinarian should be advise d of the diagnosis, how the diagnosis was confirmed, what tr eatment was administered or adv ised, and what follow-up is required. For overnight admissi ons, the clinician on the case w ill call the referring veterinarian on the day of admission and on the day of disc harge to advise h im/her of the initial plan and differential diagnoses that are being considered. Most owners a ppreciate a daily phone call regarding the condition and progress of their pet, which is req uired by the cardiology service. Please record a summary of a ll conversations in VetHosp. Grading for the Rotation. You grade for the cardiology rotation is weighted based on the following components: 1. Knowledge base (20%) 2. Clinical skills (30%) 3. Proficiency in procedures (15%) 157 4. Professionalism and conduct (15%) 5. Communication (15%) 6. Animal welfare (5%) Knowledge base includes understanding disease pathophysiology, treatment options, individual effort seeking out information and awareness of recent developm ents in the field. Clinical skills includes data prioritization, dia gnostic planning, interpretati on of lab data/radiographs/ECG. Proficiency in procedures includes phlebotomy skills and other technical tasks. Professionalism and conduct includes work ethic , reliability during business ho urs and after hours, reaction to feedback. Communication include s collegiality and interactions with classmates, staff, and faculty. We do not grade based on your performance the first da y of the rotation, rather we evaluate performance throughout t he 2 week rotation. Both quant ity and quality of effort are both factored into grading. Please show initiative by being actively involved in all cases the cardiology team sees. This involves performing a cardiovasc ular exam on all patients (exce ption: fractious animals) to practice your physical examinatio n skills. Please write histori es or import discha rge templates in advance whenever possible to opt imize your time for experientia l learning during business hours. Generally students on the cardiology service have a dece nt amount of free time before and after receiving, so we expect you to use this time towards learning. Students who meet basic expectations as outlined above receive feedback such as this: You have a solid working foundatio nal knowledge base. Please ke ep reading to solidify your knowledge base and spend time o n rotations seeking out informat ion relevant to your cases. You did a good job prioritizing case in formation and improved over the 2 week in your interpretation of diagnostics. You displayed strong verbal and written communi cations with clients. You were reliable during business hours and afterwords, and accepted fee dback well. Students who exceed our expectati ons receive feedback such as t his: You displayed an above average knowledge base in cardiology and a willingness to research new information without being pro mpted. You did an excellent jo b prioritizing case information and improved over the rotation in your interpretation of diagno stics. Your writte n discharges were excellent, requiring minimal corrections/edits on our beha lf. You showed great teamwork with your classmates and strong ve rbal communication skills wit h owners. Students who fall below our expectations receive feedback such as this: You displayed a weak knowledge bas e in cardiology including dis ease pathophysiology, recent developments, and the rapeutic medications . It was also found to be difficult for you to identify physical exam abnormalities and p rioritize data to formulate an appropriate treatment plan effectively. Also newly learned c oncepts were not reliably able to be applied to clinical cases. Your medical records were not always complete or accurate. You struggled with appropriate interpretation of diagnostic tests. 158 Sample Schedule for the Cardiology Rotation - VMC 711 Week 1.

The goal of the Clinical Oncology Service is to teach s tudents a realistic approach to the diagnosis and treatment of pets with cancer. We are a very busy service, which allows students the opportunity to be involved with a wide variety of cases. Our mo st important goal, however, is for you to experience the practical diagnosis and treatment of a ca ncer patient.

If you have an ICU afterhours shif t or other commitment, please inform the oncology s taff the morning of. Rounds Room/Treatment Room Oncology has two dedicated spaces for this rotation. The treatm ent room is where chemotherapy will be administered and traffic in and out of thi s room should be kept to a minimum if possible. T he rounds room is located across from ICU and can house the patient record, any medications that are being sent home, as we ll as other paperwork needed during this rotation. Receiving Appointments We receive new cases and recheck patients Monday-Friday. We try to reserve Friday for recheck and chemotherapy appointments only, however, if deemed medicall y necessary, we will also see new cases on Fridays. Review the next day's appointment schedul e each afternoon, sign up for a case, and familiarize yourself with the incoming patient compla ints. Students are responsible for receiving all cases unless otherwise specified. During the first week of your r otation you will have the option to ask the house officer assigned to your case to model what an appropriate history and physical exa mination looks like. For new appointments: Place cage card outside exam room #4 Perform a complete hist ory and physical exam Develop a diagnostic/trea tment plan with clinician Consult with the oncology technici ans to formulate an estimate Review estimate and consent form s with owner, make sure they si gn the forms, and confirm their contact information For recheck appointments: These cases may or may not need an exam room o Check with technicians and/or cli nicians ahead of time to deter mine the best use of the exam rooms Formulate a plan for the appointment based on the previous disc harge summary o Check the communication log as changes may be noted there o The referring veterinarian may have done blood work for the cur rent appointment. All patients need a signed authorization form and estimate All recheck appointments will have a patient flow sheet that ne eds to be filled out according to the plan for that visit (green sheet) Perform a complete hist ory and physical exam Develop a diagnostic/trea tment plan with clinician Consult with technicians to formulate an estimate Tips for learning about on-going cases: Read the most recent discharge report 161 Look over the initial VTH history & physical exam and discharge from that visit Review pertinent radiographs, CT scans, etc. on eFilm o Check the Master Problem List Chemotherapy Appointments Chemotherapy appointments are co nsidered drop-off appointments. The drop-off times are generally between 7:30am-10:00am, however some exceptions apply . For these visits it is recommended you review the chemo therapy/recheck drop off sheet (goldenrod sheet) with the client in the lobby prior to bri nging the dog back to the treat ment room. All chemotherapy patients will have a patient flow sheet that needs to be filled out acco rding to the plan for that visit. In addition, all patients will need to have a complete physical ex am (including TPR, weight in kg) and a CBC +/- chemistry subm itted as soon as possible. For your safety, anyone participat ing in the administration of chemotherapy must wear appropriate personal protective equipment (g loves, gown, goggles, face mask s). Students will not be asked to place catheters for administering chemotherapeutic drugs. Pleas e note the sign on the treatment room, if chemotherapy is being a dministered, pl ease do not ente r. Client Discharge Summaries Client discharge letters are gene rated and modified through a d ifferent way than any other small animal rotation. A step-by-step guide has will be provide d during orientation. Oncology Procedures Aspirates and/or biopsies Venipuncture: only draw blood f rom the jugular vein unless the clinician instructs you otherwise. The peripheral veins are used for chemotherapy cathe ter placement. Urine collection: In most cases, urine can be collected by free catch methods. Radiation therapy: Certain tumors will be treated by radiation, either as a single treatment modality or as adjuvant therapy in conjunction with surgery and /or chemotherapy. Radiation therapy, both palliative intent and curative intent, are not currently available at Oregon State University. The closest facilities are Portland Ve terinary Oncology Center, UC Davis Veterinary Teaching Hospital, Washington State Univers ity Veterinary Teaching Hospital, and Colorado State University Veterinary Teaching Hos pital. Client Communications At times, students will be responsible for client communication s. You will generally be asked to communicate with your clients daily. This includes follow up on blood tests so please remember to track down results, interpret, and discuss with the clinician p rior to calling your client with the information. Before Leaving Hospital Before you leave the hospital for the day please review the fol lowing check list: Check on any patient you may have hospitalized either in wards or ICU 162 Make sure all flow/treatment s heets are completely filled out a nd signed by a clinician o Round with the ICU technician Check with your fellow students and offer any help with other p atients o Clean up after yourself and your p atients (including kennels) Rounds Patient rounds will occur daily at 2:30pm, except for the first Friday of the rotation where no afternoon case rounds will occur.

Staff: Brian T. Bowers, PharmD, Director of Pharmacy Lauralei Schuster, PharmD, Staff Pharmacist Alyssa Tucker, Supply Room Technician Jeffrey Holland, Certified Pharmacy Technician Audrey Sturner, Certified Pharmacy Technician 166 VTH Pharmacy Prescription Writing Applicable To: Pharmacy and prescribers within VTH Purpose / Principle: To formalize protocol and procedur e for in-house prescription w riting Policy / Procedures: 1. Only prescribers (veterinary clinicians) in the Department of C linical Sciences that have prescription authority, giv en by the VTH Director, can pre scribe pharmaceuticals for VTH patient cases 2. Appropriate scope of practice is required for prescription writ ing with valid Veterinarian Patient Clie nt Relationship (VCPR) 3. Pharmaceuticals and supply inventory items will be written on s eparate blanks for filling and dispensing a. White blanks = \"Rx only\" b. Light blue blanks = \"Supply only\" 4. Prescriptions for medications will require the following items and/or information: a. Patient and client information including: i. First and last name of owner (full name required) ii. Name of animal iii. Species of animal iv. Case number assigned by hospital v. In the instance of dispensing control substances, the DEA registrant number and address, for Federal law requirements vi. It is preferred to use patient stickers, however, can manually write all information as well b. Drug information including: i. Name of the drug ii. Strength or concentration of the drug iii. Drug formulation iv. Complete instructions for drug use (sig), including route of administration and dosing 1. Example: 1 tab po bid v. Quantity prescribed vi. Refills authorized (when necessary) vii. When applicable, prohibition of s ubstitution of a brand name dr ug 1. \"No 5. \"D.A.W. (Dispense As Written)\" 167 6. Words of similar meaning viii. For food animals: withdrawal times c. Authorized prescriber signature d. Name of student/technic ian writing the order e. Weight of the animal f. Date prescription is written g. CII orders must be written on separate blanks, as required by F ederal and State Law h. CIII-CV orders can be written separately or in conjunction with noncontrol prescriptions *All prescription orders require this information for dispensin g 5. Supply orders will require, at minimum, case number, animal nam e, and owner last name a. Veterinary technician signature is minimally required for dispe nsing to ensure case charges and invoicing appropriateness Oversight / Follow Through: The Director of Pharmacy shall be responsible for the implement ation and oversight of this policy. Pharmacy Order Writing and Submissions Policy Applicable To: All VTH Personnel with Order Writing Authority. Purpose / Principle: To provide structure and familiarity to the pharmaceutical and medical supply ordering process and to potentially reduce unnecessary order errors and dispensing time in a continuing effort to maximize patient care. General: When submitting an order, the VTH Clinical Science faculty/staf f or student must first be respectable to the time allotted for filling orders. If therear e no questions/confir mations, place the order request in the slotted file organizer on the counter (by the pharmacy window) with respect to the time of submission (submit or clearly note which order you may need first). Please get the attention of one of the Pharmacy staff for assis tance when there are questions. It is the expectation of the VTH clinical science member/personnel and/or student to accurately write the prescriptions. On average, it takes approximately 10-15 minutes for the Pharma cy staff to complete an order. This time estimate varies and is highly dependent on the quanti ty of drugs being ordered at one time and the level of busy times from all departments within th e hospital. However, this is not a guaranteed time and should only be used as an estimate only. If, however, you h ave an emergency situation (e.g. animal crashing or need immediate eut hanasia) be sure to direct 168 attention at getting the medications from the Cubex\u00ae machines o r crash kit(s) first before coming to the pharmacy, as seco ndary pharmaceutical storage ar eas hold emergent drug supply as a primary objective. Let one of the staff members know abou t your situation if this is not a possibility. These emergency situations will take priority over all others. The next level of priority is given to inpatients and then to outpatient prescri ptions. If an owner is waiting, this is not a valid reason for the Pharmacy staff to supplement lost t ime to the owners, but will be noted and completed in a reasonable and timely manner. Helpful Notes: 1) Please realize that Pharmacy staff is currently working on orde rs throughout the day. 2) Please be respectful and minimi ze all unnecessary disturbances when submitting orders. 3) The VTH works on a closed formulary system and listed in VetHos p as a guideline for all order submissions. 4) All orders that are for procedures scheduled for the following day are advised to be submitted by 5:00PM (i.e. surgery orders). All discharge orders are to be submitted no later than 5:00PM. This will leave the last hour of the day for last minute urgent orders and gives the Pharmacy staff an opportunity to prepare for the next day's service. 5) If there are any questions, the Pharmacy staff is happy to help and is preferred when questions are present and/ or clarifications are needed. Policy / Procedure: 1) Hospital pharmaceutical and medical supply orders that are submitted to the Pharmacy, either during normal operating hours or via after-hou rs will be submitted on an approved white VTH Rx order form or blue VTH Supply order form, respectively. 2) Please refer to \"SOP Prescription Writing\" for all requirements 3) Indicate if the patient is \"inpatient\" or \"outpatient\" to notif y Pharmacy personnel destination of drugs to be dispen sed. Outpatient medications wi ll be dispensed in child- resistant packaging, when possible, to be in compliance with th e Poison Prevention Act. If child-resistant packaging is not possible the dispensing con tainer must be labeled - Not child proof - Keep out of Children's Reach. 4) Print all names submitting a nd signing orders, legibly 5) Use inventory names and strengths as written in Pharmacy invent ory formulary (VetHosp formulary) as a guide to appropriate writing. 6) Liquids should be submitted with \"mLs\" and solids with \"tabs,\" \"caps,\" \"grams,\" etc...to respective quantity dispensed. 7) If the product is an injectable, the preferred method is to hav e the 169 mgs/ml converted by the prescriber to the amount of \"mls\" requi red. For example, \"acepromazine 10mg/ml, dispense 6 .5mgs\" be converted to \" acepromazine 10mg/ml, dispense 0.65mls.\" *If the requested amount of the injectable is less than 1.0ml, the dose should be rounded to the nearest hundredths (e.g., 0._ _) to improve measurement accurac y. NOTE: Please consider that only the 1 cc syringes have the ability to correctly measure to the hundredths place. All other syringes vary on measured accuracy and this must be considered when calculating doing amounts (please see information under the general comments section) *If the requested product is an in jectable then the number of i ndependent doses should be clearly indicated (e.g. four s yringes/doses of 0.3ml). 8) If the order is written for a C ontrolled Substance (CS) the fol lowing will apply: A. All inpatient orders for CS, un less intended for i mmediate use, must include complete directions for use. All Small An imal (SA) inpatient CII CS orde rs are limited to a 24 hour supply for injectable medic ation (no more than 72 hours wi ll be dispensed for oral medication) which is based upon the stated frequency of do sing interval in the directions for use. All Small Animal (SA) inpatient CIII-V orde rs are limited to a 72 hour supply (i.e. tramadol tablets )*. If the CS request is for a CRI, the rate of infusion is required and it is the clinician's responsibility n ot to request a medication quantity (within reason) in excess of that required to cover a 24 hour period. All Large Animal (LA) orders intended for multiple dosing require c omplete directions for use and should be limited to a 24-hour supply whenever poss ible. *Note: An orange for outpa tient (\"to- go-home\") medications dispensed at the time of patient discharg es or prior to the weekend schedule (with antici pation of discharging patients during nonbusiness hours). All inpati ent orders will be written separately from outpatient orders. B. All outpatient orders for CS must be written as a separate orde r for better dispensing workflow. C. The 24 hour rule is not in effect for outpatient CS orders. Upo n discharge, the responsible clinician is encouraged to limit the order to cover a reasonable period of need. A month supply for any outp atient CS order is required in one dispensing event. These orders will be double counted and confirmed with t he quantity circled on the prescription label. D. All controlled substances in schedule-II must be written on a s eparate hospital order. E. Controlled substances in schedule III through V can be combined with routine pharmaceuticals on a single hospital order. 9) Directions for use. A. All orders intended for inpatient and outpatient dispensing mus t include complete directions for use. B. It is recommended that only recognized direction abbreviations be used. Full written descriptions a re always preferred over abbre viations. 170 Examples of the resulting format of steps above: A. For oral forms: ranitidine 150mg tablets ranitidine 150mg tablets dispense #2 tablets Give 1/2 tablet (=75mg) by or total 4 doses Give 1/2 tablet (=75mg) by mouth mout hevery 12 hours fo r every 12 hours fo r(condition). (condition). B. For injectable products: acepromazine 10mg/ml injection dispense 4 syringes of 0.10 ml Inject 0.10ml (1 syringe) IV every 4 to 6 hours if needed for sedation. 10) If any corrections or changes ar e required to th e order hardcop y please follow this procedure: A. Mark out the item to be changed with an X or \\ B. Make the necessary change in close proximity. C. All corrections or changes must be initialed by the person maki ng the change. D. Certain changes will require the authorization of the practitio ner. E. Changes are always at the discre tion and approval of the pharma cist on duty for appropriateness. NOTE: If a clinician or veterinary technicians fills the order themse lves (e.g., during afterhours) the space provided on the form that says \"filled by \" must also be initialed. 11) When leaving an order at the Pharmacy the following procedures are required: A. Make sure that the billing account for the case, internal clien t or research account, is open or active and billable before leaving the order at the Pharmacy. This is a required item for order processing. B. Waiting for an Rx or order dispense is permitted, however, only in respectable manners. It is a preference to come back when necessary. C. The general sequence of order priory is: 1) Emergency hospital orders. 171 Orders that are of a true emerge nt situation (e.g., butorphanol to sedate an animal that is causing a danger to itself or persons) will be m oved to first priority over all other orders . The person submitting an order of this nature is to alert the pharmacy staff to the necessity. These situations req uiring orders in this fashion should first be re trieved from Cubex\u00ae and/or crash kits as first level priority. 2) Routine inpatient hospital orders. 3) Routine hospital orders ( i.e. outpatient orders). 4)Routine stocking orders. 5)Research and teaching orders with large volume of inventory. D. Orders must be submitted to the P harmacy as they are completed for each patient and preferably, not submitted in gro ups of more than one patient. E. Except for an urgent situation as previously described, the latest time for order submission to the Pharmacy is 5:45pm . Any order submitted to the Pharmacy after 5:45 must be filled the next day. F. All large orders for research or student teaching must be submi tted to the pharmacy two weeks in advance of start date. Small fill-in orders for research or student teaching may be submitted for same day retrieval. These small o rders will be filled in the sequence of priority provided above. G. Orders for medications intended for non-controlled substance wa rd-stock that are contained within a preprinted ward-stock order form do requ ire a clinician or technician approval. If the reque sted medication is not a contr olled substance then a technician may review and approve the order. If the medi cation being requested is a controlled substan ce then the order must be revi ewed and signed by a VTH clinician. In no instance may a student submit a reque st for ward- stock unless for fluids/supply items. Retrieving an Order from the Pharmacy: When retrieving an order(s) from the Pharmacy the following pro cedures are required after pharmacist quality assurance has been performed: 1. Upon retrieving an order from the Pharmacy the student, technic ian, or clinician will check for completeness of the o rder and dispensed item(s). 2. When the order is picked up by th e student, technician, or clin ician, they will sign 172 (legibly) in the verify section to note pick-up and ensuring i t is the right order being requested. 3. The white copy (or \"hardcopy\" or \"original copy\") is to be reta ined and kept by the pharmacy. The yellow or carbon copy may be taken to its respective patient chart when requested. 4. Items that require mailing to clients will be retrieved, as per items 1 and 2 above, and then taken by the recipient to Shipping & Receiving for fur ther processing (see \"Mailing Prescriptions SOP \") and left to the discretion of the VTH personnel for appropriateness. 5. All hospital orders that are intended to be used during afterho urs must be retrieved before closing time (6pm). 6. Items for research and teaching should only be retrieved during normal operating hours. Other Comments: 1. It is preferred that all prescr iption orders submitted to the V TH pharmacy are submitted during M-F when full pharmacy staff is available. Sat urday morning pharmacy hours are intended to dispense prescription su pply that may be further required to help ho spital activity meet patient care objectives and is not fully staffed as a core service during weekend hours. 2. All diluents required for reconstitution (unless provided by th e product manufacturer) retrieved from the Pharmacy require a written ord er. 3. To improve accuracy in filling abbreviating drug names is disco uraged. 4. Only commonly recognized sig abbreviations should be used. 5. Please consider dosing syringe calibration and potential for me asurement accuracy when ordering injectables and round up or down as appropriate. Pleas e do not request dispensing of injectables that cannot be accurately measured wi thin the following specified parameters: 1 cc syringe - measures to the 100th of a ml mark (e.g., 0.xx). 3 cc syringe - measures to the 10th of a ml mark (e.g., 0.x). 6 cc syringe - measures to the 2/10ths of a ml mark (e.g., 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, etc.) 12 cc syringe - measures to the 2/10ths of a ml mark (e.g., 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, etc). 20 cc syringe - measures to the 1.0 ml mark. 35 cc syringe - measures to the 1.0 ml mark. 60 cc syringe - measures to the 1.0 ml mark. 6. For those prescriptions written and intended to be filled at ou tside pharmacies it should be considered that \"s.i.d.\" is not recognized in human pharmaci es and can potentially interpreted incorrectly. Oversight / Follow Through: The Director of Pharmacy, in co operation with VTH Hospital Dire ctor, shall be responsible for the implementation and oversight of this policy. VTH and Pharmacy Use of Cubex\u00ae Machines Applicable To: VTH Clinical Science Clinicians and Staff; VTH Pharmacy Staff Purpose / Principle: To provide procedure and protocol for Cubex use within the Vete rinary Teaching Hospital (VTH) Policy/Procedure: 1) Communication Chain: a. If problems arise for any staff member, this should be discusse d with their Work Leader or Service Chief first b. The Work Leader or Service Chief will communicate issues to the VTH Pharmacist *The Work Leaders and Service Chiefs will be informed regularly (as well as hospital administrators) of known issues with Cubex\u00ae u se as they arise by the VTH Pharmacist 2) The Cubex\u00ae machines are for inpatient hospital use (i.e. unit-dose use only) a. Outpatient use (i.e. dispensing regimen drug supply to clients) is not permitted per Oregon Board of Pharmacy (OBOP) and Drug Enforcement Admini stration (DEA) 1. Cubex\u00ae machines cannot hold outpatient inventory quantities 2. Clinicians should plan for presc ribing and dispensing needs ove r weekends and holidays (i.e. on Friday or Saturday business hour s with VTH Pharmacy) b. Outpatient use (i.e. dispensing regimen drug supply to clients) will be done by VTH Pharmacy during normal business hours only per OBOP and DEA requirements 1. After-hour outpatient prescriptions will be left for pharmacy to fill/dispense the next business morning 2. Similar guidelines for weekends/ holidays, which will be filled on Monday (or first business workday) 1. In the rare event a patient is discharged after pharmacy busine ss hours and medication is needed, the patient may have a sufficient quantity of non-controlled substances only to last until the pharmacy is open (i.e. 1-day supply of trilostane or pergolide) a. No extra doses permitted 173 174 i. Supply will be depleted in Cubex\u00ae for inpatients and may affect other patients' quality-of-care b. The pharmacy will supp ly the remaining outpatient regimen upon normal business hours c. At a client's request, a pr escription may be mailed by the VTH and account for an additional small supply to accommodate mail delivery time; otherwise they may return to the pharmacy during normal business hours d. Professional judgment should be utilized by the VTH clinician for reasonable quantities of medication use so depletion of supply doesn't occur from Cubex\u00ae e. The VTH clinician should al ways phone-in outpatient prescriptions to public retail pharmacies for patients being discharged as a primary outpatient medication supply when VTH Pharmacy is closed f. Controlled substances must be dispensed from the VTH pharmacy for all outpatient-use g. All Cubex\u00ae activity will be reviewed by VTH pharmacy for accountability and appropriate-use of drug supply 3) Cubex\u00ae Hours of Operation a. Cubex machines are primarily intended for after-hour and weekend use b. Guidelines for Permitted Use During Normal Pharmacy Operating H ours 1. Specific products will be available for use during normal hours , hence 24 hours, 7 days a week; see \"Urgent Drugs,\" \"Emergency Access only) drugs i. Reduces unnecessary handling/exposure to harmful agents ii. Facilitate patient care 2. All controlled substances will be preferably dispensed primarily from Cubex\u00ae, but optional, with VTH Pharmacy 3. SA/LA Crash carts (not part of Cubex): Emergency CPR drugs 2. The Anesthesia department will continue to have access to their products using current procedures of department ward stock (applicability of a separate Cubex\u00ae machine for the anesthesia department is being reviewed) [*Pending; current operations con tinue until further notice] 4) Individuals with Access a. All practicing clinicians within the VTH will have access to Cu bex inventory 175 b. All VTH Licensed VeterinaryTechnicians/Animal Health Technician s will have access to Cubex inventory c. Students will have no access to inventory d. Access will be done by bio-ID (fingerprint) and/or manual ID lo gin and pin password and trained by the Director of Pharmacy 5) Record-Keeping a. All users that access controlled substances will be required to manually write a prescription and have it signed by prescribing clinician (requi red by Federal law) 1. Signed prescriptions will be le ft for Pharmacy record-keeping i n a designated location adj acent to the Cubex\u00ae b. For non-controlled drugs, Cubex\u00ae will have a generated report o f all users taking inventory from machines 1. This report will be printed by pharmacy staff and will suffice as record- keeping requir ements for pharmacy 6) Waste/Disposals 1. Controlled substances must be returned to the VTH Pharmacy or through Cactus Sink\u00ae units, wher e proper disposal will take pla ce 1. There is no crediting to client for discarding 2. It is not applicable to be used for another patient a. Example: 0.15mL of buprenorphine is needed for a cat; a 1 mL ampule is cracked and the remainder must be either planned for use on that speci fic patient or discarded i. Use of controls will be monitored closely by pharmacy personnel to match accurate dispensation/use and discard records to verify matching quantities 1. Discrepancies will reviewed by hospital directors 2. See Return/Waste SOP for all pharmaceutical items 7) Pharmacy procedures for Restocking and Monitoring Use a. A report of pharmaceutical inventory that was taken from Cubex\u00ae the previous night/weekends will be printed each morning on busines s days 1. Pharmacy personnel will restock and check/monitor use (especially controlled subs tances) each business day 2. Signed scripts will be returned/br ought to the Pharmacy each business day 3. The VTH Pharmacist will evaluate and monitor use of inventory i tems and adjust accordingly 1. VTH Pharmacy Committee will be actively involved in adjusting Cubex\u00ae inv entory requests. 4. Pharmacy personnel will maintain logbook of expiration dating of inventory 1. Anything within one month of short-dating will be brought back to pharmacy to allow for dispen sing and replaced with longer- dating inventory back into Cubex b. Discrepancy reports will also be generated to pharmacy when a b lind count of controls do not match physical count 1. Email to VTH Pharmacist/pharmacy personnel as soon as discrepancy occurs 1. If discrepancy cannot be located and fixed immediately, an email will be sent to hospital administrators and potential responsible parties a. Close attention will be on trends of discrepancies b. Penalties may ensue if cannot correct (see Penalties for Misuse) 8) Penalties for Misuse of Cubex a. After an initial setup period, accurate use of the Cubex\u00ae syste m will be expected b. Misuse will be reported to the Hospital Director(s) c. Penalties will be determined by the Hospital Directors, and may include loss of access and other consequences as deemed appropriate from tr aining certificate documentation 1. Director of Pharmacy reserves right to implementation of fees 9) Admission/Turn-around time for Em ergency inpatient in relation to drug access a. The pharmacy/drug room cannot disp ense pharmaceuticals without proper scripting/patient record 1. As soon as admissions have recorded a case in VetHosp, pharmaceuticals will be available through Cubex\u00ae 1. Emergency meds may be obtain ed either through Cubex\u00ae (see pharmaceutical options mentioned above), crash carts, or emergency kits a. If time or no case number is assigned to a patient, an \"Emergency Patient\" is ava ilable through Cubex\u00ae and notifies the item, quantity of item, and person accessing the item to the VTH Pharmacy for follow-up measures 2. After normal operating hours, a case number may be generated within VetHOSP, which will allow access to Cubex\u00ae 3. If necessary, rush orders can still be obtained from pharmacy with proper scripting/ billing/record keeping a. This will allow for complete pharmacy prescription filling and compliance with OBOP 10) Inventory Lists of SA, LA, SA On cology, and Anesthesia departme nts a. See VetHosp formulary Oversight / Follow Through: The Director of Pharmacy services, in cooperation with VTH Hosp ital Director, shall be responsible for the implementati on and oversight of this policy . 176 Electronic Rx Submission/Refill Program Definition/Purpose: The VetHosp 2.0 Electronic Prescription Sub mission/Refill program is intended for Rx orders submitted to the VTH pharmacy. Presc riptions for VTH patients are submitted (electronically signed/ reviewed and ap proved) by VTH clinical faculty and house officers (presc ribers). These prescriptions can be prepared by VTH clinical staff and students for prescriber review. FAQs: General use: o Who can approve (electronically sign) a prescription item for a patient? A: Only VTH prescribers (clinical house officers and faculty) wit h valid VCPR can approve/sign Rx items for a patient; 4 th year students and clinical staff (CVTs) of the VTH can prepare electronic or ders, which are submitted to the VTH prescribers for approval. o Am I required to use the electronic Rx order submission instead of the current written Rx paper submission system to the VTH pharmacy ? A: No, participation in the electronic Rx order program is optional , especially during the initial launch. The intention is to transition the majority of prescriptions to the new electronic Rx program due to increased efficiency for both the pharmacy and the hospital. However, you may continue to submit paper prescri ptions if you prefer. o Can electronic Rx ward stock be approved in VetHosp as well? A: Yes, the program already exists. (NO TE: controlled substance ward st ock orders for anesthesia/RVP must continue to follow manual Rx white cop y submission) o Are any policies or req uirements different with the new electro nic Rx submission? A: All Oregon Board of Pharmacy (OBOP), Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and current policies apply (see attached policy for prescription requirements, order submission and examples). Ther e are slight differences in the new application with respect to refills and outpatient Schedule II orders. Schedule II orders like hydrocodone-homatropine tabl ets/syrup and codeine tablets MUST continue to be hand written on a paper pr escription due to DEA regulations. o What does the question 'Is this an eScript or for an outside ph armacy?' mean? A: The Oregon Veterinary Medical Examining Board (OVMEB) requests that we have in place an option for Rx hardcopy prints to be provided to a public pharmacy of client's cho ice. Therefore, the \"Outside pharmacy\" button will allow you to create a prescription to give to the client i f they wish to fill medications with a public pharmacy rather than the VTH pharmacy . The 'eScript' button allows you to submit an Rx order to the VTH p harmacy for filling. o What are the step-by-step functions to help me navigate through out the electronic Rx program? (later attached) o Can I check the status of an Rx I submit to the VTH pharmacy? A: Yes, the electronic Rx program offers the ability to see at step of the process a specific Rx is at. This includes if an order has been created, submitted, i s in the process of filling, is in the process of being checked by the pharmacist, is ready-for-pickup, 177 or has been picked up (specific person and date/time will now b e identified). o What are important reminders about prescription items? A: Prescriptions are finalized and approved drug orders with valid VCPR and are official documents. Review all prescription orders before signing to al leviate problems of returns, errors, and missing r equired information for accur acy and efficiency measures. o Can I submit Rx returns in the electronic system? A: No, if you must return Rx items, they must be returned accompanied by a white Rx hard copy with a signature. The Rx product must be returned within 7 days per po licy and must be in reusable condition. o Can I view the Rx item cost before I submit an Rx electronic or der to the VTH pharmacy? A: Yes, you have multiple areas to view the cost for a patient; the new electronic Rx order submission automatically provides the cost of the drug after you input a drug quantity. o Does a patient case need to be active before I can start using the new electronic Rx order submission program? A: Yes. The case needs to be activated and once you start preparing Rx orders under a partic ular case, it will remain open while in the eScript queue. o Do the Rx 'wait-times' change if I use the new electronic Rx or der submission program? A: No, the VTH pharmacy will continue to provide prescription dispensing in 10 - 15 minutes on average as the st andard (highly dependent upon level of hospital Rx order requests/prioritizati on and efficiency of Rx prescribing). o What are personal identification requirements in VetHosp, with respect to my position in the VTH? A: There are requirements that must identify any hospital student or personnel mem ber beyond normal user and pas sword to VetHosp authentication. This is both required legally and for c ustody of drug purposes, where we will require a fingerprint read (just like C ubex\u00ae) and an electronic signature stamp with user right limitations appropri ate to your position. Outpatient Refills: o Can clients directly contact the VTH pharmacy for prescription refills? A: No. The VTH support staff (i.e. reception) and veterinary tech nicians must be contacted by the client to initiate a refill request to the VTH pharmacy. This will allow for appropriate case activations, billing, and Rx pi ck-up by the VTH service. This system also aligns with compliance with the Orego n Board of Pharmacy and consultation(s). A dditionally, clients are not per mitted to pick-up their own Rx orders at the VTH pharmacy due to the location of the pharmacy in a secure area. o Can clients call to request an Rx transfer to a public pharmacy ? A: No. The VetHosp system is not designed to accommodate transfers. A dditionally, there are certain challenges rega rding product availability, VT H pharmacy access, product costs, facilities (i.e. phone-lines) and pharm acy resources. An appropriate mechanism is to have the VTH prescriber approve an 'Outside pharmacy' Rx hardcopy to a client and/or telephone the Rx order to a pharmacy of their choice. o How many refills can I prescribe for non-controlled substances? In Oregon, you can prescribe up to 12 refills or up to one year. E xamples: 30- 178 day supply of a total of 12 fill s, 60-day supply of a total of 6 refills, 90-day supply of a total of 4 refills, etc. o How many refills can I prescribe for controlled substances (CII I -V)? In Oregon and per Federal requireme nts, you can prescribe up to 5 refills or up to 6 months, whichever is earlier; 30-day supply per fill o How many refills can I prescribe f or controlled substances that are schedule II? In Oregon and per Federal requir ements, you cannot prescribe refills (they must be in the form of a new, written prescripti on); 30-day supply per fill o Can a client request to combine controlled substance or psychot herapeutic (i.e. trazodone, fluoxetine, etc.) refills for a lump refill be yond what was normal prescribed (i.e. 30 day RX with 2 refills dispensed as a 90 day supply)? A: No, in Oregon a client cannot request to refills combined on these items (other Rx items may be perm issible, but it is not preferr ed). o Can a client request less than what was original prescribed for a refill? A: Yes, however, it is preferred to dispense the original amoun t prescribed to help alleviate discrepancies and communication errors o Can a refill request be changed once it is been approved from t he original Rx order (i.e. the 2 nd refill request requires a dose change)? A: No. Refills only apply to the original Rx order submitted. Another Rx order would have to be submitted/approved for such changes. o Do I need a license to prescribe prescription items to the VTH pharmacy? To an outside pharmacy? A: You do not need a State or DEA license to prescribe prescriptions to your patients at the VTH pharmacy, h owever, you may be required to have a persona l license State and/or DEA lic ense for public pharmacy Rx orders. 179 PRESCRIPTION WRITING Consider these elements for writing an accurate and complete pr escription.

Course Description Instructor in Charge Dr. Ronald Mandsager The course is a three-week, five-credit rotation in veterinary anesthesiology in the Veterinary Teaching Hospital. Emphasis will be placed on the selection of anesthetic techniques for the various species and anesthetic management and supportive therap y of anesthetized animals. Additionally, demonstrations of anesthetic techniques in large and small animals may be scheduled during the rotation if time permits. Prerequisites: Successful compl etion of VM 768, Principles of V eterinary Anesthesia, or its equivalent. II. Preparation and Requirements Students are expected to review all second and third year anest hesia notes and any relevant reference materials prior to starting the rotation. Students will be expected to kno w onset time, duration of effec t, side effects, etc. of the commonly used anesthesia-related drugs when the rotation starts . Students will be expected to be proficient and accurate when pe rforming injections. Students will be expected to have experience placing venous cat heters. Students will be expected to be proficient and accurate when pe rforming tracheal intubation. Full scrub suit is required while present in the surgery room(s ). Full scrub suits are not allowed outside the surgery areas unless a lab coat or coveralls is wor n over them. Use of exam gloves is recommended when handling patients. A stethoscope, thermometer, and bandage scissors should be carr ied by the student. III. Course Schedule This rotation will begin at 8 am on Monday, the first day of th e block, for orientation. Orientation will take approximately three to four hours. Depend ing on scheduling, subsequent daily activities in the rotation will commonly begin at 7:30 am . The next day's start time will be determined and communicated the p rior afternoon, and we expect you to be on time an prepared for the start of each day. Rounds and other discussion sessions will likely be held each day and will cover a variety of topics. Students will be expected to assist with afterhours emergency c ases. During orientation, an afterhours schedule will be creat ed, with one student taking pr imary call and another taking secondary call for each shift. You will be asked to provide aft erhours contact information and are expected to be within 15 minutes of the clinic when on call. Em ergency duty will be divided as equally as possible between par ticipants in VMC 737. Any studen ts taking the elective course, 183 VMC 747, will not be included in the afterhours schedule unless they so desire. Division of responsibility for emergency duty will vary depending on the nu mber of students enrolled. Whenever duration of anesthesia of an animal is likely to exten d beyond 5 pm, the student(s) assigned to emergency duty that evening will finish the case(s) . IV. Course Objectives At the end of the rotation, students should be able to successf ully: explain the principles and techni ques of veterinary anesthesiol ogy. relate physiology and pharmacology to veterinary anesthesiology . explain why certain anesthetic agents are administered in selec ted cases. use proper procedures for preanesthetic preparation of the pati ent, induction and maintenance of anesthesia, positioning of the patient, and reco very from anesthesia. understand the effects of patient positioning on anesthetic man agement and postanesthetic complications. understand the rationale for ch oosing various methods of monito ring anesthetized patients. interpret the variables used to monitor depth of anesthesia. use supportive therapy to improve patient response to anesthesi a. interpret blood pressure data, electrocardiographic results, re spiratory gas data, and blood gas analysis as they pertain to anesthesia. master technical skills used in providing anesthesia, such as v enipuncture, tracheal intubation, venous and arteria l catheterization, use of infusio n pumps and ventilators, and other technical skills associated with anesthesia. deliver supportive care to the anesthetized patient. recognize and manage anesthetic emergencies. recognize postanesthetic complications and administer appropria te therapy. describe and modify anesthetic pr otocols for patients with como rbidities. V. Safety Every precaution is taken to prev ent human or ani mal injury dur ing this rotation and students are briefed in safety procedures during orientation and during the rotation. When injections are given to animals in this rotation, that animal must be held or restra ined by a second individual. Use of muzzles on canine patients is recommended or required whenever deemed necessary. While the rotation may seem daunting because of the size of the horse, no significant human injuries have occurred in this rotation. If y ou feel that you are being place d in an unsafe position while unsupervised in this rotation, you should notify the instructor . Any student who is pregnant should advise the inst ructor of her status. VI. Other An important component of provid ing quality anesthesia care is keeping accurate records. We 184 utilize VetDAR to maintain anesthetic records, and we expect st udents to become familiar and proficient with the software. We expect anesthetic records and associated paperwork to be completed and finalized in a timely manner. When inequities in the anesthesia caseload enable additional ti me to be available, that time should be spent in a productive manner. Examples include discus sion sessions with the clinician conducting the rotation, viewing autotutorial programs in the l ibrary, individual self-study reading anesthesia related articles in the literature, completi ng assignments given by the instructor, and as they become available, use of anesthesia sim ulation programs in the computer laboratory. Students are also expected to assist in keeping the anesthesia workspace clean and orderly. VII. Evaluation A letter grade will be assigned and based upon the student's pe rformance in the clinical setting, attendance, and upon the results of an examination should an ex amination be given following the completion of the rotation. Informal assessments of performance will be made during the rotation. Performance in the clinical setting will be assessed by the students' technical skills, ability to answer questions pose d during the discussion session s, case management and decision- making skills, and medical record keeping. 185 VMC 796 CLINICAL IMAGING Phone: http://vetmed.oregonstate.ed u/people/susanne-s tieger-vanegas Course instructors: Drs. Sta cy Cooley and Lauren Newsom Link to Dr. Cooley's bio or webs ite: https://vetmed.oregonstate .edu/people/stacy-cooley Link to bio or webs https://vetmed.oregonstate .edu/people/lauren-newsom Course description: The course is a 2-week, 3 credit clinical rotation in veterinar y diagnostic imaging in the Veterinary Teaching Hospital at the College of V eterinary Medicine at OSU. The emphasis will be placed on performing common radiographic proce dures, learning to improve radiographic techniques, learning to perform a normal abdominal ultrasound study in a small animal and to gain experience in reading radiographic studies o f clinical and teaching cases. Prerequisite: Fourth-year standing in veterinary medicine Preparation and Requirements: Students are expected to review the second-year diagnostic imaging course notes (VMC 764) or equivalent course material. S tudents are expected to know basic X-ray physics, computed r adiography, digital radiography and artifacts associated with image creation or image development that were taught in the 2nd year course or an equivalent course although these topics will not be covered directly or sp ecifically in rounds. Additionally, all students are expected to be familiar with normal radiograph ic anatomy prior to the start of the clinical imaging rotation. Course schedule: You are expected to be ready to contribute from Monday to Frida y at 8am. At first day of the block, an approximately 2-hour session is give n by the radiology technician to allow hands-on experience in patient positioning and radiograph ic technique. During the first day, the radiologist or one of t he house officers in diagnostic imaging will briefly talk about the schedule and answer any questions related to the rotation. Addi tionally, the radiologist or one of the house officers in diagnostic imaging willfamiliarize the st udents with the ultrasound unit available for scanning and explain a standard small animal abdo minal ultrasound examination. All students should ex pect to be available for imaging from 8am until 5:00 pm from Monday through Friday. There may be days when our work will take us pa st that time and students are expected to assist with these cases, and there will be days whe n our caseload is light. During the rotation, students are assigned 1 day or more per week to ultra sound and may be assigned 1 day or more per week to the reading room. You may be instructed to attend journal reviews, necropsy rounds and senior paper presentations. After the first Monday, the students will start each day from 8 :00-9:00 am in Ultrasound. This is your opportunity to practice scan ning on phantoms or on your ow n pets. Take advantage of this time, as you may not always be able to scan the clinical patien ts during appointments. We have an animal care and use protocol, which allows the students on d iagnostic imaging rotation to 186 bring in their own, healthy cat or dog for practicing ultrasoun d examinations under the supervision of the radiologist on the clinical floor. If this i nterests you, you ha ve to read through the animal care and use protocol and sign an owner informed con sent form. If you bring in your pet for practicing ultrasound and your animal is housed in one of the VTH kennels /cages or runs, you are required to clean their run/cage at the end of the day. This is an exciting opportunity for you to learn to perform an abdomi nal ultrasound in small animal patients, please comply with the rules. Daily morning rounds are scheduled (starting at 9:00 or 9.15 am ) on every weekday except Thursday (senior papers), when they start after senior papers. Clinical imaging students are expected to attend senior papers if no clinical cases are sched uled for that time. After rounds, you are expected t o assist with clinical cases in imaging. When students are not busy with obtaining radiographs, in ultrasound, or performing c ase discussions, students are expected to make use of their time and review the clinical imag ing cases from the day, study the teaching files, practice and perform ultrasound scans. Students are expected to be prompt and eager to participate in rounds, radiographic, and ultrasound examinations . Attendance is mandatory for this rotat ion. If an absence occurs, it must be excused and the course instructor needs to be informed. Students should be dressed profe ssionally and suitably for the work involved. Sandals and other open-toed shoes are inappropriate, as we are working with large and small animals.

Specific Block Responsibilities 1. Case related responsibility \u2014 primary case responsibility equates to the acquisition of imaging examinations and is to be rotated among the imaging stu dents a. Students will assume primary responsibility for an imaging case at the clinic and discuss with a technician or faculty on duty the views needed to evalua te the problem(s) identified on the request. b. Students determine the positioning of the animal, exposure sett ings, cassette size and adjust the settings on the digital screen. Students will receiv e close guidance when obtaining radiographs by the technicians early in the rotation and receive more responsibilities as they demonstrate competence. c. Please, make sure that a supervising technician from imaging or a radiologist is available before you start obtaining radiographs. d. Students decide with help of the staff or faculty on duty if th e radiographs obtained are adequate or if the radiographs need to be repeated. e. Students will perform common radio graphic procedures, learn rad iographic troubleshooting techniques, and gain experience reading radiogr aphs of clinical and teaching cases. f. Different types of film processing and processing maintenance w ill be discussed with the radiology technicians. g. Students assigned to an ultrasound case will help during the ul trasound study and if time and the condition of the animal permits will be able to scan th e animal after the initial study is finished. h. If you are concerned about the h ealth of the patient at any tim e during the imaging examination, inform the closest veterinarian, veterinary techni cian or radiology technician. 188 2. General responsibilities a. Your safety is important. As you are aware, animals are sometim es unpredictable. Listen to your intuition if you sense an animal is frightened and/or a ggressive. Treat all patients humanely and as gently as possible, but use a muzzle if you sen se that they could bite. If you have concerns, please ask the technician or radiologist on clinics for guidance and help. b. Be aware that you may encounter zoonotic diseases, including ra bies. Wash your hands frequently while on this rotation, certainly after each patient . Use precautions (such as gloves and disposable aprons) wh en handling patients suspected or known to have zoonotic diseases.You should also see to it that the imaging ro om is properly disinfected and that other patients are not e xposed, to the extent possible . If you have questions please ask the technicians or radiologists on clinics for guida nce and help. c. When time permits, it is the responsibility of the student to s tudy the teaching files available on the computer viewi ng stations and the additional r adiology teaching files stored in a plastic bin. These are different cases than you hav e seen in previous radiography labs or rounds. Ever y student is expected to be fam iliar with small and large animal common radiographic disease and anatomy. d. Be prepared to discuss radiographic special procedures regardin g feasibility, indications, contraindications, contrast med ia, procedure and interpretation . e. Review cases radiographed and visit with the attending clinicia ns or students to receive pertinent clinical information, w hich might help in the interpr etation. Cases can be viewed on the computer stations in the common radiography area. f. Keep the imaging areas clean and neat at all times. The ultraso und, small animal and large animal rooms need to be tidied at the end of the day. g. Protect tables and the X-ray/US/CT/MRI equipment 3. CANVAS teaching website All information pertinent to the course including assignments, reading material and case sets for morning rounds are posted on th e course Canvas website. Please, make sure you read through the course website before you start the rotation. 4. Morning rounds Each student needs to be prepared for morning rounds including being able to describe and discuss diagnostic imaging fi ndings of the clinical radiogr aphic and ultrasound cases of the prior day or dependent on the case load be able to discuss the prepared case sets. Students are expected to be able to discuss differential diagnoses for each case. Students will be able to review the clinical cases of the day and the prepared case sets on the common shared viewing stations in radiology. The prepared case sets are organized in sets of 10 cases and are given to the students the day before rounds a nd all cases need to be reviewe d by the students prior to morning rounds. Students are expected t o read appropriate sections of t he Thrall textbook to help prepare for rounds topics and/or discuss ions. If a contrast study was p erformed, students need to be able to describe how the study was per formed including contrast agen t used, contrast agent dose and timing of the contrast study. Furthermore, students need to be familiar with normal radiographic anatomy in small and large animals. Students should be verbally able to formulate a diagnostic imag ing report, summarize the findings and discuss differential diagnoses. A diagnostic imagi ng report should contain the following information. Below an example for a diagnostic imagin g report for rounds is listed. 189 Outline for a diagnostic imaging report for the morning rounds Case # Signalment of the patient Brief pertinent history of the patient Findings: Describe your radiographic findin gs. In this section, be sure t o include use of the 5 opacities, Roentgen signs, pulmonary patterns and other r adiographic terms where appropriate. Impressions: Summarize your findings and lis t differential diagnosis for eac h finding. Make sure, you rank the most likely differential diagnosis firs t and then rank them in the order of likelihood. Describe the next appropriate step and why you would consider t his the next step. This can be other diagnostic imaging tests, other diagnostic tests o r therapeutic recommendations. Is your diagnosis consistent with the history/ clinical signs ( if given)? Briefly, why or why not? The following radiology topics will be covered and should be re viewed thoroughly by the students before morning discussi ons: Small and large animal app endicular and axial skeleton, non-cardiac thoracic disease, card iac disease, abdominal diseas e. Week one rounds will cover small and large animal skeletal diseases and non-cardiac thorac ic disease. Week two rounds will cover cardiac thoracic diseases and abdomen including ultrasoun d. Students are expected to know basic X-ray physics, artifact s associated with image creat ion, artifacts noted in computed and digital radiographs th at were taught in the 2nd year course although this topic will not be covered directly or specifically in rounds. Learning Outcomes a. Students will integrate the knowledge learned in classes and la bs to take diagnostic quality radiographs on clinic cases. b. Students will learn to recognize high quality radiographs and k now how to correct deficiencies in image quality. c. Students will understand the basic function of film processing and what is required for processing maintenance. d. Students will learn a structured and methodical approach to eva luate radiographs and apply this to clinical and teaching cases. In addition, they wi ll learn proper terminology, refine reporting skills and need to be able to present and disc uss a prioritized differential diagnoses list. e. Additional imaging modalities w ill be discussed on a case by ca se basis. Textbooks for the clin ical imaging rotation Required: Thrall, DE, editor.

Please remember to follow the ex pectations for student conduct during this rotation. http://studentlife.orego nstate.edu/sites/stu dentlife.oregonstat e.edu/files/code_o f_student_conduct .pdf Please, read through the next section carefully. Safety considerations for the clinical imaging rotation Radiology Any radiographic study performed by a student in the VTH has to be performed under the supervision of a technician certified in the safe use of the ra diology equipment, a radiologist or veterinarian. The principle guiding radiation safety in the vet erinary teaching hospital is the ALARA principle ( As Low As Reasonably Achievable). It cannot be ove rstated that the last two words in ALARA are \"reasonably achievable.\" Reasonably achievab le is very different from \"as low as possible.\" If the guiding principle was to obtain radiat ion exposure levels as low as possible, that would indicate a zero tolerance for radiation ex posure. A goal of zero exposure would place unrealistic e conomic, design, and workflow constrai nts on the veterinary profession to the point that obtaining radiographs in a general practice w ould likely be impractical or cost prohibitive. However, all possibl e precautions must be taken to minimize exposure to ionizing radiation and properly monitor exposure to radiation by using b adges. It is completely inappropriate to take a radiogra ph without wearing badges and p roper shielding equipment 191 (gown, thyroid shield, lead gloves, eye glasses). If you are co ncerned that someone is not taking appropriate radiological safety precautions, please notify the radiology technician or radiologist on duty immediately. The clinical radiology rotation will be used to instruct and pr ovide the students with the tools necessary to obtain radiation exposures as low as reasona ble achievable. These tools fall into three categories: time, distance, and shielding. Time: Always use the shortest ex posure time possible and keep t he number of repeat radiographs as low as possible . Use always the technique chart that is provided in- and outsi de each imaging room. Distance: Always stay as far from the radiation source as pract ical. Small increases in distance will dramatically decr ease exposure. If possible, exit the room during radiography! The use of sedation to allow for sandbag and non-manual restraint i s recommended. A tutorial about the proper use of sandbags and ta pe for non-manual restraint (i ncluding instructional pictures) can be found in- and outside the radiology room as well as the library in the radiology reading room. Shielding: Use proper lead shielding equipment such as lead apr on, lead gloves and thyroid shield, etc. You are required to wear appropriate lead shielding. Not wearin g gloves is not an option in any circumstance if holding a patient, cassette or ca ssette holder. Obtaining radiographs which include unshielded fingers or hands in the radiograph is unacceptable. There should never be unshielded fingers or hands or other body parts of a human i n our veterinary radiographs. It is important to remember that hands or fingers even when covered b y lead gloves should never be in the primary beam. Lead gloves are not made for protection fr om radiation in the primary beam and only protect the hands f rom scattered radiation. Computed tomography Never be in the CT room while a patient is being scanned. All m onitoring can be performed remotely from the CT monitoring room. Students and st aff are not allowed in the CT scanning room while a patient is scanned. Ultrasound Ultrasound is not associated wit h any harmful radiation and it is safe to spend time in the ultrasound room. The ultrasound equipment, especially the trans ducers are very sensitive to force e.g. falling on the floor etc. as they contain small piezoelectric c rystals. Treat the ultrasound equipment with care and keep it clean. If you clean the transdu cers use a maximum of 50% solution of alcohol, as the surface of the probe gets otherwise damaged. Magnetic resonance tomography Remember that the magnet in an MRI unit is always on, 24/7, reg ardless of whether there are patients or staff present. The magnet is also unforgiving! If you enter the room with some thing with iron or many metals you will not get a second chance. The met allic substance will be attracted to the magnet and you will likely not be able t o stop it! The magnetic field creates a projectile effect causing metallic items to rapidly accelerate into the bore of the magne t. This means that metal items brought close to the bore of the magnet will be pulled into the magnet. If a patient is in the magnet at the time, this can result in injury and/or death of t he patient. Remember, that the magnetic field is likely to have an immediate effect. A very fe w number of metallic items are not magnetic and will not get pu lled into the magnet, so please assume that all metal will be affected. 192 Make sure you proper screen yours elf and check your pockets so that you do not carry any metallic objects including a stethoscope, pen, needles, etc. be fore you enter the MRI environment. Leave a ll metallic objects in the MRI monitoring a rea. If you carry your wallet into the magnet room, your credit card strips will be wiped of all important information and will be rendered useless. If a metallic object becomes attached to the magnet, or a patie nt or human life is endangered by a metallic object being carried into the magnet room, the magnet must be quenched. This can cost tens of thousands of dollars. Absolute contraindications for en tering the MRI environment are Pacemakers Implanted cardiac defibrillator/neuro-stimulators or infusion p umps Brain aneurysm clips Cochlear implants Metal fragments in eyes or in the head Magnetic implants External pacer wires Conditional contraindications for en tering the MRI environment include Shrapnel, bullets, etc. Intravascular stents, filters, tec. Bone joint pins, screws, plates, etc. Transdermal delivery systems Prosthetic devices Internal pacer wires Un-secured body piercings (Niobium piercings are non-magnetic) If you have any of these objects /medical devices in your body, inform the MRI technician and clinician in charge of you. You MUST not enter the MRI environm ent. REMEMBER: Never enter the magnet room for any reason unless accompanied b y the MRI technologist or radiologist on clinics. Never take anything into the magnet room without checking first with the MRI technologist or radiologist on clinics. Always remove everything from your pockets that could potential ly be a projectile Never take tools into the MRI room for any reason! The MRI technologist and radiolo gist have absolute authority ov er all personnel, patients and equipment entering the MRI environment. For the safety of all, under no circumstances should the MRI te chnician's or radiologist's directions be ignored! 193 Oregon Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory Guidelines & Procedures INTRODUCTION The Oregon Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (OVD L) is an AAVLD- accredited facility providing a full range of testing services for the diagnosis of animal disease and the promotion of animal and public health. These services include necropsy, hist opathology, bac and serolog y. The OVDL accepts animals, tissue and fluid specimens, and other materials for diagnostic testing. The results of these tests are provided to the VTH clinician, referring veterinarian, or a nimal owner to help them make informed decisions related to the health of the animals under t heir care. The primary mission of the OVDL is to provide quality diagnosti c services to clients in an accurate and timely manner and to teach veterinary and graduate students in the method of laboratory diagnostics. HOURS OF OPERATION The OVDL is open Monday through F riday, 8 a.m. t o 5 p.m., and i s closed on weekends and holidays. The majority of case material is handled during norma l business hours. However, the OVDL does accept samples after hours; those tests will be set u p the next work day. The OVDL has a pathologist on-call seven days a week. A roster listing t he pathologist on duty and the OVDL cell phone number (541-740-8633) i s posted in the OVDL Bus iness Office, Receiving Room, Necropsy Room, and both Large and Small Animal Teaching H ospitals. Necropsies generally begin at 1 p.m., but m ay commence earlier at the disc retion of the pathologist. Depending upon case load and the nature of a case, animals subm itted after 4 p.m. may be held, unless time sensitive, for necropsy on the following work day. OVDL CUTOFF TIMES FOR VTH SPEC IMEN SUBMISSIONS AND TESTING OVDL Receiving is open for receipt of specimens from the VTH fr om 7:30 a.m. until 5:30 p.m., Monday through Friday. Handling of those specimens after receip t is as follows: Specimens received by 4:30 p.m. will be delivered to section la boratories for testing or \"set-up\" as deemed appropriate for the specified tes t by that laboratory. Specimens received after 4:30 p.m. will be processed the follow ing day. I NOTE: Samedaytesting maynotbeavailableforsometests. Exceptions: Bacteriology: Same-day testing or \"set-up\" is available if spec ifically requested on the accession form. A STAT fee will be assessed for each test for which this request is made. Same day testing or \"set up\" may not be availabl e for some tests. Contact the Ba cteriology Section at 7-6824 for more information. Clinical Pathology: Same-day testing or \"set-up\" is available i f specifically requested on the accession form. A STAT fee will be assessed for each test for w hich this request is made. Sameday testing or \"set up\" may not be available for some tests . Contact the Clinical Pathology section at 7-6820 for more information. 194 Histopathology: Same-day processing and reporting are available for some tests if specifically requested on the accession form and if the specimen is received by 11 a.m. A STAT fee will be assessed for each specimen for which this request is made. Hist ology technicians or pathologist will determine the suitability of the specimen for same day pro cessing. If deemed unsuitable, the clinician will be notified and the specimen will be held pendin g submission of a revised VDL Submission Form requesting routine histopathology processing an d reporting. Contact the Histopathology Section at 7-6822 for more information. Molecular Diagnostics: Same-day PCR testing is available for so me pathogens if specifically requested on the OVDL Submissio n Form and if the specimen is re ceived by 11 a.m. A STAT fee will be assessed for each pathogen for which this request i s made. Contact the Molecular Diagnostics Section at 7-661 5 for more information. Necropsy: Regardless of the time of submission, the timing of n ecropsies is at the discretion of the Pathologist on duty. Virology: Most virology tests re quire multiple days to complete , and specimens received after 4:30 p.m. will be held for proces sing the following day. For th e more rapid diagnostic tests, a STAT fee will be assessed if the submitter requests special set -up requiring rescheduling of other laboratory testing for that day. Contact the Virology Section a t 7-2172 to determine if a STAT test can be completed for your specimen. OVDL AFTER-HOURS After 5 p.m. and on the weekends and holidays, callers to the O VDL are automatically transferred to the pathologist on-call. If the case warrants, t he clinician should request the option of an after-hours necropsy w ith the pathologist on-call. The pathologists should be infor med of all necropsy specimens r eceived after hours but notification regarding specime ns arriving after 10 p.m. should be delayed until after 7 a.m. the next day. It is important that fresh speci mens are submitted. It is rare that useful results can be obtained from a severely autolyzed animal. Specimens can usually wait un til the next morning to be brought to the laboratory but the y should be refrigerated (NOT FROZEN) during the interim. If adequate refrigeration is not pos sible then Small Animal (dog a nd cat) specimens from non-VTH clients can be brought to the OVDL for refrigeration and will b e processed the following business day. Revised OVDL policies prohibit the receiving of non-VTH Large A nimal remains after hours without the involvement of the pathologist on-duty. She/he must have itonitis If a student/technician/clinician admits a case to the OVDL fro m outside the hospital (non- VTH), all materials necessary f or admitting that case to the OV DL are found in the OVDL Receiving Room (MAGR 130). Do cuments to be completed inclu de: o OVDL Accession Form o OSU Revolving Charge Account Agreement o OVDL Disclaimer Completed forms (of VTH or non-VTH cases) should be placed in t he tray on the Receiving Room counter. If a client indicates an interest in having remai ns cremated, please ask them to call the OVDL during business hour s for information on that ser vice. Be sure the accession form clearly indicates that cremation is desired. Aprons and gloves for handling of remains can be found in MAGR 122K. The owner's name and any animal identification shou ld be placed on one of the labels found in the OVDL Receiving Room or the Necropsy Room, and th e label should be attached to the dead animal or specimen. Labels are imperative for ALL sp ecimens to prevent identificati on errors. Place the specimen in 195 either the necropsy walk- in cooler or in the glass door refrig erator in MAGR 122G. Be sure the label is clearly visible to avoid accidental disposal of specim ens. Use the hoist in the necropsy cooler to lift and move large ani mals. Stand clear of a hoisted animal; chains can slip. If un certain about hoist operations DO NOT USE IT; ask the after-hours VTH LA technicians for help as they are trained in use of the h oist. You can also ask the OVDL Pathology Laboratory Coordinator, Travis Feldsher, for training during regular work hours. NECROPSY SERVICE There are three types of necropsies available for VTH cases. 1. Necropsy with Histopathology 2. Complete Diagnostic Workup 3. Gross Necropsy Only Necropsy with Histopathology in cludes sampling of tissues for h istopathology deemed appropriate by the pathologist or specifically requested by the clinician. After fixed specimens are cut in for processing, remaining tissues are held by the OV DL for four weeks after which they are discarded. If a clinician has a special interest in ke eping specimens he/she should contact the OVDL Histopathology Laboratory and the specimens wi ll be properly packaged and delivered to the clinician. Complete Diagnostic Workup includ es a necropsy with specimen co llection appropriate for diagnostic tests deemed appropriate by the pathologist. This ma y include histopathology, bacteriology, parasitology, vir ology, molecular diagnostics, se rology, clinical pathology, and toxicology. Gross Necropsy Only is an option usually selected w hen the cause of death is obvious, such as, displacement or trauma, and no additional tes ting is necessary. For all VTH necropsy submission s, unless specifically instructe d otherwise on the submission form, the OVDL pathologist will collect a full set of tissue fo r histopathological examination and also may collect such fresh tissu es as they feel may be useful for further diagnostic testing. This does not imply automatic processing of the samples; it only ens ures the samples will be available in case they are needed later. By having these tissues availabl e the pathologist will be able to pursue the case to the depth desired by the VTH clinician, as t he desired level of investigation is not always clear on the submission form and can change accordin g to necropsy findings. Therefore, unless certain that additional tests are not warrant ed (e.g. colonic displacement, trauma cases) VTH clinicians are advised to request a Complete Diagnostic Workup TEACHING NECROPSIES Requests for Teaching Necropsies m ust be indicated as such on t he OVDL Accession form. These necropsies are charged to a separate VTH index. Teaching necropsy requests are initiated by a VTH faculty clinician for cases that they believe have sig nificant teaching value and for which the client is unwilling to pay for a necropsy. Teaching N ecropsies support the educational mission of the college. Unless otherwise indicated by the requesting clinician, Teaching Necropsies will be done as Necropsy with Histopathology. The cl inician submitting the animal should discuss further testing with the OVDL pathologist as soon as possible after submission. Additional testing at the discretion of the patholo gist does not require approval but should be discussed and agreed upon between the re sponsible clinician and the pathologist. Please note: The OVDL does not provide cosmetic necropsies. Note to clinicians - The collection of specimens for teaching p urposes (i.e. labs or 196 demonstrations) requires that y ou contact the Pathology Laborat ory Coordinator (76819, MAGR 122) to discuss your needs. Simple collections are provided as a cou rtesy; those requiring significant dissection or tissue manipulation may incur a colle ction fee. Samples will be collected and placed in the OVDL cooler by the Pathology Labora tory Coordinator. As cooler space is extremely limited teachin g specimens must be removed f rom the OVDL cooler and taken to other storage within 24 hours of collection or they wi ll be discarded. Any specimens placed in the OVDL cooler must be marked with the responsible p arty's name and date. Unlabeled specimens will be discarded immediately. SPECIMEN SUBMISSION All VTH specimens submitted for any diagnostic testing must be accompanied by a OVDL Accession form that includes the name of the clinician or house officer. Testing will not proceed without the requesting doctor's n ame on the form. It is also cr itical that an accurate and complete history accompany e ach specimen submitted. The OVDL diagnostici ans may delay testing until a history is provided. Submission of live animals to the OVDL i s not encouraged due to limited and inadequate holding facilities. If a live animal must be pre sented contact the pathologist immediately for instructions. CARE OF REMAINS In the interests of public safety and biosecurity the OVDL does not release any animal remains to owners, following a necropsy. Aside from routine disposal, r emains can only be released to a licensed crematory service. For large animals, necropsy elimina tes the possibility of cremation due to subsequent problems with transportation of the remains. Arrangements for cremation are the responsibility for the VTH. Collection of keepsakes, such a s clips of hair, must be done before the animal is delivered to the O VDL. \"Care of Remains\" instruct ions must be indicated OVDL submission form. Equine remains for cremation, buri al, or owner pick up will only be held in the necropsy cooler for a maximum of one business da y. DISPOSAL REGULATIONS There are several important regul ations involving different dis posal \"streams\" for biological materials in the necropsy area. A lthough no personnel should be utilizing these disposal streams out of hours, the regulations are emphasized here to avoid acci dents that could results in fines or loss of access to current disposal services: 1) The dumpster offal carts (rectangular) cannot contain: Plastic and gloves Metal (no horseshoes, no fixation pins/plates) Sheep or goats (including fetuses, placenta) Dogs Cats CNS tissue from cattle over 3 years of age 2) Sheep, goats, dogs, cats, (rega rdless of age) need to be access ioned in the OVDL system for disposal charges and these remains exit via a different dis posal stream. 3) Carcass/tissues cannot be freely disposed of through the OVDL - consult with the Pathology Laboratory Coordinator. In most instances a disposal fee is applicable, and therefore it will be necessary to complete an accession form fo r the disposal service. 4) Proper tagging of specimens and prompt completion of a submissi on form is critical. We do not wish remains in tended for cremation to end up in the wro ng disposal stream. 197 SAFETY Safety is a priority in the OVDL. You will receive training app licable to our section laboratories as necessary. We use a variety of sharp instruments (knives, sa ws, scissors, scalpels, needles) that can cut and puncture. Work with heavy animals can cause ba ck injury and muscle strains. Large animals can slip from the overhead hoist. The floor of th e Necropsy Room is slippery when wet, and become even more so when blood and tissue are pre sent. The animals and tissues we work with can harbor zoonotic pathogens. If you are injured while working in the VDL, please notify your sup ervisor and the OVDL (Pathology Laborator y Coordinator, Quality & Safety Manager, or Director) immediately. Report any safety con cerns to the OVDL Pathology Laboratory Coordinator immediately. A few words on rabies in Oregon... The OVDL provides rabies diagnos tic testing for Oregon and the Pacific Northwest. Rabies is not a common disease in this state. The majority of positive ca ses are found among migratory bats during the summer months. Occasionally, the disease spills over into other species such as foxes. On rare occasions we do find rabies in un-vaccinated dom estic animals. Therefore, rabies should be considered as a possi ble differential diagnosis in th e presence of compatible signs and history. Rabies suspect cases may come to the laboratory during your Diagnostic Services block. You will not be asked to work with any of these specimens until they have been verified to be rabies-free. Conclusion If in doubt, ask OVDL personnel for help...we will be happy to as sist! REPORT OF RESULTS TURN AROUND TIMES (TATs) Although there are instances in which finalization of a case is delayed for several weeks due to the nature of the test (virus isolation, toxicology assays, ext ended fixation times for brains and spinal cords, necessary lengthy decalcification of bone specime ns, etc) the OVDL does have expected TATs for routine cases . These can be found on the OVDL web page, http://vetmed.oregonsta te.edu/diagnostic . Clinicians are encouraged to contact the pathologist regarding a case which is \"overdue\" as a diagnosis may be avail able but not yet entered into a report. Standard TATs: 1) Gross necropsy findings can usually be accessed by the clinicia n within 2 business days. This can take the form of STARLIMS entry, phone call or e mail by the pathologist. 2) Histopathology from necropsies is completed for most cases with in 10 business days. CNS cases may take longer. 3) Biopsy written reports are generally completed within 2 busi ness days of receiving a fully-fixed specimen . Incompletely fixed specimens, those requiring decalcification, and those cases needing special stains may be delayed. ACCESS TO REPORTS Reports can be viewed through VetHosp. Preliminary reports can be viewed under Hospital 198 Operations, Preliminary OVDL Reports. If the case has been rele ased it will be visible under the Laboratory section of the patient file. 199 Diagnostic Clinical Pathology VMB 736 Instructors in Charge: Dr. Elena Gorman and Dr. Jen Johns Co-instructor: Dr. Carolina Allende A.

He/she is located in the Necropsy area in MAGR 122 and may be reached by calling 737-6818. This i ndividual is responsible for the day to day running of the necropsy area and students are th erefore asked to follow his/her instructions carefully in order to maximize their learning expe rience and keep the necropsy area safe and efficient. This rotation does have an \"on-call\" requirement, in which stud ents in each block must coordinate their hours to provide weekend and evening coverage of at least 2 students (more depending on enrollments per block). Necropsies generally commence between 12 - 1 pm each day but yo u should consult with the pathologist on duty and provide contact information in case the re is a change in schedule. If necropsy cases are available please arrive in the Necropsy area dressed in coveralls and boots. These must be worn while in the necropsy room. Please wear your name tags. Aprons are available and should be worn to help keep coveralls clean. Have extra coveralls ready for this rotation as clothing ea sily becomes soiled d uring necropsy proc edures. Safety goggles are required and are provided. Face masks may also be required depe nding on the nature of necropsy case and are available for your use at anytime, as are face shi elds. Knives and other dissection equipment are provided. The fir st hour of your first day will b e devoted to orientation. The instructor-in-charge, resident or Pathology Assistant will spea k to you briefly about protocols and also will give you a brief t our of the necropsy area. Students will assist with the cases each afternoon until the da y's work is completed. Students will assist in the cleaning of necropsy instruments, necropsy r oom, and loading dock area before leaving. Students are not free to leave at the end of the day u ntil all cases, cleanup, and related work is complete unless the pathologist on duty has given permi ssion. Please contact Dr. Russell in case of necessary absences. Unexc used absences will necessitate the assignment of an incomplete for this rotation until agreed upon arrangements can be made for you to make up the missed duty time. As veterinary medicine and lives tock production become more dem anding in terms of disease identification and control, the demand for laboratory service h ad increased. Some of the major 204 difficulties encountered by diagnostic laboratories in providin g meaningful service include: 1. Lack of a clear, concise clinical history submitted with the ti ssues or animals, 2. Failure to receive proper specimens with which to perform the r equested exams, 3. Failure to receive properly pr eserved/packag ed specimens Hopefully, during this rotation y ou will gain an appreciation f or some of these problems so that you can make better use of a dia gnostic laboratory and its pers onnel during your professional careers. Objectives of the Necropsy/histo pathology portion of the rotati on Upon completion of this rotation the student will be able to: 1. Perform a complete necropsy examination on both large and small animal species. This includes not only the physical/m echanical tasks, but the descri ption and interpretation of macroscopic (gross) pathology. By combining the gross necropsy findings, history, and clinical signs the student will be able to make a preliminary o r, if possible, a final diagnosis on these cases. 2. Efficiently utilize a diagnostic laboratory through proper sele ction, preparation, and shipment of specimens taken either at necropsy or from live ani mals. This includes the provision of a complete hi story and lesion description. 3. Interpret results of laboratory tests and correla te with histor y, signs, and macroscopic pathology to arrive at a final diagnosis. Recognition of the fr equent discrepancies between gross pathology and the definitive diagnosis is an impo rtant component of this objective. 4. Discuss of the significance mac roscopic and microscopic lesions , options for further testing, potential etiologies, and differential diagnoses as a result of review and improvement of the student's knowledge base on specific disease conditions investigated during the rotation. 5. Utilize learning resources in order to better understand the cl inical consequences, pathophysiology, treatment and control options associated with diagnoses made during case work-ups. 6. Write clear and concise necropsy reports and orally transmit me dical information in a clear and concise manner. (Oral presentations at gross necropsy rounds). Requirements to Meet the Objectiv es of the Necropsy/histopathol ogy portion of the rotation 205 1. Perform proper necropsy and sampling techniques When possible, students will in terview submitting owners or vet erinarians and obtain a complete history, clinical signs, lesion description, and other pertinen t information. You are expected to conduct yourself as you would in a practice setting. You are ex pected to perform necropsy examinations on all the animals submitted to the Oregon Veterin ary Diagnostic Laboratory. We expect that you will take cases as personal projects for which you will have personal responsibility. Failure to conduc t the examination properly, or collect specimens appropriately will tend to result in unsatisfactory outcome for the client. W e feel this is the best way for you to learn in this teaching setting. The student should perform the necropsy, perhaps with advice or some assistance from the duty pathologist and necropsy assistan t. There is no \"right\" way to do a necropsy (implying that all oth er ways are wrong). Each person must develop his/her own techni que that ensures a thorough exam ination of each organ system. Different pathologists may use di fferent procedures. Ask the du ty pathologist or necropsy technician for assistance or instructions on the procedures whe n in doubt. When presented with a case, please first familiarize yourself w ith the history, then develop a plan for what is necessary to establish the diagnosis(es). Discuss y our plan with the duty pathologist before beginning the necropsy examination; then do the necropsy examination. Be prepared to change your initial plan during the necropsy examination if fin dings warrant. Be sure all necessary and appropriate tissues are saved for the various anc illary tests(microbiology, histopathology, toxicology, etc.,). This is what you will have to do in a practice setting. Do not discard any portion of the anima l until you have consulted with the pathologist on duty. You will get more detailed instruction regarding sample collect ion during the orientation. (On Canvas and/or share drive under VMB 795). For instance, all VTH cases require the collection of a specific set of tissues for histopathology. Please be sure yo u are comfortable with these sampling instructions. Pathologists/necropsy technician are res ponsible for ordering tests and routing specimens but YOU are co llecting the specimens. To do s o properly, remember the following points: The processing of samples in the necropsy area involves the col lection of various tissues and fluids then forwarding these specimens to v arious work areas in the OVDL using materials such as Whirl-Pak bags, ZipLo ck bags, jars, blood tubes, centrifuge tu bes with lid, and autoclaveable carry trays. Collected specimens will be sent to other work areas in a secon dary bag or container that preserves the integrity of the specimen and p rotects laboratory personnel from possible pathogens. Collected specimens must be clearly labeled with the accession number, tissue being submitted, and the work area. Permanent marker will be used on Whirl-Pak bags, Zip-Lock bags, and centrifuge tubes. Permanent marker or accession labels can be u sed on blood tubes and swabs. (Note: The glue on the accession labels fails in 206 freezing temperatures.) Accession labels will be used on histopathology jars Some specific problems that students encounter when performing a necropsy which should be practiced and mastered by the end of the rotation include: 1. Sharpen and maintain a sharp knife. 2. Remove the head at the atlanto-occipital joint. 3. Remove the brain using field techniques (hacksaw, hatchet, \"egg -shell\"). 4. Open the joints in a manner that insures obtaining \"sterile\" jo int fluid. 5. Remove an eyeball. 6. Dissect a heart, examining all 4 sets of valves. 2. Demonstrate skills in the area s of: lesion description and i nterpretation, formulation of differential diagnoses, and articulation of pathophysiologic me chanisms. These skills (and their underlyi ng knowledge base) are demonstr ated via the crafting of necropsy examination reports and during necropsy rounds and group discus sion of cases. An ou tline of how necropsy reports should be pr epared has been included in yo ur handout materials. A working template is also attached. The necropsy report is a leg al document and it is important that you learn how to properly prepare it; especially, since th ey are often invaluable in protecting you and/or your client from damaging litigation. Your necropsy description will be part of the final report for that case and m ust be available to the duty pa thologist by noon the next day. Write them carefully; spelling, a nd scientific correctness are required but you may use point form if you wish. If writing a report in full sentences format please use the \"present tense\" in your report (pretend you are dictating). Do not alter the font or format of necropsy report template (Arial 11pt). Sign the necropsy description so the pat hologist knows who is responsible for the case. Please note that the original necropsy submission sheet must not leave the necropsy area. Take notes or request a pho tocopy of this document if nee ded. The final OVDL case report which goes to the client will be com pleted by the duty pathologist. Cases may be further discussed with the group when the results of other tests and investigations are completed. There will be 8:30 - 9:30 a.m. necropsy rounds presented each W ednesday in the necropsy room to clinicians, pathologists, a nd other students. All students i n the Diagnostic Services rotation are required to attend these rounds. Students with cases to present will do so under the direction of the duty pathologist. You should be prepared to explain your ne cropsy findings and integrate 207 them with clinical data to provide an explanation for the lesio ns and to defend your descriptions and conclusions. Preliminary diagnosis(es), other investigation s necessary, therapy, and preventive measures should also be discussed. This rotation will also include s essions at the multiheaded sco pe to review cytology slides and to look at histopathology of necropsy cases. The timing of these s essions are on the schedule provided, but may be modified at t he discretion of the patholog ists on duty. Other Activities Complete review module for micr obiology and parasitology (neede d for take home quiz). Presentation of brief \"disease reviews\" to the group Review systemic pathology notes and textbooks Complete Veterinary A ccreditation on-line course requirements Evaluation of Your Performance The format for student evaluation is as per other Evalue assess ments of the 4th year rotations involving clinical skills, comm unication skills, technical skil ls, etc. Factors used to make those assessments include de monstration of mastery of necropsy techni ques, ability to write necropsy reports, demonstration of knowledge base, attitude and interact ions with faculty, staff and students, performance during gross rounds, and a written examin ation. The written examination is due by 9am on the second Monday of rotation (unless you rece ive instructions otherwise). Hard copies or scanned copies sho uld be handed int o the patholo gist on duty for the second week of rotation. Rules and Regulations 1. Please be on time. It is unfair for the others on your rotation if they must hold up presentations, or delay in dividing up case responsibilities, o r take over your share of the work when you are late. 2. Please get excused by the Necropsy Rotation instructor in charg e, or Dr. Russell, if you are going to be or have been absent. Incompletes are messy for both you and us. All matters relating to absences, incomplet es, or make-up work must be appr oved by the course coordinator. Dr. Russell. 3. Please do not eat, drink, smoke , or chew gum, in the necropsy r oom or adjoining areas for obvious safety reasons. Please wash your hands and your boots thoroughly when leaving the necropsy area. 4. Please stay out from under the hoist when it is working. Let th e pathology assistant coordinate all operations connected with se curing, pushing, and raising or lowering of animals. 208 5. The band saw and meat saw are not to be used by students. If sp ecimens require dissection using these tools please as the n ecropsy assistant or duty path ologist for assistance. 6. Please exercise caution with reg ard to sharp instruments.. If y ou do cut yourself, a First Aid Kit is available in MAGR 122B (off the Necropsy room). An instr uctional card is taped to the wall by this kit giving the phone numbers for medical assistanc e. Notify the duty pathologist of any injuries. 7. Please secure your hair if it is long enough to be in contact w ith the cases you are dissecting. Most jewelry is a bad idea in the necropsy room. 8. Do not be cavalier about the us e of phones or tablets in the ne cropsy area. Photos are not to be posted on the Web and should only be taken to help you recall g ross details of a case. If using electronics in this area they must be in a plastic bag which is discarded when you leave the area. 9. If you have some form of immunosuppression please consult with Dr. Russell, and/or the duty pathologist about ways for you to do alternate work or do make- up work. Students who are pregnant or have deep lacerati ons also fall in this category. Please inform the duty pathologist if you have NOT been vaccinated against rabies. 10. Please be cautious abo ut formalin. Formalin is a hepatic sensit izing agent, a suspected carcinogen/mutagen and can give rise to severe asthmatic or der mal reactions. If you spill some on your skin, be sure to wash the area well with soap and water . If you spill some on your clothing or cannot wash it away, be sure to return to your lock er and change clothes immediately after washing and rinsing the area. Eyewash units are available if necessary. Inform the necropsy technician or pathologist of formalin spills on the fl oor as we have formalin spill kits for this purpose. 11. You may wish to use a full face sh ield instead of safety goggle s when chipping bone, (as when opening skulls) or wheneve r working with tissues containin g trapped gases. These shields are located on hooks in the necropsy room and can be utilized a t any time you believe there is a danger to your eyes/face. 12. Please exercise extra caution when dissecting specimens suspect ed to contain zoonotic agents. Wearing a facemask is generally appropriate with these cases. Take note of case history information suggesting possible rabies or Salmonella infections, for example. 13. Disposal \"streams\". You will be given specific instructions abo ut where medical wastes, tissues from different animal spe cies, etc. may be routed. For instance, horseshoes must never go into the offal bins. Please reque st detailed instruction on the disposal procedures if they were omitted during your orientation session. 14. It is very important that pathogens not spread from the necrops y floor to other areas such as the teaching hospital. Please be especially careful to maintain good foot sanitation. We hope you will visit again here in necropsy after the end of your rotation. We are also appreciative of the case consu ltations you ofte n provide when o n clinics and the well-written case abstracts you sometimes are asked to provide when submitti ng samples. Good luck and good learning. 209 OHS Small Animal Primary Care VMC 794 Guidelines and Procedures Instructor in charge - Dr. Kirk Miller This rotation is a three week required rotation in Primary Care based at the Oregon Humane Society in Portland, OR. Students will perform medical and surg ical treatments for the benefit of animals donated to OHS. Students will be provided with living q uarters at the OHS for the duration of their three week rotation. Students will be supervi sed by either an Oregon State University CVM faculty member (DVM) or a veterinarian employed by the Oregon Humane Society. This is a graded course and grades will be assigned by the Oregon State University faculty member. The block will start with orientation on Monday. The students a re expected to be on duty from Monday through Friday each week. The students will meet at the front of the building - SW corner labeled Incoming Pets - at 8:30 am the first Monday of t he rotation. The morning will be spent getting oriented, assigning rooms, paperwork, etc. We wil l begin taking care of patients in the afternoon. Learning Objectives: To give students experience in p erforming physical examinations To give students experience in providing preventative medicine and general health care To give students experience in performing elective surgeries To give students experience in d ental techniques commonly used in small animal general practice To expose students to behavioral p roblems in animals put up for adoption Learning Outcomes: After completing the course the students will have participated in a number of ovario- hysterectomies and castrations of dogs and cats. They will unde rstand the common behavioral problems of dogs and cats that m ight make them undesirable pets . They will enumerate the procedures and vaccinations necessary for continuing good healt h in pets. Clinic Assignments: Students will work under the su pervision of the OSU CVM faculty member (Dr. Miller) and the veterinarians employed by OHS. OHS has 3 Veterinarians plus a S helter Medicine Intern and a Shelter Medicine Resident - all are involved in student instruc tion. Each student is responsible for assigned cases until the patie nt is adopted or transferred to another student. Students will be responsible for morning treatments on a daily basis. These should be completed prior to morning rounds at 8:30 am (starting treatments at 8 am is usually sufficient, depending on caseload at that time). 210 The morning is typically spent i n special procedures/dentistry, seeing foster appointments, and taking care of medical cases presented through the shelter. Stu dent surgeries are generally performed from 1:30 pm until 4 pm. Evening rounds are held at 4:30 pm followed by evening treatmen ts. Evenings/Weekends: Students should expect to work e venings while at OHS. Examples include helping process/intake large numbers of dogs from other shelters, disch arging surgical patients, and providing medical information a bout pets to potential adopters. Students will typically be on duty until at least 7 pm Monday thru Wednesday and until 9 pm o n Thursday. There is no requirement that students work at OHS on the weeken ds. However, if students are staying in the Portland area, any help would be greatly appreci ated. Students will be able to provide continuity of care for their hospitalized patients and be able to assist the on-call Doctor with any emergencies that arise. Case Load: OHS takes in about 12,000 animal s per year. The save rate or \"l ive release rate\" is consistently around 98%. Students will be responsible for the care of their hospitalized patients as well as the patients in the Feline ICU or Upp er Respiratory Ward. It is imp ossible to predict the number of cases per student but every effort is made to provide equitable distribution of cases. Attire/ Professional Behavior: Attire consists of surgical scr ubs and a white doctor's coat. Professional behavior will be e xpected when dealing with foster parents, fellow students, and staff. Standard Equipment for Each Student: Bandage scissors Suture scissors Stethoscope Penlight Name Evaluation is based on criteria such as: attendance, rounds par ticipation, case participation, case management, attitude, work ethic, and teamwork with each other and OHS staff. Students will be given a grade based on the above criteria: A letter grade of A, B, C, F will be assigned for students part icipating in the VMC 794 rotation. If a major problem (e.g. patient care insufficient, attitude pr oblem) is noted early on, the clinician will give the student notice early in the block (formative comm ents) to give the student time to improve. Textbooks: There is a collection of books he re at OHS which is comparable to many small hospitals. Between the books available here and resources on the web most students are able to access the information needed to care for their patients. 211 Living Conditions: Dorm rooms are available for student use during your rotation. The rooms are equipped with beds and bedding, desks, lamps, etc. Students should bring thei r own towels and toiletries. There is a kitchen and living room in the student living quarte rs. The kitchen is well-equipped with a refrigerator, microwave, stove, dishwasher, etc. Dishes, pots/pans and most items needed for cooking are provided. The living room has a television with a satellite dish and a DVD player. Pet Policy: Students are allowed to bring one small or medium sized dog to stay with them while they are at OHS. The dog must be spayed or n eutered, well-behaved, house-tr ained, wear visible ID, and be crated while students are working. Do not bring large, loud, or poorly behaved dogs. Contact Person: If you have any questions regarding this rotation, please conta ct Dr. Miller. The best way to reach him is via e-mail at kirk.miller@oregonstate.edu . The address is: Kirk Miller, DVM, Dip ABVP 1067 NE Columbia Blvd Portland, OR 97211 212 VMC 780 Veterinary Preceptorship Guidelines and Procedures Course Coordinator: Dr. Susan J. Tornquist (541) 737-6943 office phone Susan.Tornquist@oregonstate.edu Preceptorship Requirement The opportunity to observe and to work with practicing veterina rians in a variety of settings is a very valuable experience for vet erinary students. All fourth-ye ar veterinary students are required to participate in at least four weeks and up to eight weeks of preceptorships. Preceptorships can be scheduled as one, two, three, or four weeks at a time as lon g as there are at least four weeks total. The weeks may all be with the same veterinarian or with different preceptors Students are responsible for arranging their own preceptorships . There are resources available to help you do this. Here is a link to a spreadsheet that provides you detailed information about the preceptorships that our students have gone to for the last seve ral years. You should be able to search for preceptorships by location and practice type and lea rn about the types of cases seen at the preceptorship: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsN8FljFxuyrdEs2dU 5vbmNnc2FIckl5VG94SmJ4dmc&usp= sharing Students must get approval from the Dean's office for each prec eptorship by entering the potential preceptor's name, practi ce address, and phone number and e-mail address in E*Value. This must be approved at least 2 weeks before the preceptorship begins. The primary requirement for approval of a pr eceptorship is that the student will be supervised at all times by a licensed DVM. Within a week after completing the preceptorship, the student is to submit a report on the preceptorship and a \"daily log\" of the practice a ctivities during the block on E*Value. ( NOTE: This information is a requirement for graduation.) Any changes in preceptorship rotation, i.e., change of preceptor, length of ti me, date, etc., must be approved by the Dean's Office. Objectives of the Preceptorship Program 1. To familiarize students with the problems associated with the p ractice of veterinary medicine. These include the clini cal, financial, and management situations which may be different from those seen in a university environment. 2. To increase the variety of clinical cases and clients that stud ents are exposed to in their educational programs. 3. To acquaint the student with the philosophy of practice and the role of the veterinarian in a community. 4. To allow the student to interact with the practitioners and the ir clients. 213 5. To provide the student the opportunity to apply knowledge gaine d in an academic setting to practice situations. 6. To improve communication between veterinarians and the College. Duties of Preceptors The preceptorship program is intended to demonstrate the realit ies of practice to students. Consequently, working hours and conditions will be those negoti ated by the student and the practitioner prior to the start of the preceptorship. Although the work day may not be an 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. arrangement, the preceptorship program is int ended to be full-time participation, and include approximately 40 hours per week. The student should be allowed to perform and participate in those professional services approved by the practitioner that do not conflict with State Veterinary Medical Practice Acts. Responsibilities of the Student 1. Conduct yourself in a profe ssional and ethical manner. 2. Follow instructions and carry out assignments from the veterina rian. 3. Honor confidentiality of the doctor/client relationship. 4. Use good judgment in handling ma tters that arise when a veterin arian is unavailable for consultation. 5. Provide a description of the type of practice, experience gaine d, and turn in a \"daily log\" of the practice activities in which he or she was involved during the block. Responsibilities of the Preceptor 1. Conduct his or her practice in a professional and ethical manne r. 2. Advise student of his or her duties and responsibilities. 3. Supervise student in assi gnments when necessary. 4. Discuss important aspects of practice with student in a meaning ful way. 5. Evaluate performance of student. Emergency/Safety Information If, at any time, or for any reas on, you feel uncomfortable, uns afe, or unsupervised at your preceptorship, contact the Dean's office right away at (541)737 -2098. If it is after hours or on the weekend, or there is no answer a t the phone number given, call Dr. Tornquist at a ny of the phone numbers listed at the top of this section. 214 215 Registration Graduation Requirements The course registration pro cess continues each term for 4th year. All required courses, elective and preceptorship credits must be accounted for on your final O SU transcript in order to graduate. Summer term= Evalue blocks 1, 2 and 3 Fall term= Evalue blocks 4, 5 and 6 Winter term= Evalue blocks 7, 8, 9 and 10 Spring term= Evalue blocks 11, 12 and 13 Senior Papers A written paper and oral presentation of the paper are a part o f the requirements for graduation. Students are encouraged to develop topics that might be used fo r presentations given after graduation or result in a publi cation. The subject should be re lated to veterinary medicine and be of interest to veterinarians. References used should provide th e most current knowledge on the subject. WRITTEN PAPER The paper will be written in electronic format, double-spaced. The reference section is to be single-spaced. Your title page should show the title and the au thor. The advisor's name should be in the lower right-hand corner. When the advisor gives her/his final approval to the paper, she/he should sign a hard copy of the title page with the signature ab ove his/her name indicating acceptance of the paper. Failure to comply with these requireme nts will mean rejection of the paper, regardless of content. The written paper will be critiqu ed as to content, style, and format, by the student's senior paper advisor and the Dean's Office. St udents should follow the instructions to authors of JAVMA . You can find the JAVMA instructions to authors for specific details at http://www.avma.org/Ne ws/Journals/Page s/javma-ifa.aspx ORAL PRESENTATION The oral presentation is scheduled for 15-20 minutes of present ation and 10 minutes of discussion, question and answer. The senior paper may be the ma in points and basic principles of a big subject or an in-depth research of a smaller subject. The oral presentation should be designed to best convey to the audience some of the material in the written paper. As much as possible the paper should not be read, as this is a poor way to present an oral paper. The faculty attending the oral p resentation will evaluate the c ontent and the presentation, and give the presentation a PASS or NO PASS. Their comments will be informative and intended as constructive criticism. If a majority of the faculty gives a gr ade of NO PASS, then the student will be required to either re-submit a satisfactory paper, or m ake another oral p resentation of passing quality, or both. 216 CALENDAR 1. Selection of date and topi c for the presentation . All dates should be selected by June 30, 2018. No more than two papers may be scheduled on any one day. Topics should be selected as soon as possible and each prese ntation topic must be differe nt from all others. The Dean's Office will serve as the coordinator for this program and will maintain the master calendar. 2. Selection of advisor. The advisor is usually someone in the College of Veterinary Med icine. Any faculty member may be asked t o serve as a faculty advisor. Occasionally, the best advisor is someone outside the College, and this is acceptable if the individual is able to advise and review drafts of the paper. If you need help with fi nding a faculty member to advise you on your topic of inter est, contact the Associate Dea n for assistance. The advisor will: a. Help define an adequate subject and the scope of the paper. A p roposed title and outline of the paper must be presented fo r approval to your advisor at least 60 days prior to the scheduled seminar presentation date. The student must complete the required form (including student name, topic, advisor's name, presentation da te, paper draft due date, and final paper due date plus si gnatures of student and advisor ) and submit to the Dean's office at least 60 days prior to the scheduled seminar presenta tion date. If this form is not submitted, the oral presentation will be delayed. b. Review the paper's rough drafts and give constructive comments on the content and format. c. Assist the student, as needed, regarding the oral presentation. d. Review and approve the final copy within 4 weeks of the oral presentation or prior to completion of program/graduatio n, whichever comes first. The ad visor should be given a hard copy of the title page and sign this hard copy, indicating approval of the paper. The final paper must be presented to the advisor at least 14 days p rior to this deadline. Be sure that you and your advisor are clea r on expectations and deadlines before you start researching your topic. If you can't agree on these, you should probably find a different advisor. Expectations of different advisors can vary quite a bit so this needs to be discussed at the outset. 3. Submitting the final paper. The final copy of the paper which has been approved by the advi sor must be submitted as an email attachment to the Dean's Office within 4 weeks of the oral presentation or prior to completion of program/graduation, whichever comes first. At the same time, a hard copy of the title page with the advisor's original signature must be gi ven in to the Student Services coordinator. If the final paper and signed title page are not p resent in the Dean's Office before this date, it is important to note that this could resul t in a delay of graduation. 4. Final approval of the paper The Dean's Office will notify the student once the paper has be en approved and will send an electronic copy to the librarian. The student and faculty advis or will receive a compiled version of faculty comments on the presentation. If you do not receive notification of approval within a few weeks of completion, check with the Dean' s office to find out the status of your paper. 217 Real Time Assessment Completion of three real-time clinical assessments (RTAs) are r equired for graduation for the Class of 2019. These RTAs are in tended to provide immediate and useful feedback to students on their mastery of a variety of clinical skills in a real pati ent, directly-observed setting. It is the responsibility of each senior student to request a fa culty member/house officer to perform each of the three RTAs. It is expected that the three R TAs will include one in surgery, one in medicine, and one in a rotation such as Rural Veterinary Practice that can demonstrate the student's skill in disease prev ention, biosecurity, zoonotic di seases and/or food safety. The student will be observed th roughout the case work-up and as sessed on a 5 point scale for proficiency in the case-relevant competencies listed on the eva luation sheet (attached). The observer will discuss the assessment with the students to point out areas of particular strengths and weaknesses and to provide suggestions for actions the stude nt might take to improve her/his skills in designated areas. In addition to being discussed with the student, the RTA evalua tions will be given to the Dean's office where they will be used as direct assessment of the clin ical competencies of fourth year students. RTA's can be submitted electronically from the current student website or by paper copy. Paper copies are available in the Dean's Office. 218 Real-Time Assessment (Please Circle ONE): Medicine Surgery Disease Prevention/Biosecurity Student Name Date Rotation Name Species Competencies 1.
