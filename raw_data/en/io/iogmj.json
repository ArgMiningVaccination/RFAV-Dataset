Infectious Diseases Clinic, University Hospital Galway, Newcastle Road, Galway About the mpox vaccine The smallpox vaccine can be used to protect against mpox. This is because mpox is caused by a similar virus to smallpox. When the smallpox vaccine is used for mpox, we call it the mpox vaccine. How the mpox vaccine is given Most people will get the vaccine through an injection between layers of skin in your forearm. This is a smaller dose but gives you the same protection as an injection under your skin. Doses of mpox vaccine If you are a close contact of someone with mpox, you will get 1 dose of the mpox vaccine. Some close contacts will get 2 doses. If you book a vaccine you will get 2 doses of the mpox vaccine, at least 28 days apart. If you had a smallpox vaccine before, you only need 1 dose of the vaccine. But if you have a weak immune system, you will need 2 doses. Vaccines may be less effective for you than other people. Protection from mpox after vaccine It takes 14 days after your course of the vaccine for it to work. There is a chance you might still get mpox, even if you have had the vaccine. But it may reduce any symptoms of mpox. Who should not get the mpox vaccine If you have had mpox, you do not need to get the mpox vaccine. Do not get the mpox vaccine if you have had an allergic reaction to any of the vaccine ingredients, including: - chicken protein - benzonase - gentamicin - ciprofloxacin - Trometamol Mpox vaccine side effects The most common side effects of the vaccine are: - headache - nausea - muscle pain (myalgia) - tiredness - reactions where you got the vaccine, including pain, redness, swelling, hardening and itching These may affect more than 1 in 10 people. Reporting side effects You can report a side effect on the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) website. [Report a side effect - hpra.ie](http://www.hpra.ie/homepage/about-us/report-an-issue) You can report it yourself, or your doctor or family member can do that for you. Mpox vaccine and COVID-19 vaccines If you are due a COVID-19 vaccine dose, you can get it 4 weeks after your mpox vaccine. If you have recently had a COVID-19 vaccine dose, you can get the mpox vaccine any time after this. You do not need to wait 4 weeks. "}
