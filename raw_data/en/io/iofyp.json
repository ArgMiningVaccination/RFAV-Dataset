In the light of sub-optimal uptake of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination, we investigated thefactors that influence the intentions of mothers to vaccinate.Method. A cross-sectional survey of 300 mothers in Birmingham with children approaching a routine MMR vaccina-tion was conducted using a postal questionnaire to measure:intention to vaccinate, psychological variables, knowledge ofthe vaccine, and socioeconomic status. The vaccination statusof the children was obtained from South Birmingham ChildHealth Surveillance Unit.Results. The response rate was 59%. Fewer mothers approaching the second MMR vaccination (Group 2) intendedto take their children for this vaccination than Group 1 (mothersapproaching the first MMR vaccination) (Mann-Whitney U =2180, P<0.0001). Group 2 expressed more negative beliefsabout the outcome of having the MMR (Mann-Whitney U was 'unsafe' (c 2= 9.114, P = 0.004) and that it rarely protected (c2= 6.882, P = 0.014) than Group 1. The commonest side-effect cited was general malaise, but29.8% cited autism. The most trusted source of information wasthe general practitioner but the most common source of infor-mation on side-effects was television (34.6%). Multiple linearregression revealed that, in Group 1, only 'vaccine outcomebeliefs' significantly predicted intention (77.1% of the variance).In Group 2 'vaccine outcome beliefs', attitude to the MMR vac-cine, and prior MMR status all predicted intention (93% of thevariance).Conclusion. A major reason for the low uptake of the MMR vaccination is that it is not perceived to be important for chil-dren's health, particularly the second dose. Health educationfrom GPs is likely to have a has been reported that the uptake of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination has fallen1since the publication of the hypothesis proposed by Wakefield and colleagues2of a link between the MMR vaccination and Crohn's disease and autism.This fall has been attributed to the media attention given to thehypothesis 3and it is feared that the publication of two reports4,5 that have found no evidence for the hypothesis will fail to receive as much media attention. However, the links between media cov-erage of possible side-effects, public perceptions of the vaccina-tion, and the fall in uptake are speculative. The communication ofrisk and the effects of that communication on behaviour are com-plex, relating both to individual cognition and to social and cul-tural factors, including the perceptions of the communicator. 6 To date, very little research has been carried out on reasons for variation in uptake of the MMR vaccination. Although previouswork using the theoretical context of health behaviour models hasgiven us insights into vaccination behaviour (for example, thework of Peckham, 1989 7), it is important to research the MMR vaccination because it differs from other vaccinations studied intwo important respects. First, the current United Kingdom two-dose MMR schedule 8means that parents are being asked to con- sent to a second dose, which is possibly unnecessary for theirchild, at a time when they have less contact with primary careprofessionals in regard to the health of their child than in baby-hood. Secondly, the MMR vaccination provides protectionagainst diseases common in the childhood of today's parents,which may lead to lower perceived severity. The current two-doseschedule will achieve virtually 100% protection onlyif there is uniform coverage of 95% of both vaccines. 9For British children who were five years old in the final quarter of 1999, first-doseMMR coverage is 93% while second-dose coverage is only75.9%. 10 Using the theoretical framework of the Theory of Planned Behaviour,11we carried out a survey to assess the factors that influence mothers' intentions to have their children vaccinated.We chose to study intentions so as to provide an insight into thedecision-making process and thus inform educational interven-tions. We compared mothers of five- to 12-month-old children(those with children coming up to the first MMR vaccine) withmothers of 21- to 35-month-old children (those with childrencoming up to the second MMR vaccine). Method A prospective cross-sectional survey was conducted using a pre-piloted questionnaire. Eight general practices in southBirmingham agreed to take part in the study and gave writtenconsent for Birmingham Health Authority to release confidentialinformation for all children aged between five and 12 months(prior to the first MMR vaccine) and between 21 and 35 months(prior to the second MMR vaccine). From the sampling framesprovided by the health authority, twins were excluded and themothers who had children in both the five- to 12-month-old andthe 21- to 35-month-old cohorts were excluded from the 21- to35-month-old-cohort. This left a total of 219 mothers of childrenin the five- to 12-month-old-cohort (Group 1) and 620 mothersof children in the 21- to 35-month-old cohort (Group 2). Onehundred and fifty from each group were randomly selected toparticipate in the study. The mothers were sent a 48-item ques-tionnaire, covering letters from the investigators and the child'sgeneral practitioner, and a reply-paid envelope in and H M Pattison, BSc, MSc, PhD, senior lecturer, Department of Primary Care and General Practice, University ofBirmingham Medical School.Submitted: 28 January 2000; Editor's response: 9 May 2000; final accep-tance: 2 August 2000. \u00a9 British Journal of General Practice, 2000, 50, 969-971.970 British Journal of General Practice, December 2000M Pareek and H M Pattison Original papers the questionnaire. Confidentiality of the information they gave from their general practice and any health authority personnelwas assured. Two mailings of the questionnaire were sent (fur-ther mailings were not possible because of the proximity of theMMR vaccination decision). The questionnaire had three sections. The first section asked about psychological factors likely to be related to vaccinationbehaviour 11 with responses given on five-point Likert-type scales (1 = 'strongly agree'; through to 5 = 'strongly disagree'): attitudes to vaccination, e.g. 'How safe do you think the MMR vaccine is?'; attitudes to the diseases prevented, e.g. 'How serious do you feel measles is?'; beliefs about the outcome of vaccination and evaluation of these ('vaccine outcome beliefs'), e.g. 'Vaccinations protectmy child against the diseases measles, mumps and rubella'; beliefs about others' attitudes to vaccination and the motiva- tion to comply with these, e.g. 'My GP wants my child tohave the MMR vaccine'; and beliefs about the ability to obtain vaccination and external obstacles or opportunities involved, e.g. 'Taking my childfor vaccinations is very easy'. The second section covered other issues pertaining to the MMR vaccine, including maternal knowledge about the MMRschedule, adverse effects, and contraindications. It also askedmothers where they obtained information from about the MMRvaccine and its side-effects and whose opinion they valued inmaking a decision to immunise. The third section obtainedsociodemographic information from the mothers, including theirage, occupational class, educational qualifications, marital status,and ethnic group. Data analysis was conducted using the SPSSpackage, 12and for all tests significance was set at P<0.05. Participants Responses were received from 173 out of 295 mothers (five were returned as the mothers had moved away), giving a response rateof 58% for Group 1 and 60% for Group 2 (59% overall). Of theresponders, 85.6% described their ethnic background as white,3.5% as African Caribbean, and 8.7% as Indian or Pakistani.This represents a slightly higher proportion of white women thanthe proportion in Birmingham as a whole (78.2%), and a slightlylower proportion of African Caribbean and Indian or Pakistani(4.7% and 12.4% respectively). 13The socioeconomic profile of the responders (measured by occupation and educational level)showed a very similar profile to that in national surveys ofwomen in this age group. 14,15Group 1 did not significantly differ from Group 2 in ethnicity or socioeconomic status. Results There was no significant difference between the responders andnon-responders in Group 1 or Group 2 in terms of vaccinationcoverage. According to South Birmingham Child HealthSurveillance Unit (CHSU) data, 89.5% of the children of Group1 and 94.3% of the children of Group 2 had received their com-plete course of primary vaccinations by the age of six months. Ofthe Group 2 children, 91.5% had received their first MMR vac-cine by the age of 21 months. The mothers who did not havetheir child vaccinated with the first MMR dose all cited 'fear ofvaccine' as their reason for this. The age when the first MMR vaccine is given was known to 62.4% of mothers and 69.9% knew when the second MMR vac-cine is given. There were no differences between Groups 1 and2. Nearly half the responders (48.6%) said that the vaccine didcause side-effects and a further 32.9% were unsure, with no sig-nificant difference between the two groups. Mothers generally had good levels of knowledge about the adverse effects causedby the MMR vaccine, with general malaise the most commonlycited side-effect in response to an open question \u2014 44.2% inGroup 1 and 58.5% in Group 2. However, there was evidencethat the media have left a lasting impression on mothers, with29.8% saying that the vaccine caused autism, and 13.1% sayingit caused Crohn's disease, again in answer to an open questionwithout prompts. Group 2 mothers were significantly more likelyto say that the vaccine causes serious neurological effects ( 2= 6.267, df = 1, P= 0.016). A high proportion of mothers (41.1%) said that there are valid contraindications to the MMR vaccine,most commonly citing 'child unwell at time of vaccine'.However, there was also evidence of misinformation with a sub-stantial proportion (27.7%) citing invalid contraindications, e.g.'adverse reactions to previous vaccines for family members'. Mothers consulted a wide variety of sources to obtain general information about the MMR vaccine, including health profes-sionals, friends, family, and the media. In both groups the com-monest source of general vaccine information was the health vis-itor (77.9% in Group 1 and 76.7% in Group 2). In contrast, moth-ers predominantly acquired their information about the side-effects of the MMR vaccine from various sections of the mediarather than from health professionals, with television the mostcommonly cited source of information about side-effects (31.4%in Group 1 and 37.9% in Group 2). Nevertheless, mothers in bothgroups still valued the opinion of their GP most in making adecision to immunise. Group 2 mothers were significantly morelikely than Group 1 mothers to value their own opinion as veryimportant ( 2= 7.128, df = 1, three vaccine-preventable dis- eases (measles, mumps, and rubella) were serious, with measlesperceived to be most serious disease (50.9% said it was 'very seri-ous') and mumps the least serious (36.1% felt it was 'very seri-ous'). Although the majority of mothers felt that the MMR vac-cine was 'very safe' or 'safe' (76.5%), the two groups differed intheir perception of its safety, with 8.1% of Group 1 mothersagreeing that the MMR vaccine was 'very unsafe' or 2= 9.114, df = 1, P = 0.004). Similar significant differences emerged in their percep-tion of the vaccine's efficacy, with 9.3% of Group 1 mothers and24.1% of Group 2 mothers saying that the vaccine ( 2= 6.882, df sig- nificantly more negative 'vaccine outcome beliefs' about theMMR 1 mothers (Mann-Whitney U =2154.5, z= -3.528, P<0.0001). This implies that they were less likely to believe that the vaccine protected their child from dis-ease and/or that this was an important outcome. Group 2 mothers had significantly lower intentions to take their child for the second MMR vaccine than Group 1 mothershad to take their child for the first MMR vaccine(Mann-Whitney U = 2180, z= -3.823, P<0.0001). Multiple lin- ear regression of the factors predicting intention for each agegroup revealed that in Group 1 the sole significant predictor ofintention was 'vaccine outcome beliefs', which accounted for77.1% of the variance in the intention score. In Group 2, threefactors significantly predicted intention: 'vaccine outcomebeliefs', attitude to MMR vaccine, and prior MMR status (i.e.first MMR status) that together accounted for 93% of the vari-ance in intention . Discussion Mothers in Birmingham whose children were scheduled to have the MMR vaccine generally possessed good levels of knowledgeabout various facets of the MMR vaccine and mainly expressedBritish Journal of General Practice, December 2000 971M Pareek and H M Pattison Original papers positive opinions about it. However, there was evidence, in some of the mothers' responses, that adverse publicity about the MMRvaccine has left a lasting impression. Hence a minority do nottrust the safety of the vaccine and are unsure about possible side-effects of the vaccine. Furthermore, a minority of mothers, ofolder children especially, doubt the efficacy of the vaccine andits benefit to their child. Despite the good level of knowledge and generally positive attitudes about the vaccine, uptake of the first and second MMRvaccine is predicted to be sub-optimal in this population \u2014 87%of Group 1 mothers intended to take their child for first MMRand only 78% of Group 2 mothers intended to take their child forsecond MMR. This is further evidence that the two-dose sched-ule, which requires 95% uptake of each dose, may be failing.There is a small group of mothers who will not take up eitherdose and for them the safety of the vaccine is of primary impor-tance. However, the two groups significantly differed in theirintention to have their child immunised because they differed inthe degree to which they believed it is important and necessary. Exposure to the extensive media coverage of concerns about the MMR vaccine does not explain the difference between thegroups. One interpretation of these findings is that Group 2mothers are not only concerned about the safety of the vaccinebut also question the importance and necessity of the seconddose. This group had less contact with health professionals andexpressed more confidence in their own judgement. So the viewsof the media and others outside the health services may havemore influence on vaccination behaviour in mothers of olderchildren. It may also be that they perceived their (older) childrenas less vulnerable to the effects of disease. Non-responders did not differ from responders in vaccination uptake and responders seem to be representative of the popula-tion, nevertheless some caution should be exercised in generalis-ing from a relatively small sample. With that caveat, the findingsof this study have important implications for the health servicebecause they suggest reasons why MMR immunisation coverageis poor. There is a clear need to instigate educational campaignsat both the national and local levels that not only emphasise thesafety of MMR vaccine and the danger of the vaccine-pre-ventable diseases, but which also emphasise the efficacy of thevaccine and delineate the rationale behind the two-dose schedule. Finally, since a majority of mothers value their GP's opinion most in making a decision to immunise and want more informa-tion from health professionals, the GP's role in education wouldappear to be central. Not only could this help to raise the uptakeof the vaccine but it could also help to reassure those motherswho will have their child vaccinated the first time but are unhap-py with the decision. Three of the four practices that declined totake part in the study gave as their reason that they did not wantthe subject raised with the mothers in their practice, fearing thatthis would put them off having the vaccination. It seems fromour results that more information from responsible health profes-sionals would have the opposite effect and help to counter thenegative impact of media scare stories. References 1.
