This coincided with the introduction of Thimerosal-containing hepatitis B vaccine in 1991, and the subsequent introduction of Thimerosal-reduced hepatitis B vaccine in the early 2000s. This study examined the potential relationship between infant exposure to mercury from three doses of Thimerosal-containing hepatitis B vaccine and the risk of boys being adversely affected (as measured by receipt of SES). This cross-sectional study examined 1192 boys (weighted n = 24,537,123) 7-8 years of age (born: 1994-2007) from the combined 2001-2014 National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES). Survey logistic regression modeling revealed that an exposed population receiving three doses of infant Thimerosal-containing hepatitis B vaccine (weighted n = 11,186,579), in comparison to an unexposed population (weighted n = 704,254), were at an increased risk of receipt of SES. This association was robust (crude odds ratio = 10.143, p = 0.0232), even when considering covariates, such as race and socioeconomic status (adjusted odds ratio = 9.234, p = 0.0259). Survey frequency modeling revealed that receipt of SES for the population that was exposed to three doses of Thimerosal-containing hepatitis B vaccine in infancy (12.91%) was significantly higher than the unexposed population (1.44%) (prevalence ratio = 8.96, p = 0.006, prevalence attributable rate = 0.1147). Despite the limitation of this cross-sectional study not being able to ascribe a direct cause-and-effect relationship between exposure and outcome, it is estimated that an additional 1.2 million boys received SES with excess education costs of about United States (US) $180 billion associated with exposure to Thimerosal-containing hepatitis B vaccine. By contrast, exposure to Thimerosal-reduced hepatitis B vaccine was not associated with an increased risk of receiving SES. Therefore, routine childhood vaccination is important to reduce the morbidity and mortality of infectious diseases, but every effort should be made to eliminate Thimerosal from all vaccines.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2018-01-12", "cleaned_text": "A Cross-Sectional Study of the Association between Infant Hepatitis B Vaccine Exposure in Boys and the Risk of Adverse Effects as Measured by Receipt of Special Education Services [https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph15010123](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph15010123) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-ijerph-15-00123)]. [2](#B2-ijerph-15-00123)]. [3](#B3-ijerph-15-00123)]. Infants in the 1990s received 12.5 micrograms (g) Hg per dose of Thimerosal-containing hepatitis B vaccine, and consequently received a total of 37.5 g Hg from the three dose series. The dosing schedule was recommended to begin at birth and to be completed by six months of age [ [2](#B2-ijerph-15-00123)]. Thus, in the 1990s, the infant hepatitis B vaccine was often the earliest routine vaccine source of Thimerosal exposure. [4](#B4-ijerph-15-00123)]. Vaccine manufacturers began to license, manufacture, and distribute Thimerosal-reduced (<1 g Hg per dose) childhood vaccines in the US. The decline in the percentage of students served under the IDEA from 2004-2005 through 2011-2012 appears to coincide with the reduction of Thimerosal from some childhood vaccines, including hepatitis B that were routinely administered to American infants beginning in 2001. [5](#B5-ijerph-15-00123)]. It was hypothesized that infant exposure to Hg from three doses of Thimerosal-containing hepatitis B vaccines, in comparison to no exposure to hepatitis B vaccines, among children born in the 1990s, would significantly increase the long-term risk to boys of adverse effects, as measured by receipt of special education services. It was also hypothesized that the subsequent reduction of Thimerosal from hepatitis B vaccines in the early 2000s would reduce the long-term risk of boys incurring adverse effects as measured by receipt of special education services following infant exposure to three doses of hepatitis B vaccine, in comparison to no doses of hepatitis B vaccine, among children born in the 2000s. 2. Methods 2.1. Study Participants 2.2. Outcomes 2.3. Exposures [2](#B2-ijerph-15-00123)], through approximately the year 2000 [ [6](#B6-ijerph-15-00123)]. The second group examined in this study was the sub-population of persons born from 1994-2000 (n = 565, weighted n = 11,890,832). Among this sub-population, the infant Thimerosal-containing hepatitis B vaccine exposed group was defined as those persons receiving three doses of hepatitis B vaccine (variable: hepatitis B vaccine exposure = 2, n = 524, weighted n = 11,186,579), and the unexposed group was defined as those persons receiving no doses of hepatitis B vaccine (variable: hepatitis B vaccine exposure = 1, n = 41, weighted n = 704,254). The third group examined in this study was the sub-population of persons born from 2001-2007 (n = 627, weighted n = 12,646,291). Among this sub-population, the infant Thimerosal-reduced hepatitis B vaccine exposed group was defined as those persons receiving three doses of hepatitis B vaccine (variable: hepatitis B vaccine exposure = 2, n = 591, weighted n = 11,807,946) and the unexposed group was defined as those persons receiving no doses of hepatitis B vaccine (variable: hepatitis B vaccine exposure = 1, n = 36, weighted n = 838,345). 2.4. Statistical Analyses 3. Results [Table 1](#ijerph-15-00123-t001)displays the characteristics of the overall population of boys born from 1994-2007 that were examined in this study (n = 1192, weighted n = 24,537,123). The overall exposed group receiving three doses of infant hepatitis B vaccine (n = 1115, weighted n = 22,994,525) was similar to the overall unexposed group receiving no doses of hepatitis B vaccine (n = 77, weighted n = 1,542,598) for age, birth year, race, and socioeconomic status. [Table 2](#ijerph-15-00123-t002)summarizes the survey logistic regression models generated to examine the potential relationship between the three doses of infant hepatitis B vaccine exposure and the risk of adverse effects, as measured by receipt of special education services. It was revealed that the exposed group receiving three doses of infant Thimerosal-containing hepatitis B vaccine in comparison to its contemporaneous unexposed group receiving no doses of hepatitis B vaccine was at a more than nine-fold significantly higher risk of adverse effects, as measured by receipt of special education services in both the unadjusted model (Model I, odds ratio (OR) = 10.143, p = 0.0232, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.373 to 74.950) and in the adjusted model (Model II, OR = 9.234, p = 0.0259, 95% CI = 1.306 to 65.286). In addition, no differences in the risk for adverse effects, as measured by receipt of special education services among boys were observed when comparing the overall exposed group that received three doses of infant hepatitis B vaccine (regardless of Thimerosal status) in the unadjusted model (Model I, OR = 1.707, p = 0.2551, 95% CI = 0.680 to 4.286), or the adjusted model (Model II, OR = 1.686, p = 0.2722, 95% CI = 0.664 to 4.285), or the exposed group that received three doses of infant Thimerosal-reduced hepatitis vaccine in the unadjusted model (Model I, OR = 0.977, p = 0.9647, 95% CI = 0.348 to 2.744) or the adjusted model (Model II, OR = 0.952, p = 0.9286, 95% CI = 0.324 to 2.798) as compared to their respective contemporaneous unexposed groups receiving no doses of hepatitis B vaccine. Finally, it was revealed in Model II that receipt of special education services was also significantly related to the covariates of race (non-Hispanic Whites were significantly more likely to receive special education services than Hispanics) and socioeconomic status in two of the three models constructed. [Table 3](#ijerph-15-00123-t003)displays the prevalence ratio for receipt of special education services subsequent to the exposed group receiving three doses of infant hepatitis B vaccine in comparison to its contemporaneous unexposed group receiving no doses of hepatitis B vaccine. It was observed that exposure to three doses of infant Thimerosal-containing hepatitis B vaccine, in comparison to no-exposure, significantly increased the risk (prevalence ratio = 8.961, p = 0.006, 95% CI = 1.202 to 66.667) and the attributable risk (prevalence attributable rate = 0.1147) of receipt of special education services. As a consequence, it is estimated that 1,283,101 boys born from 1994-2000 received special education services associated with receipt of three doses of infant Thimerosal-containing hepatitis B vaccine. By contrast, it was observed that exposure to three doses of infant Thimerosal-reduced hepatitis B vaccine, in comparison to no-exposure, was not associated with an increased risk or attributable risk of receipt of special education services. 4. Discussion [7](#B7-ijerph-15-00123)]. In the Gallagher and Goodman study, as in the present study, the investigators examined the NHANES data for the rate of special education services among boys receiving three doses of infant Thimerosal-containing hepatitis B vaccines in comparison to no hepatitis B vaccines. They observed, consistent with the significantly increased risk observed in the present study, that boys who received three doses of infant Thimerosal-containing hepatitis B vaccines in comparison to no hepatitis B vaccines incurred a nine-fold significantly increased risk for receiving special education services, after adjustment for confounders. Even though both studies observed a significant relationship between infant exposure to Thimerosal-containing hepatitis B vaccines and the long-term risk for boys of receiving special education services, the present study is differentiated from the previous study by the fact that the investigators in the previous study only examined a single year, 1999-2000, from the NHANES data on children born in the 1990s. As a result, the previous study was not able to test and evaluate the potential consequences of the reduction of Thimerosal from hepatitis B vaccines in the 2000s. In addition, unlike the present study, in which, by combining multiple NHANES years, it was possible to ensure that enough data was collected on older children (i.e., 7-8 year-olds) with greater stability in their rates of special education services, the previous study had to rely on the rates of special education services across a much wider age group (i.e., 1-9 year-olds). Thus, the wider age group examined in the previous study may have impacted the stability of the rate of special education services examined (i.e., different age groups may receive different rates of special education services). Finally, the present study is differentiated from the previous study because the present study provides an estimate of the total number of boys in the US who received special education services that are attributably associated with the administration of three doses of infant Thimerosal-containing hepatitis B vaccines. [8](#B8-ijerph-15-00123)]. These investigators observed that infants receiving additional doses of Hg from Thimerosal-containing hepatitis B vaccines administered within the first month, the first two months, and the first six months of life, in comparison to infants receiving no Hg doses from Thimerosal-containing hepatitis B vaccines, were at a significantly increased long-term risk of being diagnosed with learning disabilities. These investigators then concluded that from 1991-2001 an estimated 500,000-1 million additional US children were diagnosed with learning disabilities as a consequence of increased exposure to Hg from Thimerosal-containing hepatitis B vaccines, with an additional lifetime cost exceeding US $1 trillion. [9](#B9-ijerph-15-00123)]. Like the 2016 study, the 2014 study revealed that increasing doses of Hg from Thimerosal-containing hepatitis B vaccines within the first month, the first two months, and the first six months of life significantly increased the long-term risk of children being diagnosed with learning disabilities. [10](#B10-ijerph-15-00123)]. It was revealed on a per g Hg basis, that cases of autism, ADHD, learning disabilities, or tic disorder were significantly more likely than controls to have received increased Hg exposure from Thimerosal-containing hepatitis B vaccines administered within the first six months of life. [11](#B11-ijerph-15-00123)]. Medical event information, specific vaccine history, and selected demographic information from multiple Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) are linked together in the VSD database [ [12](#B12-ijerph-15-00123)], and it was previously demonstrated that the VSD population is large enough to be representative of the general US population [ [11](#B11-ijerph-15-00123)]. [6](#B6-ijerph-15-00123)]. It was observed that neurodevelopmental disorders reported to VAERS rose significantly from 1991-1998 (a time when there was a significant increase in Hg exposure due to new recommendations for routine administration of Thimerosal-containing vaccines to infants), and it was also observed that the neurodevelopmental disorders reported to VAERS dropped significantly from mid-1999 onward (a time when there was a significant reduction in Hg exposure due to the adoption of Thimerosal-reduced vaccines). A 2014 case-control study of the VAERS revealed that cases diagnosed with the outcomes of autism, speech disorders, or developmental delay were significantly more likely than controls to have received exposure to a Thimerosal-preserved diphtheria-tetanus-acellular-pertussis (DTaP) vaccine (administered from 1997-1999) in comparison to its Thimerosal-reduced formulation (administered from 2004-2006) [ [13](#B13-ijerph-15-00123)]. Finally, a 2016 two-phase case-control study revealed a significant reduction in the risk of receiving an autism diagnosis among persons that were born from 1998-2003 [ [14](#B14-ijerph-15-00123)]. [15](#B15-ijerph-15-00123)]. Special education students are entitled to receive special education services from their local school district from age 3-18 or 21 years-old depending upon the locality. Assuming an average student receives 15 years of special education services, it is estimated that the excess overall education cost for the average special education student would be about US $140,535. This would mean that the excess cost of special education services provided to American boys born from 1994-2000 would be US $180,320,599,035 as a consequence of infant exposure to three doses of Thimerosal-containing hepatitis B vaccines. [Table 3](#ijerph-15-00123-t003), it is reasonable to infer that out of the 1,454,735 boys who received special education services and were born from 1994-2000, a total of 1,283,101 boys, or more than 88% (or about 1 in 1.13 boys receiving special education), were associated with exposure to three doses of infant Thimerosal-containing hepatitis B vaccine. This means that the majority of the boys who were receiving special education services and who were born from 1994-2000 were associated with infant Thimerosal-containing hepatitis B vaccine exposures, and were not associated with other environmental and/or genetic factors working in isolation. These results are compatible with several previous studies [ [8](#B8-ijerph-15-00123), [9](#B9-ijerph-15-00123), [10](#B10-ijerph-15-00123)]. [16](#B16-ijerph-15-00123), [17](#B17-ijerph-15-00123)]. In the first study, the investigators used a cohort study design to evaluate the relationship between neurodevelopmental disorders, such as learning disabilities and Thimerosal-containing vaccine administration in the VSD database [ [16](#B16-ijerph-15-00123)]. These investigators found no consistent significant increased risk for learning disabilities following increasing exposures to Thimerosal-containing vaccines. In the second study, the investigators used a cohort study design to evaluate the relationship between neurodevelopmental disorder outcomes and Thimerosal-containing vaccine administration in the general practitioner research database (GPRD) [ [17](#B17-ijerph-15-00123)]. These investigators observed the non-biologically plausible result that increased exposure to Thimerosal-containing vaccines, in a dose-dependent fashion, significantly reduced the risk of learning disabilities. As described elsewhere, these previously mentioned studies were analyzed in detail for their methodological limitations [ [18](#B18-ijerph-15-00123), [19](#B19-ijerph-15-00123)]. [20](#B20-ijerph-15-00123), [21](#B21-ijerph-15-00123), [22](#B22-ijerph-15-00123), [23](#B23-ijerph-15-00123)]. No safety standard has been set for ethyl-Hg, although ethyl-Hg's mechanisms of toxicity are considered to be similar to that for methyl-Hg, according to a recent study by the US CDC [ [24](#B24-ijerph-15-00123)]. Furthermore, it has been previously reported that alkyl-Hg compounds such as ethyl-Hg are known human developmental toxicants when exposure occurs in the prenatal and early postnatal periods [ [5](#B5-ijerph-15-00123)]. Further, consistent with the adverse effects observed in this study from infant Thimerosal-containing hepatitis B vaccines and the risk of receiving special education services in boys, it was reported that susceptibility to Hg toxicity is greater in younger persons and in males relative to females [ [5](#B5-ijerph-15-00123)]. [25](#B25-ijerph-15-00123)]. Long-range connections are important in many processes in the brain, such as reading, hearing, coordination, and speech/language [ [26](#B26-ijerph-15-00123), long-range neural tracts are associated with delays in development. Literacy, speech, and learning require these more speed-efficient long-range neural networks to bring about efficient communication overall these regions [ ACIP recommendation, it is possible that some of the persons assumed to have received three doses of hepatitis B vaccine as infants may have received doses later in life. It is presumed that any doses of hepatitis B vaccine administered later in life would have less or no effect on the risk of a boy receiving special education services. In addition, it was a priori determined that boys who received three doses of hepatitis B vaccine and who were born from 1994-2000 received Thimerosal-containing hepatitis B vaccines, whereas boys who received three doses of hepatitis B vaccine and who were born from 2001-2007 received Thimerosal-reduced vaccines, based upon the previously reported composition of hepatitis B vaccines [ [6](#B6-ijerph-15-00123)]. It is possible that a small percentage of hepatitis B vaccine doses administered to boys who were born from 1994-2000 may have had no Thimerosal. It is also possible that a small percentage of hepatitis B vaccine doses administered to boys who were born from 2001-2007 were administered Thimerosal-containing hepatitis B vaccines, because existing stocks of Thimerosal-containing hepatitis B vaccines continued to be administered following the Thimerosal phase-out announcement in 1999. It is believed these potential limitations would not have increased the association observed between exposure to Thimerosal-containing hepatitis B vaccines and special education services or decreased the lack of association that was observed between exposure to Thimerosal-reduced hepatitis B vaccines and special education services. In actuality, it is believed that such phenomena would have biased the results observed in the opposite direction (i.e., increased misclassification of exposure status of the populations examined). [10](#B10-ijerph-15-00123), [18](#B18-ijerph-15-00123), [32](#B32-ijerph-15-00123), [33](#B33-ijerph-15-00123), [34](#B34-ijerph-15-00123)] and biological plausibility data that the Hg component of the Thimerosal-containing hepatitis B vaccines was responsible, but it is possible that other components of hepatitis B vaccines, such as the aluminum adjuvant or the antigen, might act synergistically. Future studies should continue to determine which vaccine components may be responsible for special education service outcomes. [Table 4](#ijerph-15-00123-t004), exposure to three doses of infant Thimerosal-containing hepatitis B vaccine in comparison to no doses did not increase the risk of stomach or intestinal illness within the last 30 days. This further supports the assertion that there is not systematic bias or confounders mediating the associations observed in this study. 6. Conclusions [35](#B35-ijerph-15-00123)].
