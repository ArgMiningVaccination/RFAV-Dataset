As the Department grew, so did its research effort and level of funding. Until recently, continual growth in research funding for the Department of Surgery was gratifying indeed. The Department's research funding from all sources, both NIH and non-NIH, increased from about $10 to more than $21 million annually, during the period of 2002-2005. This growth was impressive, taking the Department from approximately 22 nd in the country in total NIH funding, to about 5th or 6th. It is difficult to obtain our ex act position amongst NIH-funded Departments of Surgery because this number is calculated by the NIH as a total of all Departments of Surgery at Harvard Medical School, including totals for all Harvard affiliated hospitals. Since 2005, our NIH and other funding for research have been declining. The NIH seems to view its funding for research as discretionary, which is particularly unfortunate given the number of people and planning that must go in to building one's research holdings, and also the nature of individuals that need to be supported. When there is little money, as there currently is not going to various military needs and other non-discretionary activity, NIH funding declines. Just as others have experienced a downturn in NIH funding, so have we. Our NIH and other funding have diminished, including a reduction in the total dollar amount for each awarded grant and the total number of NIH grants that are funded, including competing renewals of long-standing projects. It is unlikely that this trend will reverse soon and from my conversations with other Department chairs, this downturn is being experienced all over. Nonetheless, the Department of Surgery at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center has a robust research effort and continues to pursue academic productivity as well as research productivity with its excellent faculty. This fact is demonstrated in the following report that summarizes our research effort in 2007. Whether or not the current trend in NIH funding will reverse, is anybody's guess. At present, it looks like it will not. However, we are grateful for the fine clinical and research faculty that we have and the ability to support first class research that goes on in the Department. We look forward to better days. Josef E. Fischer, MD Chairman, Department of Surgery Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center William V.

A. Clowes, Jr. Professor of Surgery Susan J. Hagen, PhD Associate Director for Surgical Research Associate Professor of Surgery Sabrina Pinder, BS Administrative Coordinator A. Introduction In this section of the Annual Report, we provide an overall description of the goals and responsibilities of the Division of Surgical Research, a summary of research faculty in the Department, funding and publications generated by researchers in the Department of Surgery, and other aspects of research within the Department. More detailed resear ch updates are found for individual members of the different Divisions in subsequent sections of the report. The Division of Surgical Research is an administrative division with an aim to facilitate both basic and clinical research in the Department of Surgery at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC). The Division of Surgical Research is headed by Per-Olof Hasselgren, MD, PhD, who is Vice Chairman for Research in Surgery at BIDMC and the George H.A. Clowes Jr. Professor of Surgery at Harvard Medical School, and Susan J. Hagen, PhD, who is Associate Director for Surgical Research in Surgery at BIDMC and Associate Professor of Surgery at Harvard Medical School. The division is also supported by an administrative coordinator, Ms. Sabrina Pinder. The Division of Surgical Research has the following responsibilities: 1) Pre-award review and approval of all grant submissions in the Department of Surgery. This includes assisting in the process of submission of grant applications and interaction with the BIDMC Office of Sponsored Programs. 2) Management of research space, including laboratory and office space, and shared research equipment. For this, the allocation of research space within the Department is overs een, shared tissue culture facilities are maintained, and the Department is represented at various institutional committees and subcommittees dealing with research space at the BIDMC. 3) Organizing monthl y Surgical Research Se minars, open for both clinical and research faculty in the Department as well as other members of the BIDMC community. 4) Preparing the Department of Surgery Annual Research Report. 5) Organizing laboratory and shared equipment maintenance and telecommunications. 6) Supporting and mentoring junior faculty in the establishment of research laboratories. 7) In teracting with and providing information to Surgical Residents who plan to spend time in the research laboratory. 8) Obtaining visas for foreign scholars in Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center 1Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2007 Division of Surgical Research Research and in preparing applications for Harvard Medical School appointments for Research Fellows and Instructors in Surgery Research. 9) Making recommendations concerning research faculty appointments and reappointments in Surgery (working together with the Department of Surgery Appointment, Reappointment, and Promotion Committee). 10) Assisting the Chairman with the development of existing and new research areas within the Department of Surgery, including both short- and long-term strategic planni ng and recruitment. B. Research Faculty The number of individuals involved in research (basic and clinical research) in the Department of Surgery has varied between 122 and 148 over the last 6 years. Currently, research in the Department is conducted by 51 faculty, 44 postdoctoral research fellows, 9 surgical residents, 20 research associates and assistants, 2 visiting scientists, 1 nurse educator, 1 dietitian, 1 medical writer, and 17 undergraduate, graduate, and medical students. Numerous research coordinators, administrative assistants, and administrative coordinators provide important administrative support for research efforts in the Department. Many faculty members in the Department of Surgery have received and continue to receive both national and international prominence related to research. Several faculty members continued to serve or were appointed to NIH study sections or serve as ad hoc members of study sections, and a number of research faculty members serve on Editorial Boards or are Editors for National and International journals. In 2007, most of the Research Faculty in Surgery were invited speakers around the world. Faculty members were invited speakers in interesting locations that varied from Thailand (Blackburn) to Belgium (Hasselgren) to Australia (Kiessling and Koulmanda). Research Faculty in the Department of Surgery also participates in significant teaching endeavors. These include acting as mentors in the NIH in-service teacher program, MIT Bioengineering Undergraduate Research Program, Biomedical Science Careers Program, Project Success, Undregraduate Research Opportunities Program, and Research Scholars Institute Summer Program. The Vascular and Endovascular Surgery Division remains actively involved in the William J von Leibig research training program for both medical and postdoctoral students. Several of the Surgical Research Faculty teach at Harvard Medical School in the Body, Cell Biology, Pharmacology, and GI Pathophysiology courses and most of the surgeons in the Department participate in the surgical clerkships. C. Research Activities and Funding Research activities within the Department of Surgery at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center are strong and have shown a robust growth over the last 6 years (2002-2007). Research and development constitute one of the cornerstones and missions of the Department, in addition to patient care and teaching. The strength and growth of the various research programs within the Department of Surgery are illustrated by a 119% increase in external funding from 2002-2005, making the Department one of the top five surgery departments in the country wi th regards to NIH funding. Since 2005 funding has declined somewhat, reflecting budget restrains imposed on NIH during the past few years, but is still increased 55% over 2002 external funding levels . All Divisions within the Department presently conduct NIH-funded research. The number of R01 grants held by faculty in the Department has increased from 23 to 38 (a 65% increase) during the 6-year period 2002-2007 and in 2007, 22 faculty in Surgery held R01 grants . During the same period of time, the number of publications originating from the Department increased by nearly 67%. Both basic and clinical research programs are active in the Department. From a thematic standpoint, the following areas of research are represented: Cancer Biology, Inflammation, Development, Vascular Biology, Cardiothoracic research, Transplantation-Immunology, Obesity-Nutrition-Metabolism, Wound Healing, Epithelial Biology, Stem Cell Biology, and Clinical Outcomes. All research, both basic and clinical, in the Department of Surgery is supported by external fund ing and more than 2/3 of this funding has been in the form of NIH grants. Although the amount of external funding decreased during 2007, the level of funding is remarkable considering that a number of those faculty members who contribute substantial grant funds to the research effort are also clinically very active. The federal (almost exclusively 2 Beth Israel Deaconess Medical CenterDepartment of Surgery Annual Research Report 2007 Division of Surgical Research NIH), non-federal, and total external funding duri ng the 6-year period 2002-2007 are illustrated below in Table 1 and Figure 1. Table 1 .Total (Direct and Indirect) Awarded Funds from Fiscal Year (FY) 2002-2007 FY 0246810121416182022 $14,309,711$15,979,518$17,701,183$21,241,191 $9,714,966$15,066,355 2007 2005 2004 2003 2002 2006Figure 1 (left) Total (direct and indirect, federal and non-federal) awarded funds during the 6-year period 2002-2007. The current distribution of external funding between the different Divisions in the Department of Surgery is illustrated by the diagram in Figure 2. The Transplant Surgery and General Surgery Divisions have the largest external funds constituting approximately 30-40% each of the total departmental funding. It should be noted that the figures provided here for awarded funds in Table 1 and Figs 1 and 2 are greater than the corresponding figures provided in previous Annual Research Reports from the Department. The reason for this discrepancy is that the BIDMC Research Administration has not previously been able to provide figures for actual awarded funds and in previous years the awarded funds were calculated on the basis of expended dollars. This is the first year in which the BIDMC Research Administration has provided information about actual awarded funds and that is why the figures provided in this report are accurate. During the last 5 years we have actually underestimated grant awards in the Annual Research Reports.

Training Grants The Department presently holds two active NIH training grants, one in Cardiovascular Surgery (PI, Dr. Frank Sellke) and one in Vacsular Surgery (PI, Dr Frank LoGerfo). In addition, investigators in Surgery actively participate in a GI Surgery Training Grant. This is a joint training grant between the three HMS Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center 3Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2007 Division of Surgical Research teaching hospitals led by Dr. Soybel (PI) at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, Dr. Hodin (Co-IP) at the Massachusetts General Hospital and Dr. Hasselgren (Co-IP) at BIDMC. An additional NIH training grant for Surgery at the BIDMC, submitted by Transplantation (Dr. Hanto, PI), was awarded by the NIH and will begin in 2008. E. Surgical Residents and Research Over the last 6 years, approximately 10 residents per year elected to spend time in a basic or clinical research laboratory as part of their surgical training (Figure 3). Most of the residents performed research in a basic science laboratory doing bench research. Although not obligatory, the present policy is to have residents dedicate time to research between their second and third clinical years. This extends the surgical residency from 5 years to 7-8 years, but learning to do bench research an important and worthwhile experience, regardless of whether the resident plans a career in academic surgery or in private practice. The majority of residents perform research in laboratories within the Department of Surgery, but some residents have spent time in other Departments at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center or in laboratories off-site in Boston (for example MIT, Massachusetts General Hospital, and Children's Hospital) or other institutions, including places abroad. An important aspect of a Residents' research is obtaining funding. The process that has been adopted in the Department over the last 6 years is for the resident who plans to go into the laboratory to write and submit at least two credible grant/fellowship applications (typically applying at sources such as various National Surgical Societies, NIH, and the American College of Surgeons) - those applications are usually written together with and supported by the research mentor with whom the resident will work. If the applications are not funded, training grants in the Department or other funds within the individual laboratories can frequently provide support and it is only exceptionally that the resident has to rely on Departmental financial support for the time in the laboratory. To assist residents in obtaining funding, the Division of Surgical Research has made available a 70 page booklet entitled \"Funding Sources for Surgical Residents\" (right), which describes various funding sources, deadlines, financial support available, and application forms. This booklet is also available electronically at http://www.bidmc.harvard.edu/content/bidmc/Departments/Surgery /Funding.pdf?node_id=10717 and was updated in 2007.Number of Residents in a Research Elective 036912 (9)(11)(12) (8)(11) (9) 2002 2003 2004 2005 2007 2006Figure 3 (left) Number of surgical residents per year spending time (2- 3 years) in a research elective. In 2004, an Annual Residents' Research Competition was instituted. This competition is open for all residents who are or have recently been in a research laboratory or who are involved in a clinical research project. Fifteen abstracts were submitted this year and they were scored by a committee consisting of Faculty in the Department. Four finalists presented their papers at a Surgical Grand Rounds in June and the winner was selected among the 4 finalists. The presentations at Grand Rounds were evaluated based on both scientific content and delivery. 4 Beth Israel Deaconess Medical CenterDepartment of Surgery Annual Research Report 2007 Division of Surgical Research The 4 finalists in the 4th Annual Residents' Research Competition (2007) were: Patrick O\"Neal: \" The Expression of the Muscle Specific Ubiquitin Ligases Atrogin-1 and MuRF1 is Increased during Experimental Hyperthyroidism in Rats\" Mentor : Dr. Per-Olof Hasselgren, Division Surgery, BIDMC.

Research Seminars The Division of Surgical Research organizes monthly research seminars with presentations by investigators within the Department of Surgery, from other Departments at the BIDMC, and from other regional institutions. Half of the seminars in 2007 were technique-based presentations with general applicability to all research labs in Surgery. The \"Techniques\" seminars held during 2007 are summarized below in Table 2. In the fall of 2007 our \"Updates\" seminar series was re-instated, highlighting the research effort by faculty within the Department. These seminars focused on basic science within the major research emphasis areas of Cancer Biology, Inflammation, Vascular Biology, Cardiothoracic research, Transplantation-Immunology, Obesity-Nutrition-Metabolism, and Wound Healing. This informal seminar series also provides the opportunity for interaction among the research faculty and for increased collaboration between various research groups. A summary of \"Updates\" seminars in 2007 can be found in Table 2.

Annual Research Reports The Division of Surgical Research continues to highlight progress in research by producing an Annual Research Report. The report is made available to all faculty members of the Department, senior leadership of the Hospital including the Chairs of all departments. It is also sent to most Surgical Chairs at major Academic Centers in the country. In addition, the Annual Research Report is an important source of information for Resident Candidates and Postdoctoral Fellows when interviewing for a position in the Residency Program at the BIDMC or in one of the research laboratories. The Report for past years, 2001-2005, can be found within the Department of Surgery web site at http://bidmc.harvard.edu/display.asp?node_id=6558 . 6 Beth Israel Deaconess Medical CenterDepartment of Surgery Annual Research Report 2007 Division of Surgical Research H. Appointment, Reappointment, and Promotion Committee In the year 2003, a Departmental Appointment, Rea ppointment, and Promotion Committee was formed. The purpose of this committee is to review the credentials of faculty members who are being considered for reappointment or promotion at the Harvard Medical School. In addition, the credentials of new faculty being recruited are reviewed by the committee before the individual is being proposed for appointment at HMS. The Committee is chaired by Dr. Hasselgren and presently has 8 members consisting of faculty at the Professor or Associate Professor level. The committee meets at least twice per year. I. Research Facilities and Space The Department of Surgery occupies approximately 32,000 square feet of laboratory space including wet labs, special purpose rooms (cold rooms, tissue culture rooms, and shared equipment rooms), and office space. Although the greatest number of research faculty and staff in Surgery are located on the 8th floor of the Dana/Research West building on the East Campus, Surgery has research space in several different locations. These spaces include (in square feet) 10,150 at the HIM (Harvard Institute of Medicine) Building, 11,249 in Dana/Research West, 917 in Slosberg-Landy, 1,755 at 21-27 Burlington Avenue, and 4,818 at Research North. Clinical Research space includes 443 (in square feet) in Palmer and 1,982 in Feldberg. The overall dollar density for research space in the Department of Surgery is approximately $154/sq foot. With new recruitments that have already been completed (in the Divisions of Transplantation and Trauma/Critical Care), the dollar density is expected to increase substantially during the next fiscal year. J. Bibliography (January - December 2007) In addition to external funding, the number of publications is an important measure of the success of the research effort conducted in the Department. Over the last 6 years, the number of publications from the Department has increased significantly. In 2007, members of the Department of Surgery published 121 original articles, submitted an additional 90 articles that are in press, wrote 74 reviews and editorials, and published 14 books/textbooks. Overall, this outstanding produc tivity was significantly greater than in 2006 and represents a 53% increase in published original arti cles, a 61% increase in submitted or in press articles, a 32% increase in published review articles, and a 133% increase in the publication of books, including Mastery of Surgery 5 th edition, which was edited by Dr. Fischer with contributing chapters by many of the Surgery faculty.

McCully, PhD BASIC RESEARCH The primary focus of our laboratory is to elucidate the mechanisms and subcellular localization of biochemical and molecular events contributing to myocardial cell death. In particular, we are interested in the discriminant and/or coordinate contribution of necrosis and apoptosis to myocardial cell death. Study designs utilize models of stunning and ischemia/reperfusion injury in the isolated Langendorff perfused rabbit and the in situ blood perfused pig heart to determine the relative contribution of these pathways in the aged as compared to the mature cardiac surgical patient. The laboratory is also involved in the isolation and identification of genes associated with myocardial ischemia/reperfusion amelioration using differential display, selective subtraction hybridization and microarray technology. For this, we use rabbit and pig heart cDNA libraries constructed in our laboratory and non-redundant cDNA's isolated, sequenced and putatively identified by our laboratory for microarray analysis. Current research areas involve identification of mitochondrial changes in morphology, function, respiration, volume and DNA integrity in association with intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic and necrotic myocardial cell death following ischemia and reperfusion. In addition studies are underway to the identify mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium channel regulation of apoptosis and necrosis in the blood perfused pig heart model of acute myocardial infarction; and the role of STAT1/STAT2 signal transduction in myocardial preservation. These studies include comparison between mature and aged populations and differential gender response. L IST OF CURRENT EMPLOYEES Ioannis K.

McCully Mitochondrion Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2007 Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery 34 Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center DIVISIONAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN THE PASTYEAR Individual Accomplishments In the past year we have constructed rabbit heart cDNA libraries and have isolated and 5' sequenced 8647 rabbit heart cDNAs and have identified and stored 2592 non-redundant cDNAs with a mean insert size of 1.67 kb . These non-redundant cDNAs have been used to construct rabbit heart microarrays to allow for the parallel determination of multiple gene products and relative mRNA abundance levels and the identification of the co-regulated gene s and the functionally related gene groups associated with global ischemia and the enhanced cardioprotection afforded by cardioplegia in the mature and aged male and female heart. This work was performed as current human and mouse cDNA libraries did not allow for analysis with the rabbit heart owing to differences in 3' untranslated regions. W e h a v e a l s o d e v e l o p e d a n i s o l a t e d p e r f u s e d m o u s e h e a r t m o d e l f o r u s e w i t h w i l d t y p e a n d k n o c k - o u t mouse models. Current studies include electreo-mechanical changes and reduction and redistribution of gap junction and adherens proteins during ischemia/reperfusion injury and the effects of cardioplegia. Age and gender studies have been performed and will continue using mature and aged orchidectomized male rabbits and appropriate shams and ovariohysterectomized female rabbits with appropriate shams and hormone replacement therapy along with de novo RNA and protein synthesis inhibition. These studies are designed to utilize microarray technology identify specific up and down regulated RNA's and functionally related gene groups modulated by global ischemia and by cardioplegia with gender and with age. It is expected that these studies will allow for the development of gender and age specific cardioprotective protocols using specific hormonal (17/g451-estradiol, testosterone) or molecular biological techniques, which will allow for the short-term activ ation or suppression of RNA transcripts and provide for enhanced post-ischemic recovery following cardiac surgery. The ability to specifically modify the functional and biochemical response for the male and female mature and aged heart through the directed specific activation or suppression of RNA transcripts will ultimat ely enhance the ischemic tolerance and reduce morbidity and mortality in human cardiac surgery with specific benefit being expected in the aged female cardiac surgical patient.

Blackburn, MD, PhD Jin-Rong Zhou, PhD Center for the Study of Nutrition Medicine (CSNM) Nutrition Metabolism Laboratory (NML) BASIC RESEARCH Research in the NML aims to study the role of diet and nutrition in the prevention and treatment of breast, prostate, and bladder cancers, and obesity/metabolic syndrome, and to investigate the mechanisms of action of active dietary components. To identify active components of the diet, we have established a series of cell-based in vitro bioassays for identification of single dietary components and their synergistic combinations to target cancer cell proliferation, apoptosis and invasion/ metastasis, and on tumor angiogenesis. A series of clinically relevant animal mo dels for cancer were established in this laboratory to systematically evaluate the efficacy of candidate components and their synergistic combinations in prevention and treatment of cancer. Advanced techniques for cellular and molecular biology and epigenetics are also applied to elucidate the mechanisms of action of active candidates. By combining efficacy evaluation and mechanistic studies, it is expected to identify effective dietary and nutritional regimens for the prevention and treatment of cancer. The research findings can be directly translated to clinical practice and are designed to provide evidence that strongly establish and support dietary guidelines for prevention and tre atment of related diseases. C LINICAL RESEARCH The CSNM has over 30-years of extensive experience conducting longitudinal studies particularly in multicenter settings. We are particularly well equipped with the infrastructure to develop clinical investigation and outcomes assessment. CSNM provides sophisticated scientific nutrition interventions that are utilized to support research, training and patient care in many disease states. The CSNM mission is in line with the medical center's \"bench-to- bedside\" mission. One of our centers accomplishments this year to highlight is the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Betsy Lehman Center for Patient Safety and Medical Error Reduction Expert Panel on Weight Loss Surgery 2007 Update on Patient Safety Recommendations.

This report represents a six-month effort in 2007 and involved over 100 specialists from across the state and across the many disciplines involved in the field of weight loss surgery. Massachusetts, Department of Public Health Commissioner, John Auerbach said, \"Overwhelming new data highlighted in this report demonstrate reductions in known disease risk factors, improvements in health, and significant reductions in mortality after weight loss surgery,\" \"We expect this report to continue to set the standard for improving the safety of weight loss surgery in the Commonwealth and beyond.\" Nationwide, the number of weight loss operations climbed 800% between 1998 and 2004. Between 2005 and 2006, it grew another 11% , increasing from approximately 180,000 procedures to more than 200,000. Across all age groups, the fastest growth occurred among adults aged 55 to 64, with a 20-fold increase between 1998 and 2004. In Massachusetts, the number of weight loss operations climbed from 200 to 3036 procedures between 1998 and 2004. Between 2004 and 2006, it grew another 14% increasing from approximately 3036 procedures to 3447. Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2007 Division of General Surgery 52 Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center New data reflect a trend toward the use of procedures that not only restrict stomach size, as with laparoscopic banding, but also reroute part of the digestive tract, as is done with laparoscopic gastric bypass, the most commonly performed weight loss surgery in the U.S. In 1990, gastric bypass accounted for 55% of all weight loss operations; by 2000, that figure had climbed to 93%. In 2006, growing popularity of the laparoscopic banding procedure changed the ratio of gastric bypass (both open and laparoscopic) to laparoscopic banding to 70:30. As the number of weight loss surgeries increased, the national inpatient death rate fell 78.7%, from 0.89% in 1998 to 0.19% in 2004. Male inpatient deaths have historically been higher than those for women, yet the gap narrowed substantially during those years, decreasing by close to 50%. Length of hospital stay also fell by 38.5%, from nearly 5 days to 3.1 days. The oldest patients had the longest length of stay and the highest inpatient mortality rate. Over the past two years, the average inpatient mortality rate for weight loss surgery in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts has been 0.07%, significantly below the national inpatient death rate. Other new findings show that: - There are a growing number of surgical options available, including sleeve gastrectomy and biliopancreatic diversion. - Laparoscopy has displaced open surgery as the predominant approach; - Weight loss surgery accreditation/credentialing programs have been established within the past three years. - Weight loss surgery patients have a higher prevalence of mental health disorders, with preliminary evidence indicating substance abuse problems. - Approximately 4% of U.S. children suffer from extreme obesity. - Advances in anesthesiology allow for more precise dosing of muscle relaxants and novel applications of anesthetic agents. - There are new national credentialing standards in perioperative nursing. - New patient transport and lift technologies can reduce healthcare workplace injuries. - Optimal treatment requires greater collaboration between members of a multidisciplinary care team. - 99% of patients who are eligible for weight loss surgery do not receive it. - The need to accommodate growing numbers of severely obese patients will require wide-ranging changes in new and existing healthcare facilities. - The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and other payers now only reimburse procedures performed at accredited weight loss surgery centers. The Expert Panel included a consumer representative and leading authorities in the fields of obesity treatment, patient safety, nutrition, medical practice, managed care, pediatrics, nursing, and ethics. I had the honor of being the chair of this distinguished panel and Matthew Hutter, M.D., from Massachusetts General Hospital served as the Panel's Vice Chair. The panel used a state-of-the-art model of evidence-based medicine to develop its findings. The recommendations are based on a comprehensive review of the best and most current literature on weight loss surgery and they are grounded in established methodology and vetted by nationally-recognized experts. The complete report will be published in Obesity in 2008 but can be found at the link, www.Mass.gov/dph/betsylehman . Expert panel on Weight Loss Surgery. Dr. Blackburn (red circle) was the Chair of this panel. Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2007 Division of General Surgery Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center 53 B) Women's Intervention Nutrition Study (WINS) The stu dy is cur r ent ly c los ed a nd data i s be ing analy zed. I am p l e ase to an nou nce tha t we a r e now awaiting publication of a protocol-mandated survival analysis update entitled \"Survival Analyses from the Women's Intervention Nutrition Study (WINS) Evaluating Dietary Fat Reduction and Breast Cancer Outcome\" (see abstract below). Results indicate a die tary intervention targeting fat intake reduction did not significantly increase overall survival of women with resected breast cancer receiving conventional cancer management. Exploratory analyses suggest dietary intervention influence on survival may be greater in hormone receptor negative subgroups and during the period of active dietary intervention. ABSTRACT Survival Analyses From the Women's Intervention Nutrition Study (WINS) Evaluating Dietary Fat Reduction and Breast Cancer Outcome Chlebowski RT, Blackburn GL , Elashoff Giuliano Hudis C, Butler J, Shapiro Torrance, CA; Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital, Boston, MA; University of California, Los Angeles, CA; Cancer Prevention Institute, New York, NY; University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ; St Johns Hospital and Health Center, Santa Monica, CA; Cedars Sinai Hospital, Beverly Hills, CA; Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY; University of California at Irvine, City of Orange, CA; Park Nicollet Institute, Minneapolis, MN Background : We previously reported five year results with follow up through October, 2003 of a phase III randomized trial where a dietary fat reduction intervention targeting fat intake reduction, associated with significant weight loss, improved relapse-free survival compared to control in women with resected, early stage breast cancer receiving conventional can cer management (RR 0.79, P=0.034) (JNCI 2006;98:1767- 76). After initiating the dietary intervention with 16 visits over 8 weeks, ongoing adherence was addressed by q 3 month nutritionist contacts. Active dietary intervention and contacts with nutritionists ended in May, 2004. We now report a protocol-mandated survival analysis update. Methods : Updated survival information was obtained through October, 2007 largely through national death registries and randomization group survival differences were examined using Cox proportional hazards models in intent ion-to-treat analyses. Exploratory analyses examined survival by hormone receptor subgroups and active dietary intervention status. Results: Although fewer deaths were seen in the intervention group (9.1% vs. 11.1% cumulative mortality, RR 0.83) the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.146). In the 362 women with ER- and PR- disease, a significant overall survival difference was seen for intervention group participants (7.5% vs. 18.1%, cumulative mortality, RR 0.41, P=0.003). The influence of ongoing active dietary intervention was examined by analyses censored six months after contact with nutritionists ended (for survival before and after 12/31/04). Conclusions: A dietary intervention targeting fat intake reduction did not significantly increase overall survival of women with resected breast cancer receiving conventional cancer management. Exploratory analyses suggest dietary intervention influence on survival may be greater in hormone receptor negative subgroups and during the period of active dietary intervention. C) Look AHEAD (Action For Health in Diabetes) Look AHEAD (Action For Health in Diabetes) is a multicenter randomized clinical trial to examine the effects of a lifestyle intervention designed to achieve and maintain weight loss over the long term through decreased caloric intake and exercise. Look AHEAD is focusing on the disease most affected by overweight and obesity, type 2 diabetes, and on the outcome that causes the greatest morbidity and mortality, cardiovascular disease. Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2007 Division of General Surgery 54 Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center The Look AHEAD trial has completed enrollment of 5,145 obes e patients with type 2 diabetes. At study entry, participants were randomly assigned to one of two interventions, the Lifestyle Intervention or Diabetes Support and Education. They will be followed for a total period of up to 11.5 years. The primary aim of Look AHEAD is to study the effects of the two interventions on major cardiovascular events: heart attack, stroke an d cardiovascular-related death. Look AHEAD also will investigate the impact of the interventions on other cardiovascular disease-related outcomes, cardiovascular risk factors, and all-cause mortality. Additional outcomes include: diabetes control and complications, fitness, general health, health-related quality of life and psychological outcomes. The cost and cost effectiveness of the Lifestyle Intervention relative to Diabetes Support and Education will be assessed. DSE-Control Group - 2 social retention events-\"Duck BoatTour\" and Holiday Party at Longwood Grille. - Classes were organized throughout the year for nutrition, exercise and support. Transition into Phase III is complete for 3 groups. This includes a two hour class that covers nutrition and fitness. - Seasonal Newsletter Lifestyle Intervention Group - Retention Events-Duck Boat Tours, Holiday Party at Longwood Grille. - Weight loss campaigns/refreshers-Strong Roots Campaign. Results were less effective than in the past, attendance were both positive. In speaking with other site s around the country, it was a general consensus that this campaign was not as effective at producing overall weight loss than other campaigns.- Holiday Weight loss challenge-Continued in 2007. Not a national campaign, only done at Joslin. Participants signed contract during holiday season to either main tain or lose weight during a matter of 8 weeks. Incentive provided if successful as all participants lost weight. E) Effects of Soy Isoflavones on Menopausal Hot Flashes In collaboration with OB/GYN, we completed our study on alternatives to hormone replacement therapy in post-menopausal women. We investigated the effect of the novel daidzein-rich isoflavone-aglycone extract from soy germ fermentation on the severity and frequency of hot flashes in postmenopausal women. The study design was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of menopausal women, aged 38 to 60 years who experienced 4-14 hot flashes/day. After a one-week run-in period, a total of 190 menopausal women were randomized to receive placebo, 40 or 60 mg/day of DRI for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the mean changes from baseline to week 12 in frequency of hot flashes recorded in the participant dairy. The secondary outcomes included changes in quality of life and hormonal profiles. 147 subjects (77%) completed the study. DRI 40 mg and 60 mg equally improved hot flashes frequency and severity. Hot flash frequency reduced by 43% in 40 mg DRI group and 41% in 60 mg DRI group at 8 weeks when compared to 32% in the placebo group ) (p = ns vs placebo). The corresponding numbers for 12 weeks were 52%, 51% and 39% respectively (p = 0.07 and 0.09 vs placebo). When comparing the 2 treatment groups with placebo, there were significant reductions in mean daily hot flash frequency. Supplement reduced hot flashes frequency by 43% at 8 weeks (p =0.08) and 52% at 12 weeks ( p = 0.048), but did not cause any significant changes in endogenous sex hormones or thyroid hormones. The study suggests that daidzein-rich isoflavone aglycone supplement may be an effective and acceptable alternative to hormonal treatment for menopausal hot flashes. E) Calcium Supplementation for Healthy Weight (CaSHew) The CSNM has been given the opportunity to collaborate with one of our Boston Obesity Nutrition Research groups at the Massachusetts General Hospital to investigate Calcium Supplementation for Healthy Weight (CaSHew). The hypothesis is adding calcium and vitamin D supplementation, via Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2007 Division of General Surgery Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center 55 orange juice, to caloric restriction enhances weight loss and decreases visceral fat in adults with BMI i n t h e r a n g e o f 2 5 t o 3 5 k g / m2. The primary objective of this proposal is to evaluate the effect of calcium and vitamin D supplementation (in form of calcium and vitamin D fortified orange juice beverage) in combination with caloric deficit diet on weight loss in overweight and obese adults. Visceral fat loss will be examined as a secondary outcome. Enrollment is completed, with second arm of the study CaSHew lite patients completing study in April 2007. 83 patients were randomized to the CaSHew lite study and there were no adverse effects, study results are being analyzed and written up for publication. Jin-Rong Zhou, PhD In the past year, we continued to in vestigate the effects of dietary/nutritional components and ingredients from natural resources, alone and in their combinations on the prevention an d treatment of cancer. The purpose is to identify potential synergistic combin ations of active components to target on different important cellular pathways as effective candidates of preventive regimens. We investigated the activities of a panel of dietary components in inhibiting the growth of pancreatic cancer cells and the growth of endothelial cells as the primary screening steps to iden tify potential anti-growth and anti-angiogenesis candidates. We identified a few synergistic combination regimens of dietary active components that significantly inhibited the growth of pancreatic cancer cells and angiogenesis in vitro. These candidate combination regimens will be verified for their activities in the clinically relevant orthotopic animal models. We also initiated research on identifying more potent active components in Chinese herbs and botanicals for the prevention and treatment of differe nt types of cancer and to elucidate the mechanisms of action of active components. We have iden tified certain active anti-prostate cancer components with less cytotoxicity to normal cells from Baihuashishicao and Danshen, and have been funded to continue the proposed research. The results derived from these proposals will be directly translated into clinical investigation for the prevention and treatment of related cancers. In addition, we have started to elucidate how epigenetic modification may play in understanding the mechanisms by which nutritional/natural active components and their combinations may prevent the development and progression of cancer. We focus primarily on the effects of treatments on DNA methylation. Our studies demonstrate that the combination of soy and tea active components indeed synergistically modulate the expression of certain genes via modification of methylation status of their DNA promoters. This mechanistic approach provides a novel strategy to understand how nutritional/natural active components exert their cancer preventive activities.

Callery, MD, FACS Charles M. Vollmer, Jr., MD, FACS Tara S. Kent, MD CLINICAL RESEARCH Our work focuses on outcomes research in high-acuity pancreaticobiliary Surgery. Fueled by a robust clinical practice which focuses on treatment of pancreatic malignancies, cystic lesions, and pancreatitis in a multidisciplinary setting, we perform over 100 resection cases and another 75 major pancreaticobiliary operations per annum. A prospective database has been developed and maintained from this practice, and provides the substrate for our investigations. Areas of emphasis have been the development and critical analysis of clinical pathways and other systems initiatives for optimal patient care. Separate investig ations are centered on technical and perioperative management aspects of surgical care. Also explored has been the impact of surgical complications associated with these operations. We are now also embarking on Quality of Life analyses for these disease processes.

These analyses have demonstrated outcomes within the framework of the recently developed ISGPF clinical grading scale for this postoperative complication. Predictive factors for the development of fistulae have been delineated. We have further identified tha t the use of Octreotide is most beneficial and cost- effective when selectively applied to high-risk glands. A new clinical entity of the \"latent\" fistula has been identified. Another concentration has been showi ng the utility of the POSSUM surgical audit system in predicting morbidity and mortality following pancreatec tomy. This work has been extended to illustrate the practical application of POSSUM in defining the interplay of baseline physiology and surgical performance. In addition, through collaboration with our radiology and oncology consultants, we have helped to define the place of state-of-the-art technologies in treatment of these diseases - most notably Cyberknife Radiotherapy and Multi Channel Detector CT Angiography scans for pancreatic cancer.

Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2007 Division of General Surgery Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center 71 Sandra M. Gaston, PhD BASIC RESEARCH My research laboratory is focused on characterizing the individual biological differences that can influence the clinical behavior of human cancers, with a major emphasis on prostate cancer. We are fortunate to have access to well-documented human clinical samples, and we have developed a number of innovative technologies that allow us to perform detailed molecular genetic analyses of these specimens without compromising patient care. These include a set of tissue print and print-phoresis technologies designed to generate spatial- molecular maps of tumor markers in needle biopsies and surgical specimens while preserving the tissue itself for diagnostic histopathology (Gaston et al. Nature Medicine 11: 95-101, 2005). Currently, with support from three different grants from the National Cancer Institute, we are utilizing our tissue print technologies to investigate the molecular genetic events that shape the behavior of prostate cancers in human patients. By using our gene expression maps as overlays to annotate the histological features of clinical specimens, we have be en able to use tumors and tissues from radical prostatectomies to identify a set of molecular marker profiles that differentiate locally invasive prostate cancer from indolent tumors. We are also using tissue print gene expression maps to profile the molecular genetic events that correspond to specific prostate cancer phenotypes that can by imaged in human patients using advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) techniques. In addition, we are applying our tissue print techniques to the analysis of prostate needle biopsies; these are key diagnostic specimens that must be submitted in their entirety for surgical pathology and are thus not usually available for molecular marker studies. These efforts have produced several sets of new biomarkers that may ultimately be useful in the management of patients with prostate cancer (see section V, part 1-4). The hormonal microenvironment is an important variable in the biological behavior of many types of cancer, including prostate cancer, and my laboratory has developed a set of micro-bioassays that allow us to evaluate bioavailable androgens and estrogens in complex biological fluids. In a mouse model of prostate cancer, we showed that our bioassays could detect changes in bioavailable serum androgen that occur in response to soy based dietary supplements that inhibit tumor growth, and that these are distinct from immunoassay measurements of total and free serum testosterone (Zhou et al. Prostate 53:143-153, 2002). Recently, using this same mouse model of prostate cancer, we found that soy based dietary supplements that inhibit tumor growth also produce significant changes in tumor choline metabolism. With support from the DOD Prostate Cancer Research Program, are following up on this discovery, with the goal of developing a pre-clinical model to evaluate MR spectroscopy as an in vivo non-invasive technique for monitoring tumor response to soy-based dietary interventions in prostate cancer patients. We anticipate that that this project may have translational applications in the design of pharmacological and dietary interventions for prostate cancer patients who want to incorporate complementary therapies into their cancer care program. During my first four years at BIDMC, in addition to my research laboratory, I was director of the BIDMC Andrology Laboratory. Although the clinical aspect of this laboratory is outsourced, the research component remains active under my direction. Our current Andrology research efforts focus on individual differences in the susceptibility to mitochondrial toxins, as measured by the effects of these toxins on sperm mitochondrial respiration and motility. Using this approach, we have identified a set of polymorphisms in the mitochondrial ATP synthetase that may be particularly important in determining both therapeutic and toxic responses to specific inhibitors of cell respiration (see section V, part 5).

Gaston DIVISIONAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN THE PASTYEAR Research Accomplishments With NIH and intramural research support, my laboratory has continued to advance the development of a set of novel tissue printing technologies that support the molecular analysis of human tissue specimens. Our tissue print techniques allow us to transfer a mi croscopic layer of cells and extracellular matrix from the surface of a fresh tissue specimen onto nitrocell ulose membranes, creating a \"molecular xerox\" which preserves the specimen for histopathology. We have combined tissue print techniques with specific protein and RNA/DNA detection methods to generate two-dimensional maps of molecular markers in radical prostatectomy specimens, and these maps have allowed us to identify clusters of molecular markers that co-localize with sites of microscopic invasion of cancer into the prostate capsule. Because our tissue print techniques do not damage tissue specimens, we have been able to utilize this approach to obtain molecular marker profiles from human prostate ne edle biopsies. Prostate needle biopsies are key diagnostic specimens that must be su bmitted in their entirety for surgical pathology and are thus not usually available for molecular marker analysis. Using biopsy cores obtained from radical prostatectomy specimens as model specimens, we have demonstrated that we can generate both mRNA and protein marker profiles from biopsy tissue prints while preserving the cores for standard H&E and immunohistochemical studies. We have systematically improved the efficiency of our print RNA and DNA extraction and have achieved high quality gene expression profiles on Affymetrix microarrays using RNA obtained from prints from single biopsy cores. These important technical milestones allowed us to move forward with a pilot translational research protocol in which we are using tissue print analysis to perform molecular profiling studies on diagnostic prostate needle biopsies. This biopsy protocol allows us to capture molecular markers in prostate tissues from a much broader range of patients than can be represented in conventional tissue banks that rely upon radical prostatectomy specimens. Our biopsy print RNAs represent an important new resource for biomarker development efforts currently underway in our laboratory and in the larger prostate cancer research community. The significance of this unique resource for prostate biomarker analysis was recognized by the NCI Early Detection Research Network with two research grants entitled \"Multi-Analyte Assessment of PrCa Chr21 Rearrangements in Diagnostic Biopsies\" as for Specific Subtypes of TMPRSS3-ERG Positive Prostate Cancer.\" With support from General Electric Industry Sponsored Research funds, an NIH Grant and the Ellison Foundation, we have used tissue prints to produce \"molecular whole mounts\" of radical prostatectomy specimens that can be mapped point-to-point with structures visualized in vivo by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectra (MRS). We have collaborated with Dr. Robert Lenkinski and other investigators in the BIDMC MRI/MRS program to profile the patterns of mRNA expression that underlie the MRI/MRS choline peak that is frequently observed in prostate cancer. The genes that regulate choline metabolism include several that have been identified as \"druggable\" targets for new anti- cancer compounds. Recently, we identified an animal model of prostate cancer that appears to recapitulate some of the tumor-associated changes in choline metabolism that are observed in human patients, and we have received a DOD prostate can cer research grant and an NIH grant to support the development of this animal model for the pre-clinical study of the molecular mechanisms that produce MRI/MRS visible changes in tumor choline metabolism. We have used our tissue print \"molecular whole mounts\" of radical prostatectomy specimens to generate gene expression maps of the angiogenic processes in human prostate cancer that result in MRI visible tumor-associated changes in tissue perfusion, as visualized in vivo by dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). Currently, we are using both Affymetrix microarray and rt-PCR data to compile gene expression \"signatures\" of DCE-MRI positive prostate cancers. These studies are an important component of a larger effort to interpret prostate DCR-MRI images in terms of the biological and clinical sub-types of human prostate cancer. Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2007 Division of General Surgery 74 Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Mitochondrial toxicity can present a significant limit ation to the clinical application of new therapeutic agents, and current pre-clinical models are inadequate to efficiently screen for this adverse activity. Because the motility of mammalian spermatozoa is exquisitely sensitive to the status of the mitochondria in the sperm midpiece, we have developed a novel in vitro bioassay that utilizes motile spermatozoa to detect individual differences in susceptibility to drugs and toxins that inhibit mitochondrial respiration. Utilizing both clinical samples and samples from an animal model (domestic boars), we have identified individuals whose pattern of sensitivity or resistance to specific classes of mitochondrial toxins could have important clinical consequences. Currently, we are characterizing genetic polymorphisms that we have found to be associated with increased sensitivity to the drug oligomycin. We anticipate that this study will provide proof-of-principle for a new pharmacogenomic screening strategy that can be used to identify the human chromosomal and/or mitochondrial alleles that give rise to individual differences in sensitivity/resistance to specific inhibitors of mitochondrial respiration.

Hagen, PhD BASIC RESEARCH Our current NIH sponsored research projects are concerned with the regulation of gastric barrier function during health and disease, and our focus includes mechanisms that regulate tigh t junction organization and permeability in the stomach, gastric mucosal restitution after injury, and cell death and survival of gastric epithelial cells. Although we are particularly interested in the regulation of barrier function during Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection and how defects in the gastric mucosal barrier result in mucosal damage and gastric atrophy during infection, such studies are also pertinent to understanding gastric ulceration and stress-induced mucosal damage under surgical conditions and other critical illnesses including trauma and sepsis, where inflammation and hypoxia impact mucosal permeability, restitution, and epithelial cell death. Inflammation-induced Defects in Tight Junction Permeability Although the structure of tight junctions is well defined (inset), whether this generic organization is the same and how it relates to barrier properties of the gastric mucosa is unknown. In recent studies, it was shown that when occludin, one of two proteins that seal the paracellular space (inset), is knocked-out, mucosal damage occurs in the stomach and the stomach histology is identical to that seen during infection with HP. Lack of occludin affected only 2 tissues, the stomach and testis, suggesting that o c c l u d i n r e g u l a t e s , i n a u n i q u e w a y , t h e m a i n t e n a n c e a n d / o r development of tight junctions in these tissues. Because little is known about how occludin regulates development and/ or maintenance of tight junctions at the surface of the gastric mucosa or in gastric glands, new culture models were recently developed by us to study the cell and molecular regulation of occludin in gastric surface and chief cells. How inflammation alters occludin, ZO-1, claudin, and e-cadherin localization and function, and mucosal permeability in the stomach are studies currently underway in the laboratory. We are also interested in the role of myosin light chain kinase, an enzyme that facilitates myosin contraction at the tight junction, in regulating permeability during inflammation and in facilitating the cell death of surface and chief cells. Mechanisms that Regulate Gastric Mucosal Restitution after Injury My laboratory is probably most well-known for studies concerning mechanisms that regulate restitution, which is rapid epithelial repair after injury, in the stomach. Our current focus concerns mechanisms by which intracellular pH is regulated and how this regulation affects restitution and subsequent repair of barrier function after injury. We recently proposed a novel idea that H+/lactate export, via the monocarboxylate transporter-1 (MCT-1), may be essential for pH regulation during restitution by exporting lactate that is generated by glycolysis, a process we recently showed to be the main energy source for restitution. Current studies to understanding the role of MCT-1 in restitution are underway. Heat Shock Proteins and Mucosal Protection A new area of investigation in the laboratory is concerned with understanding pathways that regulate protection of epithelial cells against HP toxins and factors. These new studies were initiated because apoptosis of gastric epithelial cells is accelerated during HP infection and the death of gastric chief and parietal cells results in atrophic gastritis, which is the major initiating factor in the progression to gastric cancer. We recently showed that L-glutamine (Gln) protects against the death of surface cells in the presence of HP-associated ammonia (Nakamura E, AJP 2004) and, in the past year, extended these From Mitic, et al, Am J Physiol 279: G250, 2002 Susan Hagen Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2007 Division of General Surgery 80 Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center studies to a model of HP pathogenesis in mice, using die ts containing Gln. We have shown Gln-induced transcriptional regulation of heat shock proteins 70 and 25, and arginase protect against cell death and are working to elucidate how these proteins confer protection to gastric cells. These studies are done in collaboration with Dr. James G. Fox at MIT.

First, Regina Ragasa, a research assistant who spent 2 years in the lab prior to attending medical school, finished work concerning how isothiocyanate ( ITC, below), the reactive group on stilbenes like DIDS and SITS, affects restitution and wound repair after injury. Regina found that isothiocyanates bind to the H+/lactate co- transporter, MCT-1, in addition to the Na+/HCO3- co-transporter and proposed that restitution is impaired because intracellular pH is affected adversely by blocking this transporter. The paper was submitted and will be the first to suggest MCT-1 plays a role in cell migration. Two abstracts from this work were accepted for presentation at DDW in May and her paper was published in the Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics in October (see the Bibliography, below). Dr. Zhang finished a paper that was started by Dr. Tashima concerning the procedure for preparing isolated cultures of gastric chief cells that grow into a confluent monolayer within 3 days. Dr. Zhang extended this work to also show that chief cells divide in culture and de-differentiate into cells that contain trefoil factor (TFF2), a marker only found in spasmolytic polypeptide-containing metaplastic (SPEM) cells during HP infection. These results are important to lend insight as to how chief cells may become metaplastic during inflammatory disorders of the stomach. Dr. Zhang's work on TFF2 was also accepted for presentation at DDW in May of 2007. Work with Dr. James Fox concerning the expression of cell death and survival proteins and pathways in gastric cells was also finished and submitted for publication and an abstract on our collaborative work concerning glutamine protection during HP infection, in vivo , in mice was also accepted for presentation at DDW in May. We finished the paper on the later work, which is now under consideration in the Journal of Nutrition. Administrative Accomplishments I continued to work as Associate Director for Research in the Department of Surgery. Accomplishments this year were successful completion of, in collaboration with Dr. Per-Olof Hasselgren and with help from Kim Emswiler, the \"Annual Research Report\". We were also able to fill the vacant Administrative Coordinator position in the Office for Surgical Research (June of 2007) with a very capable person, Sabrina Pinder (photo at right), who was previously a Policy Department Supervisor at First American Title Insurance Company in Boston. With Sabrina's help, we published the \"Funding Sources for Surgical Residents', maintained the space database for Surgery, organized seminars, and maintained HMS appointments and visas.

Andrea Calhoun sitting at the JEOL 1200EX electron microscope Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2007 Division of General Surgery Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center 85 Per-Olof Hasselgren, MD, PhD The research in our group is focused on mechanisms regulating the catabolic response to sepsis and injury in skeletal muscle. Sepsis and injury (and a number of other conditions as well, including cancer, AIDS, uremia, and starvation) are associated with muscle wasting ( Fig 1 ), mainly reflecting ubiquitin- proteasome-dependent degradation of the myofibrillar proteins actin and myosin. This response in skeletal muscle has severe clinical consequences, including muscle weakness and fatigue, delayed ambulation with risk of thromboembolic and pulmonary complications and prolonged stay in the intensive care unit. Our research supports a model in which myofilaments are released from the sarcomere through a calcium/calpain-dependent mechanism followed by ubiquitination and degradation of actin and myosin by the 26S proteasome. The gene expression of calpains and several components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, in particular the ubiquitin ligases atrogin-1 and MuRF1, is upregulated in atrophying muscle, supporting the concept that increased gene transcription is an integral part of muscle wasting mechanisms. Currently, the transcriptional regulation of genes in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is examined. In particular, the roles of the transcription factors C/EBP /g69 and /g71 and NF-kB as well co-factors p300 and PGC-1 /g68 and /g69 in the regulation of atrogin-1 and MuRF1 expression are examined. In addition, the role of calcium in sepsis-induced and glucocorticoid-regulated muscle proteolysis is examined, in particular with regards to changes in store-operated calcium entry and regulation of calcium-calmodulin protein kinase II and PI3K/Akt/GSK3 /g69 signaling. In recent studies we have found evidence that p300- regulated acetylation of certain transcription factors and probably other nuclear proteins as well regulates protein breakdown in catabolic muscle. Our current understanding of some of the molecular mechanisms involved in muscle wasting, in particular the role of transcription factors and nuclear co-factors, is summarized in Fig 2 . The long-term goal of our studies is to define molecular mechanisms responsible for sepsis-induced muscle proteolysis and to define molecule(s) that can be targeted to prevent or treat muscle wasting in sepsis and other catabolic conditions. Transcription factors involved in muscle wasting are regulated by multiple posttranslational modifications. For example, the transcription factor C/EBP /g69 can be activated by acetylation and phosphorylation ( Fig 3 ). Indeed, recent experiments in our laboratory have provided evidence that C/EBP /g69 is acetylated at multiple sites in dexame thasone-treated myotubes and in the same experimental model, silencing of the histone acetyl transferase p300 blocks dexamethasone-induced protein degradation in cultured myotubes ( Fig 3 a and b ). Thus, the regulation of protein degradation in atrophying muscle is complex and factors influencing protein degradation in catabolic muscle are regulated at multiple levels.

( b) Transfection of cultured L6 muscle cells with a p300 plasmid mutated in its HAT activity domain prevents dexamethasone-induced protein degradation, supporting a role of p300-mediated acetylation in the catabolic response in skeletal muscle.

In that effort, I believe we have become one of the premier groups in the country studying neutrophil biology. Our work has mainly been devoted to studies of the regulation of calcium entry as a cellular activation signal. Current though, our work has shifted focus slightly, and we are looking less specifically at G-protein coupled receptor-linked calcium signaling and more at the composition of lipid rafts and the role of raft composition in cell signaling both in inflammation and in general. All of our basic science interests are translational so our studies are firmly rooted in clinical care. Thus is our practice to study basic molecular events concurrently in cell systems, animal systems and human disease states where ever possible. Basic science interests include: 1. Neutrophil signaling in critical illness. 2. Clinical inflammation biology in the ICU. 3. Chemokine biology in trauma and sepsis. 4. The biology of the peritoneum in shock and sepsis. 5. Development of treatments for critical illness based on the control of immune cell calcium entry. 6. The composition of lipid rafts and the role of raft composition in raft function. Of special note is that we are always looking for new collaborators with whom we can study new disease models and clinical processes, and who can provide us with clinical, animal or cellular specimens where we can extend our observations as to signaling mechanisms. Clinical research interests include: 1. Shock and resuscitation. 2. Wound biology. 3. Chest trauma. 4. Transfusion biology and surgical hemostasis. 5. Surgical infections.

Education research is focused on establishing a technical skills laboratory validating new teaching tools and instituting curriculums for Harvard medical students and BIDMC residents. Research assesses team simulation of the novice, expert, and seasoned surgeon in the unique mock laparoscopy endosuite. BIDMC was the first Level I Comprehensive Education In stitute accredited by the American College of Surgeons in New England. In 2007, SASC crafted the ACS-APDS national Surgery Residency curriculum for basic and advanced laparoscopic skills. We also formally partnered with the Dubai Health Authority to initiate a Simulation Center in the UAE for regional training of physicians and surgeons in the Middle East region. In collaboration with Dr. Chuttani of GI Endoscopy (Department of Medicine at BIDMC) we have developed new approaches to less invasive operations for reflux and weight loss surgery with NOTES at the Center for Minimally Invasive Surgery animal lab at HMS. Endoscopic banding techniques may achieve comparable outcomes with faster recuperation. Collaborative efforts have also worked toward developing better simulators. With S. De, PhD at RPI we have been funded by an NIH R01 grant to create a virtual reality laparoscopic simulator for teaching the technique of the laparoscopic adjustable gastric band using virtual reality and haptic feedback (see figure below). The newly developed Point-Associated Finite Field (PAFF) approach provides users a smooth visual display and realistic touch response. PAFF provides surgeons a more realistic experience of cutting, bleeding, smoke, and tissue pressure response. Virtual laparoscopic instruments are controlled by the surgeon. Also, with Caroline Cao, PhD at Tufts University and Steven Schwaitzberg, MD at Cambridge Hospital we are assessing cognitive loading and value of haptics in task acquisition. PAFF Virtual Simulator Jones Lap-B and Simulator Dan JonesDepartment of Surgery Annual Research Report 2007 Division of General Surgery 94 Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center With industry we are creating simulators for laparoscopic surgery and NOTES. Simulators allow the surgeon to practice the procedures safely (see figure above, right). Through the Program for Obesity and Weight Loss Surgery we have strived to increase our knowledge of obesity and establish best practice guidelines for bariatric surgery. With Drs. Steven Loring and Stephanie Jones (Department of Anesthesia at BIDMC), we are investigating the use of esophageal pressure measurements as a surrogate of pleural pressure to characterize the effects of obesity on respiratory function. With the MGH Weight Loss Program, BIDMC developed a rodent model to study the laparoscopic adjustable band compared to the gastric bypass, and with Dr. Ronit Grinbaum subsequently established an animal model for the gastric sleeve procedure. Studies evaluate central gut neuroendocrine changes after surgery, specifically ghrelin, POMC pathway, and PYY 3-3. Under leadership of Dr. George Blackburn, MD, we have served on the Expert Panel on Weight Loss Surgery for the Betsy Lehman Center in 2007. At BIDMC, Bariatric Surgery efforts have studied the impact of hospital clinical care pathways for laparoscopic adjustable band and gastric bypass procedures ( www.bidmc.harvard.ede/wls ). With Dr. Christine Wee will are studying the patient's assessment of risk and benefit of weight loss surgery.

An on-line bariatric surgery educational web site was implemented with CRICO-RMF to train surgeons, anesthesiologist and nurses. We successfully proposed a premium incentive disc ount for Harvard surgeons with FLS certificate. This resulted in the Controlled Risk Insurance Company (CRICO) of Harvard's Risk Management Foundation (RMF) endorsing the Fundamentals of Laparoscopi c Surgery (FLS) Patient Safety Incentive Program for general surgery attending physicians who perform laparoscopic surgery. The Society of American Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) developed the FLS program which is a comprehensive, CD-Rom based education module that includes a hands-on skills training component and assessment tool. FLS sets a bar guaranteeing a level of competence in technical and cognitive skills related to laparoscopic surgery. SASC at BIDMC serves as a training and the testing site. MIS Fellows Research : Drs Kinga Powers and Scott Rehrig performed team simulations in the first mock operating endosuite.

Junger, PhD, DI BASIC RESEARCH Our research focuses on the cellular immune response in trauma and critical care patients. In healthy subjects, a de licate balance between inflammatory and anti-inflammatory signals allows the cellular immune system to recognize and destroy invading microorganisms while sparing host tissues. In trauma and critical care patients, this balance is lost: On one hand, overzealous and excessively activated phagocytes damage host tissues, causing organ damage and complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure syndrome (MOFS). On the other hand, subsequent compensatory down-regulation of cellular immune responses results in immune suppression and a weakening of the patient's ability to fend off microbial invaders. As a consequence, many patients develop severe infections and sepsis. Both phenomena lead to post-traumatic complications that account for large proportion of deaths among those patients who die in the intensive care setting. We study the molecular and cellular mechanisms associated with these complications using a wide range of techniques that include molecular techniques, cell biology, animal models, and clinical trials. Using these methods and the close interdisciplinary cooperation between physician scientists and basic researchers, we work on the design of novel therapeutic approaches to prevent immune-related complications in trauma and critical care patients. We have discovered that extracellular osmolarity can modulate the functions of neutrophils and T lymphocytes. We found that the infusion of hypertonic resuscitation fluids in traumatized animals can modulate the inflammatory response by preventing excessive activation of neutrophils and reducing the risk of sepsis. These findings have encouraged much interest among researchers and trauma care providers in the US and abroad. Many groups were able to confirm our findings. As a consequence, hypertonic resuscitation fluids are increasingly used for the treatment of military and civilian trauma patients. In the past several years, we have investigated the cellular mechanisms by which hypertonic fluids regulate leukocyte functions. We could show that neutrophils and T lymphocytes respond to hypertonicity by releasing cellular ATP, which is converted to adenosine. We found that ATP and adenosine modulate the functions of neutrophil and T lymphocytes through autocrine feedback mechanisms that involve a large family of purinergic receptors that are expressed on the cell surface of neutrophils and T lymphocytes. In neutrophils, two types of adenosine receptors (A3 and A2a) with opposing effects on cell activation define the cellular response to hypertonic stimulation. In T lymphocytes, P2X type ATP receptors are involved in the up-regulation of T lymphocyte function by hypertonic fluids. Utilizing our knowledge of how hypertonicity affects immune cell function, we are designing novel hypertonic resuscitation fluids with improved anti-inflammatory properties. Recently we found that cellular ATP released from migrating neutrophils is also responsible for controlling chemotaxis. ATP and adenosine that is generated by the hydrolysis of released ATP activate P2Y2 and A3 adenosine receptors. Both receptors serve essential roles by facilitating gradient sensing and /g561/g561 Wolfgang Junger /g561 Cellular ATP released from neutrophils controls chemotaxis in a chemotactic gradient field. Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2007 Division of General Surgery 106 Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center by promoting the migration of neutrophils. These findings may allow us to explore new strategies to control neutrophil-induced host tissue damage in trauma patients and in patients with other inflammatory diseases. In addition to our work on purinergic signaling, we study the role of gamma-delta T cells in host defense. Gamma-delta T cells are a rare and little studied T lymphocyte subpopulation. We found that these cells are able to recognize and eliminate inflammatory neutrophils; thus gamma-delta T cells protect host organs such as the lungs from inflammatory tissue damage. We found that gamma-delta T lymphocytes recognize and target inflamed neutrophils by detecting heat shock protein (Hsp) 72 on the cell surface of the inflamed cells. We are currently studying ways to augment the ability of gamma-delta T lymphocytes to recognize and eliminate inflamed neutrophils from affected host tissues. C LINICAL RESEARCH Our basic research efforts described above have led us to the discovery of a promising novel approach that might be useful to modulate the cellular immune responses in trauma patients. In association with collaborators at the University of Washington in Seattle and at the University of Toronto, we have initiated a multi-center clinical study to test the immunomodulatory potential of hypertonic resuscitation fluids in trauma patients. The aims of this collaborative effort are to study if preclinical administration of hypertonic resuscitation fluids in trauma patients can prevent inflammation and excessive activation of neutrophils and of monocytes. Our group will focus in particular on the effects of hypertonic resuscitation on T lymphocyte activation, apoptosis, and T helper lymphocyte subset distribution patterns.

Junger, PhD RESEARCH ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN THE PASTYEAR Research Progress In June of 2007, I moved my laboratory from the University of California San Diego to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center where our research continues to focus on the molecular mechanisms underlying inflammatory diseases, particularly in the context of traumatic, septic, and hemorrhagic shock. In addition, we pursued a number of related research projects. For example, we studied the role of ATP release in the response of T cells to shock waves in a collaborative effort with Dr. Yu at Jilin University, China. The aim of this research is to define the immunomodulatory effects that Dr. Yu has observed in response to shock wave treatment of patients. We also studied the role of nucleotide receptors in the regulation of kidney function. This collaborative effort with UCSD researchers has elucidated how osmotically-induced ATP release and feedback through purinergic receptors regulates kidney function. Another project with collaborators at UCSD and at the Lainz Hospital in Vienna, Austria focuses on the use of hypertonic fluids to treat inflammatory bowel disease. This research effort is aimed at determining whether hypertonic manipulation can be utilized to prevent the flair-up complications associated with colitis. We further explored the role of ATP release in neutrophil function. In particular, we studied the mechanisms by which neutrophils hydrolyze released ATP to adenosine. In collaboration with Dr. Simon Robson, BIDMC Department of Medicine, we have begun to investigate the involvement of NTPDase 1 (CD39) in this process.

Slavin, MD Plastic Surgery Research Center BASIC RESEARCH The Division of Plastic Surgery focused on two primary basic research projects in 2007: 1. Perforator Identification Using Near-Infrared Imaging (NIR) and the 2. Cortical Neuroplasticity and Perforator Breast Reconstruction Research Projects (Translational) Perforator Identification Using Near-Infrared Imaging (NIR) : Techniques were developed by out group to localize perforating vessels for use in reconstructive surgery. Utilizing a real time, light emitting diode (LED)-based imaging system to exploit invisible near-infrared (NIR) light, this procedure assesses the physiology of tissue while also providing simultaneous color video imaging of the surgical field. The perforating vessels are assessed with NIR fluorescence angiography using indocyanine green (ICG), a FDA-approved permits patient-specific planning, image-guided creation, and intraoperative assessment without the need for lasers or ionizing radiation. This research is conducted on pigs by Bernard Lee MD, in collaboration with John Fragioni MD, PhD, who oversee the research effort. Figure 1(left) Dynamic NIR fluorescent contrast for flap design : ICG distribution and clearance during early arterial phase (T = 8 sec; top row), late arterial phase (T = 10 sec; middle row), and venous phase (T = 13 vivo . ICG mg/kg; 0.1 mmol/kg; 2.5 mg total) was injected intravenously for flap planning (top row). Perforating arteries (PA1 and PA2; PA3 not shown) were identified around a nipple (N2) 12 sec post -injection. Arrowheads iden tify the origin of each PA. After raising the flap, all three PAs were identified by re-injection of ICG (middle row). Two vascular pedicles, including PA 1 and PA3 (bottow row; arrows), are sh own at the underside of the flap. Images shown include color video (left), NIR flu orescence (middle), and a pseudo-colored (lime green) merged image of the two (right). Cr: Cranial. Cortical Neuroplasticity Project : Cortical neuroplasticity has long been thought to contribute to the success of surgery involving peripheral neuromuscular grafts. We are attempting to quantitatively test the hypothesis that primary plasticity of the motor cortex is responsible for the gain of function seen in patients who have undergone procedures in plastic surgery pertaining to peripheral nerve, with current focus on facial reanimation. Patients have been analyzed using functional MRI (fMRI), with preliminary results suggesting that cortical neuroplasticity is involved in the gain of function associated with facial reanimation. Understanding the ways in which such plasticity occurs, as well as the distance over which it Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center 115Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2007 Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery can occur in motor cortex, may help us to unders tand the capabilities and boundaries of peripheral nerve surgery. Results suggest that manipulation of peripheral nerves may have a significant effect on the function of the central nervous system. Figure #3 fMRI image from an adult patient with a congenital, unilateral facial paralysis who underwent facia l reanimation surgery at BIDMC. Activity for teeth clenching is compared to smiling. Perforator Breast Reconstruction Project . The project assesses the impact of breast reconstruction, following mastectomy, on improving the psychology and quality of life of patients. Functional MRI is utilized changes in areas of self-recognition following breast reconstruction. Nine patients with breast cancer have been studied. Four patients had a mastectomy without reconstruction, while four patients had a mastectomy and reconstruction with autologous tissue. A single patient had a mastectomy with delayed reconstruction with autologous tissue. Each patient had one unaffect ed breast, allowing for an internal control. After analyzing the results, it was concluded that patients who choose breast reconstruction with autologous tissue demonstrate self-recognition of the reconstructed breast. In addition, self-perception of the reconstruction may be a mechanism by which these procedures improve patient quality of life. LINICAL RESEARCH he Division of Plastic Surgery focused on following clinical research areas in 2007: ) Lymphedema The Translational Research Projects were made possible by the Doris Duke Clinical Research Fellowship at Harvard Medical School (awarded to Sharon E. Fox , HMS '08), who spent a year in the Division of Plastic Surgery (2006/07). Sharon Fox developed the protocol, patient base, fMRI procedures, and project analysis for the Translational FMRI Projects. Mentors included Drs. Bernard Lee, Robert Goldwyn, Adam Tobias, Sumner Slavin, Joseph Upton, and Mr. Geoffrey Brahmer . Figure 4 (left) Perception of the body as \"self\" following mastectomy and breast reconstruction. C T 1 . The lymphedema clinic, under the direction of Drs. Sumner Slavin and Loren Borud, serves as a focal point for much needed residency and medical student education in the area of the diagnosis and treatment of lymphedema. Attending, resident, and medical st udent involvement has led to clinical papers and presentations at regional, national, and international meetings. In 2007, Dr. Arin Greene, a plastic surgery faculty surgeon from Children's Hospital, has joined the team as a faculty 116 Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2007 Division of General Surgery ymphedema Researcher, Mauricio Contretras, MD, also prepared a grant submission, \"Temporal Gene A) Create a new lymphedema canine model that replicates the secondary lymphedema found in the B) eveloping acute and C) n of specific target genes to the pathophysiology of secondary lymphedema )Massive Weight Loss / Body Contouringattendings With Dr. Greene's strong interest in both basic and clinical research on lymphedema, the Division hopes to develop research collaborations on lymphedema with other key researchers within the Harvard system.

In August of 2007, Dr. Samuel Lin , a plastic surgeon and board certified otorhinolaryngologist, joined the Division as a faculty member with experience in reconstructive microsurgery and perforator flap techniques. The program also completed its first year of a funded fellowship program, also accepting its second aesthetic and reconstructive breast surgery fellow, Dr. Eran Bar-Meir, a plastic surgeon from Israel. In reconstructive procedures.

Slavin R R esearch efforts in the Division of Plastic Surgery have led to a host of presentations, papers, and other this current academic year, Janet Yueh, another Doris Duke Fellow, started a clinical research project hese two brief examples reveal, perhaps, one of our greatest accomplishments as a Division: our R scholarly activities at the local, regional, national and international areas. In all of our research, we have invited and incorporated the participation of medical students, residents, and fellows. We have also sought, where possible, to collaborate with colleagues and other researchers, both locally and internationally. For instance, the Cortical Neuroplasticity Research Project initiated by Doris Duke Fellow, Sharon Fox, was a collaboration between a young HMS researcher, a senior Plastic Surgeon, Dr. Joseph Upton, and Functional fMRI Researchers from Boston University Center for Biomedical Imaging and the Computational Neuroimage Analysis Lab at Hanyang Unive rsity in South Korean. The project created a dialogue between plastic surgeons and fMRI researchers both locally and internationally. It resulted in some new understandings of the brain and led to papers, presentations, and invitations to share the information with others, including a special awarded oral presentation by Sharon Fox at Harvard Medical School 2007 Soma Weiss Research Day. Finally, this collaborative experience helped direct Ms. Fox (HMS IV) to seek out a PHD in biomedical imaging at MIT / Harvard, where she will integrate her knowledge of both imaging and medicine. In assessing programmatic outcomes of the DIEP flap program. Through her investigative efforts, she learned about disparities in funding mechanisms for the hospital in the medicare reimbursements for DIEP flap breast reconstructions. Her insight led to collaborative efforts, and further investigation with senior level surgical clinicians and administrators at the BIDMC, ICD-9 coders, national policy advocates, and senior clinicians in the field. From a simple question concerning DIEP flaps, and the funding of DIEP Flaps within the hospital, a process has now ensued both within the hospital and beyond. Currently, a hospital task-force has been formed to study the issue and to take it to a national task-force in Baltimore. As part of this process, and in collaboration with others, Ms. Yueh learns about her own talents as a clinician, and investigator. She also learns how the world of medicine and patient care impacts and is impacted by policy, funding, governmental and insurance protocols. T ongoing ability and commitment to work with residents, medical students, and researchers and to mentor them to be future leaders in surgery, medical educatio n, and research. This collaborative model extends Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center 119Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2007 Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery to all of our work, including our ongoing fellowship programs: body contouring, aesthetic and reconstructive breast surgery, and hand/microsurgery fellowships.

R EPORT OF TEACHING Undergraduate and Medical School Courses 1. Medical students were introduced to the diagn osis, treatment, and management of lymphedema at the monthly clinic. 2. The Division of Plastic Surgery was active in teaching student clerkships and 4th year medical students for HMS course, SU514M.1. In 2007, we had 13 students clerks rotate through the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center 123Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2007 Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Division. Each student spent 1 month in the Division. We had hosted 4 international medical students who were on observational rotations. 3. The Division was part of the Dept. of Surgery's elective rotation for 2-week rotations of Harvard Medical Students, HMS III's. In 2007, we helped mentor 9 students. In addition to mentoring ongoing students, the Division sponsored 3-hour wound healing and suturing training seminars for each group of rotating students assigned to the BIDMC. This one-half day seminar takes place quarterly, about 4 times a year. 4. Sponsored 2 Doris Duke Clinical Fellows from HMS. The Division was the recipient of Doris Duke Fellows from HMS for 2006/2007 (Sharon Fox) and 2007/08 (Janet Yueh). Graduate School and Graduate Medical Courses 1. Drs. Slavin and Borud introduced surgical interns and plastic surgery residents to the special challenges and approaches in clinically treating patien ts with lymphedema. Residents / medical students are now involved in writing papers/abstracts for papers and presentations. 2. Drs. Tobias and Lee introduced surgical interns and plastic surgery residents to the special challenges and approaches in microsurgery and working with perforator flaps. Residents, a breast surgery fellow and medical students are now involved in writing papers/abstracts for papers and presentations. 3. Drs. Slavin mentored 5 demonstrations and training sessions in the use of plastic surgery fillers for both aesthetic and reconstructive purposes. 4. Drs. Slavin, Borud, Lee, Tobias, and Upton all participated in the Core Curriculum and Journal Club of the Combined Harvard Plastic Surgery Residency Program. 5. In 2007, the Division helped mentor 24 interns (General Surgeons and EMEDS), 2 podiatry residents, and 16 plastic surgery residents. We also sponsored 3 fellows: aesthetic and reconstructive breast surgery, body contouring, and hand/microsurgery. BIBLIOGRAPHY (JANUARY -D ECEMBER 2007) Original Articles Borud LJ, Warren AG .

I am currently the PI of a Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) research grant that aims to develop new animal models for the study of wound healing in diabetes. This work is being conducted with Drs. Frank LoGerfo and Leena Pradhan from the Division of Vascular Surgery. CLINICAL RESEARCH My main research interest is the vascular reactivity of micro- and macro- circulation. During the last few years, I developed the Microcirculation Lab, which tests the microvasculature in a non-invasive way. The Microcirculation Lab is also equipped with an ultrasound apparatus that enables evaluation of endothelial function in the brachial artery. Our research has been mainly funded by grants from the NIH, American Diabetes Association and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. In addition, we conduct investigator-initiated studies that are funded by the pharmaceutical industry. Aristidis Veves I am interested in the relationship between functional changes in the vascular reactivity and structural changes of the skin. Other interests include the effect of c-nociceptive fiber dysfunction of wound healing and the diabetes-related impairment of angiogenesis. My Laboratory is also collaborating with small biotech companies. This collaboration has resulted in funding from the NIH, either in the form of SBIR or SBTT grants. The main aim of these collaborations is to develop new techniques that can improve our diagnostic abilities or develop new therapeutic interventions that will treat long-term diabetic complications. My group is also interested in the etiology of diabetic foot problems and the pathophysiology of wound healing in diabetes. We are currently conducting a larger prospective study that will evaluate the role of microvascular dysfunction in foot ulceration and wound healing failure. In collaboration with the department of Radiology, we employ a 3 Tesla (3T) magnetic resonance scanner that can access metabolic activity through measurements of the concentrations and reaction rates of the high-energy phosphorus cellular compounds in humans by employing magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy methods. The main advantage of this technique is that it can give a direct non-invasive assessment of muscle metabolism. As a first step, we evaluate the effect of diabetes and its complications on the leg blood flow and metabolic function. In addition, in collaboration with Roy Freeman, MD, examines the natural history of the progression of peripheral neuropathy in diabetic patients. Finally, I am collaborating very closely with Dr. Atul Malhotra, MD from the Harvard Center on Sleep Neurobiology and Sleep Apnea to examine the effects of sleep apnea on vascular reactivity. I currently serve as co-mentor in two fellows who work with Dr. Malhotra.

Bach, MD BASIC RESEARCH My group focuses on the effects of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and two of the products of HO-1 degradation of heme in models of shock, transplantation and vascular injury. We are particularly interested in cell signal transduction and have focused on the mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK) and other signaling molecules in particular this year. We studied the effects of biliverdin/bilirubin in ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) in models of the small intestinal and liver transplantation as well as in intimal hyperplasia following balloon injury. Most have begun a study of the signaling events consequent to biliverdin admi nistration in LPS stimulated macrophages. Biliverdin acted to ameliorate the undesirable consequences of decreased function and tissue injury in IRI likely based on its potent anti-inflammatory properties. Interestingly, biliverdin did not achieve these results in the same manner as carbon monoxide (CO), another agent we tested in the small bowel transplantation model even though both age nts prevented bowel dysfunction and cell damage. Biliverdin suppressed the expression of the adhesion molecules and markedly reduced the infiltration of host leukocytes into the bowel, something that CO did not do. This is in concert with our findings that bilirubin suppressed adhesion molecules on cultured endothelial cells stimulated with TNF- /g68 while CO did not. Fritz Bach The studies on the suppression of smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation following balloon injury provided further evidence that the be neficial effects of biliverdin/bilir ubin are mediat ed by pathways different from the effects of CO. Both biliverdin/bilirubin and CO suppressed SMC proliferation in vitro and intimal hyperplasia in vivo, however, the signaling molecules that effected these changes were different for CO and biliverdin. Even though both molecules involved modulation of p38 MAPK, biliverdin suppressed p38 while CO stimulated p38. We hypothesize that this is due to the differential modulation of p38 /g68 and p38 /g69 by CO and biliverdin. As a part of the study with biliverdin and intimal hyperplasia, we studied the downstream signaling molecules involved in those effects. Interestingly, biliverdin modulated the phosphorylation of Rb leading to hyperphosphorylation of that molecule and consequent suppression of action of transcription factors such as YY1 that are needed for SMC proliferation. This again was different from the effects of CO. We extensively studied the effects of expressing HO-1 in a model of tolerance induced by DST. The conclusions from that study showed that not only did induction of HO-1 increase the efficacy of DST stimulated tolerance, but blocking of HO-1 eliminated the tolerance-inducing effects of DST. This finding suggests that HO-1 may be a critical molecule that is needed for T regulatory mediated tolerance, something we are testing further. Also in that study, we confirmed the earlier findings of the previous years that HO-1 expression leads to antigen induced cell death (AICD). However, in this case we showed additionally that HO-1 expression did not lead to the death of T regulatory cells, although exact quantitation of those effects must still be accomplished.

Hanto, MD, PhD BASIC RESEARCH My current laboratory research is focused on the ability of carbon monoxide (CO) at low concentrations to be protective in rodent and large animal models of ischemia-reperfusion injury and delayed graft function, allograft rejection and survival, and in hepatic regeneration. The goal of these studies is to perform critical experiments that will allow CO to be studied in human clinical trials of organ donation and transplantation, chronic allograft nephropathy, and hepatic resection and transplantation. CO is a product of HO-1 action on heme and has potent anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and anti-proliferative effects. It is of great interest that the CO effects are observed with intermittent exposure e.g. 1 hour per day. We believe that CO will be effective in abrogating the isc hemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) associated with organ procurement, preservation, and reperfusion. In a rat kidney allograft model we have shown that inhaled CO confers protection aga inst chronic allograft nephropathy. We have also developed and validated a model of delayed graft function (DGF) in pig kidney allografts and have shown that CO decreased the severity of DGF and resulted in earlier recovery of kidney function. We are examining whether treatment of donor and/or recipient with CO is optimal in blocking IRI and DDF, as well as determining the optimal dose, duration, and interval. We are also examining the effects of CO on hepatic regeneration in a rodent hepatic resection model and in a model of hepatic ischemia. This work is being done in collaboration with Dr. Leo Otterbein in our division. C LINICAL RESEARCH We are engaged in a number of prospective and retr ospective clinical studies involving transplantation (kidney, liver, pancreas, and islet), dialysis access, and nontransplant hepatobiliary surgery. We have had a longstanding interest in the development of malignancies after transplantation, particularly post- transplant lymphoproliferative diseases (PTLD), and also in the risk of transmission of malignancy to recipients from donors with cancer. We have also been interested in antibody mediated rejection in kidney and liver allograft recipients and the development of therapeutic strategies to permit ABO incompatible transplants and transplants in highly sensitized patients. With the introduction of several new immunosuppressive drugs over the past several years, we are examining changes in immunosuppressive protocols to minimize the side-effects of chronic corticosteroid and calcineurin inhibitor toxicity. The ability to safely transplant HIV+ patients is another significant focus of our clinical research activities as part of a multi-center NIH sponsored trial. We are co-investigators in an NIH/NIAID Clinical Trials in Organ Transplantation study of novel immunosuppressive protocols. We are beginning a clinical study in liver transplant recipients using transcriptional profiling to analyze the allograft response in patients that are likely to have predictive value for post-transplant liver function and risk of rejection, with the ultimate goal of being able to individualize the degree of immunosuppression. There are many other ongoing clinical studies.

Karp, MD BASIC RESEARCH Basic research in the laboratory is conce rned with the molecular basis for liver development and regeneration. Ulti mately we would like to apply this knowledge to produce liver tissue substitutes, enhance liver regeneration, and understand liver cancer. Multiple projects are ongoing in the laboratory. We performed a screen for genes involved in liver regeneration and development. This demonstrated that regeneration and development are distinct process, and that at a molecular level, liver regeneration is best thought of as hepatocyte hyperplasia. We also discovered a class of inhibitory molecules that are down regulated during regeneration, loss of which enhances liver regeneration. We are currently analyzing these genes using liver specific knockout technology we have produced, as well as n AAV-8 vector to introduce genes, also which we helped develop. Seth Karp The second project seeks to determine lineage commitments in the developing and regenerating liver. We believe understanding which cells give rise to which cells in vivo will suggest a strategy for recapitulating liver organogenesis in vitro. Usi ng transgenic mice that express an inducible recombinase in the liver and a target construct that fluoresces when the recombinase is activated, we are able to heritably mark liver cells in a temporally-restricted manner. Following the cells and their progeny is then possible. Combining this approach with 2/3 hepatectomy and other models of liver damage we can determine how the liver is repopulated. We have also initiated a collaborative project with a group from MIT led by Ionnas Yannas trying to use defined scaffolds to encourage normal liver regeneration in fibrotic liver. C LINICAL RESEARCH Clinical research is concerned with predictors of graft survival from donation after cardiac death organs (DCD).We reviewed the database of the New England Organ Bank and determined factors that predict function after DCD transplantation.

We demonstrated that fetal mouse, pig, and human islets are far more resilient than conventional islets and expan d after transplantation. Using our pioneering high-oxygen fetal pancreas organ culture technique, we discovered that fetal endocrine tissues selectively survive, thereby dramatically reducing inflammation and immunogenicity. In 1995, while writing my PhD dissertation part-time, I was recruited as an Overseas Research Associate by Professor David White of Cambridge University, UK. Using the transgenic pig-to-monkey model, we demonstrated that hyperacute rejection, the barrie r that prevents xenogeneic organ transplants, is not a barrier to islet transplants. In 1998 I was recruited by Dr. Hugh Auchincloss to establish non-human primate and NOD mouse core programs for the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation (JDF) Center for Islet Transplantation at Harvard Medical School. In collaboration with Dr. Terry Strom, we achieved remarkable prolongation (ca. 300 days) of allogeneic monkey islets following a short course of novel co-stimulatory based therapy. Indeed, the grafts failed due to non-immune related islet loss that also destroyed a similarly sized autologous pancreas. We subsequently tested the effect of short-term treatment with IL-2.Ig mutant antagonist type IL-15.Ig plus sirolimus the allograft and new-onset Type 1 (T1) diabetes mellitus (DM) NOD mo dels. In treated monkey recipients, long-term drug free graft survival, a cardinal achievement in this extremely difficult model, is routine. In the new-onset T1DM NOD model this regimen restores normoglycemia, immune tolerance to islets, and abolishes a previously unrecognized inflammatory state that impairs insulin signaling, thereby causing insulin resistance. This regimen has been approved for a funded clinical trial in T1DM. Maria Koulmanda Next we hypothesized that agents that tilt the balance of pro- to anti-inflammatory molecules toward an anti-inflammatory state would prove similarly effective in these models. Hence, new-onset T1DM mice were treated short-term with alpha-1-anti-trypsin (AAT), an acu te phase reactant. Although this agent does not directly act upon T cells, AAT promotes rapid restoration of normoglycemia and islet cell tolerance in the NOD model. In fact, the remnant islet cell mass rapidly tripled in size in the AAT-treated mice. In AAT-treated monkey islet allograft recipients, insulin levels rise substantially ca. 30 days post- transplantation. In contrast, insulin levels insidiously decrease in other islet (even autologous) transplant models. While this work is not yet published, the Immune Tolerance Network has approved an AAT clinical trial in new-onset T1DM. As hypoxic- and ischemic-reperfusion type injuries lead to amplified expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in human transplants, these findings open new opportunities for clinical application of inflammation-altering cytoprotec tive strategies. Going forward I am concentrating on the study of allogeneic and xen ogeneic (both fetal and conventional) islet transplants placed into cynomolgus monkey recipients. I will pay particular attention to the study of novel anti- inflammatory (cytoprotective) strategies as a means to enable immune tolerance and nurture resilient (\"cytoprotected\") islets as a means to cure T1DM in new-onset diabetics or in recipients of islet transplants.

The Abstract for this work is below. In NOD mice with overt new onset type 1- diabetes mellitus (T1DM), short term treatment with the \"Power plus agonist IL-2- mIL-15/Fc)] abolishes immunologic destruction of the islet beta cells and restores both euglycemia and immune tolerance to beta cells. To our surprise, increases in the mass of insulin producing beta cells or circulating insulin levels were not linked to the restoration of euglycemia. Instead, the restoration of euglycemia was linked to relief from an unforeseen inflammatory state in fat and muscle tissues that impair the ability of these tissues respond to insulin. Consequently, restoration of immune 148 Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2007 Division of Transplantation tolerance enables the immune protected residual be ta cell mass to maintain normoglycemia following resolution of the insulin resistant state. Both restoration of T cell tolerance to beta cells and relief from the adverse metabolic effects of an inflammatory state in insulin sensitive tissues appear essential for permanent restoration of normoglycemia in this informative model of T1DM. Power Mix, a regimen with both tolerance inducing and select an ti-inflammatory properties, may represent a proto-type for therapies able to restore euglycemia and self-tolerance in this difficult setting.

Otterbein My group focuses primarily on the gas molecule carbon monoxide (CO) and the potent therapeutic effects it has when used at low concentrations in models of shock, transplantation and vascular injury. This work stems from the study of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), also a focus of the laboratory, as this inducible enzyme, which has been labeled a protective gene that generates CO as a product during the catalysis of heme. This year we have added the investigations of asecond product of HO-1 activity, biliverdin (BV) and converts BV to bilirubin (BR). BV has been shown to exert potent protective effects in a number of in vitro and in vivo models with the assumption that it is the powerful anti-oxidant effects that underlie the mechanism of action. We tested the hypothesis that BVR can act as a receptor and, in addition to converting BV to BR, initiates, via the binding of BV, a signaling cascade through PI3K and Akt activation. Moreover, that this occurs because BVR, in part, is localized on the external surface of cells. Figure 1 shows total internal reflective fluorescence (TIRF) data depicting cell- surface BVR on macrophages. This work has been accepted by the Journal of Clinical Investigation. Leo Otterbein Results from a comprehensive gene microarray in CO-exposed macrophages revealed the candidate target gene Egr-1 is driven by activation of PPAR /g74. While PPAR /g74 was essential in the protection afforded by CO, it occurred after 3-4 hr of exposure. Due to the rapid increase (<5 minutes) in reactive oxygen species, and that CO targets heme-containing proteins, we hypothesized that hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF1- /g68) would be a likely target. Rapid stabilization of HIF1- /g68 significantly precedes expression of PPAR /g74. We show that CO, via HIF1- /g68 increases expression of TGF-/g69 (Figure 1 ) in macrophages and in the lung and protects against ischemia/reperfusion injury. Our focus this year is to apply this information in a live bacterial sepsis model where preliminary data suggests that CO can act therapeutically to both prevent the sequelae of shock and augment bacterial killing via increased production of ROS and reactive nitrogen species arising from inducible nitric oxide synthase. CO was unable to kill bacteria in cells deficient in iNOS ( Figure 2 ). Figure 1 In a collaborative effort with Dr. Simon Robson, Department of Medicine at BIDMC, we demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory effects of adenosine in macrophages occur in part by increasing the expression of HO-1. The endogenous CO generated via HO-1 in turn upregulates the selective expression of the A2a adenosine receptor that drives the anti-inflammatory response. These effects were lost in A2a deficient macrophages. These data exemplify the close and complex interrelationship between these protective genes and their products. Air CO 1:100 1:1 1:100 1:1 1:100 1:1 Figure 2 Ongoing studies in models of vascular injury related to both arteriosclerosis arising that leads to chronic rejection as well as balloon angioplasty have elucidated that CO augments vascular repair via select targeting of calcium channels which lead subsequently to downstream activation of Akt and NO generation via eNOS. Preclincial research -large animal model of kidney transplantation A large animal study was continued this year in preparation for a clinical trial for CO in organ transplantation to prevent early loss of function and ultima tely chronic rejection. The hope is that CO can Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center 153Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2007 Division of Transplantation be used to increase the donor pool and permit the use of extended criteria donors. In collaboration with Doug Hanto, we developed a model of delayed graft fu nction (DGF) following kidney transplantation in swine, which is primarily due to ischemia/reperfusion injury. We are now testing the ability of CO, now known as Covox to prevent DGF when administered only to recipients. Our data suggests that intraoperative administration of CO to the recipient through the vent ilator as a one-time exposure, reduces DGF. Continued experiments are underway to optimize dose ranging and the cellular and molecular target(s) of CO.

To work toward this goal, we attempt to define the precise nature of immune tolerance and of immunoregulatory T cells at the molecular and cellular levels. Transplant tolerance is obtain ed when the functional supremacy of donor reactive immunoregulatory T cells is obtained and remains dominant following the cessation of immunosuppression. A distinctive cell surface phenotype for immunoregulatory T cells has been discerned. This molecular signature consists of two ectoenzymes that catalyze the formation of adenosine, an immunoregulatory substance, which contributes importantly to immunoregulatory T cell function. These laboratories place strong emphasis in the development of innovative biotherapeutics. Our first effort to use mAbs and cytokine related fusion proteins directed against activated, but not resting, T cells directly led to the development of anti-CD25 mAbs for use in transplantation and autoimmunity. More recently, novel biotherapeutic proteins developed and tested within our lab have shown great promise in the murine model of type1 diabetes and difficult mouse and non-human primate models of islet and cardiac transplantation. As a direct result of these efforts, we have obtained valuable information concerning the role of certain T cell growth factors, T cell immunoglobulin mucin domain proteins (Tim) and acute phase reactants on T cell apoptosis, and on the differing vulnerabilities of regulatory, transplant protective and cytopathic-transplant destructive T cells to therapy. Other work has given insight as to the effect of certain therapies on inhibition or promotion of activation-induced T cell death, an event that is crucial for tolerance induction.

The critical role of certain pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines upon T cell lineage commitments, pancreatic islet cell viability/expansion and insulin signaling has also fostered a healthy respect for and means to overcome the confounding role of adverse inflammation upon tolerance induction and important role for promoting the resilience of tissues under confound immune and inflammatory attack. Two new novel therapeutic regimens, power mix and the use of alpha1 anti-trypsin, an acute phase reactant protein, are slated for clinical trial in humans with new onset diabetes and islet transplantation, as a result of preliminary funding support from the NIH and JDRF funded Immune Tolerance Network.

The program touches on many aspects of this specialty including reproduction, stem cell biology, tumor markers, virology (AIDS), neurology and clinical outcomes analysis. The urology laboratory community involves two PhD research scientists and several studen ts from Harvard and MIT assigned to rotations thru our laboratories. Funding is continually growing and currently involves several NIH and DOD grants as well as private funding. Much of the Clinical Research is based on work from the new Continence Center focusing on aspects of neurology, as well as our busy oncology practice. We have established a database incorporating a single surgeon series of radical prostatectomies from the decade of the 1990's involving about 500 cases. This has been used to complete a series of manuscripts that now number five with more submitted. Our Division is heavily involved in NIH outcomes research directed towards various quality of life issues and hopefully will expand to both malignant and non malignant diseases. Finally we have an active animal lab directed at various technical aspects of minimally invasive urolo gic surgery. The research work in Urology is presented at a wide range of meetings including the AUA, AACR, and FASAB meetings. In addition as noted, in the following descriptions, the research work is published in a broad range of journals.

To this aim, I am using the TRAMP transgenic mice that spontaneously develop PCa and present a degree of tolerance to antigens that can be manipulated through various interventions. Circumventing immune tolerance through eliciting and strengthening cytotoxic lymphocytes or interfering with the rise of regulatory T cells is attempeted through manipulating the inhibitory mechanisms that prevent CTLs from proliferating in response to tumor antigens, and also through triggering events that would prevent regulatory T lymphocytes from rising. The latter includes interference with the conversion of CD4 lymphocytes to CD4 a nonsuppressive phenotype. To carry out this project we have generated a TRAMP-GFP-Foxp3 hybrid mouse that will facilitate tracking and characterization of regulatory T cells both in vitro and in vivo . Another focus of my research is prostate cancer immunotherapy. This interest sparked from data from our and other groups which suggest that immunization with a single prostate cancer TAA can generate an efficient anti-tumor response in preclinical studies and clinical trials. We propose extending the realm of prostate cancer immunotherapy by using transgenic mice, that express human HLA, to optimize strategies for inducing human HLA-restricted T cell responses to ERG and other TAA's identified by unbiased, genome-wide array studies of clinical prostate tumor samples. Novel tumor-associated antigen (TAA) identified through genome- wide array analyses, including ERG (a transcription factor overexpressed in PCa as a result of the TMPTSS2:ERG fusion) and other prostate cancer-specific TAA's, represent novel targets for prostate cancer immunotherapy. By a stepwise approach of screening epitope targets by HLA-A2.1 binding studies, immunization of human HLA-A2.1 transgenic mice to identify immunogenic peptides, and active and passive immunotherapy in mouse models (including probasin-ERG transgenic mice) to determine which of these peptides provide the most suitable targets for effective, human HLA-restricted, anti-tumor immunity in vivo. Coupling the targeting of such novel TAA with modulation of Tim pathways, to overcome T cell tolerance, is a rational avenue toward inducing effective, prostate cancer-specific immune responses. These studies will lead to clinical trials of new strategies for prostate cancer immunotherapy.

We performed in silico analyses identifying putative HLA-A2.1-restricted epitopes of ERG. We then screened these candidate epitopes for binding affinity Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center 165 Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2007 Division of Urology to human HLA-A2.1 in vitro. Epitopes with high affinity were then evaluated for their human HLA-A2.1- restricted immunosusceptibility in vivo by immunization of human HLA transgenic mice (HHD mice), that showed the ability to induce ERG-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes as measured by ELISPOT. We identified three ERG-derived epitopes that proved to be immunogenic in HHD mice. Cytotoxic lymphocytes elicited by these peptides are currently tested in a an adoptive transfer/tumor xenograft mouse model where CTL are elicited in HHD mice, expanded in vitro, and then adoptively transferred into SCID mice bearing human prostate tumors. A similar approach was utilized to identify sim2s antigen and sim2s-derived, HLA-A2.1-restricted epitopes which are being tested for immonogenicity in HHD mice at present. We will also test the potential of targeting Tim proteins on lymphocytes and dendritic cells as a strategy for circumventing immune tolerance in the context of these novel, prostate cancer-specific TAA epitopes. The results of these projects will have implications for the design of clinical immunotherapy trials targeting novel prostate TAA epitopes. Using The TRAMP-GFP-Foxp3 hybrid mouse, we have shown elev ated occurrence of regulatory T lymphocytes in the prostate draining lymph nodes from tum or-bearing mice. In addition, CD4 and CD8 T cells from tumor-bearing mice, but not from tumor-free mice, exhibit increased sensitivity to the effects of TGF-beta, as demonstrated by their elevated rate of conversion to the Treg phenotype. The latter observation triggered our interest in dissecting the gene expression profile of activated lymph node T lymphocytes from both groups of mice in the presence and absence of TGF-beta. The results of this analysis would allow identification of key molecules that are responsible for the switching process of T cells to Treg cells, and might lead to new and better ways to dampen the rise of Tregs in cancer.

DeWolf, MD Mike Schopperle, PhD BASIC RESEARCH Our basic science research focuses on studying and characterizing unique and specific human cancer stem cell molecules with the goal to further understand and define the molecular make-up of a of human cancer stem cell, to determine the molecular differences between cancer stem cells and normal cells, and to identify potential cancer stem cell molecules that may be targets for novel treatments for human cancers. Our model to carry out these studies is embryonal carcinoma, in the form of established human cancer stem cell lines derived from human germ cell tumors. Embryonal carcinoma cells are the malignant version of human embryonic stem cells derived from human embryos and embryonal carcinoma cells are true pluripotent cancer stem cells, which can be induced to differentiate into non-stem cell cancer cells. Thus, embryanal carcinoma is an excellent model for studying unique molecules expressed by human cancer stem cells and also to study their function as both cancer stem cells and their differentiat ed non stem-cell cancer cells. dl d h Mike Schopperle Using this model, we have discovered a novel cancer stem cell marker in embryonal carcinoma called podocalyxin. Podocalyxin is a cell surface protein with very limited expression in human cells: it is expressed in subsets of blood cells and functions as an cell adhesion protein to allow blood cells to migrate intosurrounding tissue (the spread of cancer within patients is thought to use similar mechanisms), and podocalyxin is expressed in kidney podocyte cells where it functions as a specific scaffolding protein to form large multi-protein complexes. Our identification of podocaxylin in human cancer stem cells was the firstreport of podocalyin in either human cancer or human stem cells, but since this discovery, numerous laboratories have discovered podocalyixn in many human cancers including breast and prostate cancers. In fact, these studies have also shown that podocalyxin is a marker for an aggressive phenotypic behavior of cancer cells. Podocalyxin has also been identified as highly expressed in embryonic stem cells further confirming the close relationship of embryonal carcinoma with embryonic stem cells. Our continued studies of podocalyin have shown that it is the molecular carrier of the TRA antigens; TRA markers have been widely used for decades within the stem cell community to study human stem cells. TheTRA markers have also been identified as potential bl ood markers for testis cancers. With the identification of podocalyxin as the carrier of the TRA molecules, studies can now be done to further the initial findings of theTRA antigens in human cancers and stem cells. We published our work in the journal Stem Cells in January of 2007 (please refer to the specific reference in our Bibliography). Our current studies on podocalyixn are now focused in two directions; the first direction is to determine the function of podocalyin in human cancer stem cells by identifying other molecules in cancer stem cells that interact with podocalyin. We have identified six true podocalyxin-interacting proteins including a glucose transporter - the molecules responsible for suppling energy (glucose) to all cells. We are now characterizing the glucose transporter-podocalyxin complex and we are excited at the prospect of identifying the first interaction between a glucose transporter and a cell adhesion protein. Indeed, in almost all human cancers, glucose transporters are highly over-expressed, but very littl e is known about the underlining molecular mechanisms that drive this process. The second direction with our studies of podocalyin is more clinically oriented; we are exploring the expression of podocalyxin in human blood samples from patients with prostate and other cancers to determine podocalyin's role as a potential blood cancer marker.

Kiessling, PhD Robert C. Eyre, MD Paul Church, MD The long-term goals of our research are to understand gene expression in genitourinary tract tissues and embryos. Studies of HIV infection in male GU tract tissues began over 20 years ago with the first measurements of viral burden in seminal plasma from men with AIDS. The immune privilege of most male GU tract tissues led to the hypothesis that semen- producing organs could be an isolated sanctuary of HIV disease. Originally controversial, this concept is now broadly accepted. The work on HIV infection in semen was recognized as a Prize Paper by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine at their annual meeting in 2007. The work on HIV has lead to studies of specific immunologic features of prostate, seminal vesicles and epididymis. Results to date suggest that the role of the prostate in immune-protection of spermatozoa relates to the disease predisposition of the prostate, including bacterial infections and cancer. In addition, the unique population of tissue-specific macrophages in seminal vesicles and epididymis that play a role in their normal development and function, may also serve as hosts for HIV infection. If so, they may be important life-long reservoirs of infection, difficult to penetrate by anti-retroviral drugs. We extended this work to studies of bacteria present in semen and discovered that, as predicted, the most prevalent bacterial species detected by molecular biology are difficult to culture organisms, particularly gram positive anaerobic cocci. Robert Eyre Ann Kiesslin g Jeffrey Shaman and Ann KiesslingMore recent studies are extending the molecular biologic detection of bacteria to interstitial cystitis, a chronic,debilitating disease of unknown etiology for both men andwomen. Patients undergoing cystoscopy to diagnose/stagetheir disease may elect to submit a biopsy for bacterialassay. This approach will provide valuable, new information about treatmentoptions for this group of patients. We have also taken advantage of recent reports that adult testis of mice contain apopulation of stem cells that can be expanded as pluripotent stem cells in culture. Our prior experience with testis research includes studies of germ cell populations,both in mice and humans. Preliminary studies suggest well known methods ofperturbing male germ cell populations may increase the number of stem cells thatcan be expanded in culture. A testis source of pluripotent stem cells holds greatpatient-specific therapeutic potential. Bryan Desmarais Current focus : 1) Genetic and phylogenetic analyses of HIV ge nes cloned from paired specimens of blood and semen contributed by study subjects in a five-year longitudinal study design. We created a public database: http://www.lrb.med.harvard.edu in which we have compiled all the published HIV env sequences from semen, including our own. We have included HIV env sequences from paired blood Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center 173 Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2007 Division of Urology specimens when available. This is the first public database of its kind and is providing background for understanding the most significant HIV host cells in semen producing organs, as well as for the design of vaccines targeting semen transmitted disease. To date, we have sequenced and analyzed approximately 1300 clones of HIV genes including those containing Envelope, Protease, and Reverse Transcriptase. The genetic analyses have illustrated unique clustering patterns of HIV quasispecies isolated from paired blood and semen specimens from long term study subjects. These findings support and extend the concept, proposed by this laboratory over 20 years ago, that semen producing organs are a sequestered focus of HIV infection, separate from blood. Importantly, several study subjects have demonstrated the appearance of therapy resistance-conferring mutations in semen before they appear in blood. Paul Church and Jeffrey Shaman More recent analyses of HIV envelope genes have revealed compartmentalization of syncytium-inducing virus species (utilize chemokine receptor CXCR4) and non-syncytium-inducing virus species (utilize chemokinereceptor CCR5). This confirms and extends reports that HIV variants which utilize CCR5 receptors are the sexually transmitted virus species. As infection progresses, blood HIV variants mutate to express envelopesthat preferentially bind to CXCR4 rather than CCR5. This switch in virus tropism is due to point mutations at one or two amino acid residues (S306R or E320K,R) in the V3 loop of HIV env, and marks a turning point in disease progression due to increased levels of infection and loss of CD4+ lymphocytes incorporated intolymph node syncytia. The switch in virus tropism was formerly attributed to a high error rate in the virus reverse transcriptase, but more recent studies have revealed that a family of deaminases, CEM15 (APOBEC3G) function as an innate cellular defense mechanism retroviral infection. CEM15 deaminates cytosine in the nascent DNAstrand synthesized by viral reverse transcriptase during the proces s of infection. The resulting uracil residue triggers destruction of the nascent DNA strand by intracellular DNAses. If, however, the nascent DNA is notdestroyed, the positive strand has an adenosine substitution for the guanosine residue that formerly paired with the cytosine. To determine if such mutations influence disease progression, we have analyzed two subsets of our HIV sequence data: 53 unique sequences of the V3 loop of Gp120 from a long-term non-progressor and 82 unique sequences of protease from a man who developed therapy resistance at 32 monthsof treatment. The logistics of archiving and analyzing a growing data set of gene sequences have necessitatedthe development of a custom laboratory database, which has be en recently completed in MySQL. We use the database as the starting point for sequence analyses and evolution. (2) Immunology of male GU tract tissues wit h emphasis on bacterial infection in the prostate, seminal vesicles, epididymis and bladder. Understanding immune controls in these tissues will provide important insights into not only sexually transmitted diseases, but also specific gland pathologies, such as prostatitis, prostate cancer and interstitial cystitis.Several lines of evidence from this laboratory indicate the prostate is immunosuppressed. This characteristic could play an important role in prostate diseases, such as prostatitis and prostate cancer. We have previously reported that prostatitis may drive HIV disease by promoting the development of therapy resistancemutations. For these reasons, we explored the bacterial species present in prostatic tissues. We used PCRamplification of bacterial ribosomal gene sequences, followed by sequencing the PCR products and identification through GenBank searches. The work began with semen specimens from two cohorts of patients, one group undergoing fertility assessment, and another group undergoing vasectomy. Pre-and post-vasectomy specimens allowed the comparison of specimens with and without contribution from the epididymis. We have developed a reference library of bacterial DNA sequences amplifiable from laboratory reagents, a problem known to haunt this line of investigati on. To date, we have amassed a total library of 174 Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2007 Division of Urology approximately 200 rDNA gene sequences which have been submitted to GenBank and recently published in Fertility and Sterility. (3) Endogenous retrovirus expression in male urogenital tract tissues. The human genome contains more retrovirus-related sequences (45%) than the mouse genome The first retrovirus identified was an endogenous retrovirus expressed by placental cells - in vivo and in vitro . The physiologic significance of the human endogenous retrovirus repertoire is poorly understood, but there is a growing awareness of the mobility of genomic elements and th eir role in cancer. A full-length human endogenous retrovirus (HERV-L) appears to be currently active in the human genome. The mouse counterpart, MERV-L, also appears to be active in the mouse genome, and is a likely candidate for the highly epididymal specific retrovirus expression described by his laboratory over a decade ago. For this reason, we have surveyed a library of male mouse tissue RNAs for expression of MERV-L. We extended this work to endogenous retrovirus expression in human testis and epididymis. The importance of this line of investigation was emphasized in 2006 when an infectious form of HERV(K) was isolated at Rockefeller University. This family of viruses appears to also be controlled by the CEM15 family of deaminases. We have taken advantage of recent advances in characterizing expression of retroelements to design strategies to characterize expression in all male GU tract tissues, work proposed to the NSF in our current grant applications. (4) Pluripotent stem cells from adult mouse testis.It had long been assumed that spermatogoonia could give rise to cultured cell lines restricted to germ cell derivatives, and that such cells were most easily isolated from pre-pubertal testis. In early 2007 it was reported that with the right growth factors, pluripotent stem cell lines could be derived from adult mouse testis. Our previous experience perturbing testis populations with the alkylating agent, busulfan, suggested that the rebound from such treatment might further enrich adult testis for stem cells, and, with Dr. Jeffrey Shaman, we have initiated a search for pluripotent stem cells in tissue sections and in cu ltured cells from se miniferous tubules. This work was submitted as a grant application to NIH for consideration. Figure 1. Cross-sections of fixed seminiferous tubules from (A) untreated mice and (B) mice treated with busulfan four weeks prior to fixation. (A) Sox2 (red; arrowheads) is a pluripotency marker and labels small cells at the basal lamina of untreated tubules.

This represents the first comprehensive characterization of bacteria in semen and revealed that most specimens are negative for abundant bacteria, and a surprising preponderance of gram positive anaerobic cocci in positive specimens. We continue to characterize bacteria in prostate tissues using the same techniques. The longitudinal genetic and phylogenetic analyses of HIV genes is now nearly complete for 9 study subjects. The results to date indicate that male GU tract organs are a clinically important reservoir of HIV disease in men, including those on therapy. To establish tissue specific reservoirs of disease, we continuing to work on a collaboration with Southwest Biomedical Research Foundation to analyze tissue biopsies from HIV-infected chimpanzees. We have completed a survey of male mouse genital trac t RNAs and DNAs for presence and expression of the endogenous retrovirus, MERV-L. This work was published in 2007 and formed the basis for the human studies leading to grant applications that will be submitted in 2008. We have conducted pilot studies to characterize endogenous retrovirus expression in human testis and epididymis. These studies were not possible for many years because of the complexity and redundancy of the repertoire of endogenous retroviruses in the human genome. We have taken advantage of recent developments in organizing human genome information and designing PCR primers to amplify specific families of endogenous RVs. The goal is to determine tissue specific expression, and whether or not there are associated disease changes. Our work in this area was featured at a British Andrology Society meeting in Leeds, England, and has appeared in proceedings from that meeting.

This set of broad research goals provides a unique environment for learning how translational research, utilizing transgenic mice, can concurrently address issues important for developing new therapy whilealso characterizing fundamental issues of basic tumor immunology. The translational component of this work also focuses on id entifying how prostate tumor antigens may be used not only as targets for immunotherapy but also to improve prostate cancer early detection. Martin Sanda CLINICAL RESEARCH The clinical research focus in the Sanda laboratory concerns prostate cancer clinical outcomes. These studies include the PROST-QA consortium, a national consortium of prostate cancer referral centers (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Cleveland Clinic, MD Anderson Cancer Center, MGH, UCLA, University of Michigan, and Washington University) wherein combined evaluation of cancercontrol, satisfaction with care, and quality of life provides comprehensive characterization of prostate cancer care quality. This study, led by Dr. Sanda, has enrolled over 1800 participants, treated by over 40 physicians nationwide, and is the largest ongoing, NCI-funded prospective study of prostate cancer quality of life. Dr. Sanda also participates in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), where he is the Urology co-Chair of the GU Early Modalities Subcommittee, which develops multi-center Phase II and Phase III protocols forearly stage GU cancers.

LoGerfo, MD Vascular Surgery Research Laboratory Christiane Ferran, MD, PhD Vascular Immunobiology Research Laboratory Alan Hamdan, MD Clinical Vascular Surgery Research Marc Schmerhorn, MD Vascular Surgery Outcomes Research V ASCULAR SURGERY RESEARCH LABORATORY BASIC RESEARCH The vascular surgery research laboratory has been extensively involved in four main areas of vascular biology research: 1) evaluating mechanisms responsible for prosthetic graft failure, 2) prevention of intimal hyperplasia in vein grafts, 3) defining the role of neuropept ides in diabetic wound healing, and 4) developing novel biomaterial surfaces. Anastomotic intimal hyperplasia (AIH) is the most common cause of delayed prosthetic arterial graft failure, and delayed failure of vein grafts. As graft healing occurs, genes are either up- or down-regulated as compared to a quiescent arterial wall. We study altered gene expression that results in endothelial cell activation as well as cellular proliferation, migration and extracellular matrix production by smooth muscle cells, leading to AIH. Differential gene expression is assessed using various techniques such as, microarray analysis, qPCR immunohistochemistry, and laser capture microdissection (LCM), a relatively new technology developed by the National Institutes of Health which is available at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. We have now established proficiency with LCM, a tool designed to isolate homogeneous populations of cells for genetic analysis. This technique allows direct microscopic visualization and isolation of selected cell populations from frozen tissue sections and permits selection of cells within a chosen area of tissue. The significance and unique aspect of this work is that ou r group is the first to identify specific genes that are altered following prosthetic arterial grafting and vein grafting in vivo and to examine their role in the cellular environment using various in vitro cell culture assays. This information is now being used to identify targets for RNA interference-m ediated gene silencing. We have es tablished our ability to silence RNA in cell culture and in the vein graft wall and are working to develop systems for RNA silencing that will be practical for intraoperative use. Frank LoGerfo For the neuropeptide-diabetic wound healing resea rch, we are currently developing different in vivo and in vitro models. Both the in vivo and in vitro projects are conducted in my laboratory by Dr. Leena Pradhan, who is an Instructor in Surgery at Harvard Medical School (HMS). For the in vivo project we collaborate with Dr. Aristidis Veves in our Department, who is an Associate Professor of Surgery at HMS in the Division of Podiatry. Peripheral neuropathy and peripheral vascular disease are the major contributors to diabetic foot ulcers and their failure to heal. Therefore, it is important to assess the individual and combined role of neuropathy and vascular disease and their intricate interplay that leads to DFU. To achieve this goal we have successfully developed an in vivo diabetic rabbit model of ischemic and neuron-ischemic wound healing. The results of our in vivo studies are highly promising implicating a role for neuroinflammation in abnormal diabetic wound healing. Angiogenesis is an important phase of wound healing and dermal microvascular endothelial cells are central to achieving successful closure of the wound. Our in vitro studies using dermal vascular endothelial cells are specifically designed to monitor the role of neuropeptides in angiogen esis in a hyperglycemic environment. For biomaterials research, we have designed and patented several novel biomaterial surfaces. An infection-resistant ionic polyurethane was developed in Phase I and II STTR grants in which quinolone antibiotics were incorporated into the polymer using textile dyeing techniques, with this surface demonstrating antimicrobial activity both in vitro and in vitro . This biomaterial can be used to comprise a wide range of implantable devices such as catheters, wound dressings and vascular grafts, avenues that Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2007 Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery 186 Beth Israel Deaoncess Medical Center are currently being explored. A similar ionic polyurethane was then employed to seal FDA-approved knitted Dacron vascular grafts using a patented perfusion technology. As part of a Phase II STTR grant, these sealed vascular grafts were evaluated at various acute and chronic time periods using a canine carotid arterial grafting model. A porcine cardiac surgical model to evaluate a novel infection-resistant Dacron prosthetic valve sewing cuff with optimum antimicrobial properties is currently in the development stages in order to complete the objectives of a Phase II SBIR grant. We have also developed in vitro , as described in our Phase I STTR proposal, a novel small-diameter nanofibrous polyurethane vascular graft via electrospinning technology. Lastly for metallic implants comprised of titanium such as bone joints and dental posts, we have completed early development of a novel titanium surface with mitogenic properties via covalent linkage of bone morphogenic protein-2 (an osteoblast mitogen). Recently we have developed a surface including activated protein C to prevent thrombosis and to stimulate cellular healing of the Dacron arterial grafts. V ASCULAR IMMUNOBIOLOGY RESEARCH LABORATORY Most of my time effort, i.e. ninety per ce nt, is devoted to research. My major research interests are in the field of vascular biology mainly intimal hyperplasia and the micro and macrovascular complications of diabetes, transplantation including xenotransplantation and islet transplantation as well as autoimmune diabetes, acute liver failure and liver regeneration. More specifically, the work in my laboratory is focused on the understanding of the function (s) of the anti- apoptotic genes A20, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and A1 in different cell types, their relationship to the pathophysiology of diseases and their potential therapeutic use in organ transplantation, diabetes, atherosclerosis, diabetic vasculopathy and liver regeneration. This interest is based on our original finding that these genes, mainly A20 serve a broad cytoprotective function in endothelial cells (EC), islets and hepatocytes and an atheroprotective function in smooth muscle cells (SMC). Expression of A20 in endothelial cells, islets and hepatocytes not only protects the cells from apoptosis by interrupting the activation of the caspase cascade but also exerts a broad anti-inflammatory purpose by blocking activation of the transcription factor NF-/g457B. Christiane Ferran Uniquely, A20 also promotes hepatocyte proliferation hence liver regeneration by down-regulating the cell cycle brake p21waf1. In addition, we have recently demonstrated that A20 also increases the expression of peroxisome proliferator associated receptor /g302 (PPAR/g302), which adds to its anti-inflammatory effect in hepatocytes, and unveil its role in regulating lipid metabolism and cellular energy ( Fig. 1 ). These novel findings are strong proof that A20 based therapies may be highly beneficial for patients presenting with severe liver damage but who still have a fraction of viable hepatocytes. Protecting this reduced functional liver mass in the face of ongoing inflammation would meet metabolic demands and allow enough time for regeneration. Expression of A20 is particularly promising for reducing the donor graft size necessary for living donor liver transplantation, allowing the safe use of steatotic organs, and permitting extensive liver resection for the cure of neoplasia. Expression of A20 in SMC, on the other hand inhibit their proliferation and sensitizes neointimal (i.e. the major component of atherosclerotic lesions), but n ot medial SMC, to apoptosis through a novel NO dependent mechanism. A20 fulfills most of the criteria required for an ideal atheroprotective therapy that confers an athero-resistant phenotype to both EC and SMC. We propose that A20 based therapies hold strong promise for the prevention and cure of vascular neointimal disease including atherosclerosis, transplant arteriosclerosis, in-stent restenosis and diabetic vasculopathy. This hypothesis is strengthened by our recent demonstration of impaired expression of A20 in failed vein grafts of diabetic patients, which could account for their increased susceptibility to atherosclerosis. Decreased A20 expression in face of HG stems from its post-translational modification by O-glycosylation (a newly recognized, key post-translational modification), which marks it for ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome. Glucose-mediated degradation of A20 in EC/SMC promotes their acquisition of a pro-atherogenic phenotype, contributing to accelerated atheroscl erosis in DM. We have also novel direct in vivo proof of the protective effect of A20 against transplant arteriosclerosis. Expression of A20 in aortic grafts performed in mice with total HLA mismatch prevents transplant arteriosclerosis. In a similar vein, we have breakthrough evidence that A20 is a negative regulator of angiogenic pathways in EC, both upstream and downstream of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF). Expression of A20 Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2007 Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center 187 in EC inhibits EC tube formation, in vitro, through blockade of PKC/g451II and ERK1/2 activation while enhancing VEGF mediated AKT phosphorylation. As such, its degradation in the face of high glucose, also contributes, through increased sensitivity to apop tosis and heightened angiogenesis, to diabetic retinopathy. This is the first demonstration that A20 may affect VEGF signaling downstream and upstream of VEGF signaling. Restoring adequate levels of the \"atheroprotective\" and \"anti-angiogenesis\" protein A20, in the face of high glucose/hyperglycemia, should protect from the macro and microvascular complications of diabetes. Since Dr. Kaczmarek joined our group, an additional line of investigation was initiated in the laboratory, mainly focusing on the induction of A20 and other protective genes such as A1 by extracellular nucleotides. Extracellular nucleotides play a significant biological role in many tissues and cell types, as signaling molecules that regulate cellular function under both normal and pathophysiological conditions. They are released in tissue fluids and plasma in response to differe nt cellular stimuli and as result of tissue damage and cell death. Extracellular nucleotides exert their biological action via specific purinergic P2 receptors that are classified into two main groups: P2X, ligand-gated ion channels and P2Y, G protein-coupled receptors. Si D K k j i dFig. 1 (left) A20 restores cellular energy in hepatocytes by upregulating PPAR/g302. Relevant to our line of research, Dr. Kaczmarek has shown that P2 receptor signaling upregulates expression of the two anti-apoptotic \"cytoprotective\" genes, A20 and A1 in human endothelial addition, extracellular nucleotides activate endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), even under high glucose levels. These two observations indicate tha t P2 receptors may be targets for management of EC dysfunction, and possibly diabetic complications. Treatment with extracellular nucleotides may thus represent an alternative therapeutic avenue to increase expression of A20 that could be much easier to implement than gene therapy. C LINICAL VASCULAR SURGERY RESEARCH The clinical research component of the Vascular Division continues to be very vibrant. A major change is the overall increase in the number of cases done by the division and the percentage of cases that are now performed with endovascular techniques. To account for that change we updated our encounter forms to retrieve meaningful data specific to those new techniques. This will allow us to be on the forefront of divisions in regards to understanding our own outcomes as well as being able to publish them and to provide patients as well as insurers with that information. Another significant addition was the hiring of Maya Lele as our Research Coordinator. Jennifer Lambert received her Nurse Practitioner's License and has stayed in the Division, but has stepped down as our Research Coordinator. Allen Hamdan VASCULAR SURGERY OUTCOMES RESEARCH The Division of Vascular Surgery also has an active interest in outcomes research on a national level as well as at the local level here at BIDMC. Our main interest is to compare outcomes after open surgery and endovascular surgery for a variety of vascular diseases. We have access to national data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (a 20% sample of all non-federal hospital admissions). This administrative database allows us to evaluate in-hospital outcomes after open vascular surgical or endovascular procedures in large cohorts of patients, representative of the entire nation, as well as allowing estimates of national rates of various vascular interventions (open and endovascular) over time. We also have our own database in the Division with all vascular procedures captured prospectively. This allows detailed evaluation of co-morbidities and various outcomes with physician chart review and angiographic review. Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2007 Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery 188 Beth Israel Deaoncess Medical Center This will allow appropriate risk adjustment for various factors associated with choice of a given treatment strategy. Working with Bruce Landon, MD from the School of Health Policy at HMS we have developed collaboration with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and have access to data from all Medicare patients. Through this database we have access not only to in-hospital outcomes, but with access to Part B files we can adjust for pre-existing conditions based on diagnoses made prior to the index admission. We also have unique identifiers allowing us to track long term readmission, reintervention, and survival of patients after open or endovascular treatment. Collaboration with James O'Malley from the School of Health Policy at HMS allows us to perform detailed statistical analyses including propensity score matching of patients undergoing open or endovascular surgery.

Mechanisms of Bypass Graft Failure Intimal hyperplasia (IH) is the pathologic process of vessel wall thickening and lumen narrowing that occurs in blood vessels in response to injury. This process remains the most common cause of delayed bypass graft failure, a consequence of focal gene expression. As graft healing occurs, genes are either up or down-regulated compared to a quiescent arterial or venous wall. Our hypothesis is that altered gene expression results in cellular proliferation, migration, and extracellular matrix production by smooth muscle cells leading to IH. Our continued investigation is to assess gene expression at different time points (24 hours to 60 days) after surgical implantation of either ePTFE prosthetic grafts or reversed cephalic vein grafts in a canine vascular bypass model. To date, we have completed all surgical implantations an d have collected specimens for all time intervals (n=3 per time interval). Once specimens are harvested, frozen sections of either normal common carotid artery as compared to the distal anastomosis in the case of prosthetic grafts or unaltered cephalic vein as compared to the mid-portion of the vein graft are generated for laser capture microdissection (LCM). In the case of prosthetic grafts, smooth muscle cells from the graft neointima and control arterial wall are dissected out using LCM. In the case of vein grafts, endothelial cells as well as smooth muscle cells are harvested from the graft neointima and control vein wall. RNA was extracted and amplified for Affymetrix microarray analysis. Gene fold-change expression was validated using Q-RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. At present we are evaluating our prosthetic graft microarray results with the assistance of our BIDMC Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2007 Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center 191 core facility Director, Dr. Towia A. Libermann and Biostatistician Manoj Bhasin. Microarray results are performed using the Affymetrix Canine 2.0 Chip. Analysis of these results is performed using MAS5 software. A listing of genes that are greater than 2-fold over- or under-expressed is being generated for each different time period under study (1, 7, 14, 30, and 60 days). For the vein graft, significant work has been performed in perfecting the techniques used to isolate and harvest endothelial cells. Currently, we employ a rapid immunohistochemical stain designed to visually identify endothelial cell proteins. Q-RT-PCR of CD31 expression can be used to validate the purity and homogeneity of captured endothelial samples. We are in the process of harvesting these distinct cell populations. Once performed, RNA can be extracted and amplified from each cell population. Affymetrix gene chip microarray will be run for each sample followed by validation of gene expression using Q-RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. We believe identifying alterations in gene expression, their time courses, cellular localization (immunohistochemistry) and computational analysis will provide a valuable guide to a comprehensive understanding of IH. 2. Prevention of Intimal Hyperplasia in Vein Grafts Intimal hyperplasia in arterialized vein bypass grafts is a significant cause of vein graft stenosis and delayed graft failure. Injury at the time of implantation or as a consequence of transplantation into the high pressure arterial system may contribute to these delayed events. Alterations in gene expression accompany implantation and arterialization injury. These alterations lead to intimal hyperplasia, including transformation of endothelial cells to an inflammatory state and initiating migration and transformation of smooth muscle cells from the contractile to secretory states thus creating the lesion of intimal hyperplasia. It is our hypothesis that silencing of genes upregulated by injury to the vein wall will diminish intimal hyperplasia. Furthermore, gene silencing can be accomplished within the constraints of operating room conditions. We have demonstrated the ability to identify candidate genes associat ed with intimal hyperplasia and our ability to knockdown gene expression with siRNA. Using LCM we have separated genetic events in the endothelium from those in smooth muscle. Currently we are applying these technologies to (1) systematically identify silencing targets, (2) to silence target genes in vitro, (3) to silence target genes under surgical conditions, (4) to demonstrate inhibition of intimal hyperplasia in vein grafts in vivo. We are performing studies in both human tissue and canine models as well as in vitro using human smooth muscle cells and human coronary artery endothelial cells. In 2006, the work of Dr. Thomas Monahan characterized the contributions of two novel target genes ident ified by our lab, Cadherin 11 (CDH11) and the myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate phenotypes associated with intimal hyperplasia and identifi ed both as promising targets for therapeutic gene silencing in vein grafts. The first manuscript describing the ability of CDH11 inhibition to reduce pathologic smooth muscle cell phenotypes in vitro was published in The Journal of Vascular Surgery in 2007. The work of Nicholas Andersen focused on translating siRNA technology for use in vascular surgical procedures, including the validation of siRNA technology in vascular cells cultured in vitro to the rapid transfection of human vein segments under operating room conditions. Promising results were obtained on both fronts and a manuscript summarizing our experience with siRNA transfection in human vascular cells in vitro was published in the Journal of the American College of Surgeons. In 2007, Junaid Malek made significant progress towards the goal of using laser capture microdissection to separately characterize gene alterations associated with intimal hyperplasia in the endothelial and smooth muscle layers of implanted vein grafts. This work was presented at multiple meetings and should be published shortly. A second BIDMC general surgery resident, Michelle Martin, also joined our laboratory this past year and will be working to develop new in vivo models to test the ability of MARCKS siRNA to reduce intimal hyperplasia formation in animals. 3. A Nanofiber Biocomposite Small Diameter Graft The specific aim of this study, is to assess blood permeation, graft patency and healing of our novel nanofibrous biocomposite graft (ESDC-rHir-VEGF) using a canine arterial (n = 9) grafts have been synth esized to date using electro spinning methodology as described in the Experimental Designs and Methods Section of the Phase II proposal. During this time period, several parameters such as varying electro spinning time to alter graft wall thickness, crimp versus straight construct, unstretched versus various percentages of stretch, incorporation of rHir/VEGF into the nanofibrous construct, and the effects of graft sterilization via ethylene oxide on biologic activity were examined. Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2007 Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery 192 Beth Israel Deaoncess Medical Center In an effort to establish a better compliance match at the graft/artery anastomosis, electro spinning time was decreased to 30 minutes, in order to determine if wall thickness could be decreased while preserving tensile strength (only grafts electro spun for 20 minutes demonstrated any strength loss as compared to the standard electro spinning time of 40 minutes). 4. Incorporation of rHir/VEGF into the Nanofibrous Construct In order to provide a slow, sustained localized release of rHir and VEGF, we investigated incorporation of the biologically active agents directly into the nanofibers of the graft wall. The advantages are that no binding agent such as collagen would be required. Both rHir and VEGF were directly dissolved in the polymer solution. The synthesis process remained unchanged. 5. Effects of Ethylene Oxide Sterilization on Biologic Activity Biologic activity pre-and post-sterilizati on and graft strength were evaluated. ESDC-rHir-VEGF grafts were synthesized and cut in half. One set was sent for ethylene oxide sterilization (54\u00b0C, 10 lbs pressure, cycle time = 2.2 hours) and the other was left unchanged. rHir release and activity was determined as well as tensile strength of the materials pre/post-sterilization. rHir was released over a 6 day wash period, with thrombin inhibition properties of the wash solution unchanged. Tensile strength was also not adversely affected upon sterilization. Implantation of ESDC-rHir-VEGF and Conventional Dacron (Control) Grafts: After evaluation of the various parameters, nanofibrous grafts with the optimized properties were implanted. We have successfully completed surgical implantations at 7, 14 and 30 days (n =3/time interval), with just one last time interval remaining at 60 days. All Nanof iber Hir-VEGF prosthetic graf ts have been patent, as well as the standard Dacron (control) grafts, however, thrombus deposition on the luminal surface and healing characteristics are different between the two. Grafts explanted at these various times (7,14 and 30 days), were placed in 10% buffered formalin. After tissue fixation, specimens were dehydrated through graded alcohols and xylene. The distal anastomosis of each graft was then embedded in paraffin and later sectioned (3/g459m thickness). Slides were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The 4 Figures, below (1X and 10X), show a cross-section of an ESDC-rHir VEGF graft at 14 days. There is no thrombus deposition; there is a strong cellular infiltration through out the wall of the nanofiber prosthetic graft, supported by a rich network of capillaries. On the luminal surface of the graft there is a cellular lining resembling endothelial cells, CD 31 immunostaining will be performed to confirm cell type. This healing pattern looks very different from that found in other prosthetic grafts. We are now evaluating the mid-portion of these grafts to determine if the healin g pattern and cell types are different. Development of a nanofibrous bioactive small-diameter vascular graft would have a significant impact on small vessel repair and replacement. These grafts could be utilized in peripheral bypass (specifically below-knee) as well as for coronary artery bypass, in which there are over 500,000 bypass grafts implanted annually in the United States. Thus, the potential annual market value for an \"off-the-shelf\" synthetic small-diameter arterial bypass graft could exceed $1.5 billion. Additionally, this type of nanofibrous structure could play a significant role in creating other novel implantable biocompatible devices. Surfaces on these implant s could be designed to create a material to which selected biologically-active proteins could be immobilized in order to localize the beneficial effects directly at the material surface. 6. Development of Infection-Resistant Suture Materials Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2007 Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center 193 Infection remains as one of the major complications associated with utilizing biomaterials. Surgical site infections account for approximately 14-16% of the 2.4-million nosocomial infections in the United States, with these infections resulting in increased patient morbidity and mortality. The inherent bulk properties of various biomaterials, including those that comprise sutures, provide a milieu for initial bacterial adhesion with subsequent biofilm production and growth. Once the pathogen(s) adheres to the biomaterial surface, treatment with antimicrobial agents is ineffective due to limited penetration of the agent through the bacterial biofilm. Thus, development of a novel infection-resistant suture would provide a localized bactericidal environment. In Phase I, Ciprofloxacin (Cipro), Linezolid and Doxycycline were successfully incorporated into nylon, silk and polyester (Dacron) suture materials using textile-dyeing techniques, resulting in infection-resistant suture materials with optimum antim icrobial properties while maintai ning the physical properties of the materials. The goal of this Phase II is to evaluate these novel infection-resistant sutures in vivo using a wound infection model. Our hypothesis is that antibiotic-dyed sutures will release antibiotic in a slow, sustained fashion over a period of time as demonstrated in our Phase I in vitro studies, preventing bacterial infection at the suture surface as well as in the surrounding tissue. Current non-degradable suture materials do not possess these characteristics. Infection-resistance of the novel sutures characterized will be evaluated using a rabbit wound (sub- cutaneous) infection model. This model is based on a suture animal model recently described by others and permits direct comparison of infection-resistance between control and test suture materials, eliminating potential intra-species variability. The animals are anesthetized, placed prone and their backs shaved and scrubbed. A 20g catheter is inserted (two on each side of the spine in a random fashion, under the skin caudally, remaining as superficial as possible. The catheter insertion will proceed in the cranial direction for a distance of approximately 5cm before exiting the skin. The catheter needle is then removed and an antibiotic-dyed 2-0 suture is passed into the catheter unti l it protrudes from the tip. A sterile syringe containing 0.5ml of S. aureus (1 X 107 cfu) is connected to the hub and infused until fluid begins to exit at the opposite end. The catheter is pulled back slightly and sealed with Dermabond\u00ae skin adhesive. The remainder of the syringe content is infused and the catheter removed. Suture is cut flush and sealed with the skin adhesive. The same procedure is performed on the opposite side of the spine with the untreated suture (control). Skin silk sutures are placed as a reference to where subcutaneous suture implants were done. Time periods of 7 and 14 days (n = 4 animals/time period/suture treatment) will be evaluated in order to examine infection-resistance as well as healing of the suture materials. Preliminary histology results at 7 days show that the Cipro-tretaed sutures (Nylon &Plain-PET sutures) have an effective anti bacterial activity when compared to the untreated sutures. Our studies are on going and we plan to continue with our 7 and 14 day subcutaneous suture implants. 7. Development of a Biologically-Active Prosthetic Grafts Surface thrombosis and lack of cell ingrowth lead to prosthetic vascular graft implantation failure. Biological modification of existing materials remains one of the most promising approaches to overcome the problems. Activated protein C (APC) is a potent anticoagulant and the ligand for endothelial cell protein C receptor (EPCR), which is primarily expressed on endothelial cells and on some hematopoietic stem cells. This project sets out to test the feasibility of immobilizing APC to Dacron and to evaluate the biocompatibility of APC Dacron. When modified with the underwent multi-step modification. Surface bound APC has promising physical and functional stability as tested using a static system and a simulated arterial flow system. The APC bonded Dacron surface demonstrated good anti-coagulant activity as indicated by chromogenic assay and clotting assay. Our preliminary studies also indicated that binding of APC sign ificantly increases human coronary artery endothelial cell viability and proliferation when these cells are seeded on Dacron surface. The above study has been presented at the Annual Meeting of the Society for Biomaterial. We have submitted a STTR grant application to the NIH for the fiscal year of 2007. A patent based on the above study is pending. 8. Role of Neuropeptides in Diabetic Foot Ulcerations Abnormal wound healing is a major complication of both type I and type II diabetes and is the most Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2007 Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery 194 Beth Israel Deaoncess Medical Center frequent cause of non-traumatic lower limb amputation. Wound healing requires the orchestrated integration of complex biological and molecular events. Inflammation, proliferation and migration of cells followed by angiogenesis and re-epithelizati on are essential phases of wound healing. Recently, dysregulation of neuropeptides, such as Substance P (SP) and Neuropeptide Y (NPY), secreted from peripheral nerves have been implicated in abnormal wound healing. The link between wound healing and the nervous system is clinically apparent as peripheral neuropathy is reported in 30-50% of diabetic patients and is the most common and sensitive predictor of foot ulceration. Furthermore, molecular studies have shown SP and NPY levels are reduced in diabetic patients. Receptors for SP are found on relevant wound healing cells including monocytes, mast cells, endothelial cells (ECs) and keratinocytes. SP is known to evoke an acute inflammatory response, consistent with the inflammatory phase of wound healing. It also has a proliferative effect on ECs, an important step in angiogenesis. Thus, SP affects numerous phases of wound healing and any dysfunction in the production, release or signaling of SP could impair wound healing. NPY has a similar proliferative effect on ECs, and NPY receptor null mice demonstrate impaired wound healing. Although SP and NPY production and metabolism appear to play a role in diabetic wound heali ng, the exact molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying these complex interactions remain elusive. Our hypothesis is that inadequate levels of neuropeptides such as SP and NPY and/or dysregulation in their signaling pathways lead to abnormal woun d healing in diabetes. In vivo model: Both peripheral vascular disease and peripheral neuropathy are major contributors to diabetic foot ulcers hence we have developed 3 different models that will mimic these 2 processes and thus will help understand the complex pathology underlying non-h ealing ulcers in diabetic patients. The surgeries for the 3 different models are performed in one of the ears of the rabbits whereas the other ear serves as a sham control. Following surger y, skin punch biopsy wounds are made in the rabbit ears and wound healing is monitored. At the end of the study period of 10 days post-surgery, molecular analysis is performed on the wounds. The 3 different rabbit models of diabetic wound healing: A. Ischemic Model: Central and the Rostral arteries in the ear are ligated B. Denervation Model: The Central and the Rostral nerves are severed C. Neuroischemic Model: The central and rostral arteries are ligated and the central and rostral nerves are severed. All the surgeries in the ischemic and neuroischemic wound healing model have been completed. Our findings suggest that compared to control rabbits, dia betic rabbits have a chroni c baseline increase in inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and IL-8 and a decrease in neurop eptides SP and NPY. In the control rabbits sham ears heal faster than ischemic ears. Compared to sham ears, ischemic wounds heal significantly slowly in both diabetic and control rabbits. Sham wounds heal significantly slower in diabetic rabbits compared to controls. Upon injury, compared to control rabbits, diabetic rabbits fail to achieve an acute inflammatory response that probably hinders wound healing in both ischemic and sham ears. This work will be presented at the Wound Healing Society Meeting at San Diego, California and at American Diabetes Association 68th Scientific sessions in San Francisco, California in 2008. In vitro model: Since angiogenesis is an important phase of wound healing, and diabetes is known to impair angiogenesis, the goal of the in vitro studies is to investigate the effects of hyperglycemia on endothelial cells. The in vitro studies are conducted in Human Dermal Microvascular Endothelial Cells (DMVECs). DMVECs were treated with different concentration of glucose in the absence or presence of SP, NPY and inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8. Our data so far suggest that high glucose blunts DMVEC proliferation and angiogenic tube formation where as co-exposure to neuropeptides and inflammatory cytokines ameliorates the inhibitory effects of high glucose. Current studies are being performed using siRNA to further delineate the signaling pathways in the neuropeptide-cytokine axis. Based on these above results, 2 STTR grants were submitted and are under review at the NIH. Control Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2007 Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center 195 VASCULAR IMMUNOBIOLOGY RESEARCH LABORATORY The past year, we have mainly extended our program to studying the impact of A20 upon diabetic vasculopathy and diabetic retinopathy. Our preliminary results resulted in the discovery that diabetes mellitus impairs the expression of atheroprotective genes such as A20. A20 is blunted in diabetic patients due to metabolic disturbances aggravated by genetically determined factors specific to patients with type I DM. This work has set the basis for a follow-up grant (we had received a novel 3 years funding from the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation grant aimed at evaluating the role of A20 upon diabetic retinopathy. The work on the role of A20 in the development of DV was also the subject of a proposal to the JDRF following an invitation from this agency after the approval of a letter of intent. We have also been successful in expanding our work demonstrating the beneficial effect of A20 expression in medial smooth muscle in preventing intimal hyperplasia to studying its impact on already established disease. Our data demonstrate that expression of A20 in neointimal smooth muscle cells induces the regression of established lesions via its unique capacity to sensitize neointimal SMC to apoptosis via a NO dependent mechanism. These provocative and exciting results have been finalized in a manuscript now under revision for publication to FASEB journal. This work was the subject of a proposal to the NIH LRP that was successfully awarded to Virendra Patel last year. In addition, it has served as a basis to 2 grant proposals. Both were successful in securing funding. The first grant received funding from the Roche Organ Transplant Research Foundation for one year. The second grant received funding as an RO1 from the National Institutes of Health. This later work has also been submitted in a proposal to the NIH loan repayment program (LRP) that was successfully awarded to Mark Fisher. We have expanded our research interest in collaboration with Dr. Elzbieta Kaczmarek who joined our laboratory in July of this year. Dr. Kaczmarek, an expert in P2 receptor signaling has recently demonstrated that P2 receptor signaling upregulate expression of A20 and A1 in human endothelial cells (EC). In addition, extracellular nucleotides activate en dothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), even under high glucose levels. These two observations indicate that P2 receptors may be targets for management of EC dysfunction, and possibly diabetic complications. The molecular mechanisms of these purinergic regulations of A20 expression and eNOS activity are under investigation. Two grants to the ADA and the NIH based on this work were submitted and results are pending. We have also expanded our work on the effect of A20 upon liver regeneration and demonstrated that this gene has the unique capacity to promote liver regeneration via decreasing the expression of the cell cycle brake p21waf1. This data has been published in Hepatology. New stimulating data generated, implicating an effect of A20 on the Cyclin Dependent Kinase p21waf1 and PPAR/g302, were solid leads that constituted the basis for the competitive renewal of this grant that is pending review. C LINICAL VASCULAR SURGERY RESEARCH 1.Inflammatory marker trial : This is a prospective trial looking at about 300 patients in concert with the Brigham and Women's Hospital under the direction of Dr. Mike Conte. Patients are prospectively followed who undergo vein bypass grafts. A number of inflammatory markers including C-reactive protein are evaluated pre and post-operative to see if there is any impact on progression of vascular disease. C reactive protein elevation has already been shown to be related to increased perioperative events (presented at the Society of Vascular Surgery national meeting), and has been published in the Journal of Vascular Surgery. We continue to actively enroll patients. 2.CREST Trial: Dr. Schermerhorn is now the site PI for this trial. It is a randomized trial looking at carotid stent vs. carotid endarterectomy. All of the surgeons are eligible to perform carotid endarterectomy in the trial. Dr. Schermerhorn is eligible to perform endarterectomy as well as carotid stenting. He is one of the few surgeons in the country who has this dual nomination. We are actively enrolling patients in this very important trial. Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2007 Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery 196 Beth Israel Deaoncess Medical Center 3. EMPiRe: This is a registry evaluating a novel embolic protection device to allow safer use of carotid stents. It involves creating flow reversal in the carotid artery during treatment which makes it essentially impossible to embolize during the procedure. Dr Schermerhorn is the site PI and the BIDMC is one of the few centers that will have access to this potentially revolutionary device. 4.Insulin Drip Trial : This trial is an institutional randomized study spearheaded by the department of Anesthesia in collaboration with ours. Patients undergoing major vascular procedures are assigned to standard insulin therapy or more extensive insulin drip therapy. This has been shown to prevent perioperative complications after cardiac surgery. We already have seen a trend toward improvement in myocardial ischemia in the extensive insulin drip group 5.Zilver PTX trial: This trial will compare outcomes of drug eluting stents versus angioplasty in the superficial femoral artery (SFA). Restenosis is common after angioplasty of the SFA. This trial will examine the potential benefit of a drug eluting stent in terms of restenosis after SFA interventions. 6.Durability Trial: This trial will compare routine stenting of the SFA with a nitinol stent versus selective angioplasty with selective stenting. This new stent is available in long lengths and has potentially lower fracture rates than prior devices wh ich may enhance freedom from restenosis in the SFA. 7. Sonoma Registry: This carotid stent registry will evaluate the function of the Filterwire and the Nex stent for treatment of carotid stenosis in patients at high risk for endarterectomy. 8. Choice Registry: This carotid stent registry will evaluate the function of two carotid stent / embolic protection filters for patients with carotid high risk for endarterectomy. 9.Sapphire Worldwide: This carotid stent registry will evaluate filter and the Precise stent for carotid stenting in patients at high risk for endarterectomy. 10. TAG 05-02: This post market registry will evaluate long term outcomes after thoracic stent graft treatment of descending thoracic aortic aneurysms. 11. AAA 03-02 This investigational device used to treat abdominal aortic aneurysms with large proximal necks will be evaluated to compare short and long term outcomes with historical control data with open surgical repair. VASCULAR SURGERY OUTCOMES RESEARCH Currently, there are two Harvard-Longwood Research in Vascular Surgery (T-32) fellows working on Outcomes Research; Ami Jhaveri MD and Kristina Giles, MD. With access to the Medicare database, we have analyzed outcomes after Open and Endovascular repair of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms in the Medicare population. Our work has confirmed the perioperative benefit seen in recent randomized trials and demonstrated that these results nay be generalized to the entire Medicare population. Additionally, we are the first to demonstrate that laparotomy related problems such as bowel obstruction or abdominal wall hernia require frequent intervention after open surgery, matching the need for aneurysm related reintervention after endovascular repair. This is to be published in the Jan 31, 2008 New England Journal of Medicine and was presented at the 2007 annual meeting of the New England Society for Vascular Surgery. We will also be analyzing predictors of perioperative and late moratlity after open and endovascular aneurysm repair, morbidity and mortality associated with reinterventions after aneurysm repair, volume outcome relationships over time as endovascular repair is dispersed across the country, and aneurysm related mortality after introduction of endovascular repair - all using the Medicare database. Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), a 20% sample of all non-federal hospital admissions, we are evaluating the overall aneurysm related mortality (elective repair, plus rupture repair, plus rupture death without repair) over time and have noted a decrease in overall aneurysm related mortality after introduction of endovasulcar repair with fewer ruptures and more elective repairs. Kristina Giles has submitted an abstract to the annual meeting of the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) and will submit a manuscript to the Journal of Vascular Surgery (JVS). Kristina has also used the NIS database to demonstrate a lower operative mortality with endovascular repair of ruptured aortic aneurysms compared to open repair. She has also demons trated a volume-outcome effect in that higher volume hospitals have lower mortality with ruptured AAA repair. This too was submitted to the SVS annual meeting and will be Department of Surgery Annual Research Report 2007 Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center 197 submitted to JVS. Ami Jhaveri has used the NIS database to compare in-hospital mortality and amputation rates after lower extremity bypass or angioplasty stratified by indication for intervention (claudication, rest pain, ulcer, or gangrene). She has also identified trends of increasing utilization of angioplasty compared to bypass over time. This was also submitted to the SVS and will be submitted to JVS. We have analyzed the national outcomes with open repair of descending thoracic aortic aneurysms in the era prior to endovascular stentgrafting to serve as a benchmark comparison for future reports with stentgrafting. I will present this data at the annual meeting of the Society for Clinical Vascular Surgery and submit a manuscript to JVS. We are continuing to update our own database of a ll vascular procedures with detailed prospective data collection of all common procedures. We have analyzed our own outcomes at BIDMC reporting the largest US series of infrapopliteal angioplasty for critical limb ischemia presented by Seth Blattman at the New England Society for Vascular Surgery (NESVS) and submitted by Kristina Giles for publication in JVS. Hector Simosa has presented our data with the largest series worldwide of lower extremity vein graft angioplasty, presented at NESVS and submitted to JVS. I have submitted a manuscript detailing our series of aortic arch debranching and stentgrafting procedures for publication in the JVS. We participate in the Society of Vascular Surgery's national registry of carotid stenting and endarterectomy. I am co-authoring a submission by the SVS outcomes committee demonstrating outcomes after carotid stenting and endarterectomy using the SVS registry, submitted for presentation at the SVS meeting with a manuscript for JVS.

The training program addresses the absence of adequate research training for vascular surgeons as it applies to specific areas of clinical disease. This program is in its fourteenth year. Trainees pursue a program of research activity supplemented with course work in research design, ethics, statistics and evaluation of published research in the areas of molecular and cell biology, biomechanics, coagulation and thrombosis and angiogenesis. Clinically relevant atherogenesis, intimal hyperplasia, prosthetic/host interactions and thrombosis will be the main focus of these research projects. Trainees carry out their research projects under the guidance of a faculty advisor selected from 20 renowned vascular researchers based at four Harvard Medical School hospitals (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Brigham and Women's, Children's Hospital (Boston) and Joslin Diabetes Institute) and the Massachusetts Insti tute of Technology. Upon completion of the program, trainees are capable of independent research and possess the scientific and research background needed to obtain peer-reviewed grants. Selection of trainees is based on candidate's demonstrated ability and career choice of academic practice. Applicants are resident physicians who have completed either 2/3 years of clinical post-doctoral experience (surgical residency) or 5 years of clinical training (i.e. are board eligible). Only those applicants with career goals in academic surgery, with a keen interest in basic research in vascular surgery are compatible. Trainees in the program are not involved in any clinical activities unless research related.

Allen Hamdan Frank Pomposelli Marc Schermerhorn We taught fellows and surgical residents how to do clinical research, present at meetings, and write abstracts and papers. This year we worked with Dr. Sim osa, who presented work concerning vein graft angioplasty at the New England Society for Vascular Surgery annual meeting. The work was finished, manuscript prepared, and was recently accepted for publication in the Journal of Vascular Surgery. We also mentored Dr. Jeff Kalish.
