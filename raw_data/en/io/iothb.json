Background a.Upda tes The College was advised on February 28, 2022 that the Government of Ontario would be taking steps to wind down the College of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Acupuncturists of Ontario. On March 10, 2022, following a vote in the legislature, the Ontario government amended Bill 88, to remove Schedule 5 from the bill . The profession of traditional Chinese medicine will remain a regulated health profession in Ontario. There will be no change to C ollege's regulatory functions going forward. No formal letter from the Minister's office has been receive d by the College at the time of the meeting package being sent out; however, the Ministry confirmed that the Bill 88 has been amended and the amended bill is posted publicly on the Ontario Legislature website. Furthermore, the College received an email from the Ministry confirming that the Government is no longer pursuing Schedule 5, and that no changes will be made to the controlled acts. b.Pan-C anadian and Chinese Examinations In addition to the removal of Schedule 5 from Bill 88, the government has directed the Ministry of Health to work with the College to offer a Chinese language entry to practice examination for registration with the College. c.Pet ition re The Federation of Ontario Traditional Chinese Medicine Association (FOTCMA) Members A petition addresse d to the Legislative Assembl y of Ontario requested that it bring to light the conflict of interest and failure of the CTCMPAO to fulfill t heir fiduciary d uties to their members due to the infiltration of known members of FOTCMA. The College has not received a copy of the petition and the names of these individuals have not been i dentified. d.Next S teps College staff will continue to follow up with the Ministry regarding public appointments and other resources /support needed for this new direction. The College will need a constituted Council to begin work on the Chinese examination immediately to meet the deadline put forward by the Ministry.

Public Interest Rationale A doctor class will help ensure that patients have access to safe and higher quality of TCM health care from qualified practitioners that meet an experienced level of competencies and standards. Background At the November 1, 2021 open meeting of the Executive Committee, the Executive Committee along with the support of Council members decided it was vital to resume the work o f the Dr. Title Project. The Executive Committee appointed five Council members (Xianmin Yu, Joanne Pritchard -Sobhani, Deborah Sinnatamby, Feng Li Huang, Ming Cha ) to the Dr. Title Working Group to begin Phase 2 of the project and directed staff to publish a call for interest for more Working Group members. At the February 24, 2022 Executive Committee meeting, the Executive Committee reviewed 26 candidate applicat ions (15 from professional members, 5 from members of the public, 6 from the 2020 call for interest) received from the call for interest. The following five candidates are now being recommended to Council for feedback. Members of the Public Bonnie Oakes Charron Margaret Cheung Martial Moreau Professional Members Michael Chen (Zhen Hao Chen) The Terms of Reference (ToR) states that \"The Working Group shall be appointed by Council and will consist of a minimum of six and a maximum of 10 members of Council. A priority of the Working Group will be to ensure that there is a balanced representation of both professional and public members of the Council.\" Clearly, the current working group composition does not meet the requirements of the To R. Recruiting non-Council public members will benefit the working group by providing much needed public input and may meet the requirements in an alternative way. Meeting Date: March 21 , 202 2 Subject : Dr. Title Working Group Reported By: Ann Zeng Action: Discussion, Motion EXECUTIVE Staff have conducted research on how other regulatory health colleges compensate non-Council members of the public on their committees. The College of Midwives, College of Nurses, and College of Pharmacists compensate their non -Council members of the public the same rate as professional members . It is recommended that the same approach be adopted for non -Coun cil members of the public on the Dr. Title Working Group. Amended Terms of Reference When Council appoints members to the Dr. Title Work ing Group, the continuity of knowledge should also be taken into consideration. Next Steps 1) To appoint up to a maximum of five more members to the Dr. Title Working Group. 2) To approve the amended Terms of Reference as amended.

Public Interest Rational e The CPMF has been implemented by the Ministry of Health to ensure colleges are regulating in the public interest according to Ministry standards. The College will be required to make changes to meet these standards. Background College staff have two updates for the Executive Committee regarding the CPMF at this time . a.Draft 2021 Report Attached b elow is a first d raft o f the C ollege's 2021 CPMF re port , which is d ue on M arch 31, 2022. A s this is an early draft, staff ask that Committee members provide their feedback on the content of the report. Of th e requirements that were not met in the previous CPMF report, the College is ab le to demonstrate that progress has been made towards meeting our expectations. However, some new requirements have been added to this years CPMF that will require work from the College. Most notably, the Ministry has put an emphasis on equity, diversity, and inclusion in this year's report. The College will need to work towards adding an equity impact assessment to our decision-making processes in the next year. Colleg e staff is working to provide Council members a more finalized draft of the report prior to the March 21, 2022 meeting. b.Stra tegic Plan As previously presented to the Committee, a large part of the CPMF relates to Colleges' strategic plans and becoming more transparent with our progress towards them. The strategic plan of this College is currently expired, and the development of a new one has been put on hold due to the lack of public voice on Council. It is recommended that this be a top priority of Council once it becomes constituted in the future. College has prepared an RFP for a consultan t to facilitate the new strategic plan to remain prepared. The College is able to begin the process of developing a new strategic plan as soon as we have a constituted Council. c.HR Po licy Manual Update The College on a regular basis engages its legal counsel to review and update the College Human Resources Policy Manual to ensure the College is in accordance with the Employment Standards Act, 2000. These \"standards\" are the minimum requirements to descri be the rights and responsibilities of employees and employers in Ontario. Meeting Date: March 21, 2022 Issue: College Performance Measurement Framework Reported By: Ann Zeng and Sean Cassman Action: Information and Discussion EXECUTIVE Company policies about vacation, sick days, discrimination, etc. are described in the HR Policy Manual. Also, company culture, values, expectations as well rights, and obligations related to employment. Our legal counsel was tasked to review the HR manual in its entirety. Below are some of the sections that were updated. Remote Work or COVID Policy -Suggestion: two distinct policies since the College may allow employees to work remotely after the pandemic.

Each College will report on seven Domains with the support of six components, as illustrated in Table 1. Table 1: CPMF Measurement Domains and Components 1 Measurement domains Critical attributes of an excellent health regulator in Ontario that should be measured for the purpose of the CPMF. 2 Standards Performance -based activities that a College is expected to achieve and against which a College will be measured. 3 Measures More specific requirements to demonstrate and enable the assessment of how a College achieves a Standard. 4 Evidence Decisions, activities, processes, or the quantifiable results that are being used to demonstrate and assess a College's achievement of a standard. 5 Context measures Statistical data Colleges report that will provide helpful context about a College's performance related to a standard. 6 Planned improvement actions Initiatives a College commits to implement over the next reporting period to improve its performance on oneor more standards, where appropriate. DRAFT5 | PageCPMF Model The seven measurement domains shown in Figure 1 are the critical attributes that contribute to a College effectively serving and protecting the public interest. They relate to key statutory functions and organizational aspects that enable a College to carry out its functions well. The seven domains are interdependent and together lead to the outcomes that a College is expected to achieve as an excellent regulator. Figure 1: CPMF Mo del for M easuring Regulatory Excellence 3 System Partner Extent to which a College works with other Colleges/ system partners, as appropriate, to help execute its mandate effectively, efficiently and/or coordinated manner to ensure it responds to changing public expectation. 5 Regulatory Policies The College's policies, standards of practice, and practice guidelines are based on the best available evidence, reflect current best practices, are aligned with changing publications and where appropriate aligned with other Colleges. 6 Suitability to Practice College efforts to ensure that only those individuals who are qualified, skilled and competent are registered, and only those registrants who remain competent, safe and ethical continue to practice the profession. 4 Information Management College efforts to ensure its confidential information is retained securely and used appropriately in administering regulatory activities, legislative duties and objects. 2 Resources The College's ability to have the financial and human resour ces to meet its statutory objects and regulatory mandate, now and in the future Organizational Focus Applicant/ Registrant Focus Results & Improvement Registrant Focus 1 Governance College efforts to ensure Council and Committees have therequired knowledge and skills to warrant good governance.

DRAFT7 | PageThe CPMF Re porting Tool The second iteration of the CPMF Reporting Tool (along with the companion Technical Specifications for Quantitative CPMF Measures document) will continue to provide comprehensive and consistent information to the public, the ministry and other stakeholders by each of Ontario's health regulatory Colleges (Colleges). In providing this information each College will: 1.meet with th e ministry to discuss the system partner domain and their progress on improvement commitments identified in the 2 020 CPMF Report ; 2.complete the self -assessment ; 3.post the completed CPMF Report on its website; and 4.submit the CPMF Report to the ministry. The purpose of the first and second iterations of the CPMF is to provide the public, the ministry and other stakeholders with baseline information respecting a College's activities and processes regarding best practices of regulatory excellence and, where relevant, the College's performance improvement commitments. At this time, the ministry will not assess whether a College meets or does not meet the Standards. The information reported through the completed CPMF Reporting Tools may help to identify areas of improvement that warrant closer attention and potential follow-up. Furthermore, the reported results will help to lay a foundation upon which expectations and benchmarks for regulatory excellence can be refined and improved. Finally, the results of the first and second iterations may stimulate discussions about regulatory excellence and performance improvement among Council members and staff within a College, as well as between Colleges, the public, the ministry, college re gistrants/members, and other stakeholders. Additionally, in 2021 the ministry developed a Summary Report highlighting key findings regarding the commendable practices Colleges already have in place, collective strengths, areas for improvement and the various commitments Colleges have made to i mprove their performance in s erving and protecting the public as per their 2020 CPMF Reports. The focus of the Summary Report is on the performance of the regulatory system (as opposed to the performance of each individual College) and on areas where opportunities exist for colleges to learn from each other. The ministry's Summary Report is available: In English: health.gov.on.ca/en/pro/programs/hwrob/regulated_professions.aspx, and In French: health.gov.on.ca/fr/pro/programs/hwrob/regulated_professions.aspx DRAFT8 | PageAs this will be the second time that Colleges will be report ing on their performance against the CPMF standards, the Colleges will be asked to report on: Improvements a College committed to undertake in the previous CPMF Report ; Changes in comparison to baseline reporting from the 2020 CPMF Report ; and Changes resulting from new or refined standards, measures, and evidence.1 Completing the CPMF Reporting Tool While the CPMF Reporting Tool seeks to clarify the information requested, it is not intended to direct College activities and processes or restrict the way a College fulfills its fiduciary duties. Where a term or concept is not explicitly defined in the CPMF Reporting Tool , the ministry relies on individual Colleges, as subject matter experts, to de termine how a term should be appropriately interpreted given the uniqueness of the profession each College oversees. In the spir it of continuous improvement, if the College plans to improve its activities or processes related to the respective Measure or Evidence, it is encouraged to highlight these planned improvement activities. What has changed in 2021? Based on fee dback from the Colleges, the ministry made improvements to the current CPMF Reporting Tool, making it easier to complete. In Part 1 - Th ese changes include drop-d own menus, bookmarks to Measures, and additional information for clarification. Where a question remained unchanged from the 2020 CPMF reporting tool and a College fully met the S tandard or Evidence, a College may opt to respond with ' Meets Standard' to illustrate that the current response is consistent with last year's response for the same Evidence. However, i f there were changes between 2020 and 2021, the College i s required to provide this updated information, including supporting information (i.e. provision of relevant li nks). Please note that this option is l imited to only certain Evidence and is not available for all Evidence. Colleges will be asked to provide information in the right-hand column of each table indicating the degree to which they fulfill the \"required Evidence\" set out in Column Two. In Part 2 - Colleges are requested to refer to the Technical Specifications Document for d etailed guidance on how to complete the se ction on Context Measures. Additionally, the ministry has also applied a drop-down menu where appropriate and has hyperlinked the definitions to a gl ossary of terms for easier navigation. 1 Informed by the results from the first reporting iteration, the standards, measures, and evidence were evaluated by a second CPMF Working Group and where appropriate were further refined for the second reporting cycle. Additionally, Colleges will also be asked to report on Measures where it was identified that further informa tion is required to establish baseline information relevant to the intent of the requested Evidence.

Type and distribution of QA/QI activities and assessments used in CY 2021* What does this information tell us? Quality assurance (QA) and Quality Improvement (QI) are critical components in ensuring that professionals provide care that is safe, effective, patient centred and ethical. I n addition, health care professionals face a number of ongoing changes that might impact how they practice (e.g. changing roles and responsibilities, changing public expectations, legislative changes). The information provided here illustrates the diversity of QA activities the College undertook in assessing the competency of its registrants and the QA and QI activities its registrants undertook to maintain competency in CY 2021. The diversity of QA/QI activities and assessments is reflective of a C ollege's risk -based approach in executing its QA program, whereby the frequency of assessment and activities to maintain competency are informed by the risk of a registrant not acting competently. Details of how the College determined the appropriateness o f its assessment component of its QA program are described or referenced by the College in Measure 13 .1(a) of Standard 11.

DRAFT Page 10 of 10 Strategic Planning Request for Proposal CTCMPAO 55 Commerce Valley Drive West, Suite 705 I Thornhill, Ontario I 2018 -2021 Strategic Plan DRAFTEXECUTIVE Issue The Ministry has released their proposals for governance reform, and are asking for college input on them . Public Interest Rational e There has long been discussion on the effectiveness of the current college governance structure and its ability to uphold the public interest. The Ministry is making moves to better enable colleges to fulfill their mandates through governance reforms . Background College staff have previously reported that the Ministry intends to make changes to college governance practices, and that we should expect a consultation on this. On January 26, 2022, the Min istry sent the considered governance reforms to colleges that include a number of proposals. They include: Cor e Governance Considerations 1.Size of Councils between 10 -12 2.Separate Councils and Committees 3.Selection Committee for professional members of Council and Committees 4.Professional members selected by Council 5.Consistency in expectations regarding term-limits and eligibility to sit on Council for professionalmembers of Council 6.No executive committee of Council Hou se Keeping 1.Outdated, unused titles are no longer protected 2.Outdated provisions in profession specific acts are removed 3.Terminology updates Mod ernization 1.Colleges subject to French Language Services Act 2.Colleges subject to the jurisdiction of the Auditor General 3.Options for the review of complaints and discipline decision making process Reduc ing Barriers to Registration 1.Removal of Canadian experience requirements for internationally trained applicants 2.Time limits for registration decisions 3.Standardized requirements for demonstrating language proficiency 4.Expediting registration in emergencies Int egrating Oversight Systems and New Professions Meeting Date: March 21, 2022 Issue: Governance Reform Consultation Reported By: Ann Zeng and Sean Cassman Action: Information and Discussion EXECUTIVE 1.Establishing the Authority and regulation of personal support workers College s are asked a series of questions for each of these proposals, indicating this is a relatively focused consultation. Attached below is the consultation deck and the College's draft response. The propo sals outlined in the consultation deck would lead to significant change to the College's governance. Notably, professional members would not be selected by election, Council members would not be able to sit on Committees, and the size of Council would shrink and have equal number of professional members and public members (e.g. 5 professional members and 5 public members or 6 professional members and 6 public members). Aside from governance reform, the consultation includes a number of additional proposals that would affect the College. The core gov ernance considerations and house keeping items are in line with other go vernance modernization initiatives seen in other jurisdictions, and is in line with what was suggested to the Ministry in the initial consultation conducted in 2021. Our response to these proposals is based on previous discussion from Council members, legal advice received on governance, our governance review, the numerous governance reviews taken place in recent years, and staff review of their impact on the College. The College's response is generally supportive of these initiatives. However, the other three considerations l ack information, and i n the opinion of staff, require more consultation once more details can be shared. Without additional information, we are not able to accurately assess how they will impact the College. Our response to the Ministry reflects this and has been reviewed and approved by the Executive Committee. Next Steps While no timeline for these reforms have been given, Council should consider to begin preparing to adopt these, or similar, reforms. Staff will continue to monitor this work carefully and keep Council apprised of any updates.

I would like to thank the Colleges for their leadership and continued contributions to the ongoing work on college governance reform. The input the ministry received from colleges this past June was instrumental in moving this work forward. At this time, the ministry is seeking health regulatory colleges' insight and feedback on reforms that the ministry is considering for government approval. Attached to this letter is a briefing deck that provides an overview of the reforms under consideration and some guiding questions for some of the areas on which we are seeking your input. The ministry will be scheduling time to address any questions you may have about the proposals and would like to focus on some key areas of particular interest. We would request that you submit any written feedback you may have on the proposed reforms by February 23, 2022 . The ministry looks forward to our continued partnership as we embark on improving and strengthening the oversight system for health professions in Ontario. Sincerely, Sean Court Assistant Deputy Minister Encl. c. Allison Henry, DirectorFebruary 23, 2022 SENT VIA EMAIL Dear ADM Sean Court , Re: Response to Ministry of Health Consultation - Governance Reform and Regulatory Modernization On behalf of the College of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Acupuncturists of Ontario (CTCMPAO) , I am submitting our response to the January 26, 2022 governance reform consultation deck. This comes supplemental to the letter submitted by HPRO on behalf of all health regulatory colleges. This submission has been reviewed and approved by our Executive Committee, who have expressed their support. We would like to extend our appreciation for the Ministry of Health's (MOH or Ministry) ongoing efforts and focus on the importance of governance reform and modernization of Ontario 's regulatory health colleges. We welcome the opportunity to provide feedback on the Ministry 's proposals. In principle, CTCMPAO supports the ministry's efforts to undertake regulatory and governance reform. We believe there is an important need to update many aspects of the RHPA framework to ensure that regulatory health colleges are able to better fulfill their legislative mandate to regulate health professions and protect the public interest. We are pleased to see the proposals set out in the core governance considerations and housekeeping sections. We believe these changes will bring Ontario in line with best practices that have been emerging in other jurisdictions. Taken together, the proposals included in the ministry's consultation document represent a major transformation of the regulatory and legislative approach of regulating health professionals in Ontario, while maintaining the RHPA framework. However, we are learning of many of these specific reforms and modernization proposals for the first time, particularly in the sections not related to governance, which propose adding several levels of external oversight. We are not able to provide complete review and final comment on these specific proposals, and ask that you conduct additional consultation once more information can be shared. As we note, many of the suggestions would require a duplication of work, and have far-reaching implications on the day-t o-day operations of ours and other regulatory colleges, as well as major implications on our registrants and potential registrants. We would also ask that the Ministry provide more information on how CPMF requirements may change in light of these reforms. CTCMPAO is a relatively new College, and has made significant progress in a short amount of time to begin regulating this profession. We look forward to continuing this work in the changing regulatory landscape, and making CTCMPAO aligned with best practices in regulation. However, we would like to reiterate the specific challenges we are facing due to a lack of public members, and how these reforms may affect us if we are not provided with sufficient appointees. As you are aware, CTCMPAO has been operating without a constituted Council since November 26, 2019 due to an insufficient number of public members. While we thank the Ministry for assistance in urgently appointing two new members on February 18, 2022, the College is still in deficit of public members (we will be short two appoi ntees as of February 28, 2022) . In lieu of a constituted Council, the College 's Executive Committee has been acting for over two years on behalf of the Council to make urgent decisions. However, these decisions will require ratification by a fully -constituted Council once the Minister of Health appoints new public members , or risk losing effect. Should the Ministry proce ed with its proposed governance reforms, specifically the elimination of Executive Committees and requirements for an equal proportion of professional and public members, CTCMPAO would be unable to fulfill its governance functions without an immediate infusion of Ministry -appointed public members, or some other solution from the Ministry that allows us to function. We will need significant support from the Ministry in the form of transition provisions, including sufficient time for colleges to be in a position to adopt all of the changes. In addi tion, to avoid this issue in the future, we recommend that college councils be able to continue to act even when they are not properly constituted. We have enclosed a document providing an initial overview of our feedback, questions, additional information required, and concerns with the proposed reforms shared in the consultation document. We strongly encourage the Ministry to continue its engagement with Ontario 's regulatory health colleges to address these considerations to ensure that this governance reform and regulatory modernization effort succeeds in our shared objective of enhancing college governance and better protecting the public. We look forward to continuing to work together with the Ministry as you proceed on this important work, and welcome the opportunity for fulsome consultation, including additional information and details so we can further provide informed comments on these major reform proposals. Sincerely, Ann Zeng Registrar and CEO Cc: Allison Henry , Director, Health Workforce Regulatory Oversight Branch , MOH Stephen Cheng , Manager, Strategic Regulatory Policy Unit, MOH Council members of CTCMPAO Encl: CTCMPAO 's Response to the Governance Reform and Regulation Modernization Consultation EXECUTIVE Issue The creation of a telepractice guideline : to help members of the College understand the complexities of telepractice ; and to help members determine if telepractice is an appropriate approach in their practice. The guideli ne will highlight the key standards and regulations that apply to telepractice. Public Interest Rationale With a changing work and social environment, alternative methods to in -person service have become important considerations in providing healthcare. Telepractice is one of the methods that has grown in use in recent years. The goal of the telepractice Guide line is to help practitioners understand their responsibilities when providing care using telecommunication technologies. This is to ensure that practitioners engaged in telepractice comply with all existing practice requirements and provide safe, effectiv e, and ethical care to patients. Backgroun d On November 26, 2021, the Telepractice Guideline consultation was sent for general stakeholder feedback. The survey received 86 total respondents, and is now closed. The full results are attached below . This is the first time the College engaged the Citizen Advisory Group (CAG) in an attempt to increase public feedback. The College received 2 responses from the public, which is more than we would typically get. In the future, if we wish for more public engagement , the CAG offers a paid service where we can guarantee a minimum number of public respondents. In general, there were no major disagreements or confusion with any section. We did receive specific feedback suggesting that more education be done on the topic , such as webinars. There were also a few comments looking for more information on confidentiality and security. One respondent suggested that members would benefit using a multifactorial identification before discussion confidential information. The College may want to consider addressing this issue in the future. The Quality Assurance Committee has reviewed the survey results and approved the guideline without any revisions. It is now being brought for Council review. Next Steps Council vote on approval of the guideline. Encl: Telepractice Guideline, Survey Results Meeting Date: March 21, 2022 Issue: Telepractice Guideline Reported By: Sean Cassman Action: For Decision The College would like to thank the members of the Quality Assurance Committee for their ongoing guidance and for providing the necessary vision for the development of this guideline DRAFT Telepractice Guid eline Version 7.0 October 2021 1. Introduction With a changing work and social environment, alternative methods to in -person service have become important considerations in providing healthcare. Telepractice is one of the methods that has grown in use in recent years. In th e Spring of 2020, the College of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Acupuncturists of Ontario (CTCMPAO) developed a position statement on telepractice. The College developed the position statement as a temporary measure to provide guidance on telepractice as an alternati ve to in -person service during the COVID -19 pandemic. However, as technology evolves and is increasingly integrated into the provision of healthcare services, it is expected that telepractice will become a more prominent model of care. Building on the June 1, 2020 position statement, this guideline is designed to provide a more comprehensive overview that will help practitioners understand their responsibilities when providing care using telecommunication technologies. Tele practice (also called virtual practice) can be defined as the use of telecommunications technology to deliver healthcare services without direct contact between the practitioner and the patient. While technology continues to change, some examples of technology used in telepractice include telephone, email and video conferencing. It i s important to note that this guideline cannot address all situations that may arise with the use of telepractice. Members engaging in telepractice are expected to stay informed on relevant changes to regul ations, standards, and policies and to use their knowledge, skill and judgment to ensure they comply with the expectations of the College. For t he purposes of this guideline, members of CTCMPAO will be referred to as \"practitioners.\" Key points Practitioners engaged in telepractice are accountable for the care they provide totheir patients. They must use their professional judgement to assess on a case -by- case basis if the use of telepractice is in the patient's best interest. Practitioners engaged in telepractice must comply with all existing practicerequirements, including the profession's scope of practice, the standards ofpractice, and any relevant regulations. Practitioners who engage in telepractice must ensure they have the competencies (knowledge, skills, and judgment) to provide safe and effective virtual care to their patients.2 2. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Telepractice The Traditional Chinese Medicine Act, 2006 , defines the scope of traditional Chinese medicine as the assessment of body system disorders through traditional Chinese medicine techniques and treatment using traditional Chinese medicine therapies to promote, maintain or restore health. In the context of traditional Chinese medicine, t he primary benefit of telepractice is ensuring the continuity of care and accessibility. Providing virtual care can improve accessibility when, for example, physical contact is discouraged due to a health pandemic, there is a shortage of practitioners in a geographical region, or when patients have transportation or mobility issues. However, it should be noted, teleprac tice has its limitations. For example, TCM practitioners and acupuncturists rely on several diagnostic methods to conduct patient assessments. This includes physically assessing patients by palpitation or pulse examination. In the case of telepractice, these physical assessment methods are not feasible. In addition, telepractice limits the number of modalities used in traditional Chinese medicine; these include, for example, acupuncture, cupping, gua sha, and tui na. Taking into consideration both the limitations and benefits of telepractice, practitioners must use their professional judgement to determine on a case-by -case basis: If telepractice is appropriate and in the best interest of the patient? If the virtual examination is sufficient to formulate a TCM diagnosis and treatment plan? Or if other diagnostic methods are more appropriate for the particular patient? If treatments available through telepractice are the best options for the patient's co ndition? Practitioners must also consider if they have the skills and competencies required to treat patients remotely. For example, do they have the communication skills to obtain the necessary information through questioning? Further, do they have the n ecessary technological equipment to effectively provide TCM care via telepractice? If a practitioner determines that virtual care is appropriate for a particular patient, they will need to ensure that there is a plan in place to deal with unforeseen and adverse events such as medical emergencies or technological /connection problems. The following list includes examples of TCM services that may be provided via telepractice: Initial assessment and monitoring - in addition to a review of the patient's medical history, diet, lifestyle and habits a practitioner, may use the TCM diagnostic technique of inquiry and observation to collect information to determine a TCM diagnosis . Home-based modalities - for example, in some cases, it may be appropriate to guide the patient to perform acupressure or practice therapeutic exercises such as tai ji or qi gong. Herbal medicine - if the practitioner is able to collect the required information to determine a TCM diagnosis , a herbal prescription can be prescribed to proceed with an herbal treatment of the patient. Dietary therapy and lifestyle advice - similarly, when appropriate, practitioners may provide dietary and lifestyle advice remotely. 3 NOTE: Telepractice is not acceptable in the following two scenarios: Clinical Experience Requirement - Applicants for registration are required to complete a program of clinical experience in the profession, which involves specified hours of direct patient conta ct. It is the College's position that all supervised clinical training must be provided in person. The clinical experience requirement cannot be satisfied through telepractice. Supervised Practice Requirements - Some members of the College may be required to practice under supervision. It is the College's position that the supervisor and the practitioner being supervised are, at all times, physically present at the treatment location. The supervised practice requirement cannot be satisfied through teleprac tice. 3. Jurisdictional Considerations and Registration Requirements The jurisdiction for the traditional Chinese medicine practice is dependant on a variety of factors, including the location of the patient and the practitioner . A practitioner must be registered with CTCMPAO to preform any of the controlled acts 1authorized to the profession or us e the protected titles in Ontario. Although acupuncture cannot be provided via telepractice, communicating a TCM diagnosis can occur. Th erefore, a practitioner must be registered in Ontario to communicate a TCM diagnosis to a patient in Ontario. For example, if a practitioner based in British Columbia were to communicate a TCM diagnosis to a patient in Ontario, they would have to be registered with CTCMPAO. CTCMPAO members treating patients residing outside of Ontario must comply with the registration/licensing requirements in Ontario and the jurisdiction where the telepractice service will be provided. For example, if a CTCMPAO member were to provide remote care to a patient in British Columbia, the practitioner would be expected to abide by the regulations and standards in Ontario and British Columbia. Practitioners should also check with their professional liability insurance provider to ensure that they have proper coverage for providing care to patients located outside of Ontario. 4. Privacy and Confidentiality Practitioners must maintain the privacy of all patient personal health information as required by the Personal Health Information Protection Act , 2004 (PHIPA) and the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA). These requirements apply to both in -person and virtual care. Under PHIPA, practitioners are expected to take steps to ensure that personal health information is protected against theft, loss and unauthorized use or disclosure. Practitioners must also follow the law 1 CTCMPAO Members are authorized to perform two controlled acts: 1. Communicating a traditional Chinese medicine diagnosis identifying a body system disorder as the cause of a person's symptoms using traditional Chinese medicine techniques. 2. Performing a procedure on tissue below the dermis and below the surface of a mucous membrane for the purpose of performing acupuncture. 4 for collecting, using, and sharing personal health information. PHIPA sets out when a member must ask for consent to collect, use, and disclose personal health information. Practitioners are ultimately responsible for ensuring virtual care is provided in a manner that protects patients' confidentiality and the privacy of their personal health information. To this end, practitioners must ensure that the technology and devices they use (e.g., laptops or phones) do not allow for accidental access of patient information to unauthorized parties. Practitioners should also evaluate if the patient's physical setting and their own setting provide a safe, secure and confidential environment. Phone calls and videoconferencing sessions should not be recorded unless the practitioner has the patient 's consent and can ensure the recording is stored properly . Note: Telepractice visits should only be conducted in a private space so that the privacy and confidentiality of the patient's personal health information are not compromised. Practitioners should take measures to ensure that an unintended third party cannot overhear their convers ations with patients at either end of the conservation. It is crucial that patients understand the risks of receiving treatment by telepractice and provide consent before proceeding. For more information, see the Consent to Treatment section below. The In formation and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario developed a fact sheet for Privacy and Security Considerations for Health Care Visits. Although, the fact sheet applies primarily to public sector and government organizations, many of the recommendations included in the document also apply to practitioners as health information custodians. Practitioners providing virtual care are strongly encouraged to review the guide. NOTE: When providing clinical advice or treatment information by email, practitioners should consider whether it's appropriate for the patient to receive this information electronically. Using encryption and password protection, a secure internet connection, and limiting how much personal health information is sent, may help to improve the safety and security of transmitting patient health information. For more information, see the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario (IPC) Fact Sheet: Communicating Personal Health Information by Email . At the start of the virtual visit, practitioners should verify the patient's identity. The practitioner's identity, location, and CTCMPAO registration status should also be confirmed. If anyone else is present with the practitioner, it is important to ensure that they are introduced and that the patient consents to them being present during the visit. Practitioners should also check if anyone is accompanying the patient and, if so, confirm the patient's consent. 5. Technology The College cannot recommend a specific technology provider ; practitioners are expected to choose the communication technologies that are most appropriate for their practice. Practitioners engaged in telepractice must understand the capabilities and limitations of the technology they choose such as security, data storage and technical trouble shooting. Any technology that is used to 5 provide virtual care must meet the Personal Health Information Protection Act, 2004 (PHIPA) requirements. PHIPA sets out the rules about the collection, use and disclosure of personal health information. These rules apply to all health information custodians in Ontario and to all individuals and organizations that receive personal health information from health information custodians. Under PHIPA, heath information custodians must implement technical, physical and administrative safeguards to protect personal health information. The Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario (IPC) provides examples of different measures to safeguard privacy, for example: Administrative Safeguards: privacy and security policies and procedures, staff training and confidentiality agreements , using professional (not personal) email accounts Technical Safeguards: strong authentication and access controls, strong passwords and encryption, maintaining up -to-date software, firewalls and anti-malware scanners Physical Safeguards: controlled access to locations where personal information is stored, Keeping portable devices in secure location For more information, please see the Guide to the Personal Health Information Protection Act . Practitioners must ensure that th ey have the skills and training in the use of the telecommunication technology and that they have access to appropriate technical support. Practitioners should also consider the patient's needs, reliability and security of their devices (e.g., home compute r, laptop, tablet, or cellphone), internet access, and access to technical support. Note : At the outset of a telepractice visit/session, practitioners should arrange for alternate means of contact in case of technical difficulties/connection loss. 6. Consent to Treatment The requirement for practitioners to obtain patients' consent for treatment is the same for telepractice and in- person patient care. However, in addition to receiving informed consent to provide treatment, practitioners should also obtain informed consent from patients to conduct an appointment via telepractice. In order to obtain informed consent before providing treatment through telepractice, practitioners must inform the patient about the risks, scope and limitations of telepractice . Practitioners must also have the patient's consent to collect, use and disclose personal health information using telecommunication technologies. Note : Before providing a telepractice treatment, practitioners should ensure that the patient is aware of the risks associated with providing services in ways other than in- person interactions . Once the telepractice session begins, practitioners must obtain the patient's informed consent before treatment. Consent is an ongoing process; practitioners should re-confirm consent at each visit/session and ensure that patients understand their right to withdraw consent. Practitioners must document consent in the patient's file. For more information, please see the Standard for Consent and the Health Care Consent Act , 1996. 6 7. Record Keeping Practitioners engaged in telepractice are required to maintain patient records in accordance with the College's Standard for Record Keeping. Practitioners must maintain comprehensive clinical records and document all patient encounters that take place through telepractice. If applicable, patient records should clearly indicate that a service was provided remotely. For more detailed information, please see the Standard for Record Keeping and Record Ke eping Guideline . 8. Fees and Billing Practitioners are already required to advise patients of fees prior to providing treatment. P ractitioners are also expected to advise their patients (upfront) of any additional fees associated with telepractice. The fee information must be clear and should not be misleading or hard to understand. Invoices should be an accurate representation of the service provided to the patient. If applicable, an invoice should indicate that a service was provided remotely. Practitioners should advise their patients to check that insurance providers cover services provided by telepractice. For more information, please see the Standard for Advertising and the Advertising Guideline . 9. Maintaining Professional Boundaries Practitioners must establish and maintain professional boundaries with their patients and be aware of the potential for boundary violations. Telepractice may provide opportunities for more informal types of interaction, which may lead to potential boundary crossings. For example, suppose a practitioner allows for text messaging with patients. In that case, they should carefully consider their expectations of how and when they will use and respond to text messages from their patients. Members will also want to remember and consider how these text messages are incorporated into the patient record. Practitioners should also pay attention to the environment where telepractice will occur and avoid any personal items that may increase the risk for boundary crossings or violations. For more information, please refer to the Standard for Maintaining Professional Boundaries . 10. Professional Liability Insurance Practitioners are required to maintain Professional Liability Insurance coverage as specified in the College By-Laws. When engaged in telepractice, practitioners must ensure that their PLI policies offer adequate coverage for that type of service delivery. For more information, please see the Professional Liability Insurance Policy . 7 References College of Naturopaths of Ontario Regulatory Guidance: Telepractice - Providing Naturopathic Care at a Distance Telepractice Guideline College of Occupational Therapists of Ontario : Guidelines for Telepractice in Occupational Therapy College of Optometrists : Telehealth Policy for Optometrists College of Physiotherapists of Ontario Virtual Practice Virtual Practice FAQS College of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Acupuncturists of British Columbia PRACTICE STANDARD: Tele -Practice During the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic College's Statement Regarding Tele -Practice During the COVID -19 Pandemic Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario A Guide to the Personal Health Information Protection Act Privacy and security considerations for virtual health care visits Recent PHIPA Amendments and Privacy/Security Considerations for Virtual Care Ontario College of Social Workers and Social Service Workers Frequently Asked Questions CTCMPAO T elepractice Guideline SurveyMonkey 1 / 2897.67% 84 2.33% 0.00% 0Q1 Do of Canada Outside of Canada ANSWER CHOICES RESPONSES Ontario Rest of Canada Outside of CanadaCTCMPAO T elepractice Guideline SurveyMonkey 2 / 2.33% 2 1.16% 1 0.00% 0Q2 Are you a ...? traditional...

In this situation,should the pratitioner get consent in each time when they contact the patient?12/5/2021 12:20 AM 13 It's perfect, nothing needs to be changed. 11/30/2021 3:23 PM 14 I would suggest a checklist of items listed in the guidelines for practitioners to access to be sure that they are meeting all requirements. A sample consent would also be helpful. For example I have seen extensive consents regarding telemedicine used by CAMH and other organizations.11/27/2021 1:40 PM 15 The language does not allow for the reality and practicality of life and practice. The expectations are too idealistic for a time when medical care across the board has been compromised; it makes it difficult for practitioners to make a living within rigid parameters that do not allow exception for these exceptional circumstances everyone is struggling through. Those that work remotely in administrative capacities may not be aware of the challenges present in practice today. I fear that the unyielding attitude towards people that dedicate their lives to helping others only serves to limit the public's ability to access care and is not a true representation of philosophy and intention behind TCM.

Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Telepractice The Traditional Chinese Medicine Act, 2006, defines the scope of traditional Chinese medicine as the assessment of body system disorders through traditional Chinese medicine techniques and treatment using traditional Chinese medicine therapies to promote, maintain or restore health. In the context of traditional Chinese medicine, the primary benefit of telepractice is ensuring the continuity of care and accessibility. Providing virtual care can improve accessibility when, for example, physical contact is discouraged due to a health pandemic, there is a shortage of practitioners in a geographical region, or when patients have transportation or mobility issues. However, it should be noted, \" telepractice has its limitations. For example, TCM practitioners and acupuncturists rely on several diagnostic methods to conduct patient assessments. This includes physically assessing patients by palpitation or pulse examination. In the case of telepractice, these physical assessment methods are not feasible. In addition, telepractice limits the number of modalities used in traditional Chinese medicine; these include, for example, acupuncture, cupping, gua sha, and tui na.------- But could providused videos and pictures to observe and analyze, apply the TCM : Observation, Question, & clinical experience to diagnose cases.

A level of trust and respect towards the CTCMPAO members to act in the best interests of their patients, as the profession itself sets out to do, would go a long way to instilling trust in the profession from the public. The idea that the public needs to be protected from us is belittling and demeans TCM in general. Belief and trust in the profession, as it stands, is important. Conforming to an allopathic model of medicine is detrimental to TCM as a discipline. Encouraging members to engage in experimental genetic therapies for something that does not have a significant mortality rate is inappropriate and unethical. And it deviates from TCM philosophy. It goes against the very rules and regulations we as practitioners are expected to uphold regarding informed consent, ethics, discrimination, coercion and more. The college needs to seriously consider its intentions for the future of TCM - does the college intend to allow TCM to be absorbed and diluted by mainstream medicine? Will TCM practitioners be expected to slowly disregard the TCM perspective in favour of the algorithmic allopathic model that does not consider the individual picture presentation, and instead treats all patients the same?11/26/2021 11:44 PM 12 no 11/26/2021 6:36 PM 13 None 11/26/2021 3:04 PMEXECUTIVE 1 Issue The College is updating Council on the current risk management plan, which includes a complete look at the risks facing the College. Public Interest Rationale The College must be able to carry out its responsibilities set out in legislation. In order to avoid situations where we are prevented from doing that, a risk management plan is necessary to predict and mitigate risks . Background The College provides Council with the risk management plan at each quarterly meeting, and staff will update members if there are any changes. For the 3rd quarter , the following minor changes have been made: Upgraded the risks in Governance related to the loss in confidence of CTCMPAO. This is due to the high probability of Schedule 5 of Bill 88 damaging the reputation of the College. The College will need to diligently monitor its engagement with stakeholders to determine the actual level of impact, and take measures to retore trust in the College if damage has been done.Meeting Date: March 21, 2022 Issue: Risk Management Plan Reported By: Ann Zeng, Sean Cassman Action: Information Encl: Risk Management Plan 1 September 2021 College of Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners and Acupuncturists of Ontario (CTCMPAO) Risk Management Plan Risk Management Vision CTCMPAO is committed to building and fostering an enterprise risk management culture that clearly faces reality through systematic process of risk identification, assessment, and management and will affect this through its strategic planning process.

Ryan Chu, An ia Walsh 2 September 2021 Risk Management Process and Activities The CTCMPAO regularly undertakes risk management activities to protect the interests of the public, its members and the Government of Ontario to which it is accountable. Risk management involves complex processes of risk assessment, development and implementation of mitigation strategies and evaluation of effectiveness, change and opportunity. Effective risk management requires the active engagement of everyone actively engaged in the organization and may include consultation with external experts such as auditors. The College adheres to a Risk Management Policy which requires regular review, evaluation and reporting to Council. Risk Analysis Matrix College staff engage in a collective and joint process to identify types of risks that are likely to affect the achievement of business goals. For each risk, staff consider what could happen, how and why it could happen, and the consequences of said risk. Staff systematically review the following to identify potential risks and to categorize potential risks using a risk occurren ce matrix: each function performed within the College, records and reports generated or retained by the College. business proc esses, policies and procedures. resources of the College including knowledge of history, processes and legislative, operational and policy environment, staff, furnishings and equipment. Types of Risk Identified: 1. Governance 2. Loss Confidence in CTCMPAO 3. Finance 4. Information Management 5. Facility/Site Safety and Security 6. Human Resources 7. Statutory Obligations 8. Exam 3 September 2021 Risk Occurrence Matrix Likelihood (probability of occurring) Consequence/ Impact Rare The event may occur in exceptional circumstances. (0 - 5 %) Unlikely The event has happened at some time. (6-33%) Possible The event has happened periodically (34-65%) Likely The event has happened previously and could reasonably occur again. (66-79%) Almost Certain The event is extremely likely to occur (80-100%) Level 1 2 3 4 5 Negligible Low financial /reputation loss, small impact on operations 1 1 2 3 4 5 Minor Some financial loss, moderate impact on business 2 2 4 6 8 10 Moderate Moderate financial loss, moderate loss of reputation, moderate business interruption 3 3 6 9 12 15 Major Major financial loss, several stakeholders raised concerns, major loss of reputation, major business interruption 4 4 8 12 16 20 Extreme Complete cessation of business, extreme financial loss, irreparable loss of reputation 5 5 10 15 20 25 Risk Rating Risk Priority Description 1-3 L Low Risk: May require consideration in any future changes to the work area or processes, or can be fixed immediately 3-6 M Medium Risk: May require corrective action, planning and budgeting process 4 September 2021 8-12 H High Risk: Requires immediate corrective action 15-25 E Extreme Risk: Requires immediate prohibition of the work, process and immediate corrective action Risk Assessment This step involved analysing the likelihood and consequences of each identified risk using the measures provided in the table above. The staff looked at the existing controls for each risk and identified what we would do to control the risk. Then, using the chart, they rated the effectiveness of existing controls in preventing the risk from happening or minimising its impact should it occur. Likelihood is a qualitative description of probability and frequency, asking the question 'what is the likelihood of the risk occurring?' Consequence was described as the outcome of the event, being a financial loss, loss of reputation, or business interruption, asking the question, 'what is the consequence of the risk event?' The risk rating was the sum of the consequence rating times the likelihood rating. The risk priority chart provides an indication of urgency to how soon the staff needed to implement a strategy to address the risk. 5 September 2021 CTCMPAO Risk Registry - 2019 - 2021 Risk Type Risk and Description Risk Likelihood Risk Impact Risk Priority Risk Owner Mitigation Actions Governance Not reaching quorum to constitute a Committee resulting in or Council becomes unconstituted : Public perception of not meeting College mandate of public protection Delays in decision - making affecting applicants (i.e. registration) or members (QA/ICRC/ Discipline) 5 Almost Certain 4 Major 20 Extreme Council, President, Registrar Current Treatment: Staff try to accommodate Council/committees members' schedules to ensure quorum in all meetings .

Adverse Impact by Rebecca Durcan January 2022 - No. 262 While the term \"adverse impact\" has a well -known meaning amongst human rights lawyers, it is still not widely recognized in the regulatory world. That may be about to change. An adverse impact occurs when an apparently neutral requirement, say a math test, has a disproportionate impact on certain protected groups. Equity principles, and in certain circumstances the law, requires that the requirement be removed or modified so that it has a more equitable impact. In Ontario Teacher Candidates' Council v. The Queen , 2021 ONSC 7386 , https://canlii.ca/t/jlcvg the Divisional Court declared that a requirement for applicants for teacher certification to successfully complete a Mathematics Proficiency Test (MPT) violated the equality provisions found in s. 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . The Court declared that applicants for teacher certification who met all other requirements should be certified by the regulatory body. The Court's overview of the case nicely sums up the outcome of its analysis. The question on this application is whether the MPT has a disproportionate adverse impact on entry to the teaching profession for racialized teacher candidates and if so, whether it can be justified under s. 1 of the Charter . The evidence points to signif icant disparities in success rates of standardized testing based on race, including statistical evidence of racial disparities with respect to the MPT specifically. The deleterious effect on diversity is somewhat ameliorated by subsequent attempts availabl e to retake the MPT. The MPT infringes s. 15 of the Charter and cannot be justified under s. 1. The Respondent [government] has not discharged its burden of showing that the MPT minimally impairs the rights of racialized teacher candidates. There were reasonably available alternatives to the MPT that , on their face , appear to be less impairing and at least as effective in achieving the goal of improving student achievement in math. These include requiring a minimum number of hours of math instruction or a math course in B.Ed. programs, requiring an undergraduate math course as an admissions requirement for B.Ed. programs or waiting to see the effects of the other parts of the Respondent's four -year math strategy. The Respondent's efforts to address equi ty issues related to the MPT do not meet the minimal impairment requirement where there are other options available that would not impair anyone's rights. Racialized teacher candidates who have been disproportionately unsuccessful on the MPT should not hav e to keep retaking the test. There is a cost to retaking the test in time and money for those who are least likely to be able to afford this and there is no undertaking that going forward, teacher candidates will not have to pay to retake the MPT. There is an under -representation of racialized teachers in Ontario schools. Racialized students benefit from being taught by racialized teachers. The deleterious effects of the MPT on racialized teacher candidates who have been disproportionately unsuccessful on the test outweigh its benefits. Page | 2 There was considerable research, expert and statistical evidence demonstrating that standardized testing generally, and standardized teaching testing in particular, had a materially higher pass rate for White candidates compared to racialized candidates. The first administration of the MPT indicated that candidates who identified as Indigenous and Black had a success rate that was 20 percentage points lower than White candidates. French -speaking candidates, th ose speaking other languages, and those who experience cognitive disabilities had even less success in passing the test. There was also evidence from a highly qualified internationally trained individual who had difficulty passing the MPT, only doing so o n his third attempt. The Court specifically commended the value of this kind of evidence. There was dispute as to the quality of some of the evidence, especially evidence related directly to the MPT. However, the Court said that while \"evidence is necessary [to demonstrate adverse impact], it cannot be that a claimant group must wait years before it is in a position to challenge a regulation that it alleges is discriminatory.\" The purpose of the requirement (i.e., the harm being addressed) was stud ent proficiency in mathematics. In conducting its proportionality analysis between the goal and means chosen to address it: Courts will typically look to evidence that the government explored options other than the impugned measure and evidence supporting its reasons for rejecting those alternatives. The government may adduce evidence that it consulted with affected parties in order to demonstrate that it explored a range of options, though there is no requirement that the government engage in consultation before legislating .... The government might also adduce evidence to show that the less impairing alternatives proposed are not likely to achieve the government's objectives or are otherwise not workable, or that the proposed alternatives are not in fact less impairing. ... Where the infringing measure is predicated on the existence of a specific problem, the court may look to evidence that the problem exists or that existing tools are ineffective in order to justify the imposition of the infringing measure . ... Overall, while the approach to the minimal impairment stage is deferential, the government is typically required to demonstrate a reasonable basis, on the evidence, for concluding that its chosen means were minimally impairing and that it had sound reasons for rejecting proposed alternatives. There was significant research before the Court indicating that standardized testing of teachers had only a modest impact on student performance especially when compared to other strategies such as enhanced mathematics training for teachers. The policy makers considered , but rejected , these alternatives as interfering with the independence of the training programs for teachers. The Court concluded that these alternatives were less impairing of the rights of racialized candidates and that they would likely be at least as effective as the MPT . One \"elephant in the room\" is that the MPT requirement was not proposed by the regulator. Rather it was inserted in t he legislation by the government in 2018 as a part of its \"getting back to the basics\" initiative. Courts have traditionally been wary of governments using professional regulatory bodies to achieve its policy goals: Szmuilowicz v. Ontario (Minister of Heal th), 1995 CanLII 10676 (ON SC), https://canlii.ca/t/g15jd . While conceptually the Court's Page | 3 analysis of the constitutionality of the provision should not be affected by the origin of the proposal, this circumstance may have been an implicit consideration in the Court's proportionality analysis. Courts have been deferential to regulators enacting regulations, by -laws or policies, not requiring a significant amount of evidence to support their reasonablen ess: Sobeys West Inc. v. College of Pharmacists of British Columbia , 2016 BCCA 41 (CanLII), https://canlii.ca/t/gn3cn . However, things change dramatically when such an initiative has a discriminatory adverse impact. Then there is a burden on regulators to provide persuasive evidence that it has fully considered and balanced the importance of the goal being achieved against the discriminatory impact. That analysis by regulators includes the full consideration o f less discriminatory alternatives. Evidence that the regulator did this analysis at the time the decision is made carries more weight than if only done after the legal challenge has been launched. In these circumstances, right -touch regulation is not just an admirable concept, but a legal requirement. Thus a good policy making process includes an impact analysis, such as was very recently recommended by Harry Cayton in his Report of a Governance Review of the Law Society of British Columbi a, (see especia lly pp. 29-30): https://www.lawsociety.bc.ca/Website/media/Shared/ docs/about/GovernanceReview -2021.pdf . Since an adverse impact, by definition, arises when a provision or requirement appears neutral on its face, regulators would be well advised to conduct an impact analysis for all major policy decisions.

A New Approach by Regulators to Intimate Partner Violence? by Erica Richler February 2022 - No. 263 The way in which regulators respond to sexual abuse of clients has evolved over the years. A traditional approach viewing the conduct as unbecoming evolved into a new approach viewing the conduct as a fundamental abuse of power and trust. The evolving understanding of how regulators should respond to intimate partner violence by practitioners is on the cusp of a rethink. The Recent Approach The recent response by professional regulators to intimate partner violence has been an increasing concern that the conduct is highly unethical and brings the profession into disrepute. Thus, even though the conduct usually occurs outside of the practice of the profession, a meaningful response is called for. A recent example where this approach was taken, perhaps with more force than in the past, is found in Kang (Re), 2021 LSBC 23 (CanLII), https://canlii.ca/t/jg7ff . In that case the practitioner disagreed with the characterization that the behaviour was \" criminal and violent conduct\" because the criminal charges were stayed in the face of a peace bond, which was protective in nature. The tribunal said: The conduct in question is the Respondent's actions in forcefully grabbing AB's arms and legs and striking AB in the back of the head two or three times. This Panel characterizes this conduct as intimate partner violence. Canadian courts have censured intimate partner violence, noting that it occurs in the privacy of one's home, where one expects to be safe and often away from the assistance of the public (see for example, R. v. Donnelly , 2010 BCSC 1786 at paras. 28 and 29). The seriousness of such acts is also reflected in legislation, for example, s. 718.2(a)(ii) of the Criminal Code, which mandates that abusing an intimate partner is an aggravating factor on sentence. This Panel has no hesitation in finding that, in participating in an act of intimate partner violence, the Respondent engaged in conduct unbecoming the profession. Given a number of mitigating factors in that case, the tribunal found that a two-month suspension was fai r and reasonable. However, other discipline cases involving intimate partner violence have resulted in only a fine: Clarke (Re), 2021 LSBC 39 (CanLII), https://canlii.ca/t/jjkfk . Under this recent approach, in addition to disavowing the conduct, the regulator also wishes to ensure that the conduct does not replicate itself in the practice of the profession. As such, courses and therapy may be added to deterrence sanctions in order to protect clients and colleagues from future harm. For example, in Law Society of Ontario v. Al Zahid, 2021 ONLSTH 89 (CanLII), https://canlii.ca/t/jglpn the practitioner had been convicted of criminal harassment for repeated com munications and threats trying to persuade his former intimate partner to obtain an abortion. The threats included providing copies of recordings of intimate acts with a threat to use them to further harass the former intimate partner. In that case, the tribunal imposed a reprimand plus a requirement to continue in treatment for his behaviour. In a case involving a health profession, Ontario (College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario) v. Mukherjee, 2019 ONCPSD 16 (CanLII), Page | 2 https://canlii.ca/t/hzwcc the practitioner broke a door into the intimate partner's residence, deliberately drove into her car and sent death threats by text message. The tribunal concluded: Dr. Mukherjee exploited the power imbalance in his relationship with Ms. B, an intimate partner and employee, by threatening to withdraw the monetary support he was providing her. He did so in a manner that was aggressive and violent, leading to criminal convictions. The penalty reflects the Committee's and public's expectation that physicians lead by example, including in matters of intimate partner violence and abuse. The six -month suspension and reprimand will serve as deterrents to Dr. Mukherjee and the profession, and send a strong message that such conduct will not be tolerated. Instruction in anger management will provide for Dr. Mukherjee's further rehabilitation. The six month suspension and instruction in anger management also satisfy the need to protect the public, which remains a paramount principle in determining an appropriate penalty. The six -month suspension in that case indicates the increasing seriousness with which such conduct is being treated by some regulators. Perhaps a case demonstrating the transition to the new approach is Ontario (College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario) v. Dhanoa, 2020 ONCPSD 28 (CanLII), https://canlii.ca/t/j8dzd . Part of the allegations related to making death threats and illegal possession of a knife \"in a family setting\". There were also concerns about substance abuse, for which the practitioner was being treated, and failing to disclose the charges and findings. In imposing a five-month suspension and professionalism courses, the tribunal said: Aggravating factors include that violence was a component of the criminal conviction. Dr. Dhanoa was convicted of assault and given a conditional sentence and probation. The assault occurred in a family setting, which was particularly egregious. The fact that this was male violence against a female augments the egregiousness of the misconduct. As a physician, Dr. Dhanoa may be called upon to treat patients who have been subjected to domestic assault. He needs to be approachable and open to doing that. A conviction of this sort does not inspire confidence that he will fulfill his duty in that regard. The case is significant for explicitly recognizing both the frequent gender dynamics of the conduct and the impact of the conduct on future patients who have experienced intimate partner violence, albeit as aggravating factors on sanction. An Emerging New Approach? In B.M.D. (CanLII), a practitioner was charged and then pleaded guilty criminally to offences that involved intimate partner violence. The regulator was required by legislation to post the charges and, later, the findings, on the public register. The issue was whether the summary of the charges and findings should mention that they involved intimate partner violence. Even without using the intimate partner's name, many people would be able to identify her. The intimate partner filed an affidavit identifying the harm that she would experience if the posting mentioned the subject of the findings as being related to intimate partner violence. Ultimately the Court concluded that the information should be posted and that the posting should refer to intimate partner violence: Page | 3 I have concluded that the countervailing public interest in the College investigating and reporting on the criminal actions of one of its professional members outweighs [the intimate partner's] privacy interests. Further, I accept that the physician's commission of an intimate partner assault would be an important matter for his current patients and any potential patients to know about in choosing whether to accept him as their medical treatment provider. Such a choice is intimate to each person. Sadly, too many of a physician's patients may themselves be victims of intimate partner violence. Those individuals, if armed with information that their doctor had committed such an offence, should be afforded an opportunity to choose not to be treated by that physician.\" The reasoning in this case suggests that a regulator's function when dealing with intimate violence goes beyond disavowing the conduct, protecting the reputation of the profession, and preventing the conduct from encroaching into the practice context. The regulator also has an ongoing obligation to recognize the harm that can occur to clients and colleagues of the practitioner. Clients and colleagues who have experienced intimate partner violence should have the choice of avoiding dealing with a practitioner with a history of such conduct. Clients and colleagues who share their history of intimate partner violence with a practitioner may legitimately feel that their trust has been violated if they later learn that the practitioner has a history of that very behaviour. The implications of this new approach remain to be developed. Are all professions equally affected, or is this new approach primarily applicable to professions in which disclosure of intimate partner violence may 1 For example, lawyers practi sing family law are expected to screen for family violence with their clients. be anticipated in the course of the professional relationship?1 Will this approach result in more frequent disqualification from the profession like there is for frank acts of sexual abuse? How meaningful is the distinction between intimate partner violence involving touching compared to conduct that does not involve touching (like there often is for sexual abuse)? How relevant is the distinction between clients and non-clients (like there sometimes is for sexual abuse)? Will there be an assumption of vulnerability on the part of the recipient of the violence (as there is for sexual abuse) or will the vulnerability have to be proved on a case -by-case basis? Finally, will a full implementation of the new approach require practitioners to notify, proactively, future employers, colleagues and clients of their history of intimate partner violence? While not specifically related to professional regulation, the federal House of Commons Standing Committee on the Status of Women is currently studying the issue of intimate partner and domestic violence in Canada and will release a report with recommendations . This is an important area for regulators of professions to monitor carefully.

External Review of Regulators by the Auditor General by Natasha Danson March 2022 - No. 264 There are proposals circulating that will expand the mandate of the Auditor General of Ontario to include auditing self-governing professions. It appears that such reviews will not be limited to the financial integrity of regulators. Given the recent audits of other arms - length regulators of professions and industries, the scope of those reviews will extend to questioning the regulatory approaches and philosophies of regulators. Five of the more recent reviews by the Auditor General for non-government regulators have been for the following regulators: Ontario Motor Vehicle Industry Council Ontario Securities Commission Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario Bereavement Authority of Ontario Electrical Safety Authority By analyzing these reports one can obtain a sense of how the Auditor General perceives its role in such reviews. Some aspects of those reports deal, as expected , with financial revenue and spending issues , including: The accumulation of large surpluses rather than using the resources to enhance regulation; Whether appropriate investment strategies were used for surplus funds; Whether the regulator's meal and hospitality reimbursement policy was appropriate; Compensation levels for staff compared to other regulators ; and The percentage of compensation fund claims recovered from the offending registrants . However, many aspects of those reports contain a much broader analysis of the regulators , including policy preferences for the approaches and philosophies of regulators. For example, below is a partial list of the points of scrutiny by the Auditor General. Inspections and Related Compliance Monitoring The number of inspections, etc., conducted, including comparison to past years; The use of checklists for inspections, etc., and whether those checklists were made public so that practitioners and the public could better understand the expectations of the regulator; Public reporting of inspections , etc., and the accuracy of those public reports ; The use of risk analysis and selection criteria for scheduling inspections, etc.; The necess ity of inspections , etc., conducted; Whether inspections , etc., could be effectively and safely done remotely; The frequency of follow -up inspections, etc., where violations were found and whether they were prioritized on the basis of risk ; Whether inspectors and enforcement staff were rotated so that they would not repeatedly be in contact with the same registrants; Whether regulators used \"undercover investigators\" or \"mystery shoppers\" to monitor compliance with the rules by registrants; W hether regulatory activities were coordinated with other regulators with overlapping mandates ; The adequacy of information technology and analytical tools to monitor regulatory performance and to identify patterns of concerns within the profession or industry; Whether the regulator monitors the length of time to complete inspections, etc., and whether those timeframes are reasonable; Page | 2 Whether the difference in enforcement action rates among enforcement staff was reasonable; and The rate of enforcement action flowing from complaints and the criteria used for evaluating complaints . Governance The percentage of Board members who are from the regulated profession or industry; Whether there were term limits for Board members ; The adequacy and completeness of the performance indicators and targets for the regulator; The length of time it took for the regulator to develop and implement key policy changes . Registration The percentage of applicants for registration processed within the target timelines; The appropriateness of the registration criteria for applicants (e.g., financial responsibility) ; Whether the regulator follows up quickly with registrants who file incomplete information with their renewal applications; Whether the regulator follows up on practitioners who do not renew their registration to ensure that they are not acting illegally; and Whether the regulator effectively deter s illegal practice by check ing advertising and posing as consumers to see the prevalence of illegal practice. CPD and Quality Assurance Whether registrants are required to complete continuing professional development in order to renew their registration. Public Awareness Activities Consumer awareness of their rights and whether the regulator publishes the results of surveys measuring consumer awareness; Whether the regulator answers technical questions or has a meaningful way for members of the public to obtain answers to those questions; and Whether prices for similar services charged by practitioners was within a reasonable range. Legislation and Government Role The appropriateness of the limits on the compensation fund criteria established in the legislation; Whether practitioners should be required to post specified consumer information (e.g., prices for services) online; The lack of Ministry oversight related to governance concerns within a regulator; Whether the legislation permits the regulator to issue \"tickets\" and administrative monetary penalties; Whether the regulator should be regulating additional categories of practitioners or transactions; and Whether the regulator was consulted by government on policy issues or pandemic strategies in which the regulator had expertise. This broader mandate for the Auditor General is justified under the \"value for money\" principle, despite the fact that most of these regulators do not receive public funds. As the Auditor General frequently conducts follow up reviews to ascertain whether its recommendations were implemented, these reports can have a significant impact on the future priorities of the regulators subject to the reviews . Page | 3 Commentary While one can see the value in holding regulators accountable , a number of questions arise as to the appropriateness of using the Auditor General to assume this role. Does the Auditor General have the expertise to assess these matters? Is it fair to assess a regulator on criteria that are not established in advance? Are the assumptions behind the Auditor General's assessment valid (e.g., Should the regulator be the source of casual advice for members of the public as to the content of technical standards? Should the regulator directly address prices charged by practitioners?)? Will these reports have the effect diminishing the role of a regulator's Board setting regulatory priorities (e.g., a shift from \"right-touch regulation\" principles to ticking off timely follow -up boxes)? Does the regulatory cost of participating in the review constitute value for money? External scrutiny of regulators is a trend that is taking hold in Canada. For example, in British Columbia the Office of the Superintendent of Professional Governance has an oversight role for a number of professions. In Ontario the Office of the Fairness Commissioner is already conducting a similar role for the registration practices of most professions , duplicating the proposed role of the Auditor General . Ultimately , assuming that external monitoring is valuable, is having the Auditor General periodically conduct intensive reviews of some selected regulators the best way of conducting such oversight? Regardless of the answers to these questions, regulators should consider whether the general recommendations made by the Auditor General in previous reviews warrant reconsideration of some of their own processes. The reports of the Auditor General can be found at: https://www.auditor.on.ca/ . February 2, 2022 Dear Registrars and Chief Executive Officers: I am writing to provide you with a link to our office's new Legislated Obligations and Fair Registration Best Practices Guide for Regulated Professions and Compulsory Trades (the guide). In developing this important document, we consulted widely with regulators, representatives from the immigration and settlement communities, and subject matter experts. When we met with regulators in September 2021 to present the guide, there was widespread consensus that it was a useful document. In the intervening time frame, we have made some minor enhancements to the document in response to comments that we received. Given that your organization is already familiar with the contents of the g uide, we have determined that it will come into effect on March 1, 2022 . The purpose of this guide is two -fold. First, to provide regulators with information and advice to more fully understand how to comply with their obligations under the Fair Access to Regulated Professions and Compulsory Trades Act ( FARPACTA ). Second, to offer our staff a tool to help them assess the degree to which a regulator is achieving such compliance. We also considered it essential to s upplement these obligations with lists of best practices designed to improve the quality, timeliness, and fairness of registration decisions, and to generally promote excellent client -service. Owing to some differences between the wording of FARPACTA and Schedule 2 of the Regulated Health Professions Act , this guide only applies to the non -health professions and to Skilled Trades Ontario. We 2 are currently working with the Ontario Ministry of Health to develop a companion document for the health colleges, which will be circulated for comment at a later date. While the two documents will be different in certain respects, they also exhibit many similarities. Thus, I would also encourage the health regulatory colleges to carefully reflect on the contents of the guide, with particular reference to the embedded best practices, which have wide applicability across the regulatory community . These best practices will now substitute for the database of exemplary practices that our office had previously posted on our web site. I should also point out that the guide forms one component of our office's new compliance approach, which features our recently promulgated risk -informed compliance framework, which can be accessed through this link. It is our plan to keep the list of our best practices evergreen. We plan to review them regularly to ensure that they remain current. We view this collection as a common resource and invite regulators to as sist us to keep these ideas timely, forward looking and relevant. I wanted to raise one related point. As you know, on December 2, 2021, the Working for Workers Act received Royal Assent. This legislation contains a number of provisions designed to moder nize FARPACTA and reduce barriers encountered by internationally trained applicants. These provisions involve establishing maximum time limits for the registration process, reducing the number of language proficiency tests that applicants must take, enab ling regulators to maintain the continuity of their registration processes during emergency situations and eliminating the Canadian experience requirement, unless a regulator can make compelling case for its retention. 3 The government recently completed c onsultations to develop the necessary regulatory provisions to operationalize the legislation. Once these regulations are finalized, our office will update the guide to incorporate these new requirements . I would ask that you circulate the guide to your b oard members, leadership team and staff as appropriate . Your assigned Compliance Analyst would be happy to respond to any questions that you may have about the document. Finally, I would like to thank everyone who was involved in developing the guide, which I hope that you will find to be helpful as you undertake your important and complex mandates. Sincerely, [Original signed by] Irwin Glasberg Fairness Commissioner Issue The College is providing a summary of the steps it has taken up until March 10, 2022 in response to COVID -19. Background A Business Continuity Plan (BCP) was drafted to address action plans in the event leading up to, during, and after an emergency pandemic or disaster. A business continuance - department function guide was developed to anticipate and plan for, the needs of each department during the event of a pandemic or disaster. A dedicated response team was temporarily formed, compris ed of key personnel at the College.
