We try to hide the symptoms, survive the side effects and hope for the best while cold germs linger in our bodies. Now imagine looking at illness from a different perspective. How do lifestyle patterns like sleep, stress, nutrition and hygiene figure into one's susceptibility to illness? What can be done to get to the origin of an illness, not just treat its symptoms? How can you integrate medical treatments with a more comprehensive approach to wellness? The field of integrative medicine is the melding of conventional Western medicine with complementary therapies and healing practices. It affords patients and health care providers a broad perspective on healing that emphasizes the health of the whole person: mind, body, community and spirit. As a medical doctor, I have worked in integrative medicine in northeast Wisconsin since 1999. I attended medical school at the School of Medicine and Public Health at UW-Madison and completed a fellowship through the University of Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine. I grew up in Rhinelander where my father was an internist and my mother introduced me to yoga well before it was widely understood in this part of the country. I credit my parents with instilling in me an interest in blending conventional and complementary medicine. A primary care provider with the added perspective of integrative medicine can help patients identify the root cause behind their health problems, and a lot of times that's stress or lifestyle issues. Our bodies have an innate healing response, and we can lose touch with that when prescriptions or invasive procedures are the only solutions offered. Integrative medicine considers all factors that influence a person's health, wellness, and disease and suggests ways to improve their health and outlook on life. The key is to choose interventions that are natural and less invasive whenever possible and consider the risks and benefits of any therapy, conventional or alternative. I work with many adults with chronic diseases like anxiety and depression, heart disease, diabetes, chronic pain, and irritable bowel syndrome. I usually begin with conventional medical diagnostic tests, and then use the integrated approach to help my patients learn more about how their bodies work and respond. It is closely tailored to each person; it's not a quick and easy fix, but an investment of time to find the right combination of therapies. Physical therapy, acupuncture or massage, among other modalities, may be prescribed to help reduce stress and facilitate healing. We evaluate each prescription medication to determine if it's still necessary, if the dosage is correct, or if a more natural alternative exists without the related side effects. Together we discuss the state of a person's sleep, relationships, nutrition, and physical activity. Here are three ways to make the most of an integrated approach to health and wellness: See a medical doctor for any significant health concerns. Emergency situations may call for surgical or prescription interventions. If it's not urgent, you will still benefit from a medical diagnosis and can work with your health-care provider to optimize your body's healing capacity, minimize unpleasant side effects, and help you cope with your injury or illness. Be open and honest with your health-care provider. The goal is always safe and coordinated care. Share what kind of treatments you receive, what over-the-counter and prescription substances you take (including herbs and supplements), and what you generally eat and drink. Adopt a holistic perspective. In addition to helping deal with a specific health issue, holistic practices can help a person's overall health and well being. For instance, yoga can provide increased physical strength and flexibility and better sleep. It can also help develop a sense of mastery, inner peace, and a less reactive approach to life \u2014 all of which can lead to an improved level of mental and spiritual wellness.
