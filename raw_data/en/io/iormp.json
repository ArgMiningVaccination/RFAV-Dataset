If you do experience one, you may have symptoms such as trouble breathing, wheezing, hives, and rapid heartbeat. Common side effects, such as a low-grade fever or a sore arm, are very different than a true allergy to the flu vaccine itself. This article outlines important information about flu vaccine side effects, what it means to have a true allergy, and what your risk of an allergic reaction could be. Nusha Ashjaee / Verywell Flu Shot vs. FluMist: Which Is Better? Can You Be Allergic to the Flu Shot? While it is possible to have an allergic reaction to a flu vaccine, it's rare. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an allergy to the flu vaccine affects only one or two people out of every million doses. A true allergy is one in which the immune system produces defensive antibodies to fight off an otherwise harmless substance. Serious allergic reactions can result in anaphylaxis, a potentially life-threatening condition. Most flu shots and the nasal spray vaccine FluMist are manufactured using egg-based technology. They contain trace amounts of an egg protein called ovalbumin, a substance that 1.3% of children and 0.2% of adults are allergic to. However, just because you have an egg allergy doesn't mean you'll have an allergic reaction to FluMist or a flu shot. In fact, both the CDC and the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology no longer recommend that people with egg allergies avoid vaccination for flu. Influenza\u2014also known as the flu\u2014affects between 3% and 11% of Americans each year. Certain people, like those aged 65 and older or those with chronic conditions like asthma, are at a greater risk of developing serious complications if they get the flu. The best way to avoid getting sick is to get a seasonal flu vaccine. Symptoms of an Allergic Reaction to the Flu Shot Call 911 or seek emergency care right away if you experience any of the following signs of an allergic reaction to the flu shot: Rash or hives (a small rash at the injection site is not considered a severe allergic reaction) Shortness of breath Wheezing Rapid heartbeat Nausea and vomiting Swelling of the lips, face, tongue, or throat Dizziness and/or fainting Confusion Feeling of impending doom How a Flu Shot Allergy Is Treated A severe allergic reaction to the flu shot is treated like any other case of anaphylaxis. Your healthcare provider will give you Adrenalin (epinephrine), Benadryl (diphenhydramine), and/or oral corticosteroids. You will be kept in the hospital and monitored until your condition improves. Common Side Effects of the Flu Vaccine The flu vaccine can cause side effects, but experiencing side effects does not mean you are having an allergic reaction to the shot. Common side effects include a sore arm and mild, flu-like symptoms. Most of these are not serious and will resolve on their own within a day or two. It's also important to understand that the flu vaccine does not cause the flu. Flu vaccines come in the form of shots and the FluMist nasal spray. Though the flu shot and the FluMist nasal flu vaccine share some side effects, there are also differences: Flu Shot Side Effects Headache Minor body aches Low-grade fever Pain, swelling, or redness at the injection site Nausea FluMist Side Effects Headache Muscle aches Fever Runny nose Wheezing Vomiting Sore throat Cough Flu Shot Side Effects You Should Know The CDC recommends that most people over 6 months of age get a flu vaccine each year. Unfortunately, many people opt not to for a variety of reasons, from misinformation about flu shot effectiveness to concerns about possible health risks, side effects, or allergies. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome Rarely, some people develop a condition called Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS) after getting the flu shot. Though this is very uncommon, it's important to recognize the signs and symptoms so you can get treatment right away. GBS is not an allergic reaction. It is an autoimmune disorder affecting the nerves. Though it can sometimes be triggered by the flu vaccine, it occurs more commonly after a respiratory or gastrointestinal illness. GBS typically begins with weakness, pain, or tingling in the feet or legs (especially in children). After these initial symptoms calm or disappear, serious long-term symptoms, like weakness on both sides of the body, may suddenly develop and get worse. Other symptoms of GBS include: Loss of coordination and unsteadiness Difficulty speaking, swallowing, or chewing Difficulty with eye muscle control Vision problems Difficulty breathing Irregular heartbeat Severe neuropathic pain, especially at night Digestion problems Loss of bladder control Even though most people (about 70%) with GBS fully recover, it can take a long time. More severe cases can result in permanent muscle weakness or even paralysis. It is rare to develop GBS after a flu shot. If you developed GBS after a previous flu vaccination, speak with your healthcare provider to discuss your risk and what other options are available for you. Is a Preservative-Free Flu Shot Safer? Prevention If you have a known egg allergy and have experienced severe symptoms in the past after being vaccinated for the flu, talk to your healthcare provider about two egg-free flu shots approved by the FDA: Flublok quadrivalent (for use in adults 18 years and older)Flucelvax quadrivalent (for use in people 4 years and older) Any severe allergic reaction to a flu vaccine, whether it contained egg protein or not, is serious. Talk to your healthcare provider about whether it would be safe to consider a flu vaccine in the future. If you've had an adverse reaction following a vaccination, report it to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). This not only provides the CDC with valuable information to ensure future vaccine safety, but it is also the first step toward formally recording the incident if you decide to file a claim. Claims can be filed with the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, a no-fault initiative that allows you to resolve vaccine injury cases without the cost of legal representation. Even if a finding isn't made, you may still be eligible to receive financial compensation through a settlement. Summary Allergic reactions to the flu shot are very rare. They occur in one to two out of every million doses given. If you do experience an allergic reaction, you may develop shortness of breath, wheezing, rapid heartbeat, and other symptoms like a rash and hives. If these occur, seek emergency care right away. Symptoms like a sore arm and low-grade fever are normal flu vaccine side effects and not a sign of an allergic reaction. It is possible, but also rare, to develop a condition called Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome after vaccination. If you have symptoms like loss of coordination, difficulty speaking, vision problems, or nerve pain after a flu vaccine, seek medical help right away. 10 Sources Verywell Health uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.
