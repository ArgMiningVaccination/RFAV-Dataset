Nutrients, herbs, and supplements can be properly harnessed to address the real causes of physical and emotional problems in order to achieve true healing. This is why the team at MindBodySpirit Care in Tampa, Florida is committed to offering treatments using nutrients, herbs, and supplements to naturally and holistically alleviate health issues and encourage lasting wellness. The Role of Nutrients in Lasting Health The body requires a wide spectrum of nutrients in order to survive and function at its optimal level. In addition to the carbohydrates, proteins, and fats that you gain through a healthy diet, your body also needs vitamins, dietary minerals, essential fatty acids, and essential amino acids. Many of these essential nutrients are metabolically necessary, but can only be obtained through strategic food choices and supplements. Dr. Shemesh at MindBodySpirit Care will help you identify your body's specific nutritional deficiencies in order to guide you through the process of changing your dietary habits. This will ensure that your body can thrive with all essential nutrients. The simple change of eliminating nutritional deficiencies can reverse symptoms like fatigue, migraines, weight gain, anxiety, and so much more. Enhancing Your Health With Herbs The body can also benefit from strategic use of herbs to improve health. Herbal medicines are naturally occurring and plant-derived substances that can be used to treat illnesses. Raw garlic, ginger, turmeric, ginseng, milk thistle, and feverfew are just a few examples of the herbs commonly used to support healing. Each medicinal herb serves a specific purpose, and Dr. Shemesh can help you identify and utilize the best herbs for your health. Strategic Use of Supplements Supplements are natural products intended to support and improve your health by nourishing your body with specific vitamins, minerals, herbs, and amino acids. They can be considered nature's medicine and are often utilized as alternatives to pharmaceutical medications. However, since the supplements industry has become a multi-billion dollar industry over the past few years, it is essential to enlist the help of Dr. Shemesh as you work to determine which supplements will truly improve your health and address your symptoms.
