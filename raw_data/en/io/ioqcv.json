Consumer choice in German health careMental health reform in LithuaniaWhat role for NGOs in improving health care systems?Questioning values, debunking myths A myriad of factors influence the direction of health policy. Many such as resource constraints, political priorities and technological developments can pullpolicy in different directions. In his discussion of the'Madrid Framework', Marshall Marinker recognisesthe need to 'develop an analytical and non-adversarial discussion about what is to be done, the reasons why, and how health policy is to beimplemented.' The Framework, itself evolving froman initial meeting in Madrid, and subsequently goingthrough several iterations, outlines some inter-locking dimensions of health policy and governance.It attempts to make explicit some of the values andbeliefs that shape policy. It is only, as Marinkernotes, by making these values transparent that theycan be examined and questioned. The future plannedcritique of the Framework will thus be awaited withgreat interest. Following on from the previous issue of Eurohealth , which included a special section on south eastern Europe brought together by section editors, BerndRechel and Nina Schwalbe, there is once again an eastern European flavour to contributions. HereGrujica Zarkovic \u00b4 and Walter Satzinger provide a nice insight into the challenges for a non governmen-tal organisation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, seekingto act as a catalyst for health system change. The importance of effective lines of communication withkey policy stakeholders, as well as a good measure ofdiplomatic skills, political awareness, and patienceare well illustrated. Both barriers and progress forchange are also evident in the state of cancer care incentral and eastern Europe, as well as in respect ofmental health system development in Lithuania. The issue also sees the launch of the Mythbusters series. This will feature a series of short essays prepared by the Canadian Health Services ResearchFoundation looking at the evidence behind healthcare debates. Not only must we question and if necessary challenge our own values, but also debunksome of the longstanding myths that can alsoinfluence policy.

All of these concerns are potentially in con- flict with one another. How are we toarrive at the best, the most civilised, themost successful policies for health? Behindthese questions there are other, prior anddeeper, questions? What are our values;how do we express them; how do we vali-date them; how do we prioritise them;what, of one set of values, can be sacrificedin pursuit of another? The story of the Madrid Framework begins in 1997 when a small group of academicsfrom a variety of health-related disciplineswas invited by Merck Sharp & Dohme(MSD) to act as an Academic AdvisoryBoard to advise on a Europe-wide healthtargets grants programme. Over the courseof the following eight years we wereenabled to support a number of innovativehealth target projects throughout Europe,and a number of brainstorming workshopsand international conferences. These allcontributed to the development of ourideas about the nature and role of values inshaping local, regional, national and inter-national health policies. Following the publication in 2002 of a book of essays Health Targets in Europe: Polity, Progress and Promise 1a group of experts, including the book essayists, metin Madrid, in May 2003, to take part in a'Conference on Values and Principles'.What were these precepts, embedded bothin what we believed we were trying to doin health policy, and in how we set aboutdoing it? In particular we were concernedto ask whether there are characteristicallyEuropean values, around which we couldbuild a consensus. Armed with the thoughts of the many leading thinkers who took part in thisworkshop, the transcripts of the paperspresented, and the reports from the manydiscussion groups, I was given the task ofdrafting some sort of document whichwould encompass the ideas that had beenraised and examined. This is the genesis ofThe Madrid Framework. In the course of our group discussions at the conference, I had become aware of thetemptation to debate what was a value,what a virtue and what a principle. Thisseemed to me to be a potentially sterile lineof enquiry. Instead, I suggested identifyinga set of 'dimensions' of policy and gover-nance. The terms 'considerations', or'things to be considered', also suggestedthemselves as appropriate, but 'dimensions'had the attraction of describing a virtualspace for both discourse and action. The need is to develop an analytical and non-adversarial discussion about what is tobe done, the reasons why, and how policyis to be implemented. This discussion issomething that 'constructive conversation'. multi-dimensionalspace in which such constructive conversa-tion can occur. The Framework The Framework is composed of 11 'dimen-sions' of health policy and governance. Theword 'dimension' was intended to suggest aforce field in which each dimension would pull in its own direction, so that policy and governance must perpetually adjust in orderto find a moral equilibrium. This dynamicimagery was meant sharply to contrast withthe static and rigid imagery characterised bythe current fashion for creating 'standards','guidelines' and 'protocols'. What I attempted to do was to achieve maximum coherence within each dimen-sion , putting together a collection of quali-ties, values, principles and concerns whichseemed to belong together. At the sametime they were designed to achieve a maximum separation between the ideascontained in each, while acknowledgingthat there must be an irreducible degree ofoverlap. The version which follows is different from those presented at previous meetings. Ateach meeting the 'constructive conversa-tion' that is provoked, results in betterunderstanding of the issues, and the needfor detailed redrafting. The order in whichthese dimensions are presented is dictatedby coherence, not priority; they are not ofThe Madrid Framework Marshall Marinker is Visiting Professor of General Practice,Guy's, Kings and St Medical and DentalSchool, King's of healthpolicy and governance\"equal complexity or range; and their con- tents are indicative, not definitive. The firstthree are concerned with targets and goals -the changes we are trying to achieve.Dimensions 4-9 are instrumental, con-cerned with the means of achieving ourends. The final two, concerned with inter-dependencies and the handling of complex-ity, are what I call 'sensibilities' which per-vade every aspect of the work. Prioritisingthese dimensions, choosing between theirconflicting or competing goods, will mostoften require trade offs and hard politicalchoices. Our values are present in all of thedimensions - and to some degree they areall in conflict. The Dimensions 1. Health In the spirit of the WHO definition, the concept of health embraces the widestrange of physical, social, mental and spiri-tual well-being. Ill-health curtails ourcapacity for life. The health status of a soci-ety has been described as the most sensitiveindicator of its wealth and freedom. Theprotection and improvement of health isthe raison d'\u00eatre of health policy and gov-ernance whose ultimate goal is to enhancethe capacities of citizens for a full life. Policies may address the determinants of ill health, risk factors, and the quality of, andaccess to, health services. For all policies,although quantifiable and measurable out-comes may be most appropriate, these willoften be embedded in important higher-level, open-ended, and longer term, goalswhere change occurs gradually over time,and short-term linear relationships can notreadily be demonstrated. 2. Equity and JusticeIn pursuit of social justice, the goal of greater equity in health and care lies at theheart of almost all European health poli-cies. Inequalities in health may refer to lev-els of general health and well-being, to theprobabilities of disease, and to the availabil-ity and quality of health services. Theseclosely mirror inequalities in socioeconom-ic status, but may also be related to gender,age, ethnicity and locality. These inequali-ties challenge our sense of social justice andsolidarity. 3. ChoiceWhile most health policies are directed to large populations, sometimes to wholenations, the individual citizens in whosename these policies are made have theirown personal beliefs, priorities and sense ofentitlement. What is deemed best for the group will only randomly be best for, anddesired by, the individual. Therefore trade-offs have to be negotiated between the col-lective interest, and the priorities and desirefor choice of individual citizen's, and spe-cial interest groups. Choice can never beopen ended. It can only refer to a limitedmenu of options. The basis for determiningthis menu should be made transparent, sothat citizens have an explanation of what isincluded and what excluded, and on whatbasis. 4. DemocracyHealth policy will play an increasingly cen- tral role in the overall social and politicalagenda. If citizens are to have confidence inpublic health systems, our priorities willneed to reflect societal values. For this tohappen all stakeholders, and especially citi-zens and patients, need to be activelyengaged. A prerequisite of such engagedcitizenship is open access to valid health-related information from a wide range ofreliable sources. Another is transparency inthe processes of policy making and imple-mentation. At local level, a variety of meth-ods may be required to assure that thosewhose lives are to be affected by policychanges have a full sense of 'ownership'. Although democracies are good at paying attention to the desires of majorities, mostpeople with specific health deficits belongto 'health minorities', and their voices needto be heard. Public involvement is bestserved when there is a high-level of healthliteracy. Although most often this isassumed to refer to the individual's grasp ofthe concepts and findings of the health sci-ences, a growing body of research hasrevealed the importance of the individual's,and the community's, beliefs and attitudes,preferences and priorities, in determininghealth related behaviour. 5. StewardshipTraditionally national governments were deemed to have three key responsibilities:'the defence of the realm', 'law and order',and 'the stability of the currency'. In the21st century, a fourth responsibility, 'stew-ardship for health', emerges as arguably ofsimilar importance. Successful targetingdemands that governments recognise thathealth is a vital national resource, and makethe appropriate commitment of financial,human and intellectual resources, in orderto ensure that aspirations become goals thatcan be effectively implemented. This willinclude long term investment in the policiesthemselves, and in the health related eurohealth Vol 11 No 1 3MADRID FRAMEWORK \"Choice can never be open ended\"sciences and technologies which underpin them. Such responsible stewardship willinvariably require a longer period of timefor planning and funding than that of thelife-span of any democratic government. 6. EvidenceSuccessful governance requires reliable data that are comparable over time and acrossnational boundaries. Such informationmakes it feasible to track health and socialtrends that unfold over long periods oftime. However, health targets are inevitablymoving targets. Foresight will inevitablyrequire more than reliable data about pasttrends; it may require a public health 'intuitive judgement' analogous to thephysicians 'clinical acumen'. Lessons can be learned from experiences in other countries. However reliance on suchexternal evidence is only safe if account istaken of contextual differences: the differ-ent physical, cultural, social and politicalenvironments of the comparator popula-tions. All data are socially constructed, allperceived 'needs' are also 'wants'.Therefore behind all evidence, there aremoral and political, as well as numerical,values. The validity of these may need to berecognised and questioned no less carefullythan we question the statistics. 7. EfficiencyGovernments have a dual accountability: to protect and improve health; and to ensurethe optimal use of the public resourcesentrusted to it. Macro-efficiency is con-cerned both with the effectiveness of inter-ventions, and the priority that is given tothem. Micro-efficiency is concerned withthe optimal uses of resources to obtain themaximum benefit at the operational level.Although this latter is argued in terms ofvalue for money and the avoidance ofwaste, efficiency calculated in too narrow away can result in loss of flexibility anddiminish the ability of systems to cope withnatural fluctuations and surprises.Complexity theory suggests that withoutsome degree of redundancy, organisationaland biological systems can seize up. Anover rigid regime of efficiency can proveinefficient. 8. SynergyPolicy and governance requires collabora- tion and cooperation between many rele-vant actors - government agencies, the pri-vate sector, patients and citizens rightsorganisations, and other elements of civilsociety. This inter-sectoral governancerequires not only an open and stable relationship between agencies and individ- uals, but, even more crucially, a willingnessof organisations to learn from the experi-ence of working with one another whichmay challenge them to expand their tradi-tional assumptions about ways of operat-ing, remits and boundaries, to grow inways that are appropriate and sensitive tothe task. At its best such co-production ofhealth can achieve something that is morethan the sum of its parts. 9. SustainabilityIn most long term enterprises there can be a falling off of commitment and energy.Since most health policies are long-termexercises, provisions must be made to sustain political and organisational motiva-tions over the course of time, and probablyof successive governments. However, sustainability may not always be a priority. Some specific targets mayrequire only short-term alliances of a par-ticular type, and a pre-occupation with cre-ating a sustainable system may inadvertent-ly result in rigidities of thought and action,and the creation of institutional orthodox-ies that become resistant to change. 10. InterdependencyIn our globalised world, no country, region or locality is an island. At every level thereare biological and political inter-dependen-cies. Health and health services are influ-enced by global concerns such as work-force mobility, air quality, internationalagreements and other factors that transcendnational boundaries. Local and nationalhealth policies can have unintended effectsbeyond their own borders. The number ofinternational agreements is growing.Increasingly such agreements recognise thelinks between health and other policies. 11. CreativityHealth policy and governance are not securely predictable and linear exercises:many of the contextual factors may changeover time - sometimes quite rapidly andunexpectedly. Tightly specified ends arenot necessarily achieved by tightly speci-fied means, and public health challengesmay not be solved by current and conven-tional approaches. Successful implementa-tion requires imagination, experimentation,innovation and flexibility on the part ofstakeholders and institutions. Trade-offs A further book is now planned for launchin summer 2006. As editor, I shall be invit-ing a number of international thinkers to eurohealth Vol 11 No 1 4MADRID FRAMEWORK \"behind all evidence, there are moral andpolitical, as well asnumerical, values\"consider and critique the Madrid Framework, to contribute essays on thedimensions, to write about the nature of'constructive conversation', and about thepolitics and ethics of the trade offs that wehave to make. In particular I will be asking these authors to pay attention to the tensions and con-flicts that can occur both within each dimension, and also, between them. Inwhat we may call the ' internal domain ' of each dimension, although its elements areconceived as being coherent, the bundle of'goods' described may well contain mutualcontradictions. The term 'trade off' is given in the Oxford English Dictionary as \"A balance achievedbetween two desirable but incompatiblefeatures; a sacrifice made in one area toobtain benefits in another; a bargain, a com-promise.\" Even a superficial considerationof what has gone before will suggest that inwhat we may call the ' external domain ' of the dimensions, each dimension can comeinto conflict with any of the others. As an example, take the ' internal domain ' of 'Equity and Fairness'. The words 'equi- ty' and Howeverboth 'equity' and 'fairness' imply the needto judge between groups or individuals who may be identified by such qualities associoeconomic status, ethnicity, age, gen-der, and so on. How are these differentaspects of inequality or difference to be pri-oritised, weighted, balanced, in the name ofequity? There is an assumption of social'solidarity' in the values embedded in thisdimension, but the boundaries of this soli-darity are uncertain. How strong a sense ofsocial solidarity do we have - with our fel-low citizens; with our fellow Europeans;with the global population; with the gener-ations yet unborn? In the Framework's ' external domain ' an obvious conflict is that between the public good of 'Equity and Fairness', and the pri-vate good of 'Choice'. Yet 'Equity andFairness' as easily be in competitionwith 'Evidence' or 'Local Empowerment'.The Madrid Framework is composed toallow transparency about such competi-tion, to illuminate the paradoxes created bythese internal and external conflicts thathave to be reconciled and managed. European Values The Madrid Framework was invented tomake our values explicit, values that colourour aspirations and shape our judgments;values that define our relationships; explain the organisations that we create, and howwe behave in them; values that determinethe goals we set ourselves; that explain howwe judge ourselves, and the behaviour ofothers. We wish to make these values asclear and visible as possible so that we canexamine and question them. A pragmatic definition of values is given by the Oxford English Dictionary: 'the princi-ples or standards of a person or society, thepersonal or societal judgement of what isvaluable and important in life'. It is worthrecalling that values in relation to healthtargeting, for example, equity, excellence,efficiency, and so on, reflect our judge- ments of what is valuable. Those of us who have so far been party to this project have made much of theEuropean nature of our values in respect ofpolicies for health. For many the term'European' has become a code word for'Not the USA'. On reflection, this is amanifestly unfair use of the term, becausethe values which we describe as essentiallyEuropean are in fact globally recognisedand owned, and not least by very manycolleagues and citizens in the USA. But our values do have their origin in a long and distinguished history of Europeanthought, and a great European tradition ofpublic health. They are characterised by anemphasis on equity and fairness and on theneed to sensitively, and democratically,mediate between this social fairness and thewish for individual freedom of choice.They are also values informed by a recogni-tion that the public health is of crucialimportance to the quality of everyone'sindividual health, and that while solidarity in health may well be a political aspiration,it is also a biological and an epidemiologicalimperative. It is because these fine sentiments can so easily be degraded into a coarse sentimen-tality, that we need constantly to re-exam-ine our values with some rigour, so thatthey can be used as tools for humanprogress, and not just as weapons in thebattle of competing political ideologies andparties. The Madrid Framework is incom-plete. It is designed to remain incomplete,so that in the hands and hearts of all whoconsider it and attempt to apply it to theirplanning and their performance, it can becritiqued, modified, improved, and in everylocation, and in relation to every challengeof health policy and governance, it can continue to evolve in the light of your experience, and prove fit for your purposes. eurohealth Vol 11 No 1 5MADRID FRAMEWORK REFERENCES 1.

The main focus so far has beenon funding and staffing of health systems. 1 Often this produces a somewhat dismalpicture of financing shortfalls and bureau-cratic quagmires. Could there be an alter-native approach through bottom up devel-opment in specific disease areas? Our recent review of cancer services took in the Czech Republic, Hungary andPoland. As well as carrying out a literaturesearch we interviewed key leaders amongclinicians, funders and patient groups. Aswell as the obvious urgent requirement forbetter outcomes and services there ispotential for achieving these quickly withina three to five year period. There can be areal chance of \"catching up.\" Current situation Compared with old Europe the main fea-tures are firstly that there is a higher rate ofincidence and mortality from cancer. In2000 age standardised mortality rates inPoland were 17% higher, Czech Republic33% and Hungary 50% higher than in theold EU-15. Secondly there have been rapidincreases in incidence over the 1990s, particularly for breast, prostate and coloncancer. Table 1 shows rates of cancer forwomen in the Czech republic. There is alsoa high level of lung cancer although recent-ly with some switch in genders with malecancers declining and lung cancer increas-ing among females. Cancer of the cervixcontinues to be high, with an incidence rateof 21 cases per 1,000 people that hasremained unchanged since the early 1980sand is more than twice that found in theUK and Scandinavia. Many of these cancer deaths are in younger age groups. Our estimates are that at least30% of premature life years lost in the newmember states are due to cancer and thisweight is likely to rise as prevention andimproved treatment reduce mortality fromcoronary heart disease. There are also sig-nificant costs from disability and reducedquality of life in survivors. Outcome fig-ures are based on Eurocare 3, which coverspatients diagnosed in 1990-94 and mea-sures survival over the five years to 1999. 2 For all cancers affecting female patientsfive-year survival rates were 43.4% in theCzech Republic and 35.3% in Poland com-pared to 51.2% across Europe and 64.3%in the USA. For breast cancer Poland andthe Czech Republic were achieving a 63%survival rate compare to 76% overall inEurope. The high levels of lung cancer inmales led to a wider survival gap for men. Given the low level of resources available in 1990-94 the Eurocare comparisons rep-resent a significant achievement. Healthprofessionals were achieving rates twothirds as good as the Euro rates with lessthan one tenth of the resources. The resultsreflect skills in diagnosis and access tosurgery, as there has been very limitedaccess to new drug therapies or radiothera-py. So far from these survival rates reflect-ing discredit on health services they in factare indicative of great achievement in verydifficult circumstances. These results were achieved with very low levels of spending on cancer services.Spending in the USA on cancer care is5-6% of total health care spending; 3it is unlikely that the proportion is any higherCan the new EU members catch up in cancer care?

At least for Hungary expenditure figures from theNational Insurance Fund of $191 millionfor cancer care in 2002 show that spendingis likely to be even lower. Table 2 presentssome estimates for spending on cancer care. The achievements in the past with these limited resources have been great but nowthere are new challenges of patient expecta-tions and a rising incidence. The pattern ofspending and organisation seems to reflecthistorical patterns with little fit betweenneed/workload, while the old strengths ofhigh quality skills are likely to fail due to growing migration. A number of our respondents spoke of the system as \"fragmented\" and \"diffused\".Money did not follow the patient andincentives to increase workload were few.In some units we visited there was littlesense of intense workload pressure. In factwe were told of the under-use of costlynew equipment in diagnostics and radio-therapy. Some specific comments both positive and negative are shown in Box 1. Towards a new model of cancer care The new Member States have had a greatstrength in the past in the extraordinarycommitment of doctors and other healthprofessionals to give good care even withlimited resources. At present howeverinvestment has a focus on big-ticket items,such as scanners and linear accelerators,which tend to pull expenditure into a fewlarge centres. There is little investment innetworking and communication, whichcould raise total capability in the system.This model of cancer care investment interms of big-ticket projects needs to bereplaced by a model promoting integrationfrom prevention through to palliative care. The aim of the model would be to ensure that scarce professional resources are usedmore effectively in a changing health envi-ronment. This should be regarded as essen-tial for international competitiveness andaccreditation. An integrated programmewould cover initiatives in the following sixareas and for each we define first steps,which could produce real results withinthree years. Prevention : The essential element here is to strengthen programmes for tobacco con- trol. 4The WHO programme sets the framework but any general reductions insmoking will take time both to happen andto have an impact on health status. Giventhe urgency of the problem there may wellbe a case for special measures to reach highrisk groups such as men over thirty whohave been smokers for ten years or more,pregnant women, and patients with dia-betes or coronary heart disease who arealready receiving treatment. Screening and early detection : A good start has been made here in the two key areas of mammography and screening for cancer ofthe cervix. Case studies in Hungary showthat such programmes are cost effective. 5 It is essential to move forward to ensure pop-ulation coverage on a three-year basis,without this many resources will be wasted eurohealth Vol 11 No 1 7CANCER CARE Table 2 HEALTH CARE EXPENDITURES, 2002 (US $ PPP bn/m.)

There is no system of home care and weonly have 2 hospices and 120 terminal care beds ratherthan the 200 needed.\" Health fund manager Czech Republic On a more positive note: \"We act as a virtual centre for South Moravia. We are theonly comprehensive cancer centre in the Czech Republic.\" Specialist Brno \"In 1997 there was a new law on patients rights. Thischanged a culture of belief that it was better to lie. Thenew move requires cooperation between physician andpatient.\"Patient association Hungary \"The Soros Foundation has been active in funding palliative care and a specialist nursing service.\" Specialist Hungaryon opportunistic screening. Screening for colorectal cancer could begin through pilotschemes in high-risk areas. Diagnostics and Assessment : Clearer stan- dards need to be set for speed of treatment and information increased on options. Thekey challenge will be to improve staging sothat more patients will be treated quickly atearlier stages. Treatment and care : There will be a move towards more complex choices with differ- ing sequences and options for surgery,chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Therapywill be longer and more intense, withgreater urgency about monitoring patientexperience and fatigue. Follow up and continuing treatment : It will be vital to improve medical records to ensure that patients at risk are recalled.This will be particularly important withlonger-term prophylaxis for breast cancer Palliative care : There has been some progress towards improving the service in Hungary through an initiative by the SorosFoundation but much more needs to bedone. Investment during transition We recommend a one-off investment pro-gramme to assist with the transition. It isunrealistic to expect that national insurancefunds will be able to find the investmentrequired when they are under greater pres-sure to maintain funding for immediatecare. One consequence of short-term finan-cial deficits is the starvation of investmentand innovation, increasing problems ofquality and staff retention. Key stepswould include international/charitablesponsorship for National Fight CancerFunds ($50 million each for Hungary andthe Czech Republic and $100 million forPoland). A strategy group with representa-tives from national Ministries, HealthFunds, oncologists and patient groupscould also be set up. This would set direc-tions to which a full-time Fight CancerFund manager would report. The national social insurance funds face a massive challenge in formulating long-termstrategies for allocating limited funds to arange of services. Many face uncertainfutures, in terms of income streams, whichare heavily dependent upon national eco-nomic performance. There are many othercompeting priorities besides cancer and,above all, the need to push through fundingand organisational reforms on a grandscale. Somehow within this context, theconcept of a national cancer investmentplan, supported by the relevant profession- al bodies, needs to be established with aclearer set of investment and funding prior-ities, which are compatible with the widerreform programme. We suggest a set of initiatives that should be key elements inthe strategy (Box 2) New developments The aim of these new initiatives would beto create a momentum for quality anddevelopment. 6We would hope that new developments would see the Fight CancerFunds having increased confidence inchange and a momentum for serviceimprovement. They would be essential toensuring that the health professions in newmember states can play their full role. Inthe interwar period cancer services werebeginning to develop strongly, for examplethrough the Marie Curie Institute inWarsaw and the Masaryk Institute in Brno.EU membership provides an opportunityfor a move towards international collabora-tion and even leadership in reducing thesocial and human costs of cancer. The programme would also contribute to a more innovation and development orien-tated approach to health care. At presentmost of the focus in external research hasbeen on the health system as a whole.

Unless such strategies are brought forward health system change is indeedgoing to present a somewhat dismal pictureof unending conflict over deficits. An innovation focus may in fact help in opening up opportunities for potential sav-ings through redeployment of resources.For example it is possible to financeimprovements in chemotherapy by movingaway from in patient hospital treatment toambulatory care. 7 Development orientation can also helpwith retention of younger staff as well asattracting back some who have already left.If health care is seen as an exciting area towork in, matching progress with otherareas of society and the economy moregenerally, then there is likely to be a greaterrate of retention of key staff. Internalmigration across occupations as able peopleleave to work in other roles is as much athreat to health services as external migra-tion within medicine. Developments in the cancer field can also help with the development of specialistnursing skills, as well as in systems forscreening and prevention. The linksbetween health development and socialgain require specific action and initiativesin key areas. Conclusions The new member states in the EU facechallenges in reducing a disease burdenfrom cancer that is already much higherthan in the old EU, and set to rise furtherwithout effective action. Levels of expendi-ture for cancer services, mainly treatmentsare low ranging between 3% and 5% oftotal health expenditure. Yet survival out-comes achieved in the 1990s were abouttwo thirds of those in Western Europe.This was a remarkable achievement giventhe low level of resources available fortreating patients diagnosed in 1990-94.Without modernisation the core strength ofcommitment from dedicated clinicians, islikely to be eroded as some younger pro-fessionals migrate. There will also be prob-lems in meeting new challenging standardsfor clinical governance. There can be a new model of cancer care, which leads towards balanced and coordi-nated investment in prevention, screening,and treatment and follow up care. Themodel also supplies many opportunities forinternational partnership, and alreadygreater participation in clinical trials canserve as a good start. Use of this model isessential to achieving reductions in cancerincidence and mortality. We are impressedby the potential for services in the newmember states to catch up, but the oppor-tunities must be taken soon. Recommendations Another key recommendation would be todevelop and attract funding sources for theFight Cancer Funds, which will provide animpetus to the strategies. The new model ofcancer care requires a one-time investmentin care programmes, staffing and intensivecare. It is hardly realistic to expect that theinvestment required can be found fromexisting health funds during a time of greatpressure on public sector budgets. Possiblecontributors to the Funds would be theEU, World Bank, philanthropists such asthe Soros Foundation and corporatedonors. National training and staffing programmes are needed to secure the range of new skillsrequired for the implementation ofresource plans. These would develop skillsfor both for newer recruits and experiencedstaff working in the service. A key leadersprogramme for staff in their thirties includ-ing short-term international placementsand opportunities for leadership trainingmight also be developed. The creation of national initiatives in quali- ty assurance, collaborating with major cen-tres in developing networks and protocolswould be crucial for using the full potentialand commitment of staff in the services.Roles and opportunities could also bedeveloped for specialist nurses who canmake a crucial contribution to screening,treatment and follow up care. Finally it isalso important to develop further nationalinitiatives in palliative and terminal care.Many patients are suffering from a greatdeal of pain as well as distress from othersymptoms. The goals of privacy, dignityand control in the last stages of life are vitaland achievable. EU Accession is already having unexpected and positive effects in economic terms. Itcould also be the opportunity for newsocial initiatives. The World Cancer Reportwas an excellent start but did not deal withthe way forward for this region in anydetail. 8We present here a programme of investment, which could allow the regionto catch up in terms both of process qualityand outcomes. There can be new partner-ships to reduce disease burden and to addsubstantially to life expectancy for the citizens of the new member states. eurohealth Vol 11 No 1 9CANCER CARE REFERENCES 1.

On the rareoccasions when more major, structuralreforms have been attempted, those, too,have been implemented in a careful step-by-step manner. As pressures for major reform have mount- ed, a growing number of SHI countriesfind themselves confronting a predictabledilemma. The combined impact of incre-mental reform has begun to put at risk theircore commitment to the central social valueof solidarity. While each reform alone hasonly a minor effect, the overall impact insome systems has begun to threaten thelong time strategic balance between equityand efficiency. To forestall undesirableconsequences, it has been suggested thatnational policymakers should considerintroducing a process of what can betermed 'strategic incrementalism', that is,assessing each individual change in terms ofits likely impact on the totality of healthsystem activity. 1Such an approach would enable decision-makers to take on boardthe full implications of specific incrementalreforms, and perhaps make adjustments inlight of those implications, before they areadopted. The present debate in SHI countries con- tains a variety of different reform proposals.Where proposed changes are similar, theysometimes are being discussed and/or intro-duced to achieve rather different health sys-tem objectives. This article first reviewscurrent proposed and/or introducedreforms across seven SHI countries in west-ern Europe (Austria, Belgium, France,Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands, andSwitzerland). It then analyses these reformsin terms of the types of change being pro-posed and their possible implications forthese systems' overall character. Proposals made or under discussion Austria: purchasing agencies; additionalcost-sharing The Austrian government is promoting the creation of purchasing agencies(Gesundheitsplattformen , or Health Platforms), flanked by a Federal Health Agency ( Bundesgesundheitsagentur ), at the regional and federal level. The main task ofthese public agencies would be to purchaseservices according to predefined qualitystandards and prices. Full implementationof the proposals would result in a loss ofautonomy in contractual powers for sick-ness funds and in a purchaser-provider splitin hospitals and institutions owned by sick-ness funds. In addition, doctors worry thatHealth Platforms might gain monopolypower in purchasing their services. In 2004,Health Platforms with limited powers wereintroduced. The Federation of AustrianSocial Security Institutions and theAustrian Medical Association succeeded innegotiating a vote within the health plat-forms, with sickness funds having a vetoright in matters concerning ambulatorycare and the government in matters of in-patient care (the Medical Association hasno veto rights). At the end of 2005, whenthe federal and the regional governmentsare expected to come to agreement aboutintegrated regional health service planning,the role of Health Platforms is likely to bestrengthened. 2 In addition, the Austrian debate currentlyfocuses on increasing and extending cost-sharing. Co-insurance of 20% has beenproposed for certain medical examinations.Increases of existing cost-sharing arrange-ments have occurred and additional mea-sures are being discussed. Belgium: activity-based hospital financing; changed drug reimbursement To date, only marginal changes have been adopted, such as minor adjustments in thebenefit package. Proposed and discussedchanges include an activity-based hospitalpayment system for certain treatments, andenhanced ment; activity-based hospital payment sys-tem; union of sickness funds The 13 August 2004 Health Insurance Law introduced two important changes. First,France is establishing a mandatory GPgate-keeping system. Before 1 July 2005,Current reform proposals in social health insurance countries Richard B Saltman is Professor of Health Policy andManagement, Rollins Schoolof Public Health, EmoryUniversity, Georgia (USA)and Research Director theEuropean Observatory onHealth Systems and Policies,Ministerio de Sanidad yConsumo, Madrid (Spain). Hans FW Dubois is Research Officer, EuropeanObservatory on HealthSystems and Policies,Ministerio de Sanidad yConsumo, Madrid hansdubois@post.harvard.eduRichard B Saltman and Hans FW Dubois \"incremental reform has begun to put at riskthe core commitment tothe central social valueof solidarity\"every insured individual (16 years and older) must choose a GP or specialist to behis/her m\u00e9decin traitant , in agreement with the doctor. When patients visit a doctorwithout being referred by their m\u00e9decin traitant , or if the patient doesn't have a m\u00e9decin traitant , he/she can be faced with an increase of the ticket mod\u00e9rateur (co- payment) due to two reasons: a diminution of the reimbursement and possibly anincrease of the doctor's fee. An exception ismade for emergencies and certain speciali-ties and medical situations. This new system will replace the voluntary GP gate-keeping ( m\u00e9decin referent ) system that was introduced in 1998. Currently, no new patients and GPs can be included in them\u00e9decin referent system and it will be fully abolished at the end of 2005. Second, a mandatory co-payment for all physician visits ( participation forfaitaire ) was created. Since 1 January 2005, allpatients pay a \u20ac1 fee for every doctor-visit, both to GPs and specialists. While theexisting (relatively high) proportional usercharges have been neutralised by supple-mental insurances, this fixed payment is notreimbursable. This \u20ac1 co-payment also applies to a number of specific groups whoare otherwise entitled to full reimburse-ment. Only the very poor (and illegalimmigrants) who receive health insurancefrom the government, pregnant women(after six months) and children under 18 areexcluded from this co-payment. The \u20ac1 fee is small (and capped at \u20ac50 per year), but as seen in other countries, once such a mea-sure is in place, the amount can be raisedrelatively easily. Additionally, an activity-based hospital payment system will be introduced inFrance, replacing global budgets for publichospitals and the per diem payments forprivate clinics. Lastly, a union was estab-lished of the three major French sicknessfunds (covering about 95% of the Frenchpopulation), which now negotiates medicalcontracts, fixes reimbursement rates andmodifies the list of reimbursable medicalservices. 3 Germany: citizen insurance and/or flat-ratepremiums In Germany two different reforms of the SHI system have been proposed, one bythe sitting Social Democratic (SPD) gov-ernment (and major trade unions), the sec-ond by the Conservative opposition.Neither reform plan is expected to beimplemented until after the nextParliamentary elections in autumn 2006.The SPD plan would end the current exemption from the statutory system forGermans who earn more than \u20ac46,800 a year. This proposed B\u00fcrgerversicherung (citizen insurance) would require all citi- zens to buy a standard SHI package, pur-chased from either a statutory or a com-mercial sickness fund. By expanding thestatutory system to incorporate higherincome earners, the statutory system wouldbecome more economically sustainable (bybringing in new revenues) and less regres-sive (higher income earners would directlycross-subsidise lower income earners). Quite differently, the Conservative opposi- tion CDU/CSU have proposed to restruc-ture flat-rate pre-mium ( Gesundheitspr\u00e4mie ). This income- independent premium would be \u20ac109 for adults, plus \u20ac60 for their employers. The contribution is capped at 7% of the insured's total income and will only applyto those currently insured by the statutorysystem. People with earnings above theincome limit will still be able to opt-outfrom the statutory scheme. The sicknessfund contribution for children, as well asfor the unemployed and low-incomehouseholds, would be financed directlyfrom taxation. 4 Luxembourg: cost sharing On 9 November 2004, the Sickness Fund Union implemented several incrementalchanges to deal with its increasing deficit. Itlimited reimbursement of laboratory analy-ses, increased hospital cost-sharing, intro-duced cost-sharing for certain benefits, andincreased premiums. There are also propos-als to increase the role for generic drugs.Hospital payment continues to be based onbudgets, introduced by a 1992 law andoperational since 1995. provider pay- ment system; no-claim bonus; private stan-dard insurance Since 1 January 2005, the Netherlands has utilised a DTC (Diagnosis TreatmentCombinations) system to pay hospitals andindependent care centres. The DTC systemis somewhat broader than DRGs(Diagnostic Related Groups) because it alsoincludes remuneration of medical special-ists and outpatient care. Moreover, in thecase of DRGs, a clinical administrator isresponsible for classifying each case, whilewith DTCs this is in the hands of the doc-tors themselves. Lastly, while DRGs areoften coded at the beginning of a treatment,DTCs are coded after discharge. About10% of DTCs are subject to negotiation eurohealth Vol 11 No 1 11HEALTH POLICY \"In Germany two different reforms of theSHI system have beenproposed\"between sickness funds and providers, while the government fixes the tariff for theremaining 90%. Further, an annual \u20ac255 no-claim bonus has been introduced as of 1 January 2005. If an insured individual does not utilise anyservices during the year, \u20ac255 will be rebat- ed. The cost of any services used will bededucted from this refund, except for GPservices, care for children under 18 yearsold, maternity care and midwifery. Thisrebate is financed through an increase inthe flat-rate premium paid by those insuredby the sickness fund. The average flat-ratepremium (weighted for the number ofinsured) increased by 25.4% from \u20ac306.86 in 2004 to \u20ac384.72 in 2005. 5 The most important reform, however, isthe proposal by the Dutch Ministry ofHealthcare, Welfare and Sports to expandthe statutory health insurance system to allDutch citizens, beginning 1 January 2006.It has been approved by the SecondChamber of Parliament and is scheduled tobe voted upon by the First Chamber inJune 2005. Currently, Dutch citizens withan annual salary above \u20ac33,000 are exclud- ed from SHI and rely on private insurancepackages that often differ from the statuto-ry social insurance package. The Ministry'snew approach would create one standard(curative care) benefit package for all citi-zens, regardless of income. At a later stage,this package is also likely to incorporatelong-term care benefits currently providedunder the Exceptional Medical ExpensesAct. The proposed, mandatory, standardinsurance would be along the lines of cur-rent health insurance and could be pur-chased from both non-profit and for-profitprivate health insurers. 6 Switzerland: activity-based hospital pay-ment system; selective contracting Two SHI reform packages are being dis- cussed in Switzerland (see Box). In 2004,both Swiss chambers of Parliament(National Council and Council of States)approved reform proposal 1A. In March2005 both chambers also approved propos-al 1C, which will be implemented 1January 2007. Proposal 1D has beenapproved by the Council of States, whilethe National Council is still debating aboutit. Proposals 1B and 2B have still not beenconsidered by either council. Lastly, pro-posal 2A is likely to be changed, as theCouncil of States is expected to propose anew system to replace the fixed dualfinancing system by some form of singlesource financing of which the details havenot yet been released. Since 2002, all Cantonal governments have had to pay at least 50% of the hospital billsfor the basic mandatory insurance package,for multi-patient wards in both public andprivate hospitals admitted to the Cantonalhospital list and also for private rooms inpublic hospitals. In practice, Cantons gen-erally choose to pay more than 50%.Cantons also pay the investment costs ofpublic hospitals. Before 2002, Cantonalgovernments did not subsidise or plan pri-vate institutions. After 2002, in return forpaying their expenses, Cantons could plan,for the institutions admitted to the list, thenumber of both public beds in private hos-pitals and all beds in public hospitals. If thereform is implemented, there will be a fixedpercentage that all cantons have to pay forhospital bills, for whatever type of bed,including investment costs. Sickness fundpremiums in Switzerland are relativelyregressive, so the political left prefers thatthe Cantons pay for the major part of hos-pital costs out of taxation. As the Cantonalsubsidy would also apply to for-profitorganisations admitted to the Cantonal list,government planning capacities would thusexpand to this type of organisation. Within three years after the new financing arrangement has been implemented, theFederal Council is to put forward its visionfor a new system, in which Cantonal gov-ernments will transfer to the sickness fundsthe money that Cantons now pay to hospi-tals, and the sickness funds will then signcontracts with hospitals. This will make eurohealth Vol 11 No 1 12HEALTH POLICY BOX First package:1A - The risk adjustment fund will be maintained for at least five more years; the financing law will be extended until a new law (in the second package) isapproved; the nursing tariff is frozen until a new tariff is implemented latest at theend of 2006; and a legal framework for an electronic insurance card will be creat-ed. 1B - Sickness funds will no longer be required to offer a free choice of provider within their Canton. While the Canton defines the minimum number of providersthe insured should have access to, sickness funds are free to negotiate andchoose the particular service providers they want to contract with. 1C - Health insurance premiums will be reduced by at least 50% for children and young low and middle income students. Cantons have considerable latitude indefining these groups more precisely. Cantons must spend a minimum amount ofmoney on this type of premium relief in order to be eligible for a federal subsidy. 1D - General cost-sharing (currently 10% of all incurred health care costs) will be increased to 20%. The annual total will still be capped at 700 Swiss Francs peradult (350 Swiss Francs per child under 18). Second package:2A - Hospitals will no longer be financed by objectives (currently also often on the basis of per-diems), but by services delivered. 2B - Managed care, while already widely applied, will be formalised in the health insurance law.\"The 'citizens' Germanyand the Netherlands,would have far-reaching organisationaleffects\"sickness funds the only payers for hospital services, combining both tax and premiumrevenues. Capital costs will remainfinanced mostly by the Cantons. Thisreform is planned for implementation in2007-2008, but as there might be a referen-dum, the process could be delayed.\" Inother words: take out last sentence, change'will' into 'might' and 'might' into 'could'. Assessing the patterns Several clusters of activity can be discernedamong this rather disparate catalogue ofrecent reforms, expected future measures,and proposals under discussion. While allof these reforms have some degree of finan-cial implication for the overall cost of running these health systems, they reflectdifferent approaches not just to financialquestions but also to the logic of healthsector reform generally. There would appear to be three distinct categories. The first can be termed short-term financial fixes, typically seeking toraise additional revenue and/or to restrictthe demand for services. These includeincreased patient charges, deductibles, co-payments, no-claims bonuses, and othersimilar devices. A special category here isthe growth of flat-rate premiums ratherthan income-tied contributions, as exist inthe Netherlands and have been proposedby the CDU/CSU in Germany. Thisemphasis on individual incentive mecha-nisms has been growing over the past ten tofifteen years, 7and is an example of isolated incremental measures that, taken together,can lead to the erosion of solidarity. The second category involves organisation- al or structural changes that are essentiallyinstitutionalised versions of short-termfinancial fixes. That is, they focus almostentirely on cost issues, however they utilisea new office or organisational entity to doso. The example here seems to be purchas-ing. While purchasing has become quitesophisticated in tax-funded health systemsover the past fifteen years, 8it is a relatively undeveloped activity in SHI countries.Austria's 'health platforms,' and Switzer-land's proposal 1B to allow selective con-tracting by sickness funds, represent twoefforts to develop purchasing further. The third category consists of more major institutional changes. Here there are severalgood examples. One - activity-based hos-pital payment (Belgium, Germany, TheNetherlands, possibly France andSwitzerland) - could, if properly regulated,encourage hospitals to increase their oper-ating efficiency. A second, using public taxmoney to pay for insurance premiums forchildren (Switzerland, CDU/CSU inGermany), is an equity-oriented measurethat would expand publicly financed cover-age beyond the unemployed and indigent.While both measures represent a majorchange, neither alters the fundamentalsocial and organisational landscape. Two other institutional reforms, however, represent major change in the nationalorganisation of SHI systems: mandatorygate-keeping (France) and a universal 'citi-zens' or 'standard' insurance (Germany,Netherlands). The introduction of gate-keeping in France is intended not only toreduce unnecessary demand and thusexpenditures, but it is directed also atimproving continuity of care. The changethus addresses a longstanding criticism ofSHI systems, which argues that they lackclinical coordination (Netherlands has gatekeeping and thus is an exception). Amongother advantages, gatekeeping in France isexpected to improve regular medical con-tact with older people, thereby reducingavoidable deaths such as those during the2003 heat wave. The 'citizens' and 'standard' insurance pro- posals in Germany and the Netherlands,respectively, would have far-reachingorganisational effects. In each case, thereform would end the long-standing opt-out (voluntary in Germany, mandatory inthe Netherlands) of high-income earnersfrom the statutory SHI system, creatingwhat would be a universal statutory sys-tem. However, the purpose in doing so isquite different between the German andDutch government approaches. InGermany, the centre-left SPD governmenthas previously sought to incorporate agreater number of citizens into the statuto-ry system. For example, the earnings ceil-ing below which membership is mandatoryhas risen 16.9 % in Germany between 2001and 2005 (from \u20ac40,034 to \u20ac46,800). In the Netherlands, conversely, the centre-rightgovernment has avoided expanding eligibil-ity for the statutory system, raising itsmuch lower ceiling only by 2.3% duringthe same period (from \u20ac32,251.73 to \u20ac33,000). For Germany, induction of higher incomecitizens into the statutory system would bea way to raise SHI revenues by increasingsubsidies from wealthier citizens, with theintent of stabilising and reinforcing theexisting system. For the Dutch govern-ment, a universal statutory system wouldbe an important stepping stone to market-oriented competition among sickness eurohealth Vol 11 No 1 13HEALTH POLICY \"what appears to be nearly the same reformmay be intended toproduce quite differentresults\"eurohealth Vol 11 No 1 14HEALTH POLICY funds, in effect attempting yet again to fulfill the vision of the 1987 DekkerCommittee, thus changing the core struc-ture of the existing SHI system fundamen-tally.

Exploring possibilities for consumer choice in the German health care system Silvia Anton, Lisa Klautzer, Silke T\u00f6nshoff, Han de Vries,James P KahanThis article reports on the results of a pro- ject conducted to explore feasible reformoptions in the German health care system*.More specifically, the project examinedpolicy instruments to address the inherentproblems of the Statutory Health Insurancesystem ( Krankenkassen ), where more than 90% of the population is currently insured.These instruments include demand- andsupply-side measures such as the extensionof patients' cost sharing, a modification ofthe benefits catalogue and organisationalchanges such as gatekeeper systems andselective contracting. Traditionally, three principles are funda- mental to the German system, and may beused to test the reform options. The first is the solidarity principle, which has two components: one of which impliesa 'sharing of health risks' in the sense indi-viduals may demand health services on thebasis of need ( Bedarfsprinzip ), and one that ensures contributions are based on abilityto pay irrespective of costs incurred to thehealth system ( Leistungsf\u00e4higkeitsprinzip ). 1 The second principle is that the Germanhealth insurance system is funded throughemployer and employee contributionsbased upon wages, as opposed to generaltaxation, risk-based health insurance, orcontributions based on total income. The third principle is that of subsidiarity, meaning that the state delegates the organi-sation of the health care system to therespective organisations of health careinsurance bodies and medical specialtysocieties. 2 The factors contributing to Germany's cur-rent health system problems fall into threecategories: revenue, expenditure and sys-tem structure. Revenue problems arecaused by a weak financing base, transfersto other sectors of the social system, and asinking wage/GDP ratio.

The system structure is alsosuffering from under-provision, over-pro-vision and mis-provision of specific ser-vices to the general population, somethingattributed in 2001 by the Advisory Councilfor Concerted Action in Health Care to thegeneral lack of transparency and providers'autonomy within the German health caresystem. Approach Following an extensive international litera-ture review that provided available evi-dence regarding the effects of 'consumerchoice in health care', we designed and car-ried out a series of three runs of a seminargame to stimulate debate among the majorstakeholders of the German health caresystem. Each run of the game used a differ-ent scenario: Back to the Future featured managed care and a number of cost-control measures such as co-payments and deductibles. As You Like It that featured different pack- ages of benefits available to the insured at different prices. Renaissance of a Single Payer System in which a quasi-governmental body was the single insurer, and used its monopolypower to control expenditures. Each of these scenarios was presented to a different set of stakeholder representatives,who visited the Bertelsmann Stiftung for awhole day of participation. The stakehold-er representatives were divided into fourteams, representing providers, insurers,government and social partners. Each stakeholder team did a SWOT analy- sis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities,Threats) of the scenario, based on its per-spective. The SWOT analysis led to recom-mendations for adjusting the reforms givenin the scenario, which were subsequentlydiscussed in a plenary session. At the end,participants were asked to assess thefavourability of the scenarios (before modification in the morning and aftermodification in the afternoon) compared to the present situation. Consumer Choice and Responsibility Theoretical foundations. Our literature review3systematically exam- ined 184 separate publications, of which the majority were published in internationalpeer-reviewed journals. It focused on theeffects of various degrees of consumerchoice on health service utilisation, healthstatus, satisfaction, equity and macro-economic effects. The current economicparadigm of consumer choice assumes thatconsumers behave rationally and maximisethe utility they receive from consumption,over a set of preferences. In health carethese preferences may include any attribut-es of the medical care consumed (for exam-ple, provider, treatment, time, cost, qualityetc.). Because considerable uncertaintyexists about future illness, and because peo-ple tend to be risk-averse, consumers oftenchoose to insure themselves against the riskof having future health care costs. This insurance is usually regulated,(and sometimes provided) by the government.In cases where consumers can choosebetween different benefit packages, insur-ance companies, or health plans, a secondlevel of choice alternatives is introduced. Insome cases choices on this second level mayset restrictions to the choice set on the firstlevel, which is for example the case if aninsurance firm only contracts with a limit-ed set of providers or offers a limited bene-fit package. Economic markets function best when con- sumers know what their preferences areand can find a product with the combina-tion of qualities and cost that is best forthem. However, because of existing infor-mation asymmetries between consumers,insurers and providers alike, it is difficultfor consumers to define their preferences;patients often have to rely on the judgmentand advice of the doctors who treat them.Therefore, the concept of consumer choiceis closely connected to the presence ofinformation in the market. When choosing an insurance company, benefits package or level of co-payment,consumers might receive incentives to consume an appropriate (instead of a toolimited or excessive) amount of medicalcare. These incentives can help to minimisethe welfare loss to society as a result ofimperfections in the health insurance mar-ket (for example, moral hazard*). In thissense, the concept of consumer choice is eurohealth Vol 11 No 1 15HEALTH POLICY \"Consumer choice is not synonymous with individualresponsibility\" * The existence of moral hazard is not only confined to health care or the insurance market, moral hazard describes the chance that a contract willchange the risk-taking behaviour of one or both of the involved parties. Moralhazard can be present in almost any situation involving two parties cominginto agreement with one another. In a contract, each party may have theopportunity to gain from acting contrary to the principles implied by theagreement. also connected to cost containment and shared responsibilities over the consump-tion of medical care by consumers,providers and insurers. Solving these mar-ket imperfections by giving consumersmore choice can lead to more efficient out-comes but might also have an effect on thedistribution of medical care. It is importantto keep in mind that consumer choice isnot synonymous with individual responsi-bility. They may reinforce each other, butone can also exist without the other, or nei-ther may exist. Empirical evidenceTo remedy the existing gaps and improve individual and market outcomes, there havebeen some attempts to provide consumerswith more information, especially in theUS. The current literature is not clear aboutthe extent to which more information actu-ally influences consumer choice, there iseven empirical evidence from some studiesthat people prefer less complexity in infor-mation. 4,5Delivering more information might be helpful but will certainly notreduce the inherent asymmetry in the provision of health care services. Aggregate consumer preferences differ across groups and within groups acrosstime. Much of the literature assumes thatthe choices of consumers are mainly drivenby financial incentives. However, a numberof studies address the fact that there exists awhole range of other issues on which con-sumers want choice, for example quality,coverage, waiting time or travelling distance. Consumer choice in health carecan deal with more than just financialincentives, in principle leading to bettermatching on many dimensions of care. 6 Regarding models of consumer choice andinstruments of cost reduction, there ismuch evidence on the effects within thehealth care system, but little evidence onlarger effects on the economy or society ingeneral. The literature on instruments (suchas deductibles, co-payments, bonuses) isconvergent, they reduce utilisation, whilethe literature on organisational delivery ismixed. The way these instruments are putinto practice can vary enormously and thiscan influence their effects in practice. Wecan therefore conclude that the debate onpicking a model for more consumer choiceshould consider both the instruments (serving as 'building blocks') and the waythey are implemented in a health care sys-tem. This conclusion has been particularlyrelevant when applied to the scenariodevelopment.Results of the seminar game There were three themes that arose from the debate on future reform options thattook place during the runs of the seminargame. Ensure quality of careParticipants' opinions converged in their need never to sacrifice quality of care forefficiency savings. To ensure quality, par-ticipants asked for incentives that guaranteethe provision of high quality care through-out the insurance system. Some of the policy measures mentioned concerned regulation: - leading to explicitly defined quality of care criteria, aligned with state-of-the- art internationally available evidence,also to guarantee consistent qualitythroughout all regions, and - ensuring the use of health technology assessment (HTA); and 'pathways' for(chronic) care as a useful policy instru-ment. The patient representative group in particu-lar foresaw an increase in the quality ofcare in our 'managed care' model scenario,i.e. when providers would have to proveboth their ability to work efficiently anddeliver high quality of care. Physicians andpharmacists however, were concerned thatprice controls would override quality con-trol measures and called for constantimprovement efforts in defining quality ofcare. The insurers stressed the need todefine clear evaluation criteria in measuringquality. Whilst the government would beconcerned over doctors' practice in general,insurers saw great merit in quality controlmeasures sanctioned by a democraticallyelected independent committee. Insurersexpressed scepticism about the possibilityof creating a truly independent and scientific HTA committee. Transfer responsibility to individuals in a sensible way Participants' opinions converged in the belief that increased Eigenverantwortung , (the concept of personal responsibility andchoice, internally translated as 'individualresponsibility') could lead to a reduction ofhealth care expenditure spent on less neces-sary care through supplementary healthcare insurance by insurers' choice.However, a common concern was that ahigh degree of individual responsibilitycould lead to less efficiency, because agreater amount of necessary health careexpenditure would be funded through private incomes and supplementary eurohealth Vol 11 No 1 16HEALTH POLICY \"What seems most striking is the attemptto maintain andactively increase quality control in thesystem\"insurance packages. Participants did not reach consensus over the un/desirability of Eigenverantwortung when this would restrict basic health carecoverage. The insurers expressed this view,arguing that a limited catalogue of healthcare services would cause many of theinsured to seek supplementary insurance.Moreover, the insurers stressed the impor-tance of advocacy committees to representpatients' interests. They also argued thatco-payments are more acceptable thanbonuses when introducing demand-sidepolicy measures to the system. In terms ofstakeholder participation, the governmentrecommended the institutionalisation of ademocratically elected advisory committeefor health. Other aspects of individual responsibility were discussed as well. For example, thegroup representing the government clearlywanted to emphasise prevention by consid-ering it as part of risk sharing(Risikostrukturausgleich *) in order to pro- vide incentives for insurers to invest morein prevention efforts. At the same time, thecause of patients' health would be support-ed by public health initiatives and greateremphasis on information sharing thatwould then enhance the performance ofhealth care systems in terms of efficiency. Debate valuesParticipants discussed the structure of Germany's system in the light of a multi-tude of inherent values in the system. Forinstance, insurers preferred some form oftax based financing system that wouldincrease the financing basis for health careto the current wage-dependent financingmodel. They believed it would tackle theproblems of demographics, employer'scontribution and related anti-competitiveeffects in the German economy. The government group, as well as providers of care, viewed introducing competition asdesirable if it encouraged selective contract-ing. Of great interest was the plea to havesome form of income-based premia reform.Both the provider group in the ManagedCare scenario, as well as the insurers andgovernment groups argued in favour ofsome greater income basis through meansof either tax-based supplementary insur-ance (providers and government), inclusionof higher income groups (patient represen-tative groups), or some income reform that would separate wages and freeze employerscontribution. Discussion Taking different components from differ-ent health care systems and designingfuture scenarios provides us with differentthinking models for reform. 'Playing' withideas that arise from these models andthinking about future reform options forGermany's health care system gives a focusto the debate around consumer choice andresponsibility. For the purposes of inform-ing policymakers about possible reformoptions, seminar gaming allowed us toexplore different ideas and identify barriersto reform. Inherent values such as justice, transparen- cy, solidarity and satisfaction take on dif-ferent meanings in the light of currentchanges, changing roles and engagement ofstakeholders in such discussions about pos-sible futures. Other countries are currentlydebating reform options for their healthcare systems with a similar agenda thatfocuses around consumer choice with anemphasis on consensus: France, in particu-lar, states explicitly that any political deci-sion-making concerning changes to theirhealth care system should be guided bystakeholders' consensus. 7The English are actively engaged in defining consumerchoice but find that \"almost half of thegeneral public does not know what patientchoice is\". 8The 2004 Policy Agenda of the Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare andSport also contains one chapter exclusivelydevoted to \"more individual responsibilityfor citizens\". 9 The attempt to reform Germany's healthcare system requires an ongoing and exten-sive exchange of ideas and recognition ofprevailing interests of different stakehold-ers involved. Exploring the feasibility ofreform through compromise and trade-offsbetween stakeholders presents one way ofdiscussing the viability of future reformoptions for Germany. Our observationsshowed that stakeholders are willing toengage and discuss a set of what may seemat times radical reform options in the lightof concepts such as choice and responsibili-ty for consumers. What seems most strik-ing is the attempt to maintain and activelyincrease quality control in the system. eurohealth Vol 11 No 1 17HEALTH POLICY * The German risk structure compensation scheme takes characteristics like age, gender, status and the various health situation s of the insured persons (for example, chronic disease) into account. By 2007, new morbidity-based indicators will be introduced as well.\"measurement of quality must be incorporated intopotential reform\"Conclusions to inform policy Based on the review of the literature, the scenarios, and our analysis of the interac-tion among participants during the seminargames, we outline a set of conclusions thatmight provide useful information for futurereforms of the German health care system,which has value for other countries facedwith reform as well. Quality assurance needs to be part of any system . This may mean increased oversight of care providers and the use of qualityindicators to assess whether performance isadequate. Personal responsibility in the form of taking charge of one's own health is viewedfavourably . This can be a vehicle for differ- ential contributions to health insurance and/or 'sin taxes' that are earmarked for thehealth care system. However, there is noconsensus on how to define appropriateindividual behaviours to differentiallyration health care services. Personal responsibility in the form of greater co-payment and deductibles/bonus-es are generally acceptable , with a range from favourable to 'necessary evil', as longas there is a safety net to preserve solidari-ty. There is a general agreement that thesemechanisms will reduce utilisation.Whether it also reduces costs depends onthe relationship of cost to utilisation. There is merit in supplementary general tax financing to balance future health careexpenditure . A need was identified to decouple insurance contribution fromwages, and freeze employers' contribu-tions. A general tax financed system wouldensure solidarity is maintained, and sta-bilise the general economic climate. The emphasis on assurance of quality of care as a necessary element of any reformcannot be ignored. It is tempting, in timesof economic headwinds, ageing populationsand expensive technological advances, togive weight to other values such as efficien-cy, cost containment and the power of themarket. This raises the question of know-ing whether or not quality care is beingdelivered; while money can be used as ayardstick for measurement of costs, a cur-rency for quality is not as readily available. If maintenance of quality is to be essential, it makes sense to incorporate the measure-ment of that quality into any potentialreform to the health care system. Althoughfor a long time, the operationalisation andmeasurement of process and outcomes ofmedical care were considered infeasible,recent studies have shown that results inthis area are promising and sometimesquite spectacular. For example, a recentmajor study showed that Americans getonly about half of recommended care. 10 At this point we could express the hopethat Germany fares better in future than itdoes at present and will not decline furtherif there is an increased movement towardsEigenverantwortung and efficiency. However, the truth of the matter is that wesimply do not know. Even estimating thecurrent German situation, much less thefuture, is impossible given the present qual-ity measurement methods and availabilityof data. eurohealth Vol 11 No 1 18HEALTH POLICY * A full description of the project can be found in the (German language) report Eigenverantwortung - Ein article focuses on the con-tributions of RAND Europe to this effort -namely the international literature review,the design and conduct of a seminar gamingexercise to test possible options, and theanalysis of the results of the exercise.REFERENCES 1.

The need to reform mental healthservices was obvious since these countrieshave inherited mental health services dominated by specialised psychiatric insti-tutions, neglect of mental health issues,indifference to human rights and some-times outright political abuse. 1Post com- munist countries have been facing similarchallenges in reforming their mental healthservice, but these processes are not welldocumented. The aim of this paper is todiscuss the development, achievements andchallenges of mental health reform inLithuania and therefore, provide the insightinto the implementation of these reforms inpost communist countries. Lithuania regained its political indepen- dence in 1991 and together with two otherBaltic countries joined European Union in2004. In Lithuania, health care reformstarted in 1992 and mental health reform in1994. Official documents indicate thatmental health is a priority issue of healthpolicy in Lithuania. 2,3,4Other legal acts determine the general principles for mentalhealth reform and regulate the rights ofmental patients. 5,6The main objectives of the national programme of prevention ofmental illnesses adopted in 1999 includeimproving access to mental health services,increasing outpatient mental health services, reducing the number of beds inpsychiatric hospitals and strengtheningprevention measures. 5 The need for mental health services Mental health in Lithuania has been deteri-orating during the last decade. The morbid-ity of mental illness has increased from 3,929 per 100,000 people in 1990 to 4,289 in2000 and 4,627 in 2003. 7Lithuania has one of the highest suicide rates n Europe, whichwas 43.7 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2001,compared with an average in the EU in2000 of 10.2. 8Disability due to mental ill- ness has climbed from 23,000 cases in 1990up to 27,167 in 2000, and to 28,697 by2003. In Lithuania, the NationalCommission of Medical and SocialExpertise decides the level of an individ-ual's disability based on their temporary orpermanent loss of working capabilities dueto illness. At least two reasons can explainthese trends. Firstly, improved access tomental health services, including the estab-lishment of Mental Health Centres, haslead to the improved diagnosis of mental illhealth. Secondly, widespread poverty in thecountry has created an increased need fordisability pensions. The most frequent users of mental health services in Lithuania are people with schiz-ophrenia, which implies that this groupreceives the largest share of financialresources. In 2000 morbidity from schizo-phrenia was 626.4 per 100,000, comparedwith 581.2 for learning disabilities, neurotic, stress, personality 273.2 paradoxical since people withlearning disabilities receive many inpatientservices based on a traditional biomedicalmodel, which is not appropriate.Specialised social and educational pro-grammes would be a more effective way ofreducing disability and promoting integra-tion into society. One of the existing obstacles to the devel- opment of mental health care reform inLithuania and probably in other post com-munist countries is the lack of epidemio-logical data. Effective planning of mentalhealth services requires an analysis of epi-demiological indicators and data on needsassessment. The current indicator of thenumber of patients served by inpatient andoutpatient services does not reflect realneed for mental health services, which in eurohealth Vol 11 No 1 19MENTAL HEALTH Mental health care reform in Lithuania: Development and challenges Vaida Bankauskaite is Research Fellow, European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, Ministerio de Sanidad y E-mail: nigomi@hotmail.comVaida Bankauskaite and Nijole GostautaiteMidttun \"Mental health has been deteriorating during the last decade\"turn does not allow efficient planning of mental health service reform, including therestructuring of health care institutions.There has though been one major attemptto assess community needs for mentalhealth services in the Kaunas region munic-ipality focussing on quality of life. 9 Provision and financing of primary mental health services Municipal mental health centres (MHC) and general practitioners (GPs) provideprimary mental health services inLithuania. MHCs are a municipally ownedinstitutions that have been providing pri-mary health care services since 1994. Therewere 64 MHCs in 2004 in Lithuania, twoof them privately owned. 7The concept of the MHC entails contradictions, becauseprimary mental health services are providedby specialists, such as child and adult psy-chiatrists, psychotherapists, narcologists(who specialise in addiction) and mentalhealth nurses. The number of personnelworking in these centres has been steadilyincreasing: there were 126 adult psychia-trists, 40 child and adolescent psychiatrists,167 nurses, 111 social workers and 71 psy-chologist in all MHCs in 2003. 7Existing regulation prevents MHCs from providingservices not related to primary mentalhealth care, which results in the duplicationof services by GPs. The responsibilities of GPs in terms of mental health in many countries, includingLithuania, consist of diagnosing and treat-ing mental disorders. The World HealthOrganization has stressed the role of theGP in diagnosing mental illnesses.Nevertheless, 65% of patients with mentaldisorders have somatic and not mentalproblems, making it difficult for GPs todiagnose these disorders. Additionally,Lithuania and other post-communist coun-tries have introduced the GP institutionrelatively recently. As a result, GPs maylack experience in providing mental healthservices and thus, may try to avoid 'com-plex' patients. Currently in Lithuania GPsdo not perform their gatekeeper functionfor patients with specialised care needs,since patients have direct access to MHCs. There are differences and similarities between the two primary mental careproviders in Lithuania. MHCs and GPsdiffer in care provision patterns and theauthorisation to prescribe subsidised phar-maceuticals. Therefore, the clients of GPsand MHCs are very different: GP clientsare a mostly healthy general population,while most clients of MHCs have severemental illnesses. Even though MHCs areproviding specialised care (adult psychia-try, child and adolescent, dependency psychiatrists and psychotherapists), bothMHCs and GPs receive per capita financ-ing and MHCs are not funded for specialised services and secondary leveloutpatient services. This situation results incompetition for the same per capita financ-ing and duplication of their functions. Provision and financing of secondary mental health services Mental health services at the secondary level are mostly inpatient and are providedin nine psychiatric hospitals (3,718 beds)and 13 psychosomatic and psychiatricdepartments in general hospitals (342 beds).The number of inpatient beds for peoplewith mental bynearly 40% between 1985-98. 10There were 3,816 beds in 2002 in Lithuania, making 11beds per 10,000 population, which is veryclose to the recommended number of beds.Recently, the number of specialised psychi-atric hospitals has been the same, whilenumber of psychiatric departments in gen-eral hospitals has decreased. Three institu-tions in two main cities in Lithuania pro-vide tertiary mental health care services. Anew trend has been to establish specialisedclinical and research centres devoted tospecific disorders, such as a centre for eat-ing disorders opened recently under theauspices of Vilnius University PsychiatryClinic. The financing of the Lithuanian health sys- tem is complicated, as is the case in otherpost communist countries, and undergoesconstant reform. The State Sickness Fund(SSF) provides 70-80 % of health care bud-get. Municipal budgets and governmentinvestment programmes provide the bal-ance of funds, which mainly covers thecosts of equipment, but is not intended topay for services. Mental health services arefinanced based on a needs assessment,which includes the current scope of carerendered, limited information on epidemio-logical trends, and morbidity and mortalitydata on registered psychiatric patients.Based on this information the SSF signs acontract indicating the limited number ofservices they will pay for each year, basedon fixed rates. Total health expenditure inLithuania reached 5.7% of GDP in 2001. 8 The financing of inpatient services inLithuania has changed many times. Thecurrent principles of financing inpatientcare services date from April 2002. Thereare four categories of inpatient services eurohealth Vol 11 No 1 20MENTAL HEALTH \"GPs may lack experience in providingmental health services\"with different systems of financing (see Table 1). The objective of this regulationwas to strengthen cost containment and thedevelopment of outpatient services, toreduce the deficit of SSF and the number ofinpatients treated. The problem is thatpractically all psychiatric services belong togroups II and III, which require furtherspecification of mental inpatient servicesand due to the absence of such a specifica-tion the provision and financing of inpa-tient mental health services in Lithuania islimited. The total expenditure for mentalhealth services in 2001 was 118.5 millionLitas ( \u20ac1 is approximately to 3.5 Litas, Lithuanian currency) or 8.25% oftotal expenditure for health care services, ofwhich 36% were to social careinstitutions, 34% 19%for subsidised medicines and 2% for dis-ability and rehabilitation programmes. 11 Provision and financing of services provided through social welfare A large share of services for people with mental disorders are provided through thesocial welfare system and regional institu-tions (over 5,500 beds). They are social careservices, yet follow a medical care servicemodel, for example, all residents have theirmedical records and receive pharmaceuti-cals covered from the institutions' fixedbudget. 40% of residentshave schizophrenia, 40% learning disabili-ties 20% with other mental health andneurological disorders including dementia,epilepsy, addiction, or personality disor-ders. The main reason for receiving resi-dential services are medical criteria (diagno-sis, mental status), and not social function-ing, therefore the level of disability of the residents does not always require theseintensive and expensive services. Estimatesby the staff of these institutions suggestthat between 15% to 40 % of the residentscould live in the community with highdegree of autonomy, if they received ade-quate outreach services. 12 The majority of specialised residential carehomes for the mentally disabled operateunder the auspices of regional authoritiesthat are funded from the social servicesbudget. This situation misrepresents a largenumber of residents with mental disordersand distorts calculations of costs of mentalillness, as well as number of long-termbeds. Therefore, a unified mental healthbudget could improve the balance betweenmore and less intensive, in and out patientservices, in response to population needs.In 2001, the Social Welfare and LabourMinistry published a catalogue of socialservices, where, for example, services forthose with developmental disabilities arespecified, but not for those with severe andpersistent mental illnesses. Municipal pay-ment contracts with primary service agen-cies for social services might also provideadditional funding, improve quality andcontinuity of care while expanding thefunctions of the MHC network. Achievements and challenges of mental health reform in Lithuania Mental health reform in Lithuania is relatively new therefore it is difficult toevaluate its development. It is possible toconclude that there have been some positive results as well as many remainingchallenges for this reform effort. The mainachievements include establishing a net-work of municipal mental health centres,improving access to mental health services,developing a strong legal basis for mentalhealth care and introducing positivechanges in the training of mental healthspecialists. In addition, new services, suchas rehabilitation, counselling, and socialservices, have been established during thelast decade. Structural changes in inpatientinstitutions include a reduction in the num-ber of beds and decreased average stay andnumber of re-hospitalisations. In addition,and significantly, the current health minis-ter has repeatedly and publicly declaredmental health a priority for Lithuania andhas taken steps to incorporate the recentWHO/EU Helsinki Declaration andAction plan. Recently, there have been pos-itive changes in user involvement in mentalhealth services (user run survey on patients' eurohealth Vol 11 No 1 21MENTAL HEALTH Table 1 Regulation of the financing of inpatient services in Lithuania from April 2002 Category Type of service Financing provided by theState Sickness Fund IA Precisely stipulated inpatient services, with full regulation oftheir scope by providers Complete reimbursement ofthese services IB Precisely stipulated inpatient services, with limited influence by providers on the scope ofthese services Completely reimbursement ofthese services, but there are limitations on reimbursement IIproblematicservicesComplex services: there is a lack of stipulation of indicationsand criteria for these services Complete reimbursement for services included in quotas, and 15% of reimbursement forservices not included in quotas III Outpatient services, which could be provided as inpatientservices if needed50% reimbursement of servicesincluded in quotas, and 15 %reimbursement of those not included in quotas \"between 15% and 40% of residents couldlive in community ifthey received adequateoutreach services\"rights in major psychiatric institutions and participation in hospital administrativeboards), diminishing the stigma towardsmental illness, through joint activities ofusers and professional organisations (forexample, Club 13 and Co, LithuanianPsychiatric Association, etc.) 13It is impor- tant to mention that Lithuanian OpenSociety Fund (Soros Fund) has been instru-mental in funding the development of newmodels of services, system analysis of programmes and the establishment of anumber of NGOs operating in mentalhealth care. Nevertheless, there are still institutional, legal, financial and human resource issuesto be addressed in the formulation of men-tal health reforms in Lithuania. One of themajor challenges is determining the futurerole of GPs in the provision of mentalhealth services. It would be feasible to dele-gate primary mental health care to GPs,leaving MHCs to deal with secondary levelservice provision. Under this scheme, theseagencies could also monitor public mentalhealth indicators in close cooperation withGPs. Then the MHCs could provide morevaried as well as specialised mental healthservices (crisis intervention, day centres,rehabilitation, case management, etc.),which are currently lacking. Other institu-tional challenges include the lack of inte-gration of mental health services, for exam-ple, in and outpatient mental health caresystems are not related financially oradministratively, making it difficult toimplement WHO recommendations. These institutional problems are inter- linked with those of financing. For exam-ple, the majority of MHCs are an integralpart of the organisational structure of pri-mary health care centres (PHC). This typeof integration with primary health careinstitutions should be beneficial for thecontinuity of care and improve somatichealth, but it actually reduces the budgetearmarked for psychiatric services. Anadditional problem occurs because of theexcessive financing of inpatient mentalhealth services, which in turn increases theoverall inefficiency of the system. As men-tioned earlier, the largest share of expensesfor mental health services goes to inpatientservices and inpatient nursing services(34% and 36% respectively), while outpa-tient rehabilitation services receiveapproximately 9% and 1% of the budget(see Figure 1). Future mental health carestrategies in Lithuania should reconsiderthe balance of types of services provided(inpatient vs. outpatient, social and psy-chotherapy services) and their financing. Challenges in adopting legislation pertain- ing to mental health issues persist at anational as well as institutional level. Forexample, at the national level a clear strate-gy for the restructuring of mental healthinstitutions is lacking. At the institutionallevel, there is a lack of practical instructionson how to implement laws on patients\u00b4rights, such as compulsory treatment, rightto information, and the right to file com-plaints among others. In addition, moreattention should be paid to the implemen-tation of legislation. For example, theobjectives of Lithuanian HealthProgramme adopted in 1998 included sta-bilising the prevalence of mental illness andcreating a quality of life monitoring systemby 2005 and reducing the suicide rate to theEU average by 2010. 4However, these objectives were not achieved due to thelack of appropriate finance and politicalsupport. There are at least three other pressing issues for professionals working in the mentalhealth system. First, deficiencies in clinicalwork include not following treatment rec-ommendations, and an overemphasis onhigh dosages and drug combinations.Second, the strong influence of pharmaceu-tical companies, the weak activities of pro-fessional associations and the number ofphysicians working abroad are additionalproblems. The third issue is the very lowlevel of salaries for physicians and nurses,which may at least partly explain the preva-lence of some of the problems outlined.The salaries of medical staff are lower thanthe average salaries in the country. Thisdoes not contribute to motivating healthworkers and impedes the implementationof health care reform. eurohealth Vol 11 No 1 Subsidised medicines Inpatient servicesRehabilitation Social institutionsDisability programmes Figure 1 Structure of state expenditure for mental health services in Lithuania in 2001 Source : Murauskiene L, 2003.\"mental health care strategies shouldreconsider the balanceof services provided....\"Concluding remarks The development of mental health reform in Lithuania illustrates that there have beensignificant achievements in a relativelyshort time. Nevertheless, numerous chal-lenges remain and require political commit-ment in order to address them.

Before 1990, the National Health Care Systems (NHCS) of most socialist coun-tries had been, to many western visitorsand scientists, a subject of admiration orbenign criticism. 1Their common features were summarised by Roemer2as follows: Everyone was entitled to receive compre-hensive health services free-of-charge as hissocial right; the provision of health serviceswas the responsibility of the government atits various levels; the delivery of preventiveand therapeutic services was principallywell integrated, with an emphasis placed onprevention; health resources and serviceswere centrally planned as part of the entire-ly planned economic and social order. All components of the health system were integrated under the direction of one majorauthority, the Ministry of Health and itssubdivisions. Although local groups of citi-zens had the possibility of contributing tohealth policy formulation, final decisions oncore system structures and functions weremade by central political authorities. In thecase of resource shortages, the health care ofindustrial workers and children were givenpriority. Private medical practice (and relat-ed activities) was not prohibited but subjectto strict regulations. All health interven-tions were based on principles of scientificmedicine; non-scientific and alternativemedicine were not permitted. After the collapse of communism, NHCS disintegrated quickly, both in terms of theirstructure and strategic base. In almost allFormer Socialist Countries (FSC), citizenslost their entitlement to free medical carepaid from tax-generated funds.Governments introduced health insuranceschemes that were financed predominantlyby employee contributions, but becameinsolvent in a time of ailing economies andstaggering unemployment. Consequently,large sections of the population were leftwithout access to health care. The socialist ideals of equity, solidarity and the priorityof vulnerable groups were tacitly aban-doned. Particularly in three FSC (USSR,Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia) dissolvedinto 25 independent countries, health plan-ning became very difficult or even impossi-ble, as each had specific health problems,political structures, ideologies, and manymore interest groups and decision-makers. After a few years this became evident. The increased costs of medical services, reducedaccess to quality medical care and a blatantlack of programmes for health promotionled to a dramatic deterioration in the healthstatus of the FSC. 3,4This outcome amazed those who expected the transition to a mar-ket economy to contribute to an improve-ment rather than deterioration in healthservice performance. Among the explana-tions for this development and strategiesfor reversal, three different positions can bedistinguished: - The pessimistic view which interprets the collapse of socialist NHCS as the effect of neo-liberal policy of internationalfinancial organisations, particularly ofthe International Monetary Fund andthe World Bank, and does not expect -in foreseeable time - any seriousimprovement of the health sector. - The pragmatic view that neither expects great advances to come soon, butbelieves that some progress can be madewith 'reforms' consisting of small incre-mental changes. - The optimistic view that interprets the deteriorating performance of health care(in those FSC which previously alreadyeducated an oversupply of health work-ers, and had a high capacity in healthfacilities) primarily as the effect of poormanagement and mistakes which couldand should have been avoided, if thenew decision-makers had known whatto do and had been willing to do so. No role for NGOs in improving the performance of health care systems? A case study from Bosnia and Herzegovina Grujica Zarkovic \u00b4 is Professor Emeritus of the Medical Faculty of the University ofSarajevo and a member of theAcademy of Sciences and Artsof Bosnia and Herzegovina. Walter Satzinger is a senior sci- entist of the Institute of HealthEconomics and Managementin Health Care, at the GSF -Research Centre inNeuherberg arkovic \u00b4 and Walter Satzinger \"ideals of equity and solidarity were tacitlyabandoned\"The first position is expressed by Afford4: \"The international community, its financial institutions, the IMF, World Bank andinvestors, must all bear considerableresponsibility for advocating an approachto economic transformation which exposedthe people of Central Eastern Europe tosuch extremes of dislocation.\" The pre-sumption underpinning the economic poli-cy of these institutions was that price liber-ation would create market conditions,tighten fiscal policy, depress demand andpublic spending, and, supported by privati-sation, force enterprises to pursue efficien-cy. This sequence of reforms, however,proved inappropriate. Price liberation ledto spiralling inflation and indebtedness ofenterprises and was followed by a collapsein production and labour markets.Pressured to reduce budget deficits and tocope with dwindling tax revenues, govern-ments responded by cutting public expen-diture and investment in the social infra-structure. In Afford's opinion, improve-ment in the performance of the NHCS inFSC will predominantly depend on swiftand thorough economic recovery. But asthe growth rate in FSC economies remainsslow, their population may wait half a cen-tury or more to receive the health care thatit enjoyed fifty years ago. The second position is shared by most health authorities and foreign advisers inFSC. It also associates improvements inhealth care with economic growth, butbelieves that small reforms in the meantimemight produce some relief in the situation.The third position, advocated by only afew authors, interprets the paralysis ofhealth policy in FSC as an a consequence ofpoor macro-management during the transi-tion from a socialist to 'capitalist' healthcare system (if anything of the kind exists),and also due to the lack of qualified man-agers capable of properly advising healthpolicy-makers and appropriately managinghealth care systems. Accordingly, all FSCcould have saved what was good, and elim-inated what was deficient in their NHCS.This position, first proposed in 1994, 5fur- ther developed with specific strategies andmanagerial methods until 1998, 3and then, with the help of local co-authors, dissemi-nated in Russia, Romania, Serbia andMontenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina,was neither accepted nor rejected by therelevant national health policy makers towhom it was submitted, it was just ignored. Optimists believe that most FSC already have at their disposal most ingredientsneeded to improve health sector perfor-mance, and that the present paralysis in health policy could be overcome if longdelayed changes were introduced byenlightened decision-makers well advisedby properly educated and dedicated healthmanagers. Unfortunately, in most FSC,bold progressive decisions are blockedbecause their resulting profound alterationsto the system would inevitably change thepower and position of various interestgroups. 6,7Those gaining from these changes might eventually, but not necessar-ily, support reform, while those losingwould certainly oppose it. However, inorder to change a health system, first, onemust be able to formulate and propose aclear vision of the goals, strategies and tar-gets of reform, second, obtain support ofrelevant interest groups, and third, manageconsensus-building between these relevantinterest groups. Without the support of rel-evant interest groups, even the best propos-als are doomed to failure. Focus This paper describes the attempts of agroup of dedicated optimists to cure thehealth policy paralysis in Bosnia andHerzegovina (B&H) between 1999 and2004 and explains why they failed. Thesubject is the Health Care Committee(HCC) of the Department of MedicalSciences of the Academy of Sciences andArts of B&H, and the focus is on aims pur-sued and methods applied by the HCCwhen it tried to mediate between relevantinterest groups while discussing a commonhealth policy for the country. The HCC was founded in 1980 by the Council of Academies of Sciences and Artsof Yugoslavia. It is a non-governmentalorganisation (NGO) without any power orfinancial means, but with some prestige dueto its former activities and the authority ofits members. Before the collapse ofYugoslavia, the HCC advocated changes toimprove the performance of the 'self-man-aging' health system and avidly supportedthe health policy based on the Targets for Health for All of the World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe.Three years after the end of war in B&H,the HCC co-opted a number of health pro-fessionals from both entities of B&H anddecided to tackle the crucial issue of healthpolicy. Health care in Bosnia and Herzegovina The health care system in B&H, its histori- cal background, organisational structure eurohealth Vol 11 No 1 25NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATIONS \"Without the support of relevant interestgroups, even the bestproposals are doomedto failure\"and delivery management, resources and expenses, as well as some proposals forreform, are extensively described in a pub-lication of the European Observatory onHealth Systems and Policies. 8This report was cautious in its analysis of performance;yet it emphasised, inter alia, that: B&H \"inherited (p.31). \"The pre-warhealth unready for change,remain functioning in the pre-war envi-ronment, while newly created facilities lackthe capacity to operate efficiently\" (p.22).\"...there is no serious prevention pro-gramme in place\" (p.32). \"...legislated enti-tlements for the receipt of publicly-financed health care in both entities are farabove available resources that can be col-lected at present. This results in implicitrationing...\" (p.44). \"The health care sectorbecame and continues to be burdened withspecialists. So far, much of the primary carein B&H is in the hands of specialists of community-based primary care\" (p.61). \"Despite anumber of reform proposals, a plethora ofworking groups, laws and draft laws, healthcare delivery remains essentiallyunchanged\" (p. 20). Finally: \"Westerndonors have contributed large amounts offunding to rebuilding system...This support, however, has not been free of con-tentious side effects...western aid seems tohave triggered a 'rent-seeking' donor cul-ture and a foreign aid dependency amongpoliticians and professionals\" (p.88). A World Bank Group for B&H, in its report of 2000 to the president of IDA,found the health system in B&H to becomplicated, expensive, ineffective andinefficient, due to an administration reflect-ing the poor state of public administrationin B&H as a whole. \"Weak new institu-tions and political environment fragmentedby ethnic divisions leaves space for corrup-tion and rent-seeking\". 9According to a document of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Refugees, 10the key problems of health system access and efficiency are a combination of complicatednon-portable insurance schemes, a lack ofadequately equipped facilities and the general lack of funds to properly run thehealth system. An earlier survey of theWorld Bank 11found out that \"rural resi- dents complain about the ...lack of accessto health facilities\" (basic health care isavailable to only 28% of the rural popula-tion surveyed), that, in general, \"most sorely needed are ...the local health careservices...\" and over 73% of households perceive that fundamental change isrequired to improve the health sector. The reform strategy of the Health Care Committee In addition to these critical reports, the HCC made its own evaluation of the cur-rent system and identified, as its main andmost disturbing features, an enormousinequity in the financing of and access to health care, a lack of public health programmes for the prevention and controlof non-communicable diseases, and poorperformance of medical and prophylacticservices at all levels of health care, especial-ly in primary care. Some causes of the misery of health care in B&H are beyond the reach of domestichealth politicians (such as the division ofthe country into two entities and manycantons, the fact that political parties arebased on ethnic and religious differences,the influence of foreign powers and man-dates of international organisations). Thefollowing deficiencies, however, could bealleviated or eliminated by domestic decision-makers alone: - Inadequate organisation of the health care and insurance system; - Inappropriate economic relations within the health system; - Decentralised sickness insurance funds obliged to pay for equal rights to med- ical care from unequal (per capita) funds; - Indifferent attitude of the authorities towards health research and develop-ment; - An absence of qualified managers in ministries of health, institutes of publichealth and insurance funds; - Poor postgraduate education in public health, and - A complete lack of postgraduate educa- tion and training in health care manage- ment. The trouble with health policy-makers andtheir would-be health managers in B&H isthat they do not share the desire of 73% ofthe population for fundamental change.Therefore, the HCC decided to try tomediate between the two groups. In 2000,it published its first set of recommenda-tions for changing the principles and meth-ods of health care services in B&H. Themost important proposals and postulationsincluded: eurohealth Vol 11 No 1 26NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATIONS \"there is enormous inequity in access tohealth care\"- Equity in the financing and delivery of essential health services for everyone. - Establishment of public health pro- grammes capable of improving the health status of the whole population. - Freedom of choice of providers of med- ical services, particularly in primaryhealth care, and their payment on a percapita basis. This document was supplemented by aprogrammatic address to the political par-ties. In 2001, the HCC published yetanother document containing similar, butdifferently worded, proposals. Both docu-ments were distributed to distinct targetgroups within registered political parties,governments, ministries of health, healthcare institutions and insurance funds, themedia and international organisations.Additional methods used to disseminatemessages included conferences for largeaudiences addressed by invited speakers,small conferences and working groups, vis-its to key stakeholders, and individual con-tacts. Unfortunately, due to a lack of funding, the HCC had to restrain most campaign activi-ties to the towns of Tuzla and Sarajevo andwas unable to stimulate major media sup-port throughout the country. All the more,it relied on strategies, laid out by the WHORegional Office for Europe in a1999 docu-ment entitled Health 21 , to advise \"policies and mechanisms for managing the change\", and tried to realise these recommendations:mobilise partners for health (governments,professionals, non-governmental organisa-tions, individual citizens) and bring themtogether for action; provide a clear map ofthe way forward, create awareness, set tar-gets, search for consensus, achieve trans-parency, evaluate progress. The four yearsof HCC activity was guided by this 'line':informing stakeholders in the health caresystem and mobilising them to public pres-sure on the political authorities to go aheadwith reform while, at the same time, sup-porting ministries and agencies of health informulating \"a clear map of the way for-ward\". The failure of the HCC-strategy The attempt of the HCC to make healthcare reform a major policy issue failed inmany respects: - The HCC initiative did not succeed in drawing the attention of the state administration to the issues at stake.Both governments never sent theirmembers or observers to HCC meet-ings, and never discussed the HCC pro-posals. - The HCC did not win the interest of the ruling political parties for its project. Allreceived HCC documentation but onlysix of 32 registered political parties inB&H accepted the HCC's invitation tosupport them in formulating their healthprogrammes and to discuss health careissues in their organisations. - The HCC failed to obtain any strong support from the B&H media. Wheninvited, reporters attended the HCCmeetings, but never commented onissues discussed. No editors were pre-pared to report regularly on health poli-cy issues and advocate changes to healthsystem management. - Although a high proportion of health professionals approved the HCC pro-posals and attended meetings, hardlyany actively promoted and publicisedHCC policy recommendations. Of course, the HCC is only a panel of dis-tinguished and committed health careexperts, working as a NGO and neitherfinancially nor logistically in a position tosolely run a nationwide campaign (nointernational organisation in B&H wasasked to support it, apart from attendingthe HCC public meetings). Why its initia-tive to provoke the political authorities intoaction failed so miserably, is not totallyclear. Did its proposals run too heavilyagainst the vested interests of those respon-sible for health policies, or is it sheer igno-rance towards the importance (and existingimpotence!) of the health care system thatforms the attitudes of decision makers? There are some indications of the latter. First, the draft of Strategy and plan for the reform of the health care system and thehealth insurance in FB&H , prepared by the two ministries of health in 2002 and meantto guide health policy until 2012, is a docu-ment great in words but small in verifiabletargets. It is rich only in non-obligatorydeclarations on \"global development goals\"and the \"introduction of a modern, rationaland efficient system of the allocation offinancial resources ... in favour of theimprovement of the health status of thepopulation\". It does not take account ofthe actual deficiencies in the present caresystem nor of potential means to overcomethem, neither does it practically commit thegovernment to resolute reforms. No won-der that the draft of this document is stillwaiting to be discussed and approved bythe FB&H parliament! eurohealth Vol 11 No 1 27NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATIONS is up to NGOs to try and stimulateimproved performancein the health care system\"A second example of that ignorance: In February 2004, a team of both ministries,responsible for the management of a largeWorld Bank credit for the Basic Health Project , received certificates for having suc- cessfully attended seminars on the teachingof health care management. The seminars'organisers, when asked which teachingmaterial they used with their students,spoke of some modules developed by a for-eign consultant, since, this was their rea-soning, no dependable textbook abouthealth care management existed anywherein the world. Obviously, they had noknowledge of the many books that arehighly specific to the topic, all available inBosnian libraries and partly even written inBosnian language! 12 Third, in June 2003, the HCC sent a welldeveloped proposal on the financing ofpublic health programmes to the healthministries and, later on, also to 46 topB&H political personalities. More than halfa year later, the President of the B&HFederation forwarded the answer of hishealth minister which read as follows:\"...We do not wish to argue about the pro-posals of the Academy. Instead we wish tomention what the Ministry has so far done,what it is currently doing and what will bedone to consolidate the health system with-out major breakages.\" This was said inspite of the deplorable situation of thecountry's health care system, and reflectsthe helplessness, if not inertia, characteris-ing the politically responsible bodies of acountry \"which barely functions as astate\". 13This episode ended the efforts of the HCC to break the paralysis of healthpolicy in B&H and to persuade decision-makers that, with the proposed changes,substantial improvements in the perfor-mance of the health system could beachieved in terms of the equity, effective-ness and efficiency of health care for allthree ethnic groups in this country. Any conclusions? Wherever (like in B&H) the improvementin performance of a health care system isinhibited by a paralysis in decision makingin health policy strategies, it is up to NGOsto try and stimulate the necessary changes.To succeed in this mission, we think, theseorganisations will foremost need: (a) a clearvision not only of the goals of the intendedchanges but also of their outcomes andpossible side-effects; (b) a dedicated andoptimistic leadership, guided by sound sci-entific advice; (c) close and good relationswith most stakeholder groups in healthcare; (d) some financial support; (e) diplo-matic skills, a lot of patience and, above all,a sense of humour to endure defeats! In our case, we might have well fulfilled these first two criteria, the third one at leastpartially, the fourth one unfortunately not.What of the fifth? After the HCC experi-ence, we should recognise that diplomacy,patience and endurance are perhaps themost important, and difficult, properties ofNGO actors to attain and uphold. eurohealth Vol 11 No 1 28NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATIONS REFERENCES 1.

They indulge in unnec-essary, expensive medical procedures allbecause they can get them for free. So whynot teach Canadians to be more responsibleby making them pay a charge for everyhealth service used? Because the idea just doesn't hold water. Research has long proven that user feeswon't eliminate inappropriate care nor domuch to reduce costs, and even the claimthat patients waste healthcare resources isfaulty. Patients abusing health services? The true story Robert Evans, a health economist at the University of British Columbia, explains:medical procedures are not hotcakes.People aren't going to line up eagerlydemanding heart transplants just becausesomeone else is paying. What's more, patients can't really waste healthcare resources. Institutional and hos-pital care, physician visits, prescriptiondrugs, and other medical services, make upmost of total Canadian health spending. 1 But most of that spending is beyond apatient's control: many visits to doctors, allhospital care and prescription drugs, canonly be given on a doctor's order. 2 That means patient-initiated abuse happensmostly during physician visits - whichmade up about 13.5 per cent of total healthspending in 2000. But roughly half ofphysician services are referrals, or call-backvisits to the same doctor, says Evans. So'first visits' initiated by patients probablymade up about six to seven per cent of allspending. Since most of these visits are rea-sonable, Evans estimates patient-initiatedabuse is probably about one to two per cent of total spending - hardly rampant. Tried, tested and quite untrue In any case, user fees are unlikely to reducecosts. Researchers found that user charges -implemented in Saskatchewan in 1968 andabolished seven years later - reduced theannual use of physician services by aboutsix per cent. But this happened mainlybecause the elderly and the poor saw about18 per cent less of their doctors. 3What's more, Saskatchewan's overall healthcarecosts didn't shrink - thanks to physicianfee increases and people with higherincomes, who saw their doctors moreoften. 2The fees also didn't affect the cost of hospital services, the most expensiveform of care. Another famous study on user fees is the US Rand Health Insurance Experiment,which assigned individuals to insuranceplans with different rates of user fees. 4 Researchers found people got less medicalcare in those plans with heavier charges.But the proportion of inappropriate antibi-otic use, hospital stays and admissions wasthe same 5,6- with or without user fees - proving that the fees don't solve such problems. What changed was the way high-risk and low-income patients used medical services.Everyone used fewer medical services, butthe decline was greater among poorer peo-ple. Sick people were also more likely todie when user charges were installed. 7 However, Rand investigators found health-care costs for people who paid user feeswere lower than people with total healthcoverage. This seems to prove user chargesat least lowered costs. But that disputes thefindings in Saskatchewan, where costsdidn't decrease. Why? While the Saskatchewan experience affect- ed all patients, Rand involved a dispersedgroup of 5,800 people, so each doctor onlyhad a few patients enrolled in the study.That's not enough to provide evidence on eurohealth Vol 11 No 1 29Myth: User fees would stop waste and ensure better use of the healthcare systemMythbusters Mythbusters are prepared by Knowledge Transfer and Exchange staff at the Canadian Health Services Research Foundation and published only after reviewby a researcher expert on the topic.

Therefore the Rand experiment, unlike theSaskatchewan experience, does not addressthe question of overall costs. We just can't conclude from Rand that healthcare costswould drop across the system; the evidencesimply isn't there. 8 Penny wise, pound foolish? But both studies confirm it is mostly thepoor who use less medical care whenforced to pay extra charges. In the long runthat would probably cost more, because theold and poor are less healthy than othergroups. In Quebec, for instance, when the elderly and people on welfare had to pay user feesfor prescription drugs, they took less medi-cine. But that resulted in sicker patients andmore visits to hospital emergency depart-ments. 9These findings echo earlier research, which showed that user feeshelped reduce costs in the short term, buteventually led to more spending becausemore people would neglect to get earlytreatment. Despite the rhetoric, user fees don't lead to a more affordable health system. Researchhas shown time after time that user feesinevitably create advantages for the richand healthy while making matters worsefor the sick and poor.0102030405060708090100 0% rate 25% rate 95% rate ratesLow-income usersMiddle-income usersUpper-income usersLikelihood of medical use (%)EFFECT OF USER FEES ON MEDICAL USE, RAND HEALTH INSURANCE EXPERIMENT Data from Manning WG et al. 1987.

Evaluating HealthPromotion: Practiceand Methods Edited by Margaret Thorogood and YolandaCoomes. Review by Walter Holland.Emeritus Professor ofPublic PoliticalScience ISBN 0-19-852880-9 186 pages. Paperback\u00a324.95This is the second edition of a book first published in 2000, which suggests the demand for this book was good. There are good descriptions of methods of evaluation, how evaluation has beenused in a variety of situations and how it can be disseminated and used in practice. The introductory chapters include a brief overview of the book and a very potted history of health promotion. It is unfortunate that the historical perspective has not been informed bypractitioners but is the view of an eminent public health historian (also, of course, of some oth-ers). For example, the term \"new public health\" is used without critical analysis of whetheractually there is anything new. It is even suggested that \"old public health\" \"struggled\" to tacklehealth hazards - this diminishes the achievements of Chadwick, Simon, Potts and many others,who succeeded in both improving sanitary conditions for all of us and played a major role in thediminution of occupational hazards. In contrast, the \"new public health\" may have been suc-cessful in reducing cigarette smoking but finds it difficult to reduce the environmental hazardssuch as air pollution, climate change, violence or transport. It is long forgotten that health promotion was equally important in the past as it is now - our forebears were far better at recognising and influencing the public health needs of sanitarybehaviour, for example, washing required both a change in individual behaviour as well as theprovision of a clean water supply - in contrast though we may be good at devising anti-smokingpropaganda or urging people to take exercise, but are poor at reducing poverty or the provisionof playgrounds. Although the book is intended for students and practitioners of health promotion, it is neces- sary to provide a 'health warning'. Most of the authors are academic social scientists. Althoughsome very good examples are given of the application of the evaluative methods to encouragehealth promotion activities, such as impregnated bed nets to prevent malaria or the introductionof a Healthy Living Centre in Scotland, others are less felicitous. The most glaring examplebeing the apparent ignorance of the \"herd immunity\" (p.52), a side effect of immunisation. Theapparent absence of a policy-maker amongst the authors to emphasise what information is actu-ally used in informing policy, rather than what the academics consider should or could be usedis illustrated by the example on fluoridation quoted on p.67. The benefits of fluoride in drinkingwater have been illustrated in innumerable examples since the late 1930s, both by controlled tri-als, before and after statistics, as well as ecological comparisons. The strength of the examplequoted in Cheshire was, I am sure, was as a local study - and thus the local decision makerswere far more likely to accept it than one done in the United States, or even North EastEngland! No reference to the importance of local studies was made. Thus, although this may be useful as an introduction to how health promotion activities can, and should, be evaluated, it is important that practitioners developing methods of health promo-tion consult more dedicated texts, both on the methodological aspects of evaluation, informa-tion needs of those responsible for policy formulation and implementation, and above all howto define the objectives of a programme, which requires knowledge of the social, psychological,biological and environmental factors that need to be remedied.

DIMDI, German Institute of MedicalDocumentation andInformation www.dimdi.deDIMDI was founded in 1969 and is an institute under the auspices of the German Federal Ministry of Health and Social Security. Its main task is to provide the public with quick and easyaccess to the latest information in all fields of life sciences. The website provides access to approxi-mately 80 databases with a total of over 100 million records. DIMDI is also responsible for main-taining and updating the official German language versions of medical and surgical procedures andnomenclature for medical devices. In addition, DIMDI is establishing database-supported infor-mation systems for medical devices health technology assessment (HTA) and evidence-based med-icine. The focus of the HTA information system is national and international HTA results in pre-vention, diagnostics, and therapies as well as developments in HTA methodology. DIMDI commissions HTA reports on the efficacy, risks, costs as well as effects of procedures and technologies in health care and their effectiveness in everyday conditions. It has a particular focuson those procedures and technologies of key importance to health policy. All 108 HTA reportsmay be freely downloaded. All the HTA reports as well as reports of the self-administration bod-ies of the German healthcare system and of international HTA agencies are searchable in the data-base.

WEBwatchEUnews COMPILED BY EUROHEALTH WITH ADDITIONAL INPUT FROM EUROHEALTHNETPress releases and other suggested information for future inclusion can be e-mailed to the editorDavid McDaid d.mcdaid@lse.ac.uk eurohealth Vol 11 No 1 33UK Parliamentary Report on the Influence of the PharmaceuticalIndustry The Health Select Committee of the lower house of the UK Parliament,the House of Commons, has pub-lished the findings of a wide ranginginvestigation into the influence ofthe pharmaceutical industry, its firstinquiry into the industry since 1914.Areas of examination included theconduct of medical research, govern-ment policy, the use of journals,company promotional activities,information for patients, regulationincluding evaluation and cost effec-tiveness, post marketing surveillanceand the patient voice. The report acknowledges the enor- mous contribution that medicationshave made to both saving andimproving quality of life. The UKpharmaceutical industry accounts for10% of global research and develop-ment (R&D) expenditure and 65%of all health related R&D in the UK.It also recognises the growing cost ofpharmaceuticals to the NHS, withmore than \u00a37 billion spent annually,80% of which is for patented drugs. The Committee concluded that indi- viduals are being prescribed toomany drugs, before the full conse-quences of adverse effects areknown. The adverse reactions areresponsible for approximately 5% ofall hospital admissions in the UK.More research is required on adversedrug impacts and there is a call forgovernment funded research into thecosts of drug induced illness. The Committee felt that the 'med- icalisation' of society, the belief thatevery problem requires medicaltreatment, can be attributed in partto the activities of the pharmaceuti-cal industry. They noted that regula-tion of the pharmaceutical industryis too light and that there is a lack oftransparency. The regulator, theMedicines and Healthcare productsRegulatory Agency (MHRA), thecommittee concluded had failed to adequately scrutinise licensing dataand furthermore that its post mar-keting surveillance was insufficient. The report states that MHRA \"has been too close to the industry, acloseness underpinned by commonpolicy objectives, agreed processes,frequent contact, consultation andinterchange of staff. We are con-cerned that a rather lax regime isexacerbated by the MHRA's need tocompete with other European regu-lators for licence application busi-ness.\" The report calls for greater trans- parency. A fundamental review ofthe MHRA is recommended. Inaddition it calls for greater publicaccess to materials considered by theMHRA prior to licensing, with clini-cal trials focusing on outcomes thatare of real benefit to patients. Bettercommunication is required betweencompanies and the MHRA duringthe early stages of drug development.A systematic system of appraisalshould be part of the post-licensingsurveillance process. The report also calls for strength- ened guidelines for the declaration oflinks between industry and patientgroups, and individual prescibers, inparticular doctors, should berequired to declare hospitality orgifts received from industry. Theseshould be maintained in a register byprofessional bodies. More can also be done by govern- ment to support the industry in itsresearch efforts, acknowledging theproblems of confusing ethical proce-dures and a lack of trained healthservice researchers. The Committeewere of the view however any spon-sorship of industry should be movedfrom the Department of Health tothe Department of Trade andIndustry, as the Department ofHealth needs to be seen to prioritisethe interests of patients and publichealth.Speaking on the publication of the report Committee Chairman DavidHinchliffe said \"The pharmaceuticalindustry is extremely powerful andinfluences healthcare at every level.The lives of millions of people havebeen improved by the medicines theindustry has produced. However, wehave developed an over-reliance onmedicines. They have been over-pre-scribed and patients have suffered asa result. \"Like any industry, drug companies need effective discipline and regula-tion, and these have been lacking.The industry, the regulator, doctorsand other prescribers must take theirshare of the blame. Our recommen-dations reflect the need for tightercontrols over drug company activi-ties, improved medicines regulationand more effective monitoring ofdrug safety and efficacy. Above all,greater transparency is required.Both the pharmaceutical industryand the regulator have already takensteps in this direction. Furtherchange is needed to ensure that thebest medicines reach patients.\" The report is available at: www. publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmselect/cmhealth/42/4202.htm Health and Consumer Protection Programme2007-2013 The European Commission adopted a Health and Consumer ProtectionStrategy and a proposal for aEuropean Parliament and CouncilDecision creating the CommunityProgramme for Health andConsumer Protection 2007-2013 inApril. The strategy and programmeproposal bring together and extendthe current EU Public HealthProgramme and the currentConsumer programme in support ofEU consumer policy. It is hoped that by bringing the two programmes together the synergiesbetween health and consumer pro-tection can be exploited, improvingeurohealth Vol 11 No 1 34policy coherence, economies of scale, and the visibility of proce-dures. The Communication proposes the following common objectives: - Protect citizens from risks and threats which are beyond the con- trol of individuals and that cannotbe effectively tackled by individ-ual Member States; - Increase the ability of citizens to take better decisions about theirhealth and consumer interests; - Mainstream health and consumer policy objectives across allCommunity policies. Specific health objectives are to: - Protect citizens against health threats; - Promote policies that lead to a healthier way of life; - Contribute to reducing the inci- dence of major diseases in the EU; - Contribute to the development of more effective and efficient healthsystems - Support the objectives above by providing health information andanalysis.

The judgement arose in Case C- 145/03, the heirs of Annette Keller vInstituto Nacional de (INSS) and (Ingesa), de Salud(Insalud). Ms Annette Keller, of Germannationality and resident in Spain, asked the competent Spanish institu-tion (Insalud) for a Form E 111 for aperiod of one month, in order totravel to Germany. During her stayin Germany, she was diagnosed ashaving a malignant tumour liable tocause death at any time. She askedInsalud to issue a Form E 112, so asto be able to continue receivingtreatment in Germany. The validityof that form was extended on severaloccasions. The German doctors treating Ms Keller transferred her to ZurichUniversity Clinic in Switzerland, theonly facility they felt where an oper-ation could be performed with anychance of success. Ms Keller paid\u20ac56,000 in costs herself and subse- quently requested a reimbursementfrom Insalud which was refused. Asa part of ensuring court proceedingsthe national court asked the Courtof Justice of the EuropeanCommunities for an interpretationof the 1971 regulation on the appli-cation of social security schemes tomigrant workers, concerning thepossibility of reimbursement of thecosts of hospital treatment receivedin a non-member country. The Court stated that the doctors in the member state of stay are bestplaced to assess the treatment neededby the patient, and that the institu-tion of the member state of affilia-tion, during the period of validity ofthe form, places its confidence in theinstitution of the member state andthe doctors authorised by it, as pro-viding the same guarantees of pro-fessional competence as doctorswithin the country. Consequently,the institution of the member stateof affiliation is bound by the find-ings relating to the need for urgentvital treatment made by the doctorsauthorised by the institution of themember state of stay, and by thedecision of those doctors to transferthe patient to another state to begiven the urgent treatment which thedoctors of the member state of stayare unable to provide. The Court ruled that whether this state is within the EU is of noimportance, nor can the memberstate of affiliation require an individ-ual to return home for medicalassessment or indeed be subject tomedical examination in the member state of stay. The Court also confirmed that the costs of treatment should initiallyhave been borne by the host countryGermany, who then would subse-quently be reimbursed by theirSpanish counterparts. As in thisinstance Ms Keller had paid for thetreatment herself the Court ruledthat the Spanish social security insti-tution must reimburse these costsdirectly to Ms Keller's heirs.

This will however still represent lessthan 10% of total public expenditureon research in the EU. The new programme places a greater emphasis than that seen previouslyon research relevant to the needs ofEuropean industry with the aim ofhelping it compete internationallyand promote economic growth. Theprogramme will establish aEuropean Research Council to iden-tify and support the best researchendeavours being carried outthroughout Europe. There is though a strong element of continuity with the past in the pro-posed Seventh FrameworkProgramme. An important elementof the new programme will be a con-tinued focus on supporting thecareers of scientists and researchersto strengthen research capacity.Projects undertaken by consortia ofEuropean partners will remain at thecore of the programme, and thethemes for these projects will remainmore or less as now. The programme will continue to develop the concept of a Europeaneurohealth Vol 11 No 1 35Research Area. Funds will be used to develop and increase those elementsof previous programmes thatworked well: Marie Curie, SMEactions, Excellence. ofcontinuity will be strengthenedthrough a programme that lastsseven years (with the possibility of amid-term review). There are also several new elements. One key feature of FP7 will be a sig-nificant simplification of its opera-tion. Measures are being considered,in line with the future revision of theFinancial Regulation, to make theprogramme as straightforward aspossible for potential participants. The European Commission has established a sounding board com-posed of representatives of smallcompanies and research teams,groups which seem to face thebiggest difficulties in participating inthe programme. This soundingboard will advise on whether mea-sures proposed to make the pro-gramme simpler will in fact have therequired effect. The proposed programme will now be debated by the Member States(Council) and European Parliament,before a final Decision is adopted.

Thetwo documents set out what hasbeen delivered to date and what thepriorities will be for the collabora-tive European Union (EU) system ofmonitoring the safety of medicinesin the future. The impact of this collaborative work is set out in the 'Progressreport of the ad hoc working groupon the implementation of theEuropean Risk ManagementStrategy'. This includes implementa-tion of measures designed to strengthen the safety monitoring ofmedicines in the EU. The collabora-tors argue that strong regulation,based on robust scientific decision-making should clearly assess the bal-ance of benefits against the knownrisks. The two reports acknowledgethat medicines regulation cannotprotect the public from every risk;the Strategy aims at putting in placea coherent approach to the detec-tion, assessment, minimisation andcommunication of risks in Europe. The next steps of the Strategy are set out in an 'Action plan to furtherprogress the European RiskManagement Strategy'. This buildson the progress made and takes intoaccount the need to respond to pub-lic concerns over the safety of medi-cines. The action plan focuses onthree priority areas: the implementa-tion of new EU pharmaceutical leg-islation; supporting initiatives to putin place an intensive drug-monitor-ing system focused on risk detection,assessment, minimisation and com-munication; further strengthening ofthe EU pharmacovigilance system. The action plan is available at: http://heads.medagencies.org/heads/docs/ERMS_actionplan_20050504.pdf and the progress report at: http://heads.medagencies.org/heads/docs/HMA_2ndreport_20050511.pdf Commission on the Social Determinants of Healthlaunched On 18 March the President of the Republic of Chile, Ricardo LagosEscobar and World HealthOrganization Director-General, DrLEE Jong-wook launched theCommission on Social Determinantsof Health, a new body to spearheadaction on the social causes behindill-health. The new Commission, which will operate for three years, includesleading global experts on health,education, housing and economics.Commissioners will work to recom-mend the best ways to addresshealth's social determinants andsafeguard the health of poor andmarginalised populations, and tobreak the 'poverty equals ill-health' cycle. Speaking at the launch Dr Lee said that \"this commission will assistcountries, no matter how rich orpoor, to implement strategies thatwill help people who are poor andmarginalised live longer, healthierlives. This effectively places the needsof the disadvantaged first on thehealth agenda in the 21st century.\" The Commission aims to identify, evaluate, adapt and distribute effec-tive strategies to address social deter-minants, with the aim of supportinggovernments to scale-up interven-tions. Commission Chair MichaelMarmot said that \"A great share ofhealth problems is attributable tosocial conditions, and this is why thepoor carry the greatest burden of ill-health. On a global scale, we mustensure that health policies movebeyond exclusively disease-focusedsolutions and include the social envi-ronment,\" The Commission will work with national authorities to determineways to replicate proven successfulapproaches in other countries andsettings. It will focus the attention ofleading experts and researchers onspecific social determinants such asurban settings, social exclusion, andemployment conditions.

Itnotes that while economic evaluationin this area has been under devel-oped, this should be a routine andconsistent element of evaluation ofall public health interventions. Theauthors argue that while formal costbenefit analysis theoretically is ideal,the complexity of evaluation maymean that cost consequence analysismay be an alternative pragmaticapproach to capturing the layeredoutcomes of public health interven-tions at a local level.

Responding to the report'sfindings Health Minister andTainaiste Mary Harney said \"Over300,000 people were charged illegallyduring 28 years. This was entirelywrong. They were old, they werepoor, they suffered from mental ill-ness, they had intellectual disabili-ties, they were physically disabled.As vulnerable people, they wereespecially entitled to the protectionof the law and to legal clarity abouttheir situation. The charges shouldnever have been made illegally, eventhough the principle of charging forshelter and maintenance had broadpublic and political acceptance... Ithas given rise now to a major finan-cial, legal and administrative prob-lem that was entirely avoidable.\" TheDepartment of Health and Childrenhas subsequently begun to set upprocedures to compensate individu-als and their descendants.

Changing demographics, new lifestyl es, increased mobility of people and patients, new knowledge about health risks, changes in health policy and the health care sys-tem, new products on the health and wellness market, a new relationship between patients and health professionals require wellinformed patients, consumers and citizens. An increasing number of choices in everyday life have become choices for or againsthealth. These developments carry great potential for empowerment but they also increase the risk of disorientation and newimbalances and inequities. While in democracies people cannot be instructed to follow a healthy lifestyle there is an increasin g expectation that they do. How do patients, consumers and citizens respond to this new environment? This Forum will outline the key characteristics of the new health environment and its challenges using concrete exemples, such as obesity and migrant health. It will describe initiatives undertaken by different actors to support healthy choices. It will att empt to bring forward some innovative proposals related to the interface between the knowledge and skills that people need to navigatehealth information, health systems and the health market and the policies and environments required to support healthy choices.

There is a growing demand across Europe for complementary and alternative medicine and, in particular,for homeopathy and anthroposophic medicine. Politiciansand the scientific community, however, treat these traditional therapies with scepticism. What are the real benefits of complementary medicine? What is the evidence of efficacy that has been demonstrat-ed over the last few years? Could complementary medicinehave a positive effect on public health budgets? Are inappropriate regulatory requirements starting to seriouslyimpede a 200-year-old European medicinal tradition?

Allgovernments are striving to find innovative solutions tocontain such increases. Very often the measures takenfocus primarily on pricing and reimbursement: providingan immediate but often short-lived solution. This session will look at how ensuring more appropriate usesof medicines could contribute to meeting this challenge.Speakers will provide data and give examples of how acollaborative care approach could lead to improved therapeutic outcomes and generate savings.The potential for a targeted approach tocomplianceP Stephens, Vice President Public HealthAffairs, IMS Health, European Region Medicine management: benefits and challenges for the healthcare systems, a case studyA H\u00e4mmerlein, Center for drug informationand pharmacy practice, ABDA, Germany Panel discussion: Patient and health professional representatives Organised by PGEU and IMS Health Lunch Workshop 4 The new EU health strategy Thursday 6th October 200512:30-14:00The Commission will present for discussion its new Health and consumer protection strategy On 6 April, the Commission adopted a strategy and programme proposal setting out a number of ambitious targets for EU health policy from 2007 until 2013. The strategy and programme proposal brings EU health and consumer protection policies together under a single framework. This will give more weight and visibility to two policies at the heart ofcitizens' concerns that share important objectives such as health protection and citizens' information.It will also develop positive synergies in terms of economies of scale and streamlining of administrative procedures. The aim is to pursue a set of common health and consumer protection objectives: protecting citizens from risks and threats; increasing citizens' ability to take better decisions about their healthand consumer interests; and mainstreaming health and consumer policy objectives across allCommunity policies. As regards health, the new programme reinforces the three strands of the existing Public Health Programme: to gather and provide information; to monitor threats; and to tackle key health determinants. In addition, the programme creates three new strands: to deliver an efficient responseto health threats; to help prevent diseases; and to foster cooperation between health systems.Finally, in line with the Lisbon agenda, bridging health inequalities and addressing ageing will bepriority themes. The Commission proposals are currently under discussion in the European Parliament and Council.

High quality hospice and palliative care which aims to meet the needs of the whole person can and does, provide an answer. On the occasion of the 1st World Hospice and Palliative Care Day the session will provide an overview on international and European hospice and palliative care issues, and discuss different models of careincluding work undertaken by the Council of Europe. Organised by Help the Hospices, UK Markos Kyprianou - EU Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection The theme for this year's European Health Forum Gastein - 'Partnerships for Health' -points to the fact that health policy can only besuccessful if joint approaches are being devel-oped across society, involving stakeholders anddifferent levels of government. This is certainlya very valid principle for EU-level policy actionson health. I am confident that this conferencewill once again provide a forum of interestingdebates among the many different actorsinvolved in health policy and health servicesacross Europe.Das Motto des diesj\u00e4hrigen European Maria Rauch-Kallat - Austrian Minister for Health and Women Health policy is a multisectoral issue and, in thelong run, it can function only through coopera-tion and coordination with other policy areasand close partnerships with the stakeholdersoutside the world of politics. Despite the different organisation of their health systems,European countries can continue to learn fromeach other, and an ever stronger European integration will see the creation of partnershipsbetween them in the health sector as well.International organisations will have a majorrole to play in this process.Gesundheitspolitik ist eine - Regional Director, WHO I very much welcome the theme of this year'sforum. Partnerships are indeed central to healthdevelopment and are also one of the main components of the policy of the WHO RegionalOffice for Europe. The complex nature of healthrequires all key stakeholders to be fullyengaged in a common and well coordinatedeffort in order to address the many determi-nants that contribute to health development.Partnerships have to concentrate on citizens'needs. They have to seek ways to furtherempower citizens to make healthy choices andto have more influence in the direction and run-ning of health systems. I look forward to partic-ipating in these important discussions withstakeholders represented in this forum, with thehope to further strengthen our common effortsto improve the health of all citizens.Ich m\u00f6chte of Salzburg As the venue of the European Health Forum, thisyear the Gasteinertal will be hosting one of themost important health conferences in Europe forthe 8th consecutive time.
