In some cases, treating the underlying disorder eliminates or minimizes the pain. For example, setting a broken bone in a cast or giving antibiotics for an infected joint helps reduce pain. However, even if the underlying disorder can be treated, pain relievers may still be needed to quickly manage the pain.

Drugs used to relieve pain fall into three categories: Nonopioid Opioid (narcotic) Adjuvant (drugs that are usually used to treat other problems such as seizures or depression but that can also relieve pain) Nonopioid Pain Relievers A variety of nonopioid pain relievers are available. They are often effective for mild to moderate pain and sometimes for severe pain. These drugs are often preferred for treating pain. People do not become physically dependent on these drugs or tolerant of their pain-relieving effects. Aspirin and acetaminophen are available without a prescription (over-the-counter, or OTC). Several other nonopioid analgesics (such as ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and naproxen) are available OTC, but higher doses may require a prescription. OTC pain relievers are reasonably safe to take for short periods of time. People should follow the instructions on the label for the maximum dose, frequency, and length of time the drug should be taken. A doctor should be consulted if symptoms worsen or do not go away. Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs Many of the most commonly used nonopioid pain relievers are classified as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen are examples. These drugs are usually used to treat mild to moderate pain. NSAIDs not only relieve pain, but they may also reduce the inflammation that often accompanies and worsens pain. NSAIDs are often taken by mouth. Some NSAIDs (ketorolac diclofenac, and ibuprofen) can also be given by injection into a vein (intravenously) or muscle (intramuscularly). Indomethacin can be given as a rectal suppository. Diclofenac is also available as a cream. Although widely used, NSAIDs can have side effects, sometimes serious ones. Problems in the digestive tract: All NSAIDs tend to irritate the stomach's lining and cause digestive upset (such as heartburn, indigestion, nausea, bloating, diarrhea, and pain), [peptic ulcers](/home/digestive-disorders/gastritis-and-peptic-ulcer-disease/peptic-ulcer-disease) [Peptic Ulcer Disease A peptic ulcer is a round or oval sore where the lining of the stomach or duodenum has been eaten away by stomach acid and digestive juices. Peptic ulcers can result from infection with Helicobacter... read more](/home/digestive-disorders/gastritis-and-peptic-ulcer-disease/peptic-ulcer-disease), and bleeding in the digestive tract ( [gastrointestinal bleeding](/home/digestive-disorders/gastrointestinal-bleeding/gastrointestinal-bleeding) [Gastrointestinal Bleeding Bleeding may occur anywhere along the digestive (gastrointestinal or GI) tract, from the mouth to the anus. Blood may be easily seen by the naked eye (overt), or blood may be present in amounts... read more](/home/digestive-disorders/gastrointestinal-bleeding/gastrointestinal-bleeding)). Coxibs (COX-2 inhibitors), a type of NSAID, are less likely to irritate the stomach and cause bleeding than other NSAIDs. Taking NSAIDs with food and using antacids may help prevent stomach irritation. The drug misoprostol can help prevent stomach irritation and ulcers, but it can cause other problems, including diarrhea. [Proton pump inhibitors](/home/digestive-disorders/gastritis-and-peptic-ulcer-disease/medications-for-the-treatment-of-stomach-acid#v77992787) [Proton Pump Inhibitors Stomach acid plays a role in a number of disorders of the stomach, including peptic ulcer, gastritis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

Bleeding problems: All NSAIDs interfere with the clotting tendency of platelets (cell-like particles in the blood that help stop bleeding when blood vessels are injured). Consequently, NSAIDs increase the risk of bleeding, especially in the digestive tract if they irritate the stomach's lining. Coxibs are less likely to cause bleeding than other NSAIDs. Fluid retention or kidney problems: NSAIDs sometimes cause fluid retention and swelling. Regular use of NSAIDs may also increase the risk of developing a kidney disorder, sometimes resulting in kidney failure (a disorder called analgesic nephropathy). Increased risk of heart and blood vessel disorders: Studies suggest that with all NSAIDs except aspirin, the risk of heart attack, stroke, and blood clots in the legs may be increased. The risk appears to be higher with higher doses and longer use of the drug. The risk is also higher with some NSAIDs than with others. These problems may be related directly to the drug's effect on clotting or indirectly to a small but persistent increase in blood pressure caused by the drug. People who take NSAIDs for a long time are more likely to have these problems. Such people need to have regular appointments with their doctor to check for high blood pressure, kidney failure, and ulcers or bleeding in the digestive tract and to evaluate their risk of heart disease and stroke. Taking NSAIDs for a short time is unlikely to cause serious problems. The risk of side effects may be increased for some groups of people, such as the following: Older people People who drink alcoholic beverages regularly People with coronary artery disease, other heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disorders, or risk factors for these disorders Older people and people who have heart failure, high blood pressure, or a kidney or liver disorder require a doctor's supervision when they take NSAIDs. Some prescription heart and blood pressure drugs may not work as well when taken with NSAIDs. Did You Know... NSAIDs vary in how quickly they work and how long they relieve pain. Although NSAIDs are about equally effective, people respond to them differently. One person may find a particular drug to be more effective or to have fewer side effects than another. Aspirin Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) has been used for about 100 years. Aspirin is taken by mouth and provides 4 to 6 hours of moderate pain relief. Because aspirin can irritate the stomach, it may be combined with an antacid (called buffered) or coated so that it passes quickly through the stomach and dissolves when it reaches the small intestine (called enteric coated). These products are intended to reduce stomach irritation. However, buffered or enteric-coated aspirin can still irritate the stomach because aspirin also reduces the production of substances that help protect the stomach's lining. These substances are called prostaglandins. Aspirin increases the risk of bleeding throughout the body because it makes platelets less able to function. Platelets are cell fragments in the blood that help blood clot. Anyone who has an increased tendency to bleed (a bleeding disorder such as hemophilia) or uncontrolled high blood pressure should not take aspirin except under a doctor's supervision. People who take aspirin and anticoagulants (drugs that make blood less likely to clot), such as warfarin, are closely monitored to avoid life-threatening bleeding. Usually, aspirin should not be taken in the week before scheduled surgery. Aspirin can aggravate asthma. People with nasal polyps are likely to develop wheezing if they take aspirin. A few people, who are sensitive (allergic) to aspirin, may have a severe allergic reaction ( [anaphylaxis](/home/immune-disorders/allergic-reactions-and-other-hypersensitivity-disorders/anaphylactic-reactions) [ Anaphylactic Reactions Anaphylactic reactions are sudden, widespread, potentially severe and life-threatening allergic reactions. Anaphylactic reactions often begin with a feeling of uneasiness, followed by tingling... read more ](/home/immune-disorders/allergic-reactions-and-other-hypersensitivity-disorders/anaphylactic-reactions) ), leading to a rash, itching, severe breathing problems, or [shock](/home/heart-and-blood-vessel-disorders/low-blood-pressure-and-shock/shock) [ Shock Shock is a life-threatening condition in which blood flow to the organs is low, decreasing delivery of oxygen and thus causing organ damage and sometimes death. Blood pressure is usually low... read more ](/home/heart-and-blood-vessel-disorders/low-blood-pressure-and-shock/shock) . Such a reaction requires immediate medical attention. In very high doses, aspirin can have serious side effects such as abnormal breathing, fever, or confusion. One of the first signs of an overdose may be noise in the ears ( [tinnitus](/home/ear,-nose,-and-throat-disorders/symptoms-of-ear-disorders/ear-ringing-or-buzzing) [ Ear Ringing or Buzzing Ringing in the ears (tinnitus) is noise originating in the ear rather than in the environment.

Most children and teenagers should not take aspirin because they could develop [Reye syndrome](/home/children-s-health-issues/miscellaneous-disorders-in-infants-and-young-children/reye-syndrome) [ Reye Syndrome Reye syndrome is a very rare but life-threatening disorder that causes inflammation and swelling of the brain and impairment and loss of function of the liver.

Although rare, Reye syndrome can have serious consequences, including death. Topical NSAIDs Some NSAIDs are available as creams or gels that are applied directly to the skin over the painful area. For example, diclofenac gel can be applied to a joint to relieve pain due to [osteoarthritis](/home/bone,-joint,-and-muscle-disorders/joint-disorders/osteoarthritis-oa) [ Osteoarthritis (OA) Osteoarthritis is a chronic disorder that causes damage to the cartilage and surrounding tissues and is characterized by pain, stiffness, and loss of function. Arthritis due to damage of joint... read more ](/home/bone,-joint,-and-muscle-disorders/joint-disorders/osteoarthritis-oa) and help improve movement. Diclofenac is also available as a patch, which can be used to relieve acute pain due to minor sprains, strains, and bruises. Ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and naproxen NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and naproxen are generally believed to be gentler on the stomach than aspirin, although few studies have compared the drugs. Like aspirin, these drugs can cause digestive upset, ulcers, and gastrointestinal bleeding. They can make asthma worse and increase blood pressure. Taking one of these drugs probably slightly increases the risk of stroke, heart attack, and blood clots in the arteries of the legs. The risk may be lower with naproxen than with other NSAIDs. Thus, naproxen may be a better choice when people with a high risk of these disorders require NSAIDs. Although ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and naproxen generally interfere with blood clotting less than aspirin does, people should not take these drugs with anticoagulants (such as warfarin) except under a doctor's close supervision. People who are allergic to aspirin may also be allergic to ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and naproxen. If a rash, itching, breathing problems, or shock develops, medical attention is required immediately. Coxibs (COX-2 inhibitors) Coxibs, such as celecoxib, are a group of drugs that differ from other NSAIDs. Other NSAIDs block the following two enzymes: COX-1, which is involved in the production of prostaglandins that protect the stomach and play a crucial role in blood clotting COX-2, which is involved in the production of prostaglandins that promote inflammation Coxibs tend to block mainly COX-2 enzymes. Thus, coxibs are as effective as other NSAIDs in the treatment of pain and inflammation. But coxibs are less likely to damage the stomach and to cause nausea, bloating, heartburn, bleeding, and peptic ulcers. They are also less likely to interfere with clotting than are other NSAIDs. Because of these differences, coxibs may be useful for people who cannot tolerate other NSAIDs and for people who are at high risk of certain complications (such as gastrointestinal bleeding) from use of other NSAIDs. Such people include the following: Older people People taking anticoagulants People with a history of ulcers People taking an analgesic for a long time However, coxibs, like other NSAIDs, appear to increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, and blood clots in the legs. As a result, before people with certain conditions are given a coxib, they are told about the risk and the need to be closely monitored. These conditions include Cardiovascular disorders (such as coronary artery disease) Strokes Risk factors for these disorders Coxibs, like other NSAIDs, are not appropriate for people who have heart failure or who are at increased risk of heart failure (such as those who have had a heart attack). Acetaminophen Acetaminophen is roughly comparable to aspirin in its potential to relieve pain and lower a fever. But unlike NSAIDs, acetaminophen has the following characteristics: Has virtually no useful anti-inflammatory activity Does not affect the blood's ability to clot Has almost no adverse effects on the stomach How acetaminophen works is not clearly understood. Acetaminophen is taken by mouth or a suppository inserted into the rectum, and its effects generally last 4 to 6 hours. Acetaminophen appears to be a very safe drug. However, high doses can lead to liver damage, which may be irreversible (see [Acetaminophen Poisoning](/home/injuries-and-poisoning/poisoning/acetaminophen-poisoning) [ Acetaminophen Poisoning Acetaminophen, a common ingredient in many prescription and non-prescription drugs, is safe in normal doses, but severe overdose can cause liver failure and death. People sometimes ingest too... read more ](/home/injuries-and-poisoning/poisoning/acetaminophen-poisoning) ). People with a liver disorder should use lower doses than those usually prescribed. Whether lower doses taken for a long time can harm the liver is less certain. People who regularly consume large amounts of alcohol are probably at highest risk of liver damage from overuse of acetaminophen. People who are taking acetaminophen and stop eating because of a bad cold, influenza, or another reason may be more vulnerable to liver damage. Opioid Pain Relievers Opioid pain relievers (analgesics)\u2014sometimes called narcotics\u2014are effective for many different types of pain. Usually, they are the strongest pain relievers. Opioids are chemically related to morphine, a natural substance extracted from poppies. Some opioids are extracted from other plants, and other opioids are produced in a laboratory. Opioids are often prescribed for a few days to treat severe pain that is likely to lessen quickly (such as pain due to injury or after surgery). Doctors usually switch people to nonopioid pain relievers as soon as possible because opioids may have side effects and there is a risk of misuse or addiction. Opioids are not usually recommended to treat people with chronic pain. Doctors sometimes prescribe opioids for longer periods of time for people who have severe pain due to cancer or a terminal illness, especially as part of care at the end of life, including [hospice care](/home/fundamentals/death-and-dying/hospice-care) [ Hospice Care Hospice is a concept and a program of care that is specifically designed to minimize suffering for dying people and their family members. In the United States, hospice is the only widely available... read more ](/home/fundamentals/death-and-dying/hospice-care) . In these situations, side effects can usually be prevented or managed, and misuse or addiction is less of a concern. Before prescribing opioids for any type of chronic pain, doctors consider What the usual treatment approach is Whether other treatments could be used Whether the person has a high risk of side effects from an opioid Whether the person is at risk of misuse or abuse of an opioid drug or is likely to use the drugs for other purposes (for example, to sell them) Doctors may refer people to a pain specialist or a mental health care practitioner who has expertise in substance misuse if the risk of having a problem is high. For example, people who have had an addiction usually need such a referral. When opioids are prescribed for chronic pain, doctors explain the nature of the person's disorder (if known) and the risks and benefits of other possible treatments, including nonopioid drugs and no treatment. Doctors ask people about their goals and expectations. They usually give the person written information that describes the risks of taking opioids. After people discuss this information with their doctor and understand it, they are asked to sign an [informed consent](/home/fundamentals/legal-and-ethical-issues/informed-consent) [ Informed Consent Before performing any invasive test or providing medical treatment, doctors must obtain permission from a competent patient in a manner that is informed and voluntary. The process is known as... read more ](/home/fundamentals/legal-and-ethical-issues/informed-consent) document. When doctors prescribe an opioid for chronic pain, they explain the risks and side effects of opioids. People are advised Not to drink alcohol or take antianxiety drugs or sleep aids when taking the opioid To take the recommended dose at the recommended times and not to change the dose To store the opioid in a safe, secure place Not to share the opioid with anyone To contact their doctor if the drug makes them drowsy or they have any other side effects (such as confusion, constipation, or nausea) To dispose of unused pills as directed To keep naloxone (an opioid antidote) on hand and to learn and teach family members how to administer it if an opioid overdose occurs If an opioid is prescribed, doctors have usual practices to ensure the person's safety. Doctors typically ask the person to get opioid prescriptions only from one doctor and fill prescriptions at the same pharmacy every time. They see the person frequently for follow-up visits and monitor the use of the drug to make sure it is safe and effective. For example, doctors may periodically test the person's urine to determine whether the drug is being taken correctly. They also ask the person to sign an agreement that specifies conditions required for opioid use, including any monitoring that may be needed. To avoid misuse by others, the person should keep opioids in a safe place and dispose of any unused drugs by returning them to the pharmacy. Side effects of opioids Opioids have many side effects. Side effects are more likely to occur in people with certain disorders: [kidney failure](/home/kidney-and-urinary-tract-disorders/kidney-failure/overview-of-kidney-failure) [ Overview of Kidney Failure Kidney failure is the inability of the kidneys to adequately filter metabolic waste products from the blood.

The following commonly occur when opioids are used: Drowsiness Mental fuzziness or confusion Nausea and vomiting Constipation Less common side effects of opioids include Retention of urine Itching A dangerous slowing of breathing Death Drowsiness is a common side effect of opioids. For some people who take opioids, drowsiness disappears or decreases within a few days. If people continue to feel drowsy, a different opioid can be tried because the degree of drowsiness caused by different opioids varies. Before an important event that requires alertness, people may be given a stimulant drug (such as methylphenidate or modafinil) to offset the drowsiness. For some people, drinking a caffeinated beverage helps offset the drowsiness. When feeling drowsy after taking an opioid, people should avoid driving and take extra care to prevent falls and accidents. Confusion can also result from taking opioids, especially if people are older. Opioids increase the risk of falls in older people. Nausea sometimes occurs in people with pain, and opioids can increase the nausea. Antiemetic drugs taken by mouth, suppository, or injection help prevent or relieve nausea. Some commonly used antiemetic drugs are metoclopramide, hydroxyzine, and prochlorperazine. The itching caused by taking opioids may be relieved by an antihistamine such as diphenhydramine, taken by mouth or given intravenously. [Constipation](/home/digestive-disorders/symptoms-of-digestive-disorders/constipation-in-adults) [ Constipation in Adults Constipation is difficult or infrequent bowel movements, hard stool, or a feeling that the rectum is not totally empty after a bowel movement (incomplete evacuation).

Increasing the intake of fluids and the amount of fiber in the diet can also help. [Osmotic agents](/home/digestive-disorders/symptoms-of-digestive-disorders/constipation-in-adults#v5612391) [ Laxatives ](/home/digestive-disorders/symptoms-of-digestive-disorders/constipation-in-adults#v5612391) such as polyethylene glycol can also be useful. These agents pull large amounts of water into the large intestine to stimulate bowel movements. Some people need enemas. When these measures are not effective, doctors may prescribe a drug (such as methylnaltrexone) that blocks only the effects of opioids in the stomach and intestine and does not lessen the pain relief. [Retention of urine](/home/kidney-and-urinary-tract-disorders/disorders-of-urination/urinary-retention) [ Urinary Retention Urinary retention is inability to urinate or incomplete emptying of the bladder. People who have incomplete emptying of the bladder may have urinary frequency or urinary incontinence. If the... read more ](/home/kidney-and-urinary-tract-disorders/disorders-of-urination/urinary-retention) can result from taking opioids, especially in men with an enlarged prostate. Trying to urinate a second time after a brief pause (double voiding) or applying gentle pressure on the lowest part of the abdomen (the area over the bladder) during urination may help. Sometimes a drug that relaxes muscles of the bladder (such as tamsulosin) is used. For most people, nausea and itching disappear or decrease within a few days. But constipation and retention of urine usually decrease much more slowly, if at all. Serious side effects can occur when people take too much of an opioid. These side effects include a dangerous slowing of breathing (respiratory depression), coma, and even death. The following adds to the risk of developing respiratory depression and of dying from respiratory arrest: Having certain conditions (such as liver, kidney, respiratory, or mental health disorders) Taking other drugs that cause drowsiness (such as benzodiazepines) Drinking alcohol Some of these side effects can be reversed with naloxone, an antidote usually given intravenously or sprayed into the nose. For people who are at increased risk of opioid side effects (including respiratory depression), doctors may prescribe naloxone when they prescribe the opioid. Nurses and family members or caregivers should watch for serious side effects of opioids and, if such side effects occur, be ready to inject naloxone or spray it into the person's nose. Doctors or pharmacists usually teach the person taking the opioid and family members or caregivers how to administer naloxone. [Tolerance](/home/drugs/factors-affecting-response-to-drugs/tolerance-and-resistance-to-drugs#v716107) [ Tolerance Tolerance is a person's diminished response to a drug, which occurs when the drug is used repeatedly and the body adapts to the continued presence of the drug. Resistance refers to the ability... read more ](/home/drugs/factors-affecting-response-to-drugs/tolerance-and-resistance-to-drugs#v716107) occurs in some people who take opioids repeatedly over time. They need higher doses because their body adapts to and thus responds less well to the drug. However, for most people, the same opioid dose remains effective for a long time. Often, the need for a higher dose means that the disorder is worsening, not that tolerance is developing. [Physical dependence](/home/special-subjects/illicit-drugs-and-intoxicants/opioids#v835696) [ Long-term effects Opioids, a class of drugs derived from the opium poppy (including synthetic variations), are pain relievers with a high potential for misuse.

Physical dependence is not the same as [opioid use disorder](/home/mental-health-disorders/substance-related-disorders/substance-use-disorders) [ Substance Use Disorders Substance use disorders generally involve behavior patterns in which people continue to use a substance (for example, a recreational drug) despite having problems caused by its use.

Dependence is characterized by a craving for the drug and compulsive, uncontrolled use of the drug despite the harm done to the user or other people. Most people who take opioids to control pain and have not previously had problems with drug abuse do not become addicted to opioids. Nonetheless, doctors regularly monitor people who are taking opioid analgesics for signs of addiction. Administration of opioids When possible, opioids are taken by mouth ( [orally](/home/drugs/administration-and-kinetics-of-drugs/drug-administration#v715386) [ Oral route Drugs are introduced into the body by several routes.

Problems with using opioids include opioid misuse, diversion, and abuse. Opioid misuse may be intentional or unintentional. It includes any use that differs from what is prescribed. Diversion involves selling or giving a prescribed drug to others. Abuse refers to recreational use of the drug. That is, the drugs are taken for the feelings of pleasure or sensations they produce, rather than to treat pain or another medical condition. Up to one third of people taking opioids for a long time to treat chronic pain misuse them. [Opioid use disorder](/home/mental-health-disorders/substance-related-disorders/substance-use-disorders) [ Substance Use Disorders Substance use disorders generally involve behavior patterns in which people continue to use a substance (for example, a recreational drug) despite having problems caused by its use.

It refers to compulsive use of opioids despite having problems caused by taking them. Also, people who have this disorder may require higher and higher doses to achieve the same effects and may experience withdrawal symptoms when they stop taking the opioid. They may try to stop taking opioids or reduce the amount they are taking but cannot. Taking high doses of opioids for a long time increases the risk of developing opioid use disorder. Adjuvant Analgesics Adjuvant analgesics are thought to work by changing the way nerves process pain. An adjuvant analgesic is the first and only drug used to treat pain due to nerve damage ( [neuropathic pain](/home/brain,-spinal-cord,-and-nerve-disorders/pain/neuropathic-pain) [ Neuropathic Pain Neuropathic pain is caused by damage to or dysfunction of the nerves, spinal cord, or brain.

Several types of drugs can be used to treat depression: Selective serotonin topical local anesthetics Antidepressants Antidepressants can often relieve pain in people even when they do not have depression. Tricyclic antidepressants (such as amitriptyline, nortriptyline, and desipramine) may be more effective for this purpose than other antidepressants, but newer antidepressants, such as selective serotonin venlafaxine, and milnacipran) may have fewer of the side effects that limit how much of the drug can be taken.

People may respond to one antidepressant and not to others, so sometimes doctors try a few drugs until an effective one is found. Antiseizure drugs Antiseizure drugs may be used to relieve neuropathic pain. Gabapentin and pregabalin are commonly used, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, pain in some people.

Anesthetics A local anesthetic, such as lidocaine, may be injected into the skin to control pain due to an injury or even neuropathic pain. Local anesthetics can also be injected around nerves to block pain\u2014a procedure called a nerve block. It is often used to treat pain caused by damage to a specific large nerve. For example, a [sympathetic nerve block](/home/brain,-spinal-cord,-and-nerve-disorders/pain/treatment-of-pain#v734871) [ Nondrug Pain Treatments Pain relievers (analgesics) are the main drugs used to treat pain.

(A sympathetic nerve block can relieve pain caused by overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system, which prepares the body for stressful or emergency situations.) Topical anesthetics, such as lidocaine applied as a lotion, an ointment, or a skin patch, can be used to control pain due to some conditions. Mexiletine, used to treat abnormal heart rhythms, is sometimes used to treat neuropathic pain. These anesthetics are usually used for a short period of time. For example, rinsing with small amounts of an anesthetic mouthwash a few times a day can relieve pain due to mouth sores. However, some people with chronic pain benefit from using topical anesthetics for a long time. For example, a lidocaine patch or gel can help relieve [postherpetic neuralgia](/home/infections/herpesvirus-infections/postherpetic-neuralgia) [ Postherpetic Neuralgia Postherpetic neuralgia is chronic pain in areas of skin supplied by nerves infected with herpes zoster ( shingles).

In one distraction technique, people may learn to visualize themselves in a calm, comforting place (such as in a hammock or on a beach) when they feel pain. Cognitive behavioral therapy may reduce pain and pain-related disability and help people cope. This type of therapy includes counseling to help people focus on coping with the pain, rather than on its effects and limitations. It may include counseling to help people and their family work together to manage pain. The importance of psychologic support for people in pain should not be underestimated. Friends and family members should be aware that people in pain suffer, need support, and may develop depression and anxiety, which may require psychologic counseling.
