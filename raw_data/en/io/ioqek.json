One is the 'art of healing ' which involves its own specialised brand of training. The art of healing is dependent on the prescriber 's foreknowledge and the clients' viewpoint of the prosperous results. The 'Science of healing ' is based on scientific and technological ideas. This tradition results in a lower liability for practitioners regarding the showing of an original approach to medicine, however the results of this method are more calculable (Kayne 2002). It is believed that the tradition of the 'art of healing' is increasing in popularity. The World Health Organisation states ' 'that the terms ' 'complementary medicine ' ' or ' 'alternative medicine' ' are used interchangeably with traditional medicine in some countries. They refer to a broad set of health care practices that are not part of that country 's own tradition and are not integrated into the dominant health care system\" (World Health Organization 2000). This type of treatment, is commonly known as 'Complementary and alternative medicine' (CAM). The word complementary derives from the meaning 'together with' established practices and the word alternative refers to 'in place' of established practices. Some patients choose to participate in complementary therapies along with the medication prescribed by their general practitioner whilst others prefer complementary therapies as opposed to the medications It could be considered that conventional medicine has indirectly contributed to the rise of complementary and alternative medicine. A broad definition of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) is \"a broad set of health care practices that are not part of that country's own tradition or conventional medicine and are not fully integrated into the dominant health-care system\" (The World Health Organisation, n.d.). Expanding on this definition it is important to address the variable similarities of CAM modalities. CAM therapies across the various modalities have in common a shared, in varying degrees, holistic approach and subscribe to some form of vitality - a contrast from the science-based view point of conventional medicine prevalent in western society. In spite of CAM therapies empirical nature and efficacies, it is suggested that dissatisfaction of conventional medicine underpins the popularity it has garnered, thus, it will be examined further as to how and why. A further discussion will be made to related dangers of both alternative and science-based medicine; providing an opportunity to constructively educate the public on the differences between the two systems. http://www.lookhealthy.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/treatment-for-arthritis1.jpg http://www.lookhealthy.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/treatment-for-arthritis1.jpg P5 - explain the advantages and disadvantages of complementary therapies in maintaining health and wellbeing Individuals living in rural and suburb areas may have very few centres which offer complementary therapies and might not know where their nearest one is. Evaluate the role of two complementary therapies in contemporary society. - D1 The term complementary medicine is used by conventional medical practitioners to refer to nom-invasive, non-pharmaceutical techniques which are used in conjunction with allopathic medical treatments such as drugs and surgery. The term implies that sometimes conventional medicine is used as a primary tool and also a non-invasive, non-pharmaceutical complementary technique is used as a supplement when needed. Complementary medicine has become an increasing feature of healthcare signs and symptoms, principles of administration, frequency / dosage of administration) (P1). 1c.The booklet should also explain how complementary therapies are regulated (e.g. legislation, code of ethics, code of practice, self regulation and enforcement). It should consider how effective these are at minimising risks. (P2) In modern medicine, alternative therapies are poorly understood and studied. The preference for alternative therapies, and herbal medicine were indicated, and the fear of relinquishing information regarding these practices were almost paralyzing. It seemed as though they were ashamed to admit to cultural healing practices, and did not divulge information to practitioners regarding their usage. The cultural disconnect was present as alternative/complimentary medicines are valued as a culture, and \"modern\" practitioners cast judgment on their usage. This perceived stigma additionally limited the information shared by the cultural participants with modern medical treatments, potentially causing additional harm, as some herbals are potentially toxic. Hi Kourtney, I agree with your opinion that just like any other healthcare method there are pros and cons to the complementary medicine and it is ultimately up to the person to make the choice and try it. There are Sceptics that may argue that the apparent benefits of the complementary medicine are just like a placebo effect because the patient is expecting for the treatment of therapy to work. I believe complementary medicine outcomes can be just like the outcomes of traditional medicine: there are benefits or positive results and also the potential for negative results or failure. Patients should explore their options and choose a method that is specifically useful for their condition and maximize results. Complementary Alternative Therapy The National Health Institute defines complementary alternative therapy as a health care methodology used outside of or in addition to mainstream medicine (National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), 2013). CAM is divided into five groups: (1) oral based product, such as supplements, (2) body manipulation, such as massage, chiropractic, reflexing and osteopathy, (3) mind and body therapies, consisting of yoga, tai chi, meditation, biofeedback and hypnosis, (4) energy touches, which includes Reiki, Gigong, and prayer; and (5) holistic approaches, such as homeopathy, naturopathy, traditional Chinese and Indian medicine. According to Efthimiou, Kukar, and Mackenzie (2009) there has been exponential growth in those who seek CAM. In 2010, data demonstrates that 40-60% of Americans use CAM to cope with medical conditions. This growth trend is attributed to increased public awareness through social media and patient's desires to try something new and promising. Barnes and Bloom (2008) determined that individuals decided to use CAM therapies because they were frustrated by the lack of response An increasing number of medical schools are now offering courses in alternative medicine for their students, and some hospitals already have alternative medicine departments. The availability of healers and doctors practicing holistic medicine has also increased in recent years, and more and more people are educating themselves in these new fields. In fact, the World Health Organization estimates that between 65 and 80 percent of the world's population (about 3 billion people) rely on traditional medicine as their primary form of health care. Alternative Medicine Steve Jobs tried alternative medicine after he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer before changing to conventional medicine until he died in 2011 (Williams, 2012, 90). Alternative medicine is defined as \"a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices and products that are not presently considered part of conventional medicine\"(NCCAM, 2011, 92). Moreover, people have known about alternative medicine for many years and some prefer it to conventional medicine. Thus, insurance companies should cover alternative medicine for two important reasons. The attitude that doctors tend to prescribe a pill for \"everything\" has become overwhelming and prominent in mainstream medicine. Patients are looking for other ways to treat their disease or condition without having to take prescription medications or use more holistic methods for their care. Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) allows people to try different options with their health care plan. \"Complementary and Alternative Medicine refers to a series of medical and health care practices and products that are not an integral part of conventional medicine due to insufficient proof of their safety and effectiveness\" (Su & Li, 2011). CAM has been widely described as using treatments with conventional medicine and/or in place of conventional medicine. While there are many different types of CAM, some treatments are well known and used in the United States. Research has shown that \"CAM has increasingly been accepted in the United States and all over the world\" (Frass, 2012). Some of those treatments include acupuncture, use of a chiropractor, and herbal supplements. People are increasingly turning to CAM therapies because it will be shown that some CAMs are effective. However, people are not aware of the potential side effects because research is not readily available. People must keep in mind that there are potential risks involved with using any type of CAM. Those risks can include worsening of the condition or injury. In addition, recommendations for using CAM will Monique Osigbeme Advanced Clinical Medicine University of Louisville School of Medicine July 2016 Complementary and Alternative Medicine: A Deeper Look In an ever-changing world, humans are evolving and with that come evolving diseases.

Collins SOC/201 Survey of Alternative Medicine November17, 2014 Kay Ach CAM Therapeutic Modalities In the pursuit of health and well-being, many Americans along with the world, have used Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) over the past decade. In July 30, 2009, National Health Statistic Reports demonstrated on a test conducted in 2007 \"that about 38.3% of adults (83 million persons) and 11.8% of children (8.5 million children under the age of 18 years) have used Complementary and alternative medicine\" (NHSR, 2009). In this paper, I will define the terms alternative medicine, complementary medicine, and integrative medicine and clarify how these terms differ. I will also describe how CAM Therapeutic Modalities Paper Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is important in todays' health care for researchers, practitioners, and consumers. Society should be aware of the safety of taking herbs, therapies, and any health topics. The CAM website can be a useful website to research information that a person wants to gain background on. In the following paper, I will give definitions of alternative, complementary, integrative medicine, conventional medicine role, CAMs philosophy, five domains of therapies, and research a treatment.
