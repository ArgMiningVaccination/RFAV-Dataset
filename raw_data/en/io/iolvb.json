Medicine (Baltimore) ; 102(12): e33365, 2023 Mar 24. | MEDLINE immune boosters (IBs) were promoted as [disease]-preventive agents. The present study examined the clinical outcomes among associated with the use of IBs in the absence of other competing causes. This single-center retrospective observational [cohort study]included [patients]with chronic [liver disease]admitted [jaundice], [ascites], or [hepatic encephalopathy]temporally associated with the [consumption]of IBs and followed up for 180 days. [Chemical analysis]was performed on the retrieved IBs. From April 2020 to May 2021, 1022 [patients]with [cirrhosis]were screened, and 178 (19.8%) were found to have consumed complementary and alternative medicines. Nineteen [patients]with [cirrhosis](10.7%), [jaundice], [ascites], [hepatic encephalopathy], or their combination related to IBs use were included. The [patients]were predominantly [male](89.5%). At admission, 14 (73.75%) [patients]had injury], and 1 (5.3%) had overt [encephalopathy]. Eight [patients](42.1%) died at the end of the follow up period. Hepatic [necrosis]and portal-based [phytochemicals]. Ayurvedic and Homeopathic supplements sold as IBs potentially cause the worsening of preexisting [liver disease]. Responsible dissemination of scientifically validated, evidence-based medical [health]information from regulatory bodies and media may help ameliorate this modifiable [liver] [health]burden.
