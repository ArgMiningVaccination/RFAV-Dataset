Su, MD, PhD1; MS1; Deborah MD2; Tom T. David K. Shay, MD1 On October 29, 2021, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) amended the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 (BNT162b2) mRNA vaccine to expand its use to children aged 5-11 years, administered as 2 doses (10 g, 0.2mL each) 3 weeks apart ( 1). As of December 19, 2021, only the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is authorized for administration to children aged 5-17 years ( 2,3). In preauthorization clinical trials, Pfizer- BioNTech vaccine was administered to 3,109 children aged 5-11 years; most adverse events were mild to moderate, and no serious adverse events related to vaccination were reported ( 4). To further characterize safety of the vaccine in children aged 5-11 years, CDC reviewed adverse events after receipt of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a passive vaccine safety surveillance system co-managed by CDC and FDA, and adverse events and health impact assessments reported to v-safe, a voluntary smartphone-based safety surveil - lance system for adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination,* during November 3-December 19, 2021. Approximately 8.7 million doses of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine were administered to children aged 5-11 years during this period; VAERS received 4,249 reports of adverse events after vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in this age group, 4,149 (97.6%) of which were not serious. Approximately 42,504 children aged 5-11 years were enrolled in v-safe after vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine; after dose 2, a total of 17,180 (57.5%) local and 12,223 systemic (40.9%) reactions (including injection-site pain, fatigue, or headache) were reported.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recom - mends the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for children aged 5-11 years for the prevention of COVID-19 ( 6). Parents and guardians of children aged 5-11 years vaccinated with Pfizer- BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine should be advised that local and systemic reactions are expected after vaccination.

VAERS is a national passive vaccine safety surveillance sys - tem, jointly managed by CDC and FDA, that monitors adverse events after vaccination ( 7). VAERS accepts reports from any - one, including health care providers,\u00a7 vaccine manufacturers, and members of the public. Symptoms, signs, and diagnostic findings in VAERS reports are assigned Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) preferred terms by VAERS staff members.\u00b6 VAERS reports are classified as serious if any of the following are reported: hospitalization, prolongation of hospitalization, life-threatening illness, permanent disability, congenital anomaly or birth defect, or death.** Reports of seri - ous adverse events receive follow-up by VAERS staff members to obtain additional information, including medical records. For reports of death, death certificates and autopsy reports are obtained, if available. CDC physicians reviewed all available information for each decedent to form an impression about cause of death.

CDC established v-safe, a voluntary smartphone-based active safety surveillance system, specifically to monitor adverse events after COVID-19 vaccination. Parents and guardians can enroll children in v-safe after either the first or second vaccine dose. Text message reminders for online health surveys are sent to parents or guardians to complete for a child.\u00a7\u00a7 Health surveys sent in the first week after vaccination included ques - tions about local injection site and systemic reactions (mild, moderate, or severe)\u00b6\u00b6 and health impacts (i.e., whether the child was unable to perform normal daily activities, missed school, or received care from a medical professional because of new symptoms or conditions). CDC's v-safe call center contacted a parent or guardian when a report indicated that a https://vsafe.cdc.gov \u00a7\u00a7 Children and adolescents aged 15 years must be enrolled by a parent or guardian and cannot self-enroll. Children aged 5-11 years might be enrolled in v-safe if they were vaccinated on or after November 3, 2021. Health check-ins are sent via text messages that link to web-based surveys on days 0-7 after vaccination; then weekly through 6 weeks after vaccination; and then 3, 6, and 12 months after vaccination. \u00b6\u00b6 Parents and guardians who participate in v-safe use the following definitions to describe the severity of a child's symptoms: mild (noticeable, but not problematic), moderate (limit normal daily activities), or severe (make daily activities difficult or impossible).Morbidity and Mortality Weekly ReportMMWR / December 31, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 51-52 1757 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Preventionchild received medical care for new or worsening symptoms; completion of a VAERS report, if indicated, was encouraged. VAERS and v-safe data collected during November 3- December 19, 2021 among children aged 5-11 years who received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine were analyzed and described overall and by sex, age group, and race/ethnic - ity. Among 5,277 VAERS reports received for children aged 5-11 years who received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, 1,028 (19.5%) were excluded from this analysis because vac - cination occurred before authorization for use in this age group or date of vaccination was unknown. SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute) was used to conduct all analyses. These activi - ties were reviewed by CDC and conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.*** Review of VAERS Data During November 3-December 19, 2021, VAERS received and processed 4,249 reports of adverse events (Table 1) for children aged 5-11 years who received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine; the median age was 8 years, and 1,896 *** 45 C.F .R. part 46, 21 C.F .R. part 56; 42 U.S.C.

Most children (4,143; 97.5%) received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine alone; seasonal influenza vaccine was the most frequently simultaneously administered vaccine (91 [2.1%] children). Overall, 4,149 (97.6%) VAERS reports were for nonserious events, and 100 (2.4%) were for serious events. The median age of children with reports of nonserious events was 8 years, and 1,835 (44.2%) of these reports were for males. The most commonly reported nonserious events were related to vaccine administration (some without any adverse event), including no adverse event (1,157; 27.9%), product preparation issue (925; 22.3%), and incorrect dose administered (675; 16.3%), (Table 2). The median age of children with reports of serious events was 9 years, and 61 (61.0%) reports were among males. The most commonly reported conditions and diagnostic find - ings among the 100 reports of serious events were fever (29; 29.0%), vomiting (21; 21.0%), and increased troponin\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7 (15; 15.0%). Among 12 serious reports of seizure, one child experienced syncope (not seizure) and another child potentially experienced syncope, two children experienced febrile seizure, one child had a history of seizures, two children had a poten - tially evolving seizure disorder, and five children experienced new-onset seizures. Among 15 preliminary reports of myocar - ditis identified during the analytic period, 11 were verified (by provider interview or medical record review) and met the case definition for myocarditis\u00b6\u00b6\u00b6; of these 11 children, seven recov - ered, and four were recovering at time of the report. VAERS received two reports of death during the analytic period; both are under review. These deaths occurred in two females, aged 5 and 6 years, both of whom had complicated medical histories and were in fragile health before vaccination. None of the data suggested a causal association between death and vaccination. Review of v-safe Data During November 3-December 19, 2021, v-safe enrolled 42,504 children aged 5-11 years who received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (Table 3); second dose information was available for 29,899 (70.3%) of these children. During the week after receipt of dose 1, local (23,290; 54.8%) and systemic (14,734; 34.7%) reactions were frequently reported; systemic \u00a7\u00a7\u00a7 T roponins are proteins found in myocytes (heart muscle cells). T roponin levels typically are measured as part of the evaluation of chest pain or other symptoms of possible myocardial damage. \u00b6\u00b6\u00b6 Acute myocarditis was defined as presence of signs and symptoms (one or more new or worsening of the following: chest pain/pressure/discomfort, dyspnea/shortness of breath/pain with breathing, palpitations, or syncope; or two or more of the following in children aged 11 years: irritability, vomiting, poor feeding, tachypnea, or lethargy); and one or more new finding of elevated troponin, electrocardiogram findings consistent with myocarditis, abnormal cardiac function or wall motion on echocardiogram, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging findings consistent with myocarditis, or histopathologic findings consistent with myocarditis; and no other identifiable cause for these findings.Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 1758 MMWR / December 31, 2021 / Vol. 70 / No. 51-52 US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Preventionreactions were more frequently reported during the week after dose 2 (12,223; 40.9%) than dose 1. Reactions were reported most frequently on the day after vaccination for both doses. The most frequently reported reactions after either dose were injec - tion site pain, fatigue, and headache. Fever was more frequently reported after dose 2 (4,001; 13.4%) than dose 1 (3,350; 7.9%). TABLE 2.

Each VAERS report might be assigned more than one MedDRA PT, which can include normal diagnostic findings. A MedDRA PT does not indicate a medically confirmed diagnosis. Reports of myocarditis and seizure were identified using a combination of MedDRA PTs; in some cases, reports of myocarditis (identified by fulfilling criteria of the CDC working case definition of myocarditis) and seizure did not have the MedDRA PT \"myocarditis\" or \"seizure\" assigned to them. https://www.meddra.org/how-to- use/basics/hierarchy Reports of no adverse event were accompanied by product preparation issue, incorrect dose administered, or underdose. \u00a7 VAERS reports are classified as serious if any of the following are reported: hospitalization, prolongation of hospitalization, life-threatening illness, permanent disability, congenital anomaly or birth defect, or death; MedDRA PTs are included with serious reports when they occur in association with the criteria for serious classification (i.e., radiologic or laboratory tests that occur during a hospitalization).Approximately 5.1% of parents reported that their child was unable to perform normal daily activities on the day after receipt of dose 1, and 7.4% after receipt of dose 2. Approximately 1% of parents reported seeking medical care in the week after vaccination; most medical care was received via a clinic appointment (441; 0.6%). Fourteen (0.02%) children reportedly received care at a hospital; information regarding reason for hospitalization was available for five children and included appendicitis (two), vomiting and dehydration (one), respiratory infection (one), and retropharyngeal cellulitis (one). Parents and guardians of all hospitalized children were contacted; two parents completed VAERS reports, and one revealed hospitalization was reported in error. Discussion This report provides preliminary safety findings from VAERS and v-safe data collected during the administration of approxi - mately 8 million doses of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to children aged 5-11 years. The findings summarized in this report are similar to the safety data from preauthorization tri - als for Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine administered to TABLE 3.

T rial participants who received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine frequently reported local (86.2%) and systemic (66.6%) reactions that were mostly mild (i.e., did not interfere with normal daily activities) or moderate (some interference with normal daily activities); no serious adverse events judged to be related to vaccination were reported ( 3). Among VAERS reports for children aged 5-11 years who received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, approxi - mately 97% were nonserious. The most common adverse events reported to VAERS in the age group were related to administration error. This age group is the first to receive a smaller dosage of mRNA (10 g) than that recommended for persons aged 12 years (30 g), and administration errors are not unexpected. Most reports of administration errors often mentioned that no adverse event was associated with receipt of an incorrect dose. Myocarditis is a rare and serious adverse event that has been associated with mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines; reporting rates for vaccine-associated myocarditis appears highest among males aged 12-29 years ( 8). To date, myocarditis among chil - dren aged 5-11 years appears rare; 11 verified VAERS reports have been received after administration of approximately eight million vaccine doses, and, in an active vaccine safety surveil - lance system, no chart-confirmed reports of myocarditis were observed during the 1-21 days or 1-42 days after 333,000 vaccine doses were administered to children of the same age (6) These cases appear consistent with other reports of myo - carditis after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination regarding time to symptom onset and a mild clinical course ( 9). T wo deaths after Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine were reported for children with multiple chronic medical conditions; on initial review, no data were found that would suggest a causal associa - tion between death and vaccination. Local (57.5%) and systemic (40.9%) reactions after receipt of dose 2 of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccination among v-safe registrants aged 5-11 years were less frequently reported than reactions reported among children and adolescents aged 12-15 years (local 62.4%; systemic, 63.4%) ( 9). Fourteen v-safe registrants aged 5-11 years were reported to have been hospitalized after vaccination. V-safe does not directly record diagnoses associated with hospitalization; however, parents and guardians can include supplemental text for each health check- in. Whether hospitalization was the result of vaccination could not be determined; however, all parents and guardians who reported a child's hospitalization were contacted and encour - aged to complete a VAERS report. T wo parents completed a VAERS report on behalf of a child who was reported to v-safe to have been hospitalized.Summary What is already known about this topic? In preauthorization trials for Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) COVID-19 vaccine, vaccinated children aged 5-11 years reported mild to moderately severe local and systemic reac - tions; no serious vaccination-related events were noted. What is added by this report? After authorization of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for children aged 5-11 years during October 2021, and administra - tion of approximately 8 million doses, local and systemic reactions after vaccination were commonly reported to VAERS and v-safe for vaccinated children aged 5-11 years. Serious adverse events were rarely reported. What are the implications for public health practice?? Parents and guardians of children aged 5-11 years should be advised that local and systemic reactions are expected after vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and are more common after the second dose. The findings in this report are subject to at least four limita - tions. First, VAERS is a passive surveillance reporting system and is subject to reporting biases and underreporting, especially of nonserious events ( 8). Second, data on race/ethnicity were not provided in >40% of VAERS reports. Third, v-safe is a voluntary program; as a result, v-safe data might not be repre - sentative of the vaccinated population. Finally, these data are limited by the short surveillance period and might change as safety monitoring continues and more doses are administered to children aged 5-11 years. Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent COVID-19 infection. ACIP recommends the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for children aged 5-11 years for the prevention of COVID-19 ( 10). Preliminary safety findings are similar to those described in the clinical trials. Parents and guardians of children aged 5-11 years vaccinated with Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine should be advised that local and systemic reactions are expected after vaccination. CDC and FDA will continue to monitor vaccine safety and will provide updates as needed to guide COVID-19 vaccination recommendations. Acknowledgments Isaac McCullum; Charles Licata.
