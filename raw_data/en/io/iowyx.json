While I am open to alternative schedules and working with the parents, I am foremost an advocate for the child and hence I DO recommend vaccination. My kids are vaccinated. I primarily use preservative-free vaccines where available. The safety & benefit from these vaccines far outweigh the tragedies of not vaccinating which I have experienced first hand. That said, we recognize that parents are bombarded with misinformation on vaccination. There is no link between [vaccines and autism](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/autism.html). If you want an authoritative look at that research, please read this [here](http://txnaturalpediatrics.com/2013/06/05/do-mmr-vaccine-cause-autism/). We are making you aware of the facts not to scare you or coerce you, but to emphasize the importance of vaccinating your child. We will do everything we can to help you understand, allay your concerns, and work with you on a mutually acceptable schedule to protect our precious little ones.

STILL NOT CONVINCED? CHECK THIS OUT Please note that I am not saying this purely from medical training. I grew up with kids around me afflicted by polio and being disabled for life. I have cared for children with heart and kidney damage caused by Diphtheria. Anyone who has witnessed smallpox would not wish it even on their worst enemy! a) Polio Afflicted Kids...(Copyright - WHO) b) Kid with Chicken Pox (copyright - AAP) c) Child with Measels (Copyright - CDC) We have two options: a) Either raise our kids in a bubble so that they are never exposed to such deadly killers b) Immunize and protect them.
