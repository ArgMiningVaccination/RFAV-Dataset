The tough stance of the CSM, which advises the drug regulatory body, the medicines control agency, will dismay the rising numbers buying what they assume are harmless herbal remedies over the counter. But in spite of previous warnings, the CSM says random tests continue to find banned substances, such as the herb aristolochia - used to treat rheumatism and skin conditions - which was associated with two cases of kidney failure in the UK in 1999 and which can also cause cancer. Steroids have repeatedly been found in preparations for eczema and psoriasis which are often bought by people to avoid using steroidal creams prescribed by doctors. Sometimes the quantity of illegal steroids in the Chinese medicines has been greater than that considered safe in licensed medicines, particularly for children. Mercury and arsenic compounds have also been found. Alastair Breckenridge, CSM chairman, said: \"There is clear evidence that standards used in the production of some traditional Chinese medicines on the UK market are, at best, unreliable. \"While many individual remedies are unlikely to pose any threat to public health, I am concerned that we continue to find further examples of traditional Chinese medicines containing potentially dangerous and often illegal ingredients. \"There is no reliable way for the public to identify those traditional Chinese medicines which could be unsafe. In the light of this evidence we are unable to give the public any general assurances as to the safety of traditional Chinese medicines on the UK market.\" More than 1,000 herbs are used in Chinese medicines, often in different quantities and combinations, according to the herbalist. There are now more than 3,000 clinics in Britain and the popularity of these and other herbal remedies is booming. They have not been through clinical trials, to ascertain exactly their effect, safety and the right dosage, and they are not licensed, but their defenders point out that the medicines have been used for thousands of years. The CSM says it is impossible for the man or woman in the street to be sure that they are getting a good quality product with no illegal ingredients. \"They should not take them if they are not labelled and include a list of ingredients in English. Even then, clear labelling is not in itself a guarantee of good quality standards,\" said Professor Breckenridge. He urged people to tell their doctor or pharmacist if they were taking a herbal remedy. The CSM says it intends to seek further powers to ban more potent or toxic ingredients from being used in herbal medicines. It is calling on the Chinese medicine sector to improve its quality and safety standards. The MCA is pressing Europe for agreement on a directive which would regulate traditional remedies. Four of the main organisations representing Chinese traditional medicine in the UK said in a joint statement that they were \"absolutely committed to compliance with the law and to the protection of public safety\". The Register of Chinese Herbal Medicine, the Association of Traditional Chinese Medicine, the Chinese Medical Institute and Register and the Society of Chinese Medicine said they were working with the suppliers to raise standards and would discipline any members of their associations \"found to be putting the public at risk\". Nick Lampert, president of the Register of Chinese Herbal Medicine, said: \"Chinese medicine is safe so long as people consult properly qualified practitioners and so long as proper quality controls are observed.\" Potential for harm in treatments Botanical name Gingko biloba Use To improve memory and blood circulation and stimulate the immune system.
