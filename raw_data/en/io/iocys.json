We celebrate her success story this National Naturopathic Medicine Week, created by the United States Senate through its Resolution urging Americans to learn more about \"the value of naturopathic medicine in providing safe, effective, and affordable health care.\" After moving from Hawaii to Connecticut in February 2016, Rosanna had a panic attack while driving and began taking a number of medications to treat her anxiety. These treatments brought unwanted side effects, made her feel even more anxious, and forced her to stop teaching fitness classes. Then she went to see licensed naturopathic doctor Jaquel Patterson. Dr. Patterson helped her rebuild her health by integrating a complete holistic spectrum. Just two months after starting Dr. Patterson's personalized protocol, which combined supplements, herbal teas, homeopathy, acupuncture, nutrition, and exercise, Rosanna is now anxiety-free. \"What I appreciate the most about my naturopathic doctor is that she takes the time to really listen,\" says Rosanna. \"She helped me understand that it is harder to build a healthy relationship with anxiety than just pop a pill; but it is totally worth it to find real healing with naturopathic medicine.\" Following Dr. Patterson's personalized naturopathic medicine protocol, Rosanna, who is a master reiki and certified essential oils aroma therapist, now feels healthier than she has in a long time. She is even teaching yoga and pilates again.
