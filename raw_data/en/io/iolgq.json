In the recent past, a concept has emerged wherein it has been shown that a CD4+ Th1 cell stimulating anti TB vaccine can be more effective if it has CD4+ Th17 cell stimulating property as well. With such an anti TB vaccine, the Th1 mediated immunity can further become stronger due to supportive effect of immune response induced by Th17 cell. Since Th1 and Th17 cells are pro inflammatory in nature, a TB vaccine capable of stimulating both of these cells may result in generation of a cumulative stronger pro inflammatory immune response. This raises an apprehension that such an increased immune response may cause adverse effects in the form of autoimmu- nity and inflammation in the vulnerable vaccinated subjects. Therefore, extensive studies to understand the spectrum and magnitude of occurrence of such diseases must be carried out with Th1 and Th17 inducing anti TB vaccine (s). This might help in understanding their risk/ benefit ratio while employing such Th1-Th17 inducing vaccines for clinical practice. Status of anti tuberculosis vaccine Tuberculosis (TB) caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is a major global health problem as it is a leading cause of more than 1.5 million deaths and of occurrence of nearly 10 million new cases every year. With the existing facilities and currently available tools, billions of USD would be required every year to fight against TB [1] which would be a heavy burden on world economy. In such a scenario, an effective vaccine against TB can play a significant role in cost effective global control of TB. Currently, BCG is the only approved vaccine which is available for its use against TB which shows partially but significant protection against TB (particularly against disseminated and meningeal TB) in children. However, its efficacy against pulmonary TB in adults is widely (0 - 80%) vari- able, across geographically different populations in the world [2]. Therefore, a need for better TB vaccine is strongly felt. Over the years, efforts have been made for: (i) developing prime-boost strat - egies (wherein priming is done by BCG followed by boosting with some MTB antigen) to improve performance of BCG, (ii) designing improved formats of BCG and (iii) searching new superior alter - nate of BCG. Following these approaches, about a dozen of new candidate vaccines have been developed [3,4] which are at various stages of their evaluation. Th17 may act as a supportive cell for Th1 inducing anti TB vac- cine After inhalation, in the form of aerosolized particles, MTB is engulfed, primarily, by macrophages and dendritic cells present in the lung alveoli. In 90-95% of healthy individuals MTB is killed and cleared by these phagocytic cells. Of the 5 - 10%, of the infected individuals, majority (90%) of the cases continue harboring MTB Citation: Om Parkash. \"Th17 Inducing Vaccine Against Tuberculosis May Cause Autoimmunity and Inflammation Mediated Adverse Effects\". Acta Scientific Microbiology 3.4 (2020): 08-11.09Th17 Inducing Vaccine Against Tuberculosis May Cause Autoimmunity and Inflammation Mediated Adverse Effects in the dormant form without showing any clinical sign of TB. This type of infection is known as latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). Further, those having LTBI have 5 - 10% risk for conversion to ac- tive TB during lifetime. On the other hand, MTB proliferate in in- fected phagocytes from 5 - 10% of the infected healthy subjects. In such an individual adaptive immune response comes into play where CD4+T cells are stimulated by MTB which then tend to pro- tect the host but fails to mount sufficient level of immunity to pro- tect the host. Ultimately, such individuals develop active tuberculo- sis [5]. Therefore, pre exposure and post exposure anti TB vaccines to prevent development of active TB (directly after MTB infection and from activation of LTBI, respectively) are being searched for global control and elimination of TB. On encountering with MTB, CD4+ T cells differentiate into various subtypes known as Th1, Th2, Th17 and T regulatory cells (Tregs). Conventionally, CD4+ helper type 1 (Th1) cell mediated immunity is considered to be protective against MTB infection (ac- tive TB and LTBI) [6]. Therefore, most of the strategies for search- ing vaccine(s) against TB have been focused on induction of immu- nity at the level of CD4+ Th1 cell. In the recent past, the role of IL-17 producing CD4+ Th17 cells towards protection against MTB infec- (active and LTBI) Th17 inducing MTB antigens could enhance the CD4+ Th1 medi - ated protection as has been found with some promising candidate vaccines [9-13] . Thus, Th17 inducing antigens in anti TB vaccine could be supportive in tuning up CD4+ Th1 mediated protective im- munity against towards autoimmunity and inflam- matory diseases Autoimmunity is a phenomenon where immune system reacts against body's self components. The diseases caused by such an abnormal behaviour of the immune response are called autoim- mune diseases. On the other hand, inflammation is an immuno- logical reaction which takes place in the body tissues due to stimuli generated by invasion of tissue by the pathogen or by persistence of irritant in the tissue or by components produced during tissue injury. Inflammation complements autoimmunity leading to auto- immune diseases. Normally, immune system maintains a balance between various immune components in the host just to avoid immune-toxicity. Occurrence of autoimmunity and inflammation in healthy subjects are prevented by immune tolerance generated by Tregs. In this context, Tregs have a role in immune tolerance through suppressing CD4+T helper cells (Th1 and Th17 cells) and thereby in protecting the host against occurrence of autoimmune and inflammation mediated diseases [14]. Contrary to this, Th1 and Th17 cells provoke inflammatory response. Primarily, Th1 cells produce IFN- and Th17 cells produce IL-17A, the cytokines produced by Th17 cells, IL-17A is the most widely studied and distinctive cytokine. This cytokine is known to be implicated, as an important component, in protective immune response against microbes on the one hand and to medi - ate immune-pathogenesis for tissue damage through inflammation on the other hand. Biologically, Th17 and Tregs act oppositely and are, thus, inversely correlated with each other i.e. down-regulation at the level of Tregs may up-regulate the Th17 mediated pro-in- [16]. Any alteration in Treg/ Th17 balance may disturb the immune homeostasis and a balance favoring Th17 cell can promote induction of autoimmune cells. The autoimmune cells, thus produced, interact with the corresponding antigens in tissues and proliferate further to give rise to more cells of their progeny. After encountering of the autoimmune cells with the respective antigens in the tissues, occurrence of inflammation is initiated by release of histamine, bradykinin and prostaglandins etc. by tissue insult. During inflammation immune cells like; T and B cells, neutrophils followed by macrophages and mast cells mi- grate to leukotrienes and proteolytic enzymes. All these components lead to infiltration of the involved tissue followed by its damage. If this process remains uncontrolled then tissue dam- age may progress further towards chronic inflammation which may stay for several months. Ultimately, tissues become fibrotic and thereby non functional due to replacement by fibrous connec- tive tissues during repair and remodelling of damaged tissues. Th17 inducing anti TB vaccine may cause induction of auto- immunity followed by progression to autoimmune and inflam - matory diseases The purpose of a vaccine is to produce protective immunity (after vaccination) against a targeted disease before or after its occurrence. It is well established that vaccination is a highly cost effective measure to eradicate and control communicable diseas - es. Thus far, vaccines have contributed significantly for effective control of several infectious diseases and thereby towards increas- ing the life expectancy. However, safety of vaccinated subjects is Citation: Om Parkash. \"Th17 Inducing Vaccine Against Tuberculosis May Cause Autoimmunity and Inflammation Mediated Adverse Effects\". Acta Scientific Microbiology 3.4 (2020): 08-11.10Th17 Inducing Vaccine Against Tuberculosis May Cause Autoimmunity and Inflammation Mediated Adverse Effects extremely important as vaccines are administered, generally, to healthy subjects. A desirable vaccine is the one which has best efficacy with no or minimum side effects. Regarding Th17 induc- ing TB vaccine, presence of Th17 inducing suppressing [5] antigens in TB vaccine might skew balance towards Th1 and Th17 mediated immune response which further might be intensi - fied on encountering with the MTB derived antigens and/or with some other cross-reactive antigens prevailing in other microbes and/or in host tissues. Since both, Th1 and Th17 cells, are pro- inflammatory (though Th17 cell is considered to be more potent), a cumulative stronger pro inflammatory effect could be generated which may favor generation of autoimmune and inflammatory re- sponses (following the phenomena described in the foregoing part of the article). This gives rise to an apprehension that, in addition to protection, vaccination with Th17 inducing vaccine may (i) trig- ger inflammatory response (as Th17 response is generated earlier than that by CD4+ Th1 cells) in those subjects who are prone to such a pathophysiological phenomenon (ii) provoke the existing subclinical inflammatory disease to become overt (iii) exacerbate the existing inflammation mediated disease (iv) may promote re- lapse of any subsided or cured inflammatory disease and (v) may induce autoimmunity and thereby autoimmune disease. Thus, it appears that protective efficacy of Th17 inducing vaccine could be compromised by induction, progression and perpetuation of auto- immune and inflammation mediated adverse effects [17] in some vaccinated vulnerable subjects. Conclusion Considering all the facts together, it is worth suggesting that a Th1 as well as Th17 inducing vaccine against TB must be inves - tigated extensively to understand whether such a vaccine could give rise to autoimmune and other inflammatory diseases. If yes, then what could be the spectrum and magnitude of such adverse events. Further, it would be important to understand whether such a Th1 as well Th17 inducing vaccine could be acceptable, in terms of risk/ benefit ratio. Even if the frequency is low, the adverse reac- tions should not be ignored and once observed they must be man- aged clinically, depending upon their seriousness. This, ultimately, can help in preventing the damage and impairment of the func- tions of involved tissues by Th1-Th17 inducing anti TB vaccine. Regarding management of Th17 induced autoimmune cum in- flammatory diseases, anti IL-17 therapies appear to be promising [18]. Further, it is worth mentioning that search of non pathogenic or less pathogenic Th17 cell [8,19] inducing MTB antigens having ability to generate protective immunity against TB could be appre- ciable. The antigens thus selected may help in reducing the chances for generation of Th17 mediated autoimmunity and inflammatory diseases on their use as protective anti TB vaccines. Acknowledgement Nil.
