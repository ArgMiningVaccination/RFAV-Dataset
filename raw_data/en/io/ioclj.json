So how do we know these medicines are safe? Believe it or not, the answer comes from a \"living fossil ,\" which still inhabits the mid -Atlantic coast of the USA \u2014the amazing horseshoe crab. The latest film by award -winning filmmaker Tom Fitz, Horseshoe Crabs : Prehistoric Paramedics , tells the fascinating story of the Atlantic horseshoe crab and its vital connec tion to human health and shorebirds. This 15 -minute educational film connects human health, environmental, and economic issues that are centered on the Atlantic horseshoe crab and its remarkable natural history. Viewers will learn how this animal's uniqu e immune system inspired scientists to develop an indispensible tool, which ensures injectable medications are free of bacterial contaminants. But as horseshoe crab harvesting increases to supply international demands for eel and conch bait, ecologists le arn that not only humans rely on this intriguing animal. Migratory shorebirds like the threatened red knot, which feed heavily on horseshoe crab eggs during their northward migration, also declined in number as horseshoe crab harvesting pressure increased. Realizing the myriad values of the horseshoe crab, scientists, industries, and government agencies are now working together to maintain sustainable populations of the horseshoe crab. How to Use This Guide Horseshoe Crabs: Prehistoric Paramedics serves as an excellent discussion starter and entry point for students to learn about this primitive arthropod, its interesting adaptations, and its importance to human health and the environment. This guide can be used to supplement study of the Next Generatio n Sunshine State Science Standards, specifically alongside lessons covering organization and development of living organisms, comparisons of functions of organs and other physical structures in animals, diversity and evolution of living organisms, and inte rdependence of living things. Th is guide also integrates Next Generation health education and language arts standards. The \"student briefing\" provided on pages 3-8 may be distributed to the class prior to or after viewing the film and either read togethe r or individually.

Its spiny shell, ten spiderlike legs, and spear -shaped tail all appear threatening. But as forbidding as the horseshoe crab may appear, it is actually harmless. In fact, this amazing creature helps keep you out of harm's way. Each time you get an injection at a doctor's office, you can thank the horseshoe crab for protecting you from harmful bacteria. Read on to find out how! LIVING FOSSILS Atlantic horseshoe crab s are a type of arthropod . Despite their name , horseshoe crabs are not actually crabs. They are more closely related to spiders and scorpion s. But this evolutionary kinship with spiders and scorpions dates back hundreds of millions years. There are four living (extant) species of horseshoe crabs, and they very closely resemble their ancestors from long ago. In fact, the horseshoe crab has changed very little in its general appearance in over 400 million years. For this reason, it is often referred to as a \"living fossil.\" BACTERIA BEWARE ! So how do horseshoe crabs keep you safe from bacteria? The answer is in its unique immune system. Special cells in horseshoe crab blood can detect endotoxins, a harmful substance made by bacteria. When endotoxins are pre sent, blood cells called amoebocytes release substances that cause the blood to form a gel. This immobilizes the bacteria and prevents them from spreading further into the body. The amoebocytes then release anti -bacterial compounds that kill the \"captured\" bacteria cells. Humans may also be harmed if bacteria and their endotoxins enter our blood. It is very important that vaccines or other injected medicines are free of endotoxins. Even if the bacteria are killed through sterilization, the remaining toxin s can be harmful. Fortunately, scientists figured out a way to use horseshoe crab amoebocytes to detect dangerous bacteria. The Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate (or LAL ) test is now used around the world to make sure medicines are free of endotoxins . David M. Goehring 5 Here is h ow the test generally works: A sample of the medicine is diluted in water. Several drops of this mixture are placed in a vial containing horseshoe crab amoebocytes, which were extracted from horseshoe crab blood. If the liquid mixture forms into a gel, t hen the medicine is contaminated with endotoxins from bacteria and cannot be used. FISH FOOD Horseshoe crabs are not just important for human health. They are also important to the fishing industry. Horseshoe crabs are used as bait for eel and conch fishi ng. Harvesting horseshoe crabs for bait along the US Atlantic seaboard increased dramatically between 1970 and 1995. Faced with such pressures, horseshoe crab populations eventually began to decline. NOT ONLY HELPFUL TO HUMANS Many s horebirds r ely on horseshoe crab eggs for food. Each year, between April and June, horseshoe crab s emerge from the Atlantic Ocean to spawn on sandy beaches. Female horseshoe crabs bury thousands of eggs in the sand . Around this time, migratory shorebirds arrive from South America on their way to the A rctic for summer breeding season. The birds are hungry and the abundant horseshoe crab eggs help supply them with energy to finish the voyage. The red knot is one shorebird that really counts on horseshoe crab eggs. As horseshoe crabs declined due to over -harvesting or other population pressures, the number of nesting red knots in the Arctic also declined. Scientists hypothesize that there is a direct relationship between the number of horseshoe crabs and migration succe ss of red knots. Today, scientists, industries , and governments are working to gether to protect the horseshoe crab and the red knot. By placing a limit on the number of harvested horseshoe crabs, the population is growing. Horseshoe crabs are once again easy to spot on beaches and the red knots are returning. Why is horseshoe crab blood BLUE ? You might be WONDERING... Horseshoe crab blood contains a molecule called hemocyanin, which moves oxygen around th e body. Each hemocyanin molecule contains two copper atoms. When oxygen is present, copper gives off a bluish hue. Human blood contains hemoglobin, which uses iron instead of copper to carry oxygen. Can you guess what color iron turns when oxygen is prese nt? 6 A CLOSER LOOK Horseshoe crabs and other invertebrates lack an adaptive immune system \u2014they ca nnot develop antibodies to fight infections. Instead, the horseshoe crab has a blood -clotting mechanism that \"traps\" and inactivates harmful bacteria. The detection, immobilization, and destruction of bacteria in horseshoe blood follow three steps: 1\u2014Rece ptors on the plasma membrane of the amoebocyte detect the presence of endotoxins from bacteria. The cell reacts by directing both small and large granules from within the cytoplasm to move toward the plasma membrane. 2\u2014Clotting enzymes and coagulating pr oteins are released from the large granules into the surrounding plasma. This activates the clotting mechanism and a gel -like clot forms around the invading microbes. 3\u2014Anti-microbial compounds, such as tachyplesin, are released from the small granules . These compounds destroy the bacteria.

In the film we learned that very little has changed about the body design of horseshoe crabs in over 350 million years. How do we know this? o Discuss how scientists use fossils and relative dating to understand evolutionary relationships of exti nct species. o Explain that numerous species of horseshoe crabs appear in the fossil record over hundreds of millions of years but with very little change in physical appearance. o Explain that the term \"living fossil\" is often used to describe the horseshoe crab, but that it is not completely accurate. Technically, a living fossil is an extant species that also appears in the fossil record. The Atlantic horseshoe crab does not exist in the fossil record, but it is very similar to extinct species that do. o Give students other examples of \"living fossils.\" crocodiles alligator snapping turtle okapi ginkgo tree 2. What does the small change in horseshoe crab body design over hundreds of millions of years say about this species in terms of its ability to adapt to a changing environment? o Ask students what usu ally happens to a species when it fails to adapt to changing environmental conditions. o Explain that many species demonstrate change in characteristics over time (evolution) but some species do not change or chan ge very little. o Students should understand that the horseshoe crab appears to be very well adapted to the environmental conditions occurring over the last 350 -450 million years. 3. Scientists and citizens are trying to protect the horseshoe crab from over harvesting. Why should society care about the plight of horseshoe crabs? o Horseshoe crab blood is a vital tool for making safe medicines. o The LAL test is the best test available for ensuring there are no bacteria or bacterial toxins in vaccines and other me dicines. HORSESHOE CRABS \u2014PREHISTORIC PARAMEDICS Discussion Questions/Writing Prompts Use the following questions to stimulate classroom discussion or as writing prompts. Either way, the goal is to foster discussion on the lev el of synthesis and analysis. Below each question, you will find supporting information and recommendations to facilitate classroom discussion . 10 o Ask students to consider the importance of horseshoe crabs to shorebirds like the red knot. o Explain to students that over -harvesting for fishing can cause the horseshoe crab population to drop so much that future supplies of fishing bait may not be available. 4. In addition to overharvesting, what are some other factors that may limit the size of horseshoe crab populations? o Possible responses include : Nesting habitat \u2014sandy beaches with low wave energy are important for successful spawning. Human disturbances of beaches can limit reproduction. Nursery habitat \u2014shallow bays with good water quality are important for young horseshoe crabs. Salinity is an important water quality factor. Juvenile horseshoe crabs prefer relatively high salinity. Preda tion\u2014as shorebirds and other egg predators increase in numbers, more horseshoe crabs will be eaten. Discuss the role of predation as a mechanism of population control. Explore the dynamics of populations in the context of predator -prey interactions. Food \u2014horseshoe crabs eat a variety of soft -shelled mollusks, small arthropods, and marine worms. Factors that result in declines of horseshoe crab prey would also result in declines of horseshoe crabs. 5. The horseshoe crab monitoring program was discussed in t he film. Scientists and volunteers attach a tag to a horseshoe crab. The tag has a unique ID number and a phone number to call if you find an animal with a tag. a. If you found a horseshoe crab with one of these tags, would you take the time to report it? What information do you think would be most important to have when you call the number? o Tag identification number, the specific location (GPS coordinates best), date, time, whether the animal is alive or dead b. What are some of the ways this information he lps scientists and government agencies? o Prompt students to recall from the film what knowledge is gained from tagging. where the animals live where they move how long they live the status of the population 11 o Remind students that government agencies must make regulations to protect a natural resource if it is threatened. Ask students how data from the tagging program might be beneficial to agencies tasked with making regulatory decisions. 6. Why is it so important to keep bacteria out of vaccines and other medicines that are injected into your body? o Discuss the role of bacteria and other germs in human sickness. o Point out that our skin and other surfaces (e.g. mouth, lungs, stomach) act as a barrier to germs. mucus linings in sinuses and lungs tears in ey es acid in stomach o Discuss how all of these defenses are bypassed when something is injected directly into the bloodstream. o Ask students to identify another situation when bacteria may easily enter the body (i.e., cuts and skin abrasions) 7. Prior to the development of the LAL test, health laboratories only used live rabbits to test whether injectable medicines were safe for human use. Rabbits received injections of the medicine and if they developed fevers, the medicine was determined to have endotoxins. In what ways do you think the LAL test is an improvement on the endotoxin test? o Possible answers include: more accurate takes less time (90 seconds vs. several days) more economical less harm to animals (most horseshoe crabs are not harmed) 8. Endotoxins are found in bacteria. Are there other infectious or toxic agents that we must keep out of injectable medicines? What are they? o Possible answers include: viruses parasites fungi o Discuss other methods commonly used to detect the presence of pathogens, such as antibody tests, cultures, DNA/RNA tests. 12 Exploration Activity: LAL Gel -Clot Test TEACHER'S GUIDE In this lab, students will conduct the LAL gel -clot endotoxin test to reinforce their understanding of horseshoe crab amoebocytes and their use in med ical laboratory testing. After viewing Horseshoe Crabs: Prehistoric Paramedics , students will use the LAL test to determine whether pond water contains endotoxins from gram -negative bacteria. While samples are incubating, the teacher will present a brief s lideshow about endotoxins, the horseshoe crab immune system, amoebocyte structure and function, and the LAL test. This activity is adapted from the LAL-LAB: BACTERIA, BLOOD & BIOMEDICAL TESTING activity originally d eveloped by the Delaware Division of F ish and Wildlife , Aquatic Resources Education Center .

Humans benefit from certain bacteria in many ways \u2014nitrogen fixation, decomposition, food digestion, fermentation of foods, biotechnol ogy applications. Other types of bacteria are harmful to humans and may cause serious infections. Gram -negative bacteria refers to a broad category of bacteria that are characterized by having an outer membrane contain ing substances called endotoxins . Endotoxins are a type of pyrogen . When pyrogens enter the body they cause fevers. In serious cases, endotoxins can cause comas and even death. Our skin acts as a barrier to prevent bacteria from entering our bodies. We are not harmed by endotoxins when we s wallow them because our digestive system breaks them down. When endotoxins are put directly into our bloodstream, the body's barrier defenses are bypassed and we can get very sick. Sterilization helps remove living gram -negative bacteria, but not endotoxi ns-- they can persist in the solution even after heat sterilization. Any medicine or medical equipment that comes into direct contact with blood or internal tissue must be free of endotoxins. This includes vaccines, injectable medications, medical implant s, needles, surgical tools. Horseshoe crabs live in a marine world teeming with gram -negative bacteria, but they lack an adaptive immune system \u2014they cannot develop antibodies to fight infections as humans can. Horseshoe crabs have a blood clotting mechani sm involving specialized cells called amoebocytes. The clotting mechanism involves detection, immobilization, and destruction of gram -negative bacteria. Receptors on the plasma membrane of the amoebocyte detect the presence of endotoxins from bacteria. The cell reacts by direct ing small and large granules located within the cytoplasm to move toward the plasma membrane. Clotting enzymes and coagulating proteins are released from the large granules into the surrounding plasma. This activates the clotting m echanism and a gel -like clot forms around the invading microbes. Anti-microbial compounds, such as tachyplesin, are released from the small granules and destroy the bacteria. The clotting component of this immune response is the basis for the Limul us Am oebocyte Lysate (LAL) test. Frederick Bang, a medical researcher, first identified the mechanisms of the horseshoe crab immune response in a 1957 research paper. He later collaborated with Dr. Jack Levin, a hematologist (blood specialist), to pioneer the methods of the LAL test. 14 After Bang and Levin published their findings, other researchers investigated and refined the LAL technology. Today, the LAL test is an industry standard for detecting endotoxins in certain medicines and medical equipment. Many lives have been saved by this scientific discovery. Horseshoe crabs play a surprising role in human wellbeing. This is another example of how the Earth's plants and animals can be very important to society and why we should work to protect as much bi ological diversity as possible. Procedure Pre-class Preparation Success of this demonstration depends on access to endotoxin -free (pyrogen -free) water for use as a control. Since contaminated distilled water may contain enough bacteria or endotoxins to giv e a positive test result, it is critical that you test distilled water prior to the lab. Using the procedures described below, test the distilled water to confirm that it is endotoxin -free. Collect \"contaminated\" water from a pond, aquarium, or similar so urce. Gather and set out other required materials. Set up computer and projector for film viewing and presentation. Have distilled and contaminated water available in vessels that students can pour from into their sample cups. Class Introduction After vi ewing Horseshoe Crabs: Prehistoric Paramedics , explain to the class that they will now conduct their own LAL gel clot test. Show the class a n LAL gel -clot vial. Ask the students what they think the vial contains. Students should recall from the film that t he vial contains components of horsesho e crab blood, specifically amoebocytes. Explain to students that LAL stands for Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate . Limulus is the genus of the horseshoe crab, amoebocyte references the specialized cells involved in the test, and lysate refers to the contents of the amoebocytes that are collected during the extraction procedure (isolated amoebocytes are placed in purified water, which causes them to lyse . The cell contents, or lysate, are then isolated, freeze dried, and place d into test vials ). LAL Gel Clot Test Pass out the student instruction sheet provided below, then review the procedure. Students should wash their hands thoroughly before and after this laboratory activity. Once the students have completed the test and cl eaned up their lab space, show the class the supplementary presentation while the samples incubate. Once the incubation period has ended, ask students to examine their sample vials and complete the worksheet provided below. Alternatively, the questions p rovided in the worksheet may be reviewed and discussed as a class. 15 Student Instructions: LAL Gel -Clot Test In this activity you will test for the presence of endotoxins using the same LAL test used by researchers and medical companies. You will test two samples \u2014 distilled water and pond water. After conducting the tests, you will complete a worksheet on your observations and answer follow up questions. Step 1: Gather and organize materials. Each student (or team of students) needs the following: 2 gel-clot LAL single test vials 2 sterile plastic graduated pipettes (1.0 ml) 2 sterile cups Sterile water Pond (or aquarium) water Permanent marker Step 2: Set up sample cups and gel clot vials . Label one cup \"SW\" (i.e. sterile water) and the other \"PW\" (i .e. pond water). Take care not to touch the inside of the cups . Pour approximately 20 ml of purified water into the cup labeled \"SW.\" Pour approximately 20 ml of the pond water into the cup labeled \"PW .\" Label one of the LAL gel clot vials \"SW\" and the o ther \"PW.\" Step 3: Collect and incubate samples Remove the first pipette from its sterile wrapping. Identify the 0.25 ml mark on the pipette. You may want to mark the 0.25 ml level with a permanent marker if it is difficult to see. Remove the seal and cap from the vial labeled \" SW.\" Hold the vial cap or place it on a clean surface. Also be careful not to touch the vial opening. Squeeze the pipette bulb then insert the tip into the sterile water sample. Slowly release the pressure with your fingertips until the sample partially fills the pipette. Now apply pressure to the bulb until the sample reaches the 0.25 ml level. Keeping steady pressure on the bulb, move the pipette over the vial. Slowly apply pressure until all the sample is transferred into the vial . Immediately recap the vial, and then swirl the contents several times to mix. Using the second pipette, repeat these steps for using the cup and vial labeled \"PW.\" Set both vials to the side. They will need to incubate for 15 minutes. Clean up and put a way materials as instructed by your teacher. Step 4: Observe test results At the end of the incubation period, pick up each vial and invert it. Compare the samples in each vial and enter your observations on the student worksheet. 16 Test Results Sam ple ID Sample Description Did a gel clot form? Yes or No?

It is used to confirm that a positive result is not due to contamination . 2) What can you conclude from this test? Explain your answer. If the test was negative for the control and positive for pond water, the student should conclude that endotoxins wer e present in the pond water but not in the sterile water. Students may recognize that the LAL test is not confirmation of living bacteria, only endotoxins. 3) In your test, the sterile water sample may have formed a clot. What are two possible explanations for this sample forming the gel clot? A positive result in the sterile water sample confirms that the sample contained endotoxins. The endotoxins could have been present in the distilled water or may have entered the sample as a result of contamination du ring the test (e.g. transfer from students hands) or from contaminated testing equipment.
