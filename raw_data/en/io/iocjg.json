This case seeks immediate relief on behalf of a putative class of Petitioner- Plaintiffs (\"Plaintiffs\") at imminent risk of contracting COVID -19 due to their civil immigration confinement by Respondents -Defendants (\"Defendants\") . Despite a known COVID- 19 outbreak within Elizabeth Detention Center (\"EDC\") in New Jersey , Defendants keep Plaintiffs locked up in unsafe , congregate conditions at the facility , pursuant to a contractual agreement between CoreCivic, a pri vate prison corporation, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") .

COVID- 19 is an infectious disease that the World Health Organization has declared to be a global pandemic.1 Experts estimate that as many as 214 million people in the United States could become infected, and as many as 1.7 million people could die.2 As of May 14, 2020, 85,870 people have died from COVID -19 in the U.S., 9,946 of them in the state of New Jersey.3 Older individuals and i ndividuals with certain pre-existing conditions are known to be at heightened risk for serious, and potentially deadly, complications from the disease.4 In addition, individuals of all ages and without pre -existing conditions have been hospitalized at significant rates and have suffered serious injury and death due to complications from the disease.5 3. As a result of the harms associated with COVID -19, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy declared a state of emergency on March 9, 2020.6 The New Jersey Supreme Court, and Governor Murphy have taken steps to mitigate risk in jails and prisons by ordering the release of large numbers of people in criminal confinement.7 1 World Health Organization, WHO Director- General's opening remarks at the media briefing on COVID- 19 (Mar. 11, 2020), https://bit.ly/35HR8GC. 2 Sheri Fink, Worst -Case Estimates for U.S. Coronavirus Deaths , The N.Y.

The Trump Administration also declared a national emergency on March 13, 2020.8 On April 3, 2020, Attorney General William Barr issued a directive to the Bureau of Prisons, instructing them to \"release all inmates who have Covid- 19 risk factors, as established by the CDC,\" permitting them to serve the remainder of their sentences in home confinement.9 5. ICE has taken a different approach. On March 18, 2020, ICE issued a statement that it would not be releasing people from civil immigration confinement due to COVID- 19.10 After several lawsuits and under increasing public pressure, ICE directed its field offices to review the continued detention of certain individuals with a high risk of serious illness from COVID -19.11 To date, t he agency has released only around 900 immigrants detained in its jails and prisons nationwide ,12 and 27,908 individuals remain locked up.13 On April 17, 2020, ICE Acting Director Matthew Albence testified to Congress that ICE had released everyone it planned to release, emphasizing that continued detention was necessary to deter a \"rush at the borders.\"14 8 White House, Proclamation on Declaring a National Emergency Concerning the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID -19) Outbreak (Mar. 13, 2020), https://bit.ly/2A4SRdq. 9 William P.

The pandemic has served as a key justification for the A dministration's \"larger strategy to reduce overall immigration .\"15 President Trump announced a wide -reaching immigration ban, backing away from the plan in part only in response to criticism by business groups.16 Border officials have \"summarily expelled\" over 20,000 immigrants at the U.S.- Mexico borde r since late March .17 Within the United States, ICE has reduced, but has not eliminated, enforcement actions, and continues to take individuals into custody, including at EDC . 18 7. On March 19, 2020, news broke of the first publicly confirmed ICE employee to test positive for COVID -19: a medical staffer at EDC .19 COVID -19 quickly spread to both other staff and those confined in EDC thereafter. 8. Since that date , more than 965 detained people have tested positive for COVID -19 in civil immigration confinement across the country \u2014over half of the population ICE has tested.20 Eighteen of those individuals are in EDC . These data vastly undercount the number of people with COVID -19 since ICE does not engage in universal testing of people in civil immigration confinement.

On May 14, 2020, it was reported that a CoreCivic guard at EDC died after contracting COVID- 19. He last reported to work on April 20, 2020.22 10. Although ICE does not release the numbers of confirmed cases or deaths among employees of private prison companies that it contracts with,23 this recent death confirms a widespread contagion of COVID -19 at EDC. Indeed, the deteriorating conditions at EDC have compelled individuals, including Plaintiff Albert Boampong,24 to engage in hunger strike s.25 11. In response to the rapid spread of the disease in jails and prisons, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (\"CDC\") issued guidelines for jails and prisons to reduce the spread of the disease. 26 These guidelines do not eliminate risk but provide mechanisms to lower risk in the absence of alternatives, such as release. Medical experts that have considered the risk to detained people have agreed that release is the only adequate protection. ICE subsequently issued a series of protocols for its jails and prisons to adopt, some of which contradict the CDC guidelines.27 Neither the CDC guidelines nor ICE requirements are being adequately implemented or enforced in EDC. 21 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE Guidance on COVID -19, Confirmed Cases (May 14, 2020), https://www.ice.gov/coronavirus. 22 Emily Kassie (@emilykassie), Twitter (May 14, 2020, , Ex.

Even prior to COVID -19, condi tions in EDC were deficient in several respects, including health and sanitation.28 13. Conditions in EDC with COVID- 19 have become even more unsafe and expose detained individuals to an elevated risk of serious illness . Social distancing is impossible for those in custody and those who work at EDC . Soap, hand sanitizer, and cleaning supplies are in short supply, making it impossible for individuals t o maintain proper personal hygiene. EDC does not have sufficient or consistent access to protective equipment for individuals in custody or staff. As a matter of policy, EDC cohort s individuals with suspected, not just confirmed cases, increasing exposure. In addition, s taff and vendors who are potentially exposed to COVID -19 outside EDC regularly come into the facility despite evidence that individuals may be asymptomatic for days before exhibiting symptoms of COVID- 19. 14. The medical unit within EDC is insufficiently equipped \u2014in terms of staff, expertise, and equipment \u2014to meet the medical needs during this epidemic. EDC does not even have an in-house infirmary. 15. Despite the rapid spread of COVID -19 within EDC and repeated outreach by advocates , ICE has not provided the individuals in confinement, their families, attorneys, and other advocates, or the general public with timely information about the steps taken at the prison to protect public health. ICE has not provided detained individuals or their families, attorneys, and other advocates with access to files, including medical records, https://bit.ly/3b8L9Mk; U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Enforcement and Removal Operations, COVID- 19 Pandemic Response Requirements (Version 1.0) (Apr. 10, 2020), https://bit.ly/3dpBORN. 28 Human Rights First, Ailing Justice: New Jersey Inadequate Healthcare, Indifference, and Indefinite Confinement in Immigration Detention February 2018, https://bit.ly/35IR0Hd.

The denial of accurate and relevant information is particularly detrimental for unrepresented individuals. 16. ICE has the authority to release every individual in its jails on humanitarian parole, bond, conditional parole, recognizance, and/or supervised release. Nonetheless, ICE has declined to release more than a small fraction of those in its custody. Even after public pressure and individual lawsuits prompted ICE to issue some limited guidance on releases, the vast majority of people, including Plaintiffs, remain confined . 17. The system left for these individuals to seek a prompt and fair custody re view is in shambles. Defendants have suspended in- person visitation; vastly restricted detaine d people 's ability to access law libraries, telephones, and/or videoconferencing with family or lawyers; delay ed or den ied prompt confidential legal calls with counsel; and decline d to provide individuals with access to evidence, including medical records and evaluations necessary for their release requests. 18. Defendants have also abruptly cancelled or adjourned bond hearings and delayed the issuance of bond decisions. Immigration judges have refused to consider the increased risks of detention when determining whether to set bond. Even if an individual is granted bond, their family members have faced \"virtually insurmountable challenges\" to posting the bond amount to secure their loved one's freedom during the pandemic , including temporary closures of the Newark and New York City bond offices and requirements to pay via certif ied check issued by a bank, which is difficult to obtain during state lockdowns. 29 Although ICE operates an online bond- payment system \u2014called 29 Matt Katz, ICE's \"Mind -Blowing\" Barriers to Posting Bond Keep Immigrants Locked Inside Coronavirus Hot Spots , Gothamist (Apr. 24, 2020), https://bit.ly/2YGJScR; ECF 2, Ex.

Defendants cannot justify continuing to subject Plaintiffs to extraordinary risk of illness , injury, and death , particularly in ligh t of readily available alternatives to physical confinement . 20. The danger posed by Plaintiffs' detention at EDC during the current outbreak of COVID - 19 is \"so grave that it violates contemporary standards of decency to expose anyone unwillingly to such a ris k\" and violates their constitutional right to safety in government custody. Helling v. McKinney , 509 U.S. 25, 36 (1993). In failing to create a system that mitigates risk by promptly and fairly process ing all individuals for release under appropriate conditions, Defendants violate the U.S. Constitution. 21. Unless this Court intervenes to order the release of the Plaintiffs, they will face dramatically increased chances of contracting COVID -19, becoming seriously ill or injured, and dying. This Court should grant Plaintiffs speedy relief, including an order directing Defendants to release Plaintiffs immediately and prohibiting Defendants from detaining or re -detaining individuals in EDC.

New Jersey is one of the hardest hit states with more than 141,560 cases reported and widespread community transmission.30 On April 4, 2020, New Jersey Health Commissioner Judith Persichilli issued a crisis alert, announcing that nine New Jersey hospitals were being forced to turn away patients due to lack of staff or beds. 31 Other area hospitals are similarly overwhelmed.32 37. All people share a risk of contracting and, upon contraction, transmitting the virus that causes COVID -19. Anyone who contracts the virus may experience life -threatening symptoms and death.33 38. Medical experts have been regularly reevaluating the risk facto rs for contracting and/or developing complications from COVID -19. Not all risk factors are known at this time. 39. Some people are at heightened risk of developing serious complications or dying if they contract COVID -19. The current list of risk factors inclu des advanced age, certain living situations, and certain pre -existing health conditions. 40. Some people are at heightened risk due to pre -existing medical conditions but are unaware of their risk, due to the lack of prior medical care, prior diagnosis, or ac cess to medical records. 34 Others may be aware of their medical condition, but unaware of their increased risk due to lack of access to news and rapidly changing science. 30 Coronavirus in New Jersey: Latest Map and Case Count , The N.Y.

The only known effective measures to reduce the risk of illness, injury or death from COVID- 19 are to prevent infect ion in the first place and to limit community spread. Social distancing or remaining physically separated from known or potentially infected individuals ; vigilant sanitation a nd hygiene, including repeated and thorough hand washing with soap and water ; and the proper use of masks are the only known effective measures for protecting people from COVID -19.42 50. Nationally, projections by the CDC indicate that over 200 million people in the United States could be infected with COVID -19 over the course of the epidemic without effective public health intervention and as many as 1.5 million will die.

Medical and correctional health experts agree that a COVID -19 outbreak is difficult to contain in jails and prisons, and will endanger the lives of the people who are confined or work within those settings.46 53. Medical and correctional health experts agree that a CO VID- 19 outbreak in a jail or prison will also strain the public health infrastructure for the surrounding area. Because jails and prisons do not employ sufficient medical personnel to address a pandemic and do not contain the specialized equipment needed t o treat COVID -19, people who become serious ly ill will need to be transported to a local hospital that serves the broader public for care. A n outbreak of COVID -19 not only strains the public health infrastructure within the jail, but also impacts the entir e community. 47 54. Soon after the World Health Organization declared COVID -19 a global pandemic, medical experts publicly warned ICE of the risk of serious illness, injury, and death if individuals were not released from civil immigration confinement. 55. By mid -March 2020, ove r 3,000 doctors submitted an open letter to ICE, urging the release of vulnerable immigrants. 48 56. On March 19, 2020, news broke of the first publicly confirmed ICE employee to test positive for COVID -19 in the nation: a medical staffer at EDC. 49 46 ECF 2, Ex. H, Keller Dec. \u00b6 49; Ex.

On March 19 , 2020, Dr. Scott Allen and Dr. Josiah Rich, doctors contracted to work with the Department of Homeland Security, sent a letter to U.S. Congress urging the release of all individuals who are not public safety risks from immigration detention in light of th e disease, describing it as a \"tinderbox scenario\" in light of the conditions in which people are detained and the inability of medical services in jails and prisons to respond adequately. 50 58. Noting these same concerns, on March 20, 2020, over forty advoc acy organizations sent a letter to Defendant Tsoukaris urging him to release all people in ICE custody in New Jersey and to suspend ICE enforcement operations. 51 59. On March 23, 2020, the CDC issued interim guidance to correctional facilities and detention centers , setting forth gui delines to help facilities lower the rate of infection . 52 The CDC, for example, discourages practices like transfers between prisons and j ails and cohorting individuals who may have been exposed to COVID -19 but have not tested positive. 60. ICE subsequently issued a series of protocols for its jails and prisons to adopt, some of which contradict the CDC guidelines. 53 ICE implemented cohorting a s a response to COVID- 19 exposure for individuals who have not tested positive .

In 2016, the Bureau of Prisons decided to phase out its contracts with private prison corporations like CoreCivic after a Justice Department study found that people in private prisons experienced a significantly higher rate of abuse than people in federall y-run facilities.61 The Homeland Security Advisory Council adopted a similar recommendation for the immigration detention system after its own study.62 The Trump Administration rescinded these decisions, permitting private prison corporations like CoreCivic to expand their operations . The vast majority of the people who have died in immigration custody since 2017 have died in facilities operated by private prison companies like CoreCivic.63 64. CoreCivic has historically sought to operate in secrecy. This includes attempts to sti fle dissent among those in confinement . For example, detained people at a CoreCivic -run detention center in Georgia went on a hunger strike in 2017 to protest their detention; CoreCivic retaliated by locking them in solitary confinement.64 59 Amanda Holpuch, Private prison companies served with lawsuits over using detainee labor , The Guardian (Nov. 25, 2018), https://bit.ly/3fOETgd. 60 Caleb Bauer, CoreCivic has history of complaints, violations , South Bend Tribune (Jan. 17, 2018), https://bit.ly/2Wp5Z60 (discussing complaints of overcrowding, medical neglect, and sexual assault); Grassroots Leadership, The Dirty Thirty: Nothing to Celebrate about 30 Years of Corrections Corporation of America , https://bit.ly/2WTP4H N (detailing decades of abuses); ECF 2, Ex.

With the COVID- 19 pandemic spreading rapidly in the immigration detention system , people held in ICE custody in CoreCivic facilities across the country began to report receiving inadequate medical attention, inedible or rationed food, and a lack of supplies for per sonal hygiene.65 66. With growing public scrutiny of detention conditions during the COVID -19 pandemic, CoreCivic has once again turned to stifling dissent through abusive and violen t tactics. At a Georgia detention center, CoreCivic ha s already used force twice against detained persons protesting for medical attention and adequate food during the pandemic.66 Afterward, the officers bragged about it on social media; in one post, an officer said he was in \"call of duty mode\" shooting ever yone in sight with pepper -ball ammunition, while another celebrated using pepper spray against a man in a wheelchair .67 In another CoreCivic -run detention center, when detained people protested being required to sign a contract to \"hold [CoreCivic] harmless\" in ord er to receive a protective face mask , they were threatened with pepper -spray.68 65 ECF 2, Ex.

Multiple medical staff at New Jersey jails have already died from COVID -19.72 71. To date, in EDC, eighteen people in confinement and two ICE personnel have tested positive fo r COVID- 19.73 On May 14, 2020, it was reported that one CoreCivic guard at EDC died after contracting COVID -19; he had worked at EDC as recently as April 20, 2020.74 ICE has not released the number of EDC staff who have tested positive for COVID- 19, since they work for the private contractor CoreCivic.75 Following a lawsuit, ICE acknowledge d that a number of non- ICE employees in privately contracted facilities have contracted COVID- 19, and some have died from the virus.76 72. People held at EDC are at heightened risk of contracting COVID -19, and suffering serious complications and death, than people free from confinement. EDC has failed to meet the basic safety, health care, sanitation, and hygiene needs of all of those whom they confine in several respects. 73. First, EDC has failed to suspend new admissions and enforce screening protocols that would mitigate the entry of COVID -19 into the facility. EDC continues to accept new individuals for confinement,77 and staff and vendors circulate in and out of the prison. It continues to transfer people in and out of the prison from other ICE facilities.

Instead, they screen individuals for symptoms , which inevitably permits asymptomatic individuals who have COVID- 19 to enter the prison .78 74. In practice, EDC considers individuals entering or within the prison symptomatic if they have a fever. Individuals who have other symptoms of COVID -19 are not treated as symptomatic if they do not have a fever. 75. According to Defendants, when a person in confinement is s ymptomati c, they are housed in isolation and tested, given a daily \"sick call\" and temperature check. Asymptomatic individuals will be permitted to enter the general population unless they have \"confirmed exposure\" to COVID -19.79 The general population stays in dormitory -style rooms and share a common kitchen and bathroom.80 These are not negative pr essure rooms, meaning that air circulates throughout the space and in and out of other portions of the facility. 76. Asymptomatic individuals with confirmed exposure are cohorted together but only tested for COVID- 19 if they subsequently start showing symptoms , if they are tested at all.81 Because an individual with COVID -19 may be able to transmit the disease for several days before symptoms appear ,82 these practices expose individuals without COVID -19 to asymptomatic individuals with COVID -19.83 Moreover, like the rest of the facility, upon 78 ECF 2, Ex.

Prison personnel who prepare and deliver food, commissary supplies, and escort people within the fac ility are not able to maintain social distancing during these interactions. Defendants have deprived Plaintiffs of any control over who comes into close contact with them.92 79. Even personal hygiene is often outside a person's control. Defendants control who receives sanitary and hygienic supplies, the nature of those supplies, and how often those supplies are replenished.

The lack of adequate hygiene supplies prevents individuals from frequently washing their hands with soap and keeping their own spaces clean .93 Because EDC has stopped its payment and cleaning assignments without a substitute protocol, detained individuals must clean common areas of th e prison on an ad hoc basis, often with inadequate supplies.94 EDC has also failed to provide Plaintiffs with adequate personal protective equipment.95 80. Third, EDC ha s affirmatively adopted some protocols that are likely to increase the chan ces that COVID- 19 will spread through the prison. For example, Defendants cohort individuals with suspected but unconfirmed cases together in one area,96 despite CDC guidelines discouraging this p ractice since it will likely cause those with the infection to spread it to those who were, prior to cohorting, not infected.97 Defendants continue to transfer individuals to and from other prisons, a practice also discouraged by the CDC.98 81. Fourth, EDC has failed to enforce protocols that would effectively treat those who are suspected or confirmed to have COVID -19.

From late March to mid -April Elizabeth Immigration Court, housed in the same building as EDC, closed or cancelled hearings numerous times without notice . Although the Elizabeth Immigration Court re -opened on April 13, 2020, scheduling of hearings has been erratic and unpredictable, and judges are often absent without notice. I ndividuals and attorneys appearing at the court continue to experience significant backlogs and delays in the adjudication of their pleadings. 112 97. Attorneys representing clients before the Elizabeth Immigration Court face numerous barrier s. Even w hen hearings proceed as scheduled , the detained indi vidual appear s via videoconferencing, while lawyers must appear in person or seek leave to appear telephonically. At no point are lawyers able to see their clients, even though lawyers for 112 ECF 2, Ex. F, Rodriguez Dec. \u00b6\u00b6 9 -14.

The poor quality of the audio connection also makes it difficult for attorneys appearing telephonically.113 98. Defendants have failed to provide detained individuals with information and records they need in order to seek release,114 all the while significantly restricting their access to attorneys or any form of legal assistance. As a result, detained individuals are unable to seek meaningful custody reviews before the Elizabeth Immigration Court or before ICE. 99. Defendants have elimi nated all in -person attorney visitation to EDC, and EDC does not permit an attorney to register for more than a single one -hour confidential phone call each day.115 The ability to c ommunicat e with legal counsel is critical not only for an individual's removal proceedings , but also any bond hearings or custody review requests to ICE . 100. Defendants have also eliminated all in -person visitations by nonprofit organizations that provide legal assistance through the Legal Orientation Program, a program funded by the Executive Office for Immigration Review to provide information to pro se individuals. As a result, many unrepresented individuals are unable to seek critical help for their cases, su ch as assistance with filling out forms or translating documents.116 101. Defendants have shut down a free hotline operated by First Friends, a nonprofit program that supports individuals who are confined in EDC and other immigration detention facilities in the region. First Friends operated the hotline for eight years prior to its shutdown in EDC in February 2020 , routinely providing detained individuals with their 113 ECF 2, Ex.

In the weeks prior to the shutdown, First Friends received app roximately 40 -50 calls from people confined in EDC each week.117 102. Defendants have also closed EDC's law library , beginning in late March, depriving detained individuals of access to legal research materials or to a printer. As a consequence, there is no way to print and complete forms for submission to the immigration court. Even though an individual may need to present physical evidence l ike identity documents, marriage and birth certificates, proof of employment, tax history, school records, letters of support, and medical record s, they cannot make copies of documents unless they hand the materials to a CoreCivic staff member. Moreover, individuals must also purchase stamps and mail their filings to the Elizabeth Immigration Court, even though they are in the same building.118 103. As a result o f such practices and policies, Defendants have failed to ensure a prompt and fair system for conducting constitutionally adequate custody reviews . NAMED PLAINTIFFS ' ALLEGATIONS 104.

Ms. Aganan describes conditions at EDC as \"unsanitary\" and \"horrendous.\"125 ICE and CoreCivic have \"done virtually nothing\" to protect her and the women with whom she is housed during the pandemic, denying them accurate information about the virus and permitting \" rumors, inaccurate information, and panic [to] spread through the facility. \" 126 Ms. Aganan has been particularly horrified by the \"dirty\" medical unit stocked with inadequate equipment , and staffed by uncaring and insensitive personnel. 127 Medical care is so de ficient, Ms. Aganan reports, that many detainees fear seeking treatment.128 Herself a sufferer of a rare hereditary condition called glucose- 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, Ms. Aganan has encountered indifference from CoreCivic staff, who have refused to accommodate the restricted diet she must maintain to remain healthy. 129 120 Id. \u00b6 4. 121 Id. \u00b6 5. 122 Id. 123 Id. \u00b6 6. 124 Id. 125 Id. \u00b6 8. 126 Id. \u00b6\u00b6 8, 13. 127 Id. \u00b6\u00b6 21 -26. 128 Id. \u00b6 26. 129 Id. \u00b6\u00b6 27 -28.

Ms. Aganan fears that she, and the women detained alongside her, will die while detained at EDC.130 Indeed, the stress of the pandemic combined with the isolation and monotony of confinement without visits or recreation has already exacted an intolerable psychological toll on her dorm -mates. 131 One was hospitalized recently after attempting suicide.132 For Ms. Aganan and the others, their \"mental and physical health is deteriorating ra pidly with each day that passes.\"133 Ms. Aganan longs not only to achieve her freedom but also to merely \"enjoy being treated with basic humanity once again.\"134 108. Plaintiff Albert Boampong is a 35 -year-old citizen of Ghana and father of two children.135 Mr. Boampong had to flee his home and his family, including his then - pregnant fianc\u00e9e, after facing threats and violent attacks.136 Mr. Boampong is seeking protection in the United States in the form of asylum and related relief.137 After Mr. Boampong was detained, his second daughter was born by C -section on May 10, 2020.138 During his fianc\u00e9e's operation, Mr. Boampong was terrified for her health , as well as that of his infant daughter.139 He remains heartbroken that he is not able to support his fianc\u00e9e and care for his children at this critical time .140 109.

Mr. Boampong is terrified to die from COVID -19 before having the opportunity to meet his infant daughter.146 In response to conditions at EDC during the pandemic, Mr. Boampong has initiated a hunger strike to challenge t he government's indifference toward his safety and that of other detained noncitizens.147 He explains the motivation behind his ongoing protest t his way: \"I am very frustrated, sad, and depressed by what I am experiencing in this facility. I still don't understand why the government is continuing to detain me and putting my life at risk, even though they know that COVID -19 is present in the facilit y and will continue to spread.\" 148 With every passing day, Mr. Boampong's fear of illness and death grows.149 141 Id. \u00b6\u00b6 6, 10 -11. 142 Id. \u00b6\u00b6 10 -12, 15. 143 Id. \u00b6 20. 144 See id. 145 Id. \u00b6\u00b6 18 -19. 146 Id. \u00b6 13. 147 Id. \u00b6\u00b6 16 -17. 148 Id. \u00b6 17. 149 See i d. \u00b6 13.

At EDC, Mr. Garc \u00eda Mendoza is surrounded constantly by dozens of other men, with social distancing a practical impossibility because they are separated by just a few feet while eating and sleeping.156 Necessities are often lacking, and Mr. Garc\u00ed a Mendoza and his dorm -mates sometimes have to wash their hands \"just with hot water because there is no soap.\"157 He describes the facility as \"filthy.\"158 An asthma sufferer, Mr. Garc\u00eda Mendoza has experienced chest pain and shortness of breath while detained, but the medical staff have refused him adequate treatment.159 Mr. Garc\u00ed a Mendoza notes with irony that EDC posted placards regarding the coronavirus that contain a link to the CDC 150 ECF 2, Ex.

Mr. Garc\u00ed a Mendoza is \"very worried about the virus and getting infected.\"161 He knows that men with whom he was previously detained have taken ill, tested positive, and been moved to isolation. 162 Compounding his anguish, Mr. Garc \u00eda Mendoza has been unable to defend himself in court because he lacks the assistance of an immigration lawyer and has no access to the law library or a printer.163 Since detainees no longer see a judge in person and cannot hand- deliver documents to the court, they must buy stamps and envelopes and send submissions through external, postal mail.164 These barr iers, combined with a lack of accessible information on court procedures, contributed to an immigration judge entering an order of removal against Mr. Garc\u00eda Mendoza last week at just his second hearing before the immigration court. 165 114. Plaintiff Bob Lupini Nsimba is a 28 -year-old man born in the Democratic Republic of the Congo who has been detained at EDC since August 2019.166 A lifelong activist, Mr. Nsimba founded an opposition political organization dedicated to denouncing fraudulent elections , police br utality, and government corruption in his country of origin .167 After Congolese police officers went to Mr. Nsimba's house in August 2019 seeking to arrest 160 Id. \u00b6 13. 161 Id. \u00b6 15. 162 Id. \u00b6 14. 163 Id. \u00b6\u00b6 22 -23, 26. 164 Id. \u00b6 27. 165 Id. \u00b6 25. 166 ECF 2, Ex.

All individuals civilly confined by Defendants in EDC are subject to th e same disregard for health and safety and are subject to the same policies of confinement and hygiene. 118. Ms. Aganan, Mr. Boampong, Mr. Garc\u00eda Mendoza, and Mr. Nsimba bring this action on behalf of themselves and all others who are similarly situated pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(2), and as a representative habeas class. See Jennings v. Rodriguez , 138 S. Ct. 830, 851 (2018) (recognizing that a (b)(2) habeas class of individuals in civil immigration detention may be certified if Rule 23's prerequisites are satisfied); U.S. Parole Comm'n v. Geraghty , 445 U.S. 388, 404 (1980) (holding that class representative could appeal denial of certificat ion of habeas and declaratory judgment claims); see also United States ex rel. Sero v.

Case 2:20-cv-05922 Document 1 Filed 05/15/20 Page 37 of 46 PageID: 3738 119. The named Plaintiffs seek to represent the following class: All individuals who , between commencement of this action and the entry of final judgment, are or have been held in civil immigration detention at Elizabeth Detention Center. 120. The proposed class satisf ies all of the requirements of Rule 23(a)\u2014numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy\u2014as well as those of Rule 23(b)(2) . 121. The proposed representative class is sufficiently numerous as to make joinder impracticable. Upon information and belief, there are over 140 people held in civil immigration confinement at EDC. 122. The proposed representative class presents common qu estions of law and fact, including (1) whether civil immigration confinement at EDC in the face of the COVID- 19 pandemic subjects class members to life -threatening infection and thus violates substantive due process ; (2) whether Defendants have failed to provide a meaningful custody review procedure in light of the pandemic, in violation of class members' procedural due process rights; (3) whether ICE's April 4, 2020 directive is contrary to constitutional right; and (4) whether Defendants have failed to comply with their own guidance and standards to mitigate the risks posed by COVID -19. 123. The named Plaintiffs' claims are typical of the representative class they seek to represent. Like all class members, Ms. Aganan, Mr. Boampong, Mr. Garc\u00eda Mendoza, and Mr. Nsimba are currently (1) civilly detained by ICE at EDC; (2) subject to the close confinement and lack of hygiene that characterize immigration detention at EDC; and are (3) subject to infection, illness, and death from COVID -19 were it to spread. 124. Plaintiffs are able to fairly and adequately protect the interests of the proposed representative class. Plaintiffs are represented by counsel from the Immigrant Rights Case 2:20-cv-05922 Document 1 Filed 05/15/20 Page 38 of 46 PageID: 3839 Clinic at the New York University School of Law, American Friends Service Committee, and Immigrant Defense Project, who have extensive experience litigating complex immigration -related cases in federal court, including lawsuits on behalf of noncitizens in immigration detention. 125. The proposed class satisfies Rule 23(b)(2) because Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class. Members of the proposed representative class all seek the same relief, and this relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole to ensure that all members of the proposed class are given consistent relief and to satisfy the health and safety standards at the core of their challenge. 126. Plaintiffs and members of the proposed class seek a writ of habeas corpus to remedy their unconstitutional detention in life -threatening conditions at EDC . CLAIMS FOR RELIEF COUNT I (Violation of Fifth Amendment Right to Substantive Due Process\u2014Unlawful Punishment; Unreasonable Risk to Health and Safety; Deliberate Indifference or Reckless Disregard ; State -Created Danger) 127. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in the preceding paragraphs as if set forth fully herein. 128. The Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees individuals in civil immigration confinement the right to be free from punis hment. The Government violates this guarantee when conditions of confinement lack a reasonable relationship to any legitimate governmental purpose, i.e., when a custodian's actions are excessive in relation to their purpose . 129. Defendants ' continued detention of Plaintiffs during the COVID -19 pandemic is excessive in relation to any legitimate governmental purpose. Less harsh measures are Case 2:20-cv-05922 Document 1 Filed 05/15/20 Page 39 of 46 PageID: 3940 available to satisfy any government al interest in continuing to detain Plaintiffs, including release on recognizance or under reasonable conditions. Under these circumstances, Defendants' detention of P laintiffs amount s to impermissible punishment. 130. The c onditions of confinement for individual s in immigration detention also violate the Fifth Amendment when the G overnment fails to safeguard the health and safety of those in custody. 131. Defendants have subjected Plaintiffs to conditions of confinement that create a substantial risk of contracting a serious case of COVID -19, for which there is no known vaccine or cure. Defendants know or should be aware of the fact that their continued detention of Plaintiffs render them especially vulnerable to severe illness or even death. Defendants are therefore k nowingly or recklessly subjecting Plaintiffs to an unreasonable risk of serious harm in violation of substantive due process. 132. The Fifth Amendment also protects individuals in civil immigration confinement from state- created danger. When the state creates or increases a danger posed to individuals, particularly where it deprives those individuals of the means to protect themselves , it violates the Fifth Amendment. 133. Despite having the authority to release Plaintiffs, Defendants have chosen to keep Plaintiffs in physical confinement and have adopted practices that create heightened risk of exposure to a deadly and debilitating disease, such as cohorting individuals without testing. It has deprived Plaintiffs of the means of protecting themselves through social distancing and protective equipment, in an environment with insufficient medical resources, and increased the likelihood that P laintiffs will suffer serious illness or death. Case 2:20-cv-05922 Document 1 Filed 05/15/20 Page 40 of 46 PageID: 4041 134. In addition, ICE has continued to book individuals into custody at EDC and to transfer individuals between detention facilities without notice or adequate protocols \u2014including social distancing and testing \u2014to safeguard their health during transport. These actions endanger Plaintiffs' health and increase the likelihood that they will suffer serious illness or death. 135. For these reasons, Defendants' ongoing civil immigration confinement of Plaintiffs violates the Fifth Amendment's guarantee of substantive due process. COUNT II (Violation of the Fifth Amendment Right to Procedural Due Process\u2014Denial of Constitutionally Adequate Custody Re view ) 136. Plaintiffs reallege and repeat each and every allegation contained in the preceding paragraphs as if set forth fully herein. 137. The Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees individuals in civil immigration confinement the right to adequate procedural protections to ensure that the government's asserted justification for the detention outweighs the individual's constitutionally protected interest in avoiding physical restraint. 138. Due process requires a consideration of the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on evaluating the individual's constitutionally protected interest and the government's justification for detention . 139. In the face of an outbreak of COVID -19 at EDC, all Plaintiffs have a significant liberty interest in securing release from unsafe conditions. In contrast, the government's interest in physical confinement is diminished . 140. The Due Process Clause thus requires all Plaintiffs to a prompt custody review that guarantees meaningful notice and opportunity to be heard before a neutral decisionmaker. Case 2:20-cv-05922 Document 1 Filed 05/15/20 Page 41 of 46 PageID: 4142 141. Defendants have failed to provide Plaintiffs with prompt and constitutionally adequate custody reviews. 142. Defendants have conducted, and concluded, custody reviews for a limited number of individuals in their custody under ICE's April 4, 2020 directive. The directive orders field offices to consider of a limited subset of individuals with high risk factors and prohibits consideration of any individual detained under 8 U.S .C. \u00a7\u00a7 1226(c) or 1231(a)(2). 143. Pursuant to the April 4, 2020 directive, Defendants have detained Plaintiffs at EDC without any consideration of flight risk or danger to the community, the risk Plaintiffs face upon continued detention, or the public health benefits of releasing individuals from EDC. 144. Defendants have also interfered with Plaintiffs' access to meaningful custody reviews by holding reviews without notice to individuals or an opportunity to be heard, delaying or ignoring requests for medical records, delaying or ignoring requests for confidential legal calls, closing courts or cancelling hearings, and taking other measures that deprive Plaintiffs of their ability to obtain evidence and support for th eir custody review re quests. 145. Weighed against the significant liberty interests at stake for Plaintiffs and the exponentially heightened threat posed by COVID -19, Defendants' failure to provide Plaintiffs with prompt and constitutionally adequate custody review with all attendant rights to counsel and courts violates the Fifth Amendment. 146. The Due Process Clause requires that Plaintiffs receive adequate procedural protections to assert their interest, including a neutral decisionmaker, notice and opportunity to be heard, and a requirement that the government bear the burden of justifying any continued Case 2:20-cv-05922 Document 1 Filed 05/15/20 Page 42 of 46 PageID: 4243 detention by clear and convincing evidence. As a consequence of Defendants' practices at EDC, Plaintiffs will continue to suffer a violation of their procedural due process rights absent custody reviews by this Court. COUNT I II (Continued Detention in Violation of the Accardi Doctrine and the Fifth Amendment) 147. Plaintiffs reallege and repeat each and every allegation contained in the preceding paragraphs as if set forth fully herein . 148. The CDC have issued guidance to all prisons and jails, specifying measures to mitigate the risks associated with COVID -19. 149. ICE has issued guidance to its contract jails, specifying measures to mitigate the risks associated with COVID -19, and specify ing that its contra ct jails are subject to the relevant Performance- Based Detention Standards previously set forth by ICE, which include standards for medical care and hygiene and requires facilities to follow CDC guidelines . 150. The Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution requ ires that agencies follow their own regulations, rules, and internal procedures w here individual rights are at stake . See United States ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy , 347 U.S. 260, 266, 268 (1954). Under the Accard i doctrine, agency action that violates its own rules must be declared null and void. 151. Defendants have failed to follow their own regulations, rules, and internal procedures designed to safeguard the health and wellbeing of individuals in their custody. Because these regulations, rules, and inte rnal procedures are designed with the right to life and liberty in mind, and because Plaintiffs have been exposed to a heightened risk of serious Case 2:20-cv-05922 Document 1 Filed 05/15/20 Page 43 of 46 PageID: 4344 illness or death as a result, Defendants' actions in continuing to detain Plaintiffs despite the agency's inab ility to safeguard their health violate the Accardi doctrine. PRAYER FOR RELIEF WHEREFORE, Petitioners respectfully requests that this Court: a. Assume jurisdiction over this matter; b. Certify Plaintiffs and all individuals who, between commencement of this action and the entry of final judgment, are or have been held in civil immigration detention at Elizabeth Detention Center ; c. Issue a Writ of Habeas Corpus ordering Defendants to release Plaintiffs and class members immediately on their own recognizance or under reasonable conditions of supervision; d. Declare that Defendants' detention of Plaintiffs and class members is unlawful in violation of the Fifth Amendment and the Accardi doctrine ; e. Order Defendants to implement protocols designed to ensure prompt custody review measures that comport with due process; f. Order Defendants to cease any new admissions of individuals into immigration confinement at EDC; g. Pending adjudication of this Petit ion, order Defe ndants to immediately release Plaintiffs and putative class members, or in the alternative, conduct bail hearings for Plaintiffs and putative class members on an expedited basis; h. Pending adjudication of this Petition, order Defendants to re frain from (1) unilaterally transferring Plaintiffs and p utative class members to another detention facility and (2) admitting new individuals into immigration confinement at EDC; Case 2:20-cv-05922 Document 1 Filed 05/15/20 Page 44 of 46 PageID: 4445 i. Award Petitioners their costs and reasonable attorneys' fees in this action as provided for by the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412, or other statutes; and j.
