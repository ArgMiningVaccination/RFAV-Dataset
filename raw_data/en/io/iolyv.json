For any COVID-19 vaccine developer ready to submit their samples to the network, please complete our [Sample Analysis Request Form](http://www.surveymonkey.com/r/8K2YWLC). ******* 2 October 2020, Oslo, Norway -The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) has today announced partnerships with five clinical sample testing laboratories to create a centralised global network to reliably assess and compare the immunological responses generated by COVID-19 vaccine candidates. Located across multiple regions globally, the laboratories initially selected for this vaccine-assessment network are: Nexelis (Canada) and Public Health England (PHE, UK), VisMederi Srl (Italy), Viroclinics-DDL (The Netherlands), icddr,b (formerly International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh), and Translational Health Sciences and Technological Institute (THSTI, India). The network will use the same testing reagents\u2014originating in the labs of Nexelis and PHE\u2014and follow common protocols to measure the immunogenicity of multiple COVID-19 vaccine candidates (both CEPI-funded and non-CEPI funded developers). This approach will ensure uniformity in assessment and informed identification of the most promising vaccine candidates. CEPI is actively negotiating with additional laboratories to participate in this network. Typically, the immunogenicity of potential candidate vaccines is assessed through individual laboratory analyses, aiming to determine whether biomarkers of immune response\u2014such as antibodies and T-cell responses\u2014are produced after clinical trial volunteers receive a dose(s) of a vaccine candidate. However, with [over 320 vaccine candidates](https://cepi.net/news_cepi/321-vaccine-candidates-against-covid-19-now-in-development/) against COVID-19 currently in development, there are likely to be numerous differences in data collection and evaluation methods. This includes potential variation in the range of correlates of immunity being measured by laboratories. Technical differences in how and where samples are collected, transported and stored can also occur, impacting the quality and usefulness of the data produced and making comparisons between measurements in individual laboratories difficult. In addition, with the wide range of COVID-19 vaccine approaches and technologies currently being deployed (e.g., recombinant viral vectors, live attenuated vaccines, recombinant proteins and nucleic acids), standard evaluation of the true potential of these vaccine formulations becomes very complex. Through centralising the analysis of samples obtained from trials of COVID-19 vaccine candidates, the new clinical-sample-testing network will minimise variation in results obtained, which could otherwise arise due to such technical differences when carrying out independent analysis. The samples from participating vaccine developers will instead be tested in the same group of laboratories using the same methods, therefore, removing much of the inter-laboratory variability and allowing for head-to-head comparisons of immune responses induced by multiple vaccine candidates. Through this new network, up to the limit of programme funding, eligible COVID-19 vaccine developers (both CEPI-funded and non-CEPI funded developers) can use the laboratories, without per sample charges, to analyse the immune response elicited by their COVID-19 vaccine candidates in preclinical, Phase I and Phase IIa studies. Data obtained on the immunogenicity of CEPI-funded vaccine candidates will be used to inform and advance CEPI's COVID-19 vaccine portfolio by providing quick and accurate evaluation of its candidate vaccines. By opening the sample testing network to other COVID-19 vaccine programmes, CEPI also aims to ensure that all eligible developers\u2014regardless of their size\u2014can benefit from this analysis. Certain commitments may be required for eligibility, such as making timely publication of sample testing results and sharing data that will be produced on the immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccine candidates to facilitate future regulatory decisions. The number of samples available for testing per developer may be limited depending on response. Chief Executive Officer, CEPI Executive Director of Vaccine Research and Development, CEPI The establishment of this network is the result of a recent global Call for Proposals, issued by CEPI in early May, to identify and select potential partners to form a centralised group to directly assess multiple COVID-19 vaccine candidates. Laboratories were selected based on the capacity to perform such studies, the ability to work internationally to harmonise protocols and data, and their record of receiving and handling samples from multiple geographical locations, among other criteria. CEPI has also opened a [new Call for Proposals](https://cepi.net/get_involved/cfps/) to extend the assessment to include clinical samples from late-stage clinical trials (Phase III and beyond). The Call is open to any laboratory worldwide until 4 October 2020. Nexelis CEO Head of Vaccine Research Groups at PHE Porton Down Founder and CSO of VisMederi Srl DVM CEO Viroclinics-DDL Executive Director at icddr,b Secretary, Department of Biotechnology (DBT) and Chairperson, Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC) Executive Director, Translational Health Science and Technology Institute (THSTI) The clinical sample testing laboratories selected for this collaborative vaccine network are: Nexelis (Canada) and Public Health England (PHE; UK), VisMederi Srl (Italy), Viroclinics-DDL (The Netherlands), icddr,b (formerly International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research Bangladesh), and Translational Health Sciences and Technological Institute (THSTI, India). CEPI is actively negotiating with additional laboratories to participate in this network. CEPI has approved costs of up to US $16million for this network. All COVID-19 vaccine developers can use this network for free to assess immunogenicity of their vaccine candidate against a common protocol, using clinical samples from preclinical, Phase I and Phase IIa trials. Samples shipment cost and documentation related to the shipment is the vaccine developer's responsibility. All the research laboratories now part of the centralised network have track records of being able to run specific tests (ELISA/neutralisation assay/ELISPOT) for vaccine trials for other emerging infectious diseases. The most advanced validated COVID-19 test (assay) was selected and, alongside associated training, the assay protocol was provided to all laboratories involved in the network to perform the same sample analysis. The ELISAs and pseudoneutralisation assay will be provided by Nexelis, with PHE delivering the wild-type neutralisation. Nexelis and PHE will also supply critical reagents (antigens, pseudoparticles and wild-type virus) along with standards and controls to ensure assay combinability across the network. To ensure ongoing accurate assessment, laboratories will be required to assess a standard sample set every six months. CEPI-funded COVID-19 vaccine developers are encouraged but are not obliged to use the centralised lab network. Results produced by the centralised lab network will be sent back to the COVID-19 vaccine developer - neither CEPI nor the laboratory who assessed the preclinical or clinical samples will own the data. CEPI has also opened a [new Call for Proposals](https://cepi.net/get_involved/cfps/) to extend the assessment to include clinical samples from late-stage clinical trials (Phase III and beyond). The Call is open to any laboratory worldwide until 4 October, 2020. Eligibility requirements and application details are available [on the CEPI website](https://cepi.net/get_involved/cfps/). In order to monitor interest and adjust the testing capacity, we are requesting that all COVID-19 vaccine developers interested in using CEPI's centralised laboratory network complete this [short survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/KT8HHX2). For any COVID-19 vaccine developer ready to submit their samples to the network, please complete our [Sample Analysis Request Form](http://www.surveymonkey.com/r/8K2YWLC). Additionally, CEPI is developing a worldwide network of drug product manufacturers that may be available for COVAX supported COVID-19 vaccine manufacture. This network is planned to be geographically diverse with flexible support for formulation, fill and finish of several industry standard modalities of drug product manufacturing.

CEPI is an innovative partnership between public, private, philanthropic, and civil organisations, launched at Davos in 2017, to develop vaccines to stop future epidemics. CEPI has moved with great urgency and in coordination with WHO in response to the emergence of COVID-19. CEPI has initiated nine partnerships to develop vaccines against the novel coronavirus. The programmes are leveraging rapid response platforms already supported by CEPI as well as new partnerships. Before the emergence of COVID-19, CEPI's priority diseases included Ebola virus, Lassa virus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus, Nipah virus, Rift Valley Fever and Chikungunya virus. CEPI also invested in platform technologies that can be used for rapid vaccine and immunoprophylactic development against unknown pathogens (Disease X). Follow our [news page ](https://cepi.net/news/)for the latest updates. Built on the principles of speed, scale and equitable access, CEPI is currently supporting a diverse COVID-19 vaccine portfolio\u2014the world's largest\u2014of nine COVID-19 vaccine candidates. CEPI is also actively looking to expand its investments in further vaccine candidates to increase the chances of finding a successful vaccine and, alongside Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance and the World Health Organization (WHO) as part of the COVAX pillar of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, meet its goal to develop, manufacture and equitably deliver up to 2 billion doses of vaccine by the end of 2021. To date, CEPI has raised up to US $1.3 billion of the $2.1 billion needed to support our COVID-19 vaccine programmes, including donations from sovereign governments, philanthropic institutions, private sector companies and public fundraising through the UN Solidarity Response Fund. Sovereign government investment includes funding from Canada and the UK; the locations for laboratories now part of the centralised network (Nexelis, Canada and Public Health England, UK). US $800m is still urgently required to support CEPI's COVID-19 vaccine R&D efforts. Prior to the emergence of COVID-19, Canada and the UK had provided CEPI with vital funds to support our priority disease programmes. In addition, the Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science & Technology, Government of India is implementing the Ind-CEPI mission which aims to strengthen the development of vaccines for the diseases of epidemic potential in India as well as build coordinated preparedness in the Indian public health system and vaccine industry to address existing and emergent infectious threats in India.
