Provisions where employees earn time of f 21 and the employees can use the days for any purpose, are paid time of f unless separate arrangements are made for sick leave. Paid time of f, once earned or awarded, is considered wages upon separation from employment. If the paid time of f is available for use at the time of separation from employment, the employer must pay the employee for that time at the regular rate of pay earned by the employee prior to separation. No employment contract or policy may provide for forfeiture of earned paid time of f upon separation. An employment contract or policy may require an employee to take vacation by a certain date or lose the vacation (use it or lose it), provided that the employee is given a reasonable opportunity to take the vacation. The employer must demonstrate that the employee had notice of such contract or policy provision. 13. The reasonable value not exceeding the employer ' s actual cost of board, lodging, and other facilities customarily furnished by the employer for the employee' s benet may be treated as part of the wages, up to a maximum of eighteen dollars per day , if agreed to by a written agreement and if the employee' s acceptance of facilities is in fact voluntary . 14. The common law test provided in subdivisions a and b of subsection 5 of section 27-02-14-01 will be used to determine whether or not an individual may be considered an employee or an independent contractor . 15.

An earned bonus is compensable when an employee performs the requirements set forth in a contract or an agreement between the parties. Earned commission: A commission is a fee or percentage given for compensation to an individual for completion of a sale, service, or transaction. Upon separation from employment, the past practices, policies, and entire employment relationship will be used to determine if the commission is earned and compensable. 16.

Formulas for determining regular rate and overtime. 1. Determining overtime from an hourly rate: Hourly rate x 1.5 = Overtime hourly rate of pay Overtime hourly rate of pay x Number of hours worked in excess of 40 = Amount of overtime due 2. Determining hourly rate and overtime from monthly salary: Monthly salary x 12 = W eekly salary 52 W eekly salary = Rate per hour T otal hours worked during that week T o calculate overtime from this: Rate per hour x 1/2 x Number of hours worked in excess of 40 = Amount of overtime due 3. Determining hourly rate and overtime for retail employees paid principally from commissions: T otal compensation for one week T otal hours worked for that same week = Regular rate of pay 4. W eighted average method of overtime: When an employee performs two jobs for the same employer , with each job having a dif ferent rate of pay , the method of computing overtime is as follows: Job 1: Rate of pay x Number of hours = Compensation Job 2: Rate of pay x Number of hours = Compensation T otal hours T otal compensation T otal compensation = A verage per hour T otal hours 23 A verage per hour = Rate of overtime 2 The rate of overtime multiplied by the number of overtime hours (hours in excess of 40) is the total overtime due. 5 .

Four classes (generations) of seed shall be recognized in seed certication: breeder , foundation, registered, and certied. a. Breeder seed is directly controlled by the originating plant breeder , sponsoring institution or rm, which supplies the source for the initial and recurring increase of foundation seed. 99 b. Foundation seed is the progeny of breeder or foundation seed produced under control of the originator or sponsoring plant breeding institution, or person, or designee thereof. As applied to certied seed, foundation seed is a class of certied seed produced under procedures established by the certifying agency for the purpose of maintaining genetic purity and identity . c. Registered seed is the progeny of foundation or other approved seed stocks that is so handled as to maintain satisfactory genetic identity and purity and that has been approved and certied by the certifying agency . This class of seed shall be of a quality suitable for the production of certied seed. d. Certied seed is the progeny of foundation, registered, or other approved seed stocks that is so handled as to maintain satisfactory genetic identity and purity and that has been approved by the state seed department. 2. The number of generations t h r o u g h which a variety may be multiplied shall be limited to that specied by the originating breeder or owner of a variety , but shall not exceed two generations beyond foundation seed. The following exceptions to the limitation of generations are allowed with permission from the variety owner and authorization from the state seed department: a. Unlimited recertication of the certied class may be permitted for crop varieties when foundation seed is not being maintained. b. The production of an additional generation of the certied class may be permitted on a one-year basis when: (1) A n e m e r g e n c y i s d e c l a r e d p r i o r t o t h e p l a n t i n g s e a s o n b y t h e c e r t i f y i n g a g e n c y s t a t i n g t h a t f o u n d a t i o n F o u n d a t i o n and registered seed supplies are not adequate to plant the needed certied acreage of the variety; and (2) The additional generation of certied seed produced to meet the emergency is declared ineligible for recertication. 3. Seed that fails to meet the certication standards for reasons other than those af fecting genetic purity may be certied i n e m e r g e n c y s i t u a t i o n s and will be labeled w i t h a a s \"substandard g r a d e \" l a b e l .

The seed department shall be supplied with satisfactory evidence of the source and class of seed used to plant each crop considered for certication. 2. Eligible seed stocks include breeder ' s, foundation, registered or , in special cases, approved lots of the certied class. Eligible seed obtained from another person must be accompanied by the of cial tag or bulk certicate from an approved certifying agency , which will be the documentation of acceptance required for eld inspection. 3. Certied seed growers may plant seed from their own elds if the eld passed inspection and if the class of seed is eligible to be certied. The grower must provide suf cient evidence to the department to verify eligibility . 4. Certied seed growers may o n l y plant seed from their own e l d s e l d that failed eld inspection previously o n l y if the eld did not fail due to genetic purity , and the grower is the applicant for eld inspection. If the eld fails inspection a second time for any reason, that seed shall no longer be eligible for the production of certied. 5. Contract growers may not replant any of the seed produced unless nal certication has been completed. 6. Growers should check with the state seed department regarding approved lots of the certied class eligible for recertication.

No eld or part of a eld will be accepted unless eld boundaries are clearly dened and properly isolated according to the specic crop standards. Isolation distances may be extended at the request of the seed commissioner o r t h e c o m m i s s i o n e r ' s a g e n t s for reasons including the production of transgenic crops or other kinds in proximity to elds being grown for the purpose of seed certication. When it is necessary to remove a strip to obtain proper isolation, the part of the strip to be removed must be cut into the eld to be inspected. If two classes of the same variety are planted adjacent to one another in the same eld, and eld inspection has been applied for both, isolation may be accomplished by placing a ag at each end of the eld ten feet [3.05 meters] into the higher class of seed, prior to inspection. The ags must be plainly visible at 101 the time of inspection. The grower may harvest that isolated ten-foot [3.05-meter] section of crop with the lower class of seed.

Applications for eld inspection, accompanied by the correct fees, payment of past-due accounts, and proof of seed eligibility , must be received at the state seed department of ce in Fargo not later than June fteenth. The penalty fee will apply after that date. Applications for grass seed must be received by May rst to avoid late penalty . Applications for millet and buckwheat w i l l m u s t be a c c e p t e d u n t i l r e c e i v e d b y July fteenth w i t h o u t t o a v o i d late penalty . Applications for soybeans requiring only a single inspection (preharvest) w i l l m u s t be a c c e p t e d u n t i l r e c e i v e d b y August rst w i t h o u t t o a v o i d late penalty . In case of an emergency or unusual circumstances due to weather or crop conditions, the deadline may be extended at the discretion of the seed commissioner . In such an event, late application penalties may be waived. 2. Information required on application. The application shall be completed by the applicant and returned to the seed department. All questions must be answered completely and correctly . The location of the farm and eld, including the legal description, shall be given clearly so that the inspector will be able to nd the farm and eld readily without waste of time and extra travel. Farm service agency eld maps must be provided by the applicant. If the seed is the grower ' s own seed, suf cient evidence must be provided to the department to verify eligibility . If the seed is purchased, an of cial certied seed tag or bulk certicates must accompany the application. 3. Roguing and spraying elds. Roguing is essential to maintain the purity of varieties and high standards of certied seed. Roguing elds prior to inspection is recommended to remove undesirable plants from elds. Plants that should be removed include of f-type plants, other crop plants, prohibited and restricted noxious weeds, and other impurities which may be growing in the eld. Roguing is usually done by pulling of f-types or other crop plants or weeds and removing them from the eld. In the case of small grain, roguing should be done after heading as foreign plants are seen most easily at this time. In hybrid seed production, fertile of f-types and undesirable plants should be removed before pollen is shed. Sterile of f-types may be removed any time prior to the nal inspection. 102 Whenever practical and advisable, seed elds should be sprayed with pesticides according to the manufacturer ' s label to control pests. Growers must follow posting requirements as specied by state and federal agencies responsible for the regulation and use of pesticides. 4. W eeds and diseases. a. Prohibited noxious weeds under North Dakota seed laws and rules are leafy spurge, eld bindweed (creeping jenny), Canada thistle, cress (perennial peppergrass), absinth wormwood, h e m p h a v i n g m o r e t h a n t h r e e - t e n t h s o f o n e p e r c e n t t e t r a h y d r o c a n n a b i n o l , musk thistle, spotted knapweed, and yellow starthistle. b. Restricted noxious weeds under North Dakota seed laws and rules are dodder species, hedge bindweed (wild morning glory), wild oats, and quackgrass. c. A eld may be rejected if it is the eld inspector ' s opinion that the amount and kind of weeds present make it dif cult to conduct the inspection, or the eld condition is such that the quality of the cleaned seed may be questionable. d. Objectionable weed seeds are restricted noxious weeds under North Dakota seed laws and rules and may include some common weeds which cause a specic problem in the conditioning of some individual crops. e. Diseases not governed by specic crop standards may be cause for rejection if it is the eld inspector ' s opinion that the quality of the cleaned seed may be af fected or if results of tests made on the seed indicate a disease condition which will af fect the crop produced from such seed. 5. Cancellation of eld inspection. An application may be canceled by the applicant before the eld inspection is completed. The application fee minus an administrative fee will be refunded to the applicant. The request for cancellation, however , must reach the state seed department before the inspector arrives in the general locality of the eld or before inspection has occurred. Refunds will not be made after the eld is inspected or because the eld has been rejected. 6. Appeal. Reinspection of rejected elds may be considered, provided the application for appeal allows a reasonable amount of time for reinspection prior to harvest. A fee for reinspection may be assessed. 7. The variety name stated on the application will be standard for inspection when entering the eld. Absent compelling visual evidence 103 to the contrary , the variety or selection declared by the g r o w e r a p p l i c a n t will be presumed correct if the documentation provided is valid. 8 .

Bulk seed lots do not have a maximum size limit except bin capacity . Each bin is considered a separate seed lot. For all crops, one sample for each lot is required. The entire lot must be certied at the time nal certication is completed. b. The lot number shall be designated by the labeler . The lot number of the seed planted may not be used as the new lot number for the seed being certied during the current crop year . 5 . 6 . Commingling (mixing) of inspected seed elds. Seed of the same kind and variety from dif ferent elds that pass eld inspection may be commingled if the seed is of the same class and general quality . If seed of dif ferent classes is commingled, the seed becomes eligible for the lowest class only . 6 . 7 . Commingling carryover certied seed from certied lots may be commingled if the seed is of the same variety , class, and general quality . If seed of dif ferent classes is commingled, the seed becomes eligible for the lowest class only . A new germination test is required for labeling. Germination tests should be done on each lot prior to commingling to ensure none of the lots have gone out of condition. 7 . C o n d i t i o n i n g . a .

General requirements and responsibilities. 1. Participation and responsibility . a. Participation in this seed potato program is voluntary and may be withdrawn prior to the rst inspection. b. Responsibilities. (1) Seed department responsibilities. The inspections, approvals, certication, and production of these rules and regulations will be done by the state seed department. (2) Applicants' responsibilities. The farming, sanitation practices, storing, and packing will be the grower ' s responsibility . It is the responsibility of the applicant to maintain genetic purity and identity at all stages of certication, including planting, harvesting, storing, and handling. Evidence that any lot of seed has not been protected from contamination that might af fect genetic purity or is not properly identied shall be cause for possible rejection of certication. 2. General requirements. a. Potatoes to be eligible for the program shall have been in a certication program and winter tested for eligibility . b. Fields will pass two or more inspections given by visual examination of a representative sample of the plants which method and size of sample will be determined by the state seed department. c. Fields passing inspection will be stored in a seed warehouse and sorted to grade at shipping time. d. Responsibility for the quality of work done in sorting the potatoes falls upon the grower or a thoroughly qualied agent authorized by the grower . e. Requirements for certication are not complete on any lot of eligible potatoes until properly t a g g e d l a b e l e d as described in this chapter and an of cial seed grade inspection certicate has been issued.

The o f c i a l t a g s o r b u l k c e r t i c a t e s l a b e l s will be issued t o t h e p u r c h a s e r only on order or authorization from the grower , who must provide to the purchaser a proper and accurate label for each container or load of seed at the time of delivery . These t a g s o r b u l k c e r t i c a t e s l a b e l s are to accompany the potatoes at shipment. Labels must not be applied to stock other than that indicated on the tags or bulk certicates. Bulk shipments, by truck or railcar , when thoroughly disinfected, may be considered the container . E x c e s s l a b e l s m u s t b e r e t u r n e d t o t h e s e e d d e p a r t m e n t . g. Resorting or regrading. If a lot of potatoes fails to meet certied seed grade requirement upon inspection, they are to be reconditioned to meet the requirement or the of cial t a g s l a b e l s must be removed. h. Reconditioning while in transit. In the case of any circumstance making it essential to recondition seed in transit, permission must be obtained from the state seed department. i. Latent virus testing. Serological testing for latent viruses shall be voluntary and a requirement for only virus-tested seed. V irus-tested seed meeting established tolerances may be indicated on the t a g l a b e l . j. Upon the discretion of the state seed department, potato seed lots originating from out of state may be subjected to a laboratory test, by a seed department-approved laboratory , for the detection of seedborne pathogens. Eligibility for recertication of any seed lot so tested must be based on that laboratory test. Additional documentation, including health certicates or summer or winter , or both, eld readings, may be required by the seed department prior to acceptance for recertication in this state. k. Failure to comply with any of the requirements of this chapter may be cause for rejection or cancellation of the lot or the certication of any seed as seed potatoes. 3. No person may disclaim responsibility of the vendor of the seed for the data or information on the label required by law and any such disclaimer of vendor ' s express or implied warranty is invalid. 4. V iolations. The state law specically states the use of the term \"certied\" or the term \"registered\" or any term or terms conveying a meaning 142 substantially equivalent to the meaning of any said terms, either orally or in writing, printing, marking, or otherwise in reference to or in connection with or in advertising or characterizing or labeling seed potatoes or the containers thereof is prohibited, unless such potatoes shall have been duly inspected and certied pursuant to the provisions of the law . Any violation of this law and any person on conviction thereof, shall be ned not more than one hundred dollars and cost for rst of fense and not more than ve hundred dollars and costs of prosecution for subsequent of fenses.

Each seed potato eld will be visually inspected based on sample inspection. The method of inspection and sample size will be at the discretion of the state seed department but a minimum of one hundred plants per acre [.40 hectare] will be inspected. For varieties that do not express readily visible symptoms of a disease, laboratory testing may be done for the pathogen. 2. The eld tolerance established will be based on visible symptoms in the samples inspected. Diseases which cannot be observed visually may be present.

It does not mean that the seed is absolutely free of disease or disease-causing agents, but that none was found during inspection. V arieties that do not express visible disease symptoms. Potato varieties that do not express visible disease symptoms of a specic pathogen may be subjected to a laboratory test to determine the levels of the pathogen in a seed lot. This testing may occur during the growing season or during the winter test, or both, and may af fect eligibility of the seed lot. Ring rot. Seed elds will be subject to a third (nal) eld inspection focused primarily on inspection for symptoms related to ring rot. If the eld has not received a third inspection, the grower will be required to submit a four hundred tuber sample (minimum) per eld for laboratory testing. Blackleg. Since the blackleg disease may be latent, the inspector will record only the percentage observed during the rst and second inspection, and no tolerance will be established. However , any excessive amount can be cause for rejection. Blackleg observations shall be based upon sample plants exhibiting the characteristic black, inky , soft, slimy , decomposed tissue of the stem. Wilt. Only the percentage noted will be recorded on the rst and second inspection, and may include other factors such as maturity , drought, or alkali problems but any excessive amount may be cause for rejection. There will be zero tolerance for potato wart, corky ring spot, gangrene, golden nematode, root knot nematode, tuber moths, or other such injurious pests that have never been found and conrmed in North Dakota seed potato elds. T olerances for potato virus x tested seed. All of the above tolerances will apply , including a requirement that bacterial ring rot must not have been found on the farm during the season. Seed lots with no more than two percent potato virus x infection may be identied as virus x tested on certication t a g s l a b e l s . 3. Field conditions. a. Insect control must be maintained early and until the vines are killed or matured. Fields suf fering excessive insect injury may be disqualied for certication. A grower will notify the inspector of the date of spraying and spray material applied. 144 b. V ine killing. If a eld has not received nal inspection, the grower must obtain approval from the inspector before killing the vines. Furthermore, if the inspector deems it appropriate, a laboratory test may be required or strips of unkilled vines must be left in the seed elds to facilitate nal inspections, or both. When strips are left for inspection, the rst twelve rows (if a six-row planter was used, eight rows if a four-row planter was used) must not be vine-killed. It will be the responsibility of the seed producer to identify where seed planting began. Approximately ten percent of the seed eld acreage must be left in strips. c. Any condition such as excess weeds, hail injury , foreign plants, chemical damage, soil conditions, or insect damage that interferes with proper inspection may disqualify the seed for certication. d. Roguing is permitted and recommended in many cases but must be done before the inspector arrives in the eld. e. Presence of disease or conditions not mentioned heretofore which may impair seed quality shall constitute cause for rejection or additional testing before nal certication. Stocks which show an excessive percentage of total serious virus in of cial postharvest tests shall be considered ineligible for certication t a g s . 4. Appeal. Inspection of rejected elds will be considered, provided application is made within three days after rejection, the eld is in good condition for inspection, and no additional roguing is done prior to reinspection. 5. Bacterial ring rot control. a. All seed produced by a farming operation in which bacterial ring rot has been found will be ineligible for recertication the following year . b. If the farming operation is found to be infected, all equipment and storages must be cleaned and disinfected. c. A farming operation found to be infected on three consecutive years shall be required to purchase all new seed, clean, and disinfect the operation under the supervision of the state seed department before entering any seed for certication. 6. The variety name stated on the application will be the standard for inspection when entering the eld. Absent compelling visual evidence to the contrary , the variety or selection declared by the grower will be presumed correct if the documentation provided is valid and the variety description characteristics meet the requirements of the chapter . 145 7. Inspections, tests, certications, and other acts are not intended to induce reliance on the seed department' s inspections, certications, or any other action or inaction for any purpose relating to quantity or quality of the seed or crop produced, tness for purpose, merchantability , absence of disease, or variety or selection identication. Certication means only that the potatoes were randomly inspected, and at the time of the inspection the eld or seed lot met the rules of the department. History: Ef fective December 1, 1981; amended ef September 1, 1997; July 16, 2001; September 1, 2002; January 2, 2006; July 1, 2007; July 1, 2010 ; O c t o b e r 1 , 2 0 1 2 1. All foundation and basic seed potato elds must be randomly sampled and tested if the grower intends to plant the same seed lot or sell to growers who intend to enter the lot for certication the following year . Only seed lots with three-tenths of one percent total serious virus or less during eld inspections are eligible for postharvest testing. 2. The results will be based on visible inspection of the plants for virus or viruslike symptoms from the sample the grower submitted. However , laboratory testing may be used on varieties that have slight or latent symptoms. 3. Other factors such as vigor , other diseases, and any factor that might impair seed quality will be considered in the postharvest testing program. 4. Information concerning sample size and time to submit samples will be available from the state seed department. 5. Lots failing the postharvest test will be ineligible for planting in the certication program. 6. In the event of frost or other serious malfunctions of the postharvest grow-out test, eligibility of a seed lot will be based on the current eld readings or a laboratory test at the discretion of the state seed department. 146 7. Seed lots showing excessive amounts of virus in the postharvest test may be disqualied for t a g s o r nal certication. The level at which to disqualify the lot will be established by the seed commissioner .

A storage to be eligible must have been cleaned and disinfected prior to harvest. Storages not previously used for certied seed must be inspected by the state seed department. 2. Seed potatoes to be eligible for nal certication t a g s must be stored in a warehouse containing only seed potatoes which have been eld-inspected. Such warehouses may contain eld-inspected stocks rejected for seed certication for causes other than such diseases as ring rot. 3. Equipment for handling, sorting, or grading can be used only on certied stock, but also must be cleaned and disinfected. 4. Containers. a. Graded stocks must be placed in new sacks o r i n , clean crates , t o t e s , or bulk containers which are t a g g e d o r m a r k e d l a b e l e d in an approved manner to indicate the lot contains certied seed potatoes. b. Brands or markings must feature \"North Dakota\" as the production area. c. No used bags may be brought into the farming operation. d. It is highly recommended that all containers be disinfected for the grower ' s own protection. 5. Out-of-state storage. Growers, upon special application, may be permitted nal certication on eligible stocks in approved nearby storages outside the state. 6. Bin inspection. Certied storages may be checked by an authorized inspector during the storage season. 7. Y ield and storage reports. Before t a g s l a b e l s will be issued for a lot of potatoes, a report will be given to the state seed department stating yield of each eld entered for certication and the location of the storages. 147 8. T ransfers of seed potatoes to other parties. A lot of seed potatoes eligible for nal certication may be transferred to another party along with t a g s l a b e l s provided authorization is given by the state seed department and the grower . 9. Each bin containing certied seed potatoes must be plainly labeled for certication with the grower ' s name and address, hundredweight [45.36 kilograms] or bushels [35.24 liters], variety , and eld identication. 10. All basic and foundation seed lots and other seed lots intended for recertication must be stored in identiable, clearly separated bins. Bins containing two or more seed lots of a variety without a divider or some other method of separation will be downgraded to the appropriate generation or disease tolerance level.

A prescriber or a dispenser must secure prior authorization from the department or its designee as a condition of payment for those drugs subject to prior authorization. 3. A prescriber or a dispenser must provide to the department or its designee in the format required by the department the data necessary for the department or its designee to make a decision regarding prior authorization. The department shall deny a claim for coverage of a drug requiring prior authorization if the prescription was dispensed prior to authorization or if the required information regarding the prior authorization is not provided by the prescriber or the dispenser . 4. A prescriber or dispenser must submit a request for prior authorization to the department or its designee by telephone, facsimile, electronic mail, or in any other format designated by the department. The department or its designee must respond to a prior authorization request within twenty-four hours of receipt of a complete request that contains all of the data necessary for the department to make a determination. 5. Emergency supply . a. If a recipient needs a drug before a prescriber or dispenser can secure prior authorization from the department, the department shall provide coverage of the lesser of a ve-day supply of a drug or the amount prescribed if it is not feasible to dispense a ve-day supply because the drug is packaged in such a way that it is not intended to be further divided. 198 b. The department will not provide further coverage of the drug beyond the ve-day supply unless the prescriber or dispenser rst secures prior authorization from the department. 6. The department must authorize the provision of a drug subject to prior authorization if: a. Other drugs not requiring prior authorization have not been ef fective or with reasonable certainty are not expected to be ef fective in treating the recipient' s condition; b. Other drugs not requiring prior authorization cause or are reasonably expected to cause adverse or harmful reactions to the health of the recipient; or c. The drug is prescribed for a medically accepted use supported by a compendium or by approved product labeling unless there is a therapeutically equivalent drug that is available without prior authorization. 7. If a recipient is receiving coverage of a drug that is later subject to prior authorization requirements, the department shall continue to provide coverage of that drug until the prescriber must reevaluate the recipient. The department s h a l l d e v e l o p w i l l p r o v i d e a form by which a prescriber may inform the department of a drug that a recipient must continue to receive beyond the prescription reevaluation period regardless of whether such drug requires prior authorization. The form shall contain the following information: a. The requested drug and its indication; b. An explanation as to why the drug is medically necessary; and c. The signature of the prescriber conrming that the prescriber has considered generic or other alternatives and has determined that continuing current therapy is in the best interest for successful medical management of the recipient. 8.
