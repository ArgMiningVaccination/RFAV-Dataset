It's been a few years since we last printed and mailed a catalog for your perusal, so we guessed it is about time to bring one out again. (Kindly let us know if you'd like to receive extra copies to give away to friends or to display at your school or your place of business.) What follows are new and soon-to-come titles and a sampling of the many books we publish and distribute, so be sure to visit our website for complete listings, including even more new titles set to be released before the end of the year. Books are doorways\u2014opening the right one at the right time can help us change our perception of the world for the better, can move us (unexpectedly), can help us find something we were looking for or better realize something we actually already knew, that was on the tip of our tongue somehow, but needed the push of another's articulation to see it more clearly, in a different context, to hear the familiar in a different voice than our own. This is just one of the miraculous ways that human beings help one another\u2014by finding my voice, I can also help you to find yours. This is the allure of all forms of literature and human expression and the reason books (I speak of their essence, what goes into their creation, the outer forms change with time), which only humans can create and comprehend, will endure. With warm wishes for all you do and create,Psychotronics and a biodynamic garden Geor Ge Kuepper Dowsing and radionics are two practices for interpreting and interacting with the natural world. They nurture the processes of gardening, farming, and landscaping through communicating with the subtle levels of reality. Nature spirits and other forms of intelligence in nature play major roles. They can be readily contacted and nourished when psychotronic methods are combined with the traditional practices of a biodynamic approach. George Kuepper describes and discusses numerous procedures that he has evolved from decades of working with agricultural radionics and recent discoveries from research in his biodynamic garden. This guidebook to growing better food is well referenced with numerous illustrations, photographs, tables, and examples. Gardeners and farmers who want to improve their plants and harvests using sustainable methods will find practical help and a feast for thought here. G EorGE KuEPP Er has m ore than 4 decades of experience in sustainable and organic farming and gardening, and has practiced radionics for well over 3 decades. he is th e author of books on radionics as well as many articles on sustainable agriculture and small-scale farming.

What drew you to dowsing and radionics, and how would you describe the essential ideas behind them? I was privileged, in the mid-1980s, to hire-on with an Oklahoma-based foun-dation whose mission was advancing sustainable agriculture in the eastern part of the state. I had responsibility for developing a model pick-your-own farm with diverse berry and vegetable crops. As a quick-start, the Foundation purchased a nearby 3-acre blueberry patch in its earli-est years of development. While it seemed the wise move at that time, what we hadn't recognized were problems emerg-ing from overuse and miss-application of farm chemicals. In defense of the origi-nal grower, he faced a number of chal-lenges related to poor, shallow soil and an environment not especially welcoming to blueberries. The only tools he was aware of were agrochemicals and he naturally believed that \"more was better.\" During that first season, I was able to document virtually every blueberry disease and insect pest to be found in the Ozark growing region, a mere 75 miles to the north. Roughly 10% of the plants died or were so un-thrifty they had to be replaced. The next season was more of the same. Though I enlisted university and industry guidance, their advice was well-inten-tioned, but not helpful. I tried to bring reduced-chemical and organic practices to bear, but they seemed too little too late. I was close to abandoning the planting when the universe rushed to the rescue. In a brief period of about three months or so, I began hearing of something called \"radionics\" from three or four independent sources. I recall my head snapping back each time the topic came up and knew it held something of importance for me. A brief bit of reading on the subject scared the hell out of me. I knew it would be life-changing. But I believed the universe was providing a river of direction and means, and I was meant to go wherever the cur-rent took me. So I enrolled in my first radionics training in the summer of 1986. The class was held on a sugar cane plan- tation near Mercedes, Texas, just minutes from Brownsville but a day-and-a-half drive from my home in southeastern Oklahoma. When I returned after four days of training, I was quite befuddled and doubtful. I was only able to do a few simple procedures and was not confident in them. I had my new \"black box\" instrument, but not much certainty that it would help. Despite that, I immediately began apply- ing those \"few simple procedures.\" I was amazed to see fast, remarkable improve-ments. As the season progressed, diseases and pest-infestations rapidly retreated; weed pressure declined; and all the plants took on a much healthier appearance. That year there were no dead or declining plants to replace. Within two years, our yields were competitive with plantings on much better growing sites. I began to apply radi-onics and dowsing (which is incorporated into the protocols of radionics) to new pick-your-own crops we planted, such as blackberries, and had similar successes. Q: Many people today would consider dowsing to be \"folk wisdom,\" meaning unscientific, subjective, and even an illusion. Is psychotronics similar in any way to the more traditional method of using a forked dowsing stick? Let me try to clarify. According to my grasp of the term, psychotronics involves the in-teraction of the mind (psycho) with physi-cal devices (tronics). Based on this under-standing, it (psychotronics) is an umbrella term that encompasses dowsing\u2014where simple tools such as forked sticks, L-shaped rods, and pendulums are used\u2014and radion-ics, which relies on complex instrumenta-tion. A continuum exists between these two modalities based on the complexity of tools employed. The principles and para- digms, however, are essentially the same. Q: Does dowsing in this sense require developed intuition, clairvoyance, or some other special capacity? The vast majority of us are endowed with the talent of intuition. Most also have the physical capability to achieve responses from pendulums, forked sticks, and the \"stick plates\" used in radionics instruments. These responses are, in fact, the result \"ideomotor\" activity\u2014very small neuro-muscular reactions that are amplified by dowsing and radionics tools. Of course, there are some who cannot dowse, for example, those suffering certain kinds of brain or nervous system dam-age, and individuals under the influence of certain drugs or alcohol. However, many who claim they cannot dowse, or do basic radionics, often construct their own bar-riers to learning. Sometimes those barriers arise for psychological, cultural, or religious reasons. But whatever the reason, denial and doubt are self-reinforcing, and ensure failure at any form of psychotronics without a sig-nificant change in attitude or belief system. That said, we need to recognize that in- nate intuition, while present in almost all of us, is not evenly distributed. We know that most of us are well-able to paint a bedroom wall; far fewer, however, can provide it with an attractive mural. And only a sprinkling of those with extra tal-ent can paint a valuable, artistic master-piece to hang there. The analogy goes on to suggest that, as most all of us can do the practical task of painting a wall, most of us can also dowse at some practical level that will be useful and reliable. Q: Would you briefly describe the basic electronic instrumentation of radionics and how it is used? Radionics instruments are tools for the mind. They provide an organized procedural means for finding information that we cannot access through reasoning. They do this by clarifying and holding the operator's intentions and, as with dowsing, provide a physical means for finding accurate and precise details through pendulum responses, physical sensations on a smooth rubbing plate, or other means, some of which are similar to those used in biofeedback and polygraph testing. Furthermore, radionics instruments can hold operator intent to pro-vide healing and balance to plants, gardens, and landscapes, as well as to humans and animals\u2014something akin to psychic healing. Now, what I have just described can also be done using less complex and lower-cost dowsing tools, though it often requires more intense and sustained focus. Instrumentation also provides something Q 5 like a psychic firewall that reduces the operator's vulnerability to negative influ-ences and conserves his or her energy. It is also true that some people simply have more confidence when using instru-mentation. I tend to be one of those. But certainly, it is this fascination with the technology that seems to draw so many engineers to radionics. Q: How can you know that the results obtained from dowsing are \"real\" and not just self-deception? Confidence in dowsing and radionics derives largely from practice and the trust that comes with it. However, self-deception is not only possible, but likely when we allow personal prejudices and assumptions to drive the process. Unless the dowser approaches with a truly open mind, he or she might use it to justify racism, social injustice, environmental destruction and other unhealthy ideas and actions. What I'm saying might appear to sug- gest that dowsing and radionics are too risky to mess with. Perhaps that's true for some. I, for one, have found psychotronics a fantastic tool for expansion of con-sciousness and advancing spiritual growth. If you sincerely seek the truth and proper guidance for your life, it should work that way for others as well. Q: How does one's intent play into the process and results of dowsing? Focused intent is a requisite for accuracy and precision. Clear intent allows us to resonate with the subject we are studying as well as its specific aspects or qualities. This is the \"psycho\" part of psychotronics. If we ignore that part, we are simply left with the interesting but useless \"tronics\" part; we have devices that no longer have utility. Q: When and why did you take up biodynamic methods for gardening? Years before venturing into psychotronics, I learned of biodynamics, from organic farmers in the upper Midwest. I went on to read an array of pamphlets and articles on it; I even began Steiner's \"Agricul-ture Course.\" Unfortunately, I just wasn't prepared for the metaphysical concepts. So, while I remained curious, I largely shelved any efforts to understand BD for quite some time. It wasn't until I was well into radionics that I began to grasp what biodynamics might be about and resumed looking more closely at it. My professional work enabled me to toy a bit with the more mystical practices of BD. I found synchronizing horticul-tural practices with celestial phenomena very useful, especially for fertilization and mowing operations. It wasn't until I approached retirement around 2015 that I immersed myself into biodynamic practice on my own property in northwest Arkansas. I set out with the objective of discovering ways in which psychotronics could aid biodynamic farm-ing and gardening. This is ongoing work for me, and centers on my one-quarter acre garden. It's not always a pretty site as I'm also experimenting with organic no-till methods and other practices that make the place appear more unkempt than it is. Q: Do beings such as elementals, devas, and so on have a role in psychotronics? Like biodynamics, I played with the con- cepts and practices for communicating with nature's \"intelligences\" for years, not really understanding their roles or their relevance to what I was doing with organics and psychotronics. I began with the writings of Machaelle Small Wright of Perelandra Garden and continue to follow her guidance. I strongly recom-mend her work to others. As with BD, my early efforts in this area were just as con-fusing and not terribly successful. Again, I really didn't understand the essentials. While I still make my share of mistakes these days, the situation is vastly differ-ent. I've found real harmony and great satisfaction in working with devas and nature spirits. As for the specific matter of psychotro- nics and its relationship with nature beings: One can practice dowsing and radionics without intentional acknowl-edgement of their existence or the roles they play in the natural world. Though I consider the information about devas and elementals the most important topic of my book, I present things in such a way that readers can draw upon psychotron-ics without focusing on nature beings at all, should they so choose. In my opinion, however, they are missing out on some-thing truly beautiful. Psychotronics is actually quite utilitar- ian; it can easily be adapted to different gardening and farming philosophies and approaches. As an early student of agri-cultural radionics, I was taught concepts associated with Carey Reams' \"Biologi-cal Theory of Ionization.\" Reams' theory formed the basic structure in which I and others used psychotronics to determine what to do with the crop, what to apply to the soil, and when to do these things. Simultaneously, however, teachers and researchers elsewhere were using radionics to guide BD practices, organics more gen-erally, Albrecht theory, and even conven-tional farming with agrochemicals.I am choosing to use psychotronics with biodynamics because through BD I'm discovering a coherent and spiritual un-derstanding of nature that welcomes the knowledge of the conventional sciences, while selecting only technologies that are life-affirming.Using psychotronics in a biodynamic garden Jens Jensen Inter vIeWs Ge orGe Ku epper 6 sensitive Beekeeping Practicing Vulnerability and Nonviolence Your Backyard Beehive JACK BrEsETTE-MILLs \"sensitive Beekeeping\" means beekeeping without a veil, in harmony with the bees; beekeeping for the sake of the bee instead of profit; and learning to care for bees thr ough our own observation and sensitivity for the beehive.

It brings deep awareness of the intimate reciprocal relationship between humans and mammals that leads to a profound empathy for our animal brothers and sisters. Volume 1 is a comprehensive description of the threefold human organism. It lays the foundation for an in-depth study of familiar groups of mammals and their intimate relationship with their natural environment. Volume 2 begins with studies of the primitive mammals, returning to the theme of human threefoldness in the final chapter. Thus, the balanced threefoldness of the human organism is contrasted with its diverse though one-sided expressions in the mammals.

It leads to a ground-breaking understanding of animal development and evolution as creative processes in which the animals are active participants. The further evolution of life on earth depends largely on human activity, and this book shows a way to learn from nature's living qualities so we may further, rather than disrupt, the health of the planet. And that matters. In vivid portrayals of nine different animals, Craig holdrege shows how all of an animal' s features are interconnected and a revelation of the animal as a whole. At the same time, every animal intersects with and influences in dynamic ways the larger environment. With the animals themselves as his guide, he avoids the pitfalls of both mechanistic and anthropomorphic perspectives that not only skew our conception of animals, but can also lead to their mistreatment. craig Holdrege, ph.D., is an author, lecturer, teacher, and co-founder and director of the nature Institute, Ghent, nY. 9781584209034 224pp $25.00\"You take all of Nature together to shed light on individual details; in the totality of her phenomena, you seek to explain the individual.

W. von Goethe. At the age of 21, rudolf steiner was chosen to edit Goethe' s scientific writings; it was steiner's task to understand and comment on Goethe's scientific achievements, and here began steiner's own training in epistemology and spiritual science. Goethe had discovered how thinking could be applied to organic nature and that this experience requires not just rational concepts but a whole new way of perceiving.

The authors of this book introduce one specific therapy and make a case for integrative health in general, including anthroposophically extended medicine, naturopathy, and other holistic approaches. Mistletoe therapy has long been considered a viable treatment for cancer by the European medical community and is beginning to gain recognition in North America, as well. The mistletoe plant possesses many remarkable properties. As a therapy, it represents a rediscovery of ancient wisdom and shows us how the science of modern medicine might expand its reach and reconnect with a more human-centered medicine. The book is structured to follow the syllabus of a three-day practitioner training hosted by the Physicians' Association for Anthroposophic Medicine (PAAM). While this book should not be regarded as a treatment or diagnostic manual, it is intended to both prepare practitioners to begin mistletoe therapy training and to make this information available, in an accessible form, to anyone interested in learning about this approach to treating cancer.

There are many books on the subject, and that decision is not a focus here. But teaching with the Waldorf cur-riculum at home is innovative now\u2014in its early days. Waldorf schools are institu-tions, and if one decides that one's child will be best educated outside of institu-tions, for whatever reason, then one is left with the challenge of finding a life in the curriculum that resonates to life at home. Before Steiner gave indications for an institutional school, he tutored one family's children at home, in all subjects, including one child with special needs. The first Waldorf school was begun when emil Molt asked Steiner for indication s of a curriculum and school for the children of the workers at his cigarette factory in Stuttgart, Germany. Yet as far as I know, no one ever asked Steiner for indica-tions on how to school at home. We don't know what his answers might have been; we have to find the answers now ourselves. Steiner was clear, though, that starting a school as an institution within the state would require compromises ( Foundations of Human experience , Au- gust 20, 1919). School at home does not require those same compromises. I often got the question, \"How can the children be socialized if they go to school at home?\" That question has many assumptions behind it. One assumption is that an institution in which children spend hours every weekday in a room with twenty or thirty other children the same age is the only way to provide them group experience that will teach them how to interact in a socially acceptable way with others. This assumption is not true, even in Waldorf schools where teachers take into account the balance of temperaments in the group. Another assumption is that children who have school at home are not in social groups. This assumption is not true either. For instance, we were part of a group of families that celebrated festivals together and sometimes joined to teach our children in small groups. And we also hired specialty teachers for small groups throughout the fifteen years that we had school at home. Flexibility and adaptability are hallmarks of the Waldorf curriculum, and these qualities make the curriculum not only ideal, but crucial, as a foundation for teaching at home. The Teacher's Own Relation to the Curriculum If we go back to the word \"curriculum\" again, we can go deeper with its meaning. The word is from the Latin curri, a stem of the verb from cule, which is a diminutive suffix. Thus, a curriculum is \"a little running\" or \"a little course.\" This is the type of course that stars follow, that rivers flow, and that runners run. But what does this \"course\" have to do with a predetermined set of lessons, which is what we now think of as a curriculum? If the course is a path, then schooling is a path, and the teacher and student are on that path together. And so there is movement and progress and change and adaptation. As I stated earlier, my first contact with the Waldorf curriculum came before I had children, when a friend who had attended the edinburgh Steiner School gave me education Towards Freedom by Franz Carlgren. This book describes the curriculum and nature of the Waldorf schools of 1972 in england and Germany. When I first read it, a few things imme-diately struck me about the education: its beauty, depth, integrity, and whole-ness. These qualities I was strongly drawn to, even though my own education and professional work were nothing like the schooling described. I was also drawn to the paintings and drawings, the class-rooms themselves, and the expressions of interest and well-being on the children's faces, not to mention the breadth of top-ics and the detail of the thinking behind the topics\u2014and also the sense that all the lessons were related to a larger whole. I felt that I would have children and that this Waldorf method would be the right education for them.e -Chapter Three, Connecting with the Curriculum by Catherine read, PhDTeaching Your Children at Home with the Waldorf Curriculum38 The Dignity of the Young Child: Volume 1 how Can We Keep the Young Child healthy?
