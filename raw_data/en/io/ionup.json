Of those, 6,893 were excluded upon title and abstract review for clearly not meeting inclusion criteria (e.g., not pertinent to the topic, not published in E nglish, published prior to study inclusion publication date, or not a full-length article). A total of 348 fu ll-length articles were retrieved for review (See Error! Reference source not found. for the PRISMA diagram). Of those, 107 were excluded due to having the wrong patient population (27 studies), the wrong study design (26 studies), the wrong intervention (24 studies), wrong outcomes (13 studies), duplicates (4 studies), all studies included in systematic review were published prior to 2008 (3 studies), conference ab stracts (3 studies), less than 20 patients (2 studies), more recent and/or comprehensive systematic review available (2 studies), wrong comparator (2 studies that compared different intensity level of exercise), and protocol (1 study). An additional 81 studies were excluded during data abstraction. Reas ons for these exclusions are listed in Appendix B . Figure 1.

Outdoor therapy was identified in the CARA legislation, while exercise was identified by the COVER Commission as an intervention of interest. These have been combined due to the overlap in the studies. COVER Commission Systematic Review Page 3 of 145 Acupuncture Evidence Base Our searches of the literature identified 1 SR with an evidence base of 64 RCTs published between 1985 to 2016 that addressed the use of acupuncture to tr eat adults diagnosed with depression. Smith (2018) examined acupuncture compared to medication (42 RCTs ), control acupuncture, which is a treatment that looks similar to active acupuncture (14 RCTs), no treatment (5 RCTs), or psychological therapies including counseling and an educational interven tion with psychological guidance (2 RCTs). Control acupuncture may include an invasive acupuncture control, sham acupuncture, which involves the insertion of a needle into a non-acupuncture site, mi nimal acupuncture in which needles are inserted into non-acupuncture sites in a superficial way to a void stimulation or manipulation, non-invasive actupuncture control with a placbo needle, mock el cetro-acupuncutre with d ecommissioned acupuncture stimulation, or mock laser acupuncture. The studies in this review included a total of 7,104 adults with clinical depression and considered the efficacy of manual acupuncture (42 RCTs), electroacupuncture (13 RCTs), a combination of manual and electroacupunctu re (7 RCTs), and laser acupuncture (2 RCTs). Treatment sessions ranged from <10 sessions to 60 sessi ons, with an average of 30 total sessions, lasting from 20 to 60 minutes of needling per session. The primary outcome measured was reduction in the severity of depression at the end of treatment. Seconda ry outcomes included remission, quality of life, and adverse events. Study Quality Using the AMSTAR instrument, we rated the qua lity of the systematic review as high (See Table 4 for more information on the review ratings). The authors of the review used the Cochrane tool to assess the RoB of the included studies. The trials were rated as low to high RoB with studies of high RoB downgraded due to lack of blinding patients, study staff, and/or outcome assessors. Key Findings Below, we describe the key findings for the outcom es of interest with the GRADE strength of the evidence (SOE) rating. See Table 1 for factors that influenced the SOE ratings. Acupuncture vs. No Treatment/Wait List/Treatment as Usual Combined evidence of 5 RCTs suggests that ac upuncture (manual and electro) may moderately reduce depression severity at posttreatment compar ed to no treatment/wait list/treatment as usual (SOE: Low). Combined evidence from 2 RCTs found no difference between acupuncture and manual acupuncture in remission of depression (SOE: Moderate). Evidence from 1 RCT found no difference between acupuncture and no treatment in the risk of adverse events (SOE: Moderate). Acupuncture vs. Control Acupuncture (invas ive or non-invasive sham controls) Combined evidence of 14 RCTs suggests that acupuncture may be associated with a small reduction in depression severity of 1.69 poin ts on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) at post-treatment (SOE: Low). COVER Commission Systematic Review Page 4 of 145 Combined evidence of 10 RCTs found greater remi ssion following acupuncture when compared to control acupuncture (SOE: Moderate). Combined evidence of 5 RCTs found no clear be tween group differences in the risk of adverse events (SOE: Moderate). Combined evidence of 2 RCTs found no clear between group differences in emotional quality of life (SOE: Moderate). Evidence from 1 RCT found no clear between group di fferences in physical quality of life (SOE: Moderate). Acupuncture vs. Medication Combined evidence of 31 RCTs suggest that acupuncture may lead to a small reduction in depression severity compared to medication alone at post-treatment (SOE: Very low). Combined evidence from 27 RCTs suggest remissi on from acupuncture compared to medication alone (SOE: Moderate). Combined evidence of 3 RCTs suggest lower rati ngs of adverse events following acupuncture compared with medication alone (SOE: Very low). Acupuncture + Medication vs. Medication Alone Combined evidence from 11 RCTs suggest that acupuncture plus medication statistically significantly reduces depression severity compared to medication alone post-treatment. (SOE: Very low). Combined evidence from 9 RCTs show no clear difference in remission between acupuncture used in conjunction with medication compared to medication alone (SOE: Low). Combined evidence from 3 RCTs show no clear di fference in adverse events associated with manual and/or electro-acupuncture plus medica tion (SSRIs) compared to medication (SSRIs) alone (SOE: Very low). Combined evidence from 2 RCTs found no clear be tween group differences in emotional quality of life (SOE: Low). Evidence from 1 RCT found suggests that acupunctu re plus medication may improve physical quality of life compared to medication alone (SOE: Low). Acupuncture vs. Psychological Treatment Combined evidence of 2 RCTs show no clear differences between acupuncture and psychological therapy in depression severity at post-treatment (SOE: Low). Evidence from 1 RCT suggests no differences betwee n groups in rates of adverse events (SOE: Low). COVER Commission Systematic Review Page 5 of 145 Discussion The evidence for acupuncture in the treatment of c linical depression shows there may be a moderate reduction in the severity of depression when compared with treatment as usual or no treatment. The use of acupuncture may lead to a small reduction in the sev erity of depression when compared with control acupuncture. Acupuncture given alone or as an adj unct to medication may reduce depression symptoms severity, however, it is important to note that the quality of the evidence is very low. No significant difference was observed between acupuncture and psyc hological treatment in the reduction of depression symptoms. Studies show substantial variation resultin g from use of different classes of medications and different modes of acupuncture stimulation. Most included studies did not report adverse events; therefore, it is unclear what risks of adverse events there are with acupuncture. Lack of medium and long- term follow-up in clinical trials represents a significant limitation of the evidence base. COVER Commission Systematic Review Page 6 of 145 Table 1.

GRADE Factors Used to Assess the Quality of a Body of Evidence Evidence Category Definition Study Quality (Internal Validity or Risk of Bias) Study quality considers the overall risk of bias rating of all the studies included in the evidence base. In this review, the overall risk of bias would be the average or median USPSTF rating for studies comprising an evidence base for a key outcome. Consistency of Evidence Consistency of evidence refers to the degree of similarity in the direction of effects or the degree of similarity in the effect sizes (magnit ude of effect) across individual studies within an evidence base. Directness of Evidence Direct evidence directly compares interventions of interest in populations of interest and measures patient-oriented outcomes. Evidence can be indirect if the tested intervention differs from the intervention of interest, the study population differs from the population of interest, the outcomes differ from those of primary interest, or treatment comparisons have not been tested in head-to-head comparisons. Precision of Evidence Precision is the degree of certai nty surrounding an estimate of effect with respect to an outcome. Precision is primarily assessed by examining the 95% confidence intervals around the summary effect size.

Acupuncture for depression. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 3 (CD004046), 1-225.COVER Commission Systematic Review Page 16 of 145 Art Therapy Evidence Base Our searches of the literature identified 1 SR and 2 RCTs that assessed the u se of art therapy in the treatment of adults diagnosed with depression. See Table 3 and Table 6 for details about the patients, interventions, outcomes and findings of the identified studies. In brief, Meekums et al. (2015) conducted a SR to examine the effectiveness of Dance Movement Therapy (DMT) for depression with or without standard care, compared to no treatment or standard care alone, psychological therapies, pharmacological ther apies, or other physical interventions including exercise and dance (Meekums et al., 2015). The author s also compared the effectiveness of different DMT approaches. The evidence base fo r the SR included a total of 3 RCTs enrolling 147 participants. However, only 2 of the RCTs (n=107) enrolled adults and will therefore, be included in this review. One additional RCT by Blomdahl et al. (2018) ra ndomized 79 patients with moderate to severe depression to receive either a manual-based phenom enological art therapy plus treatment as usual (PATd/TAU) (n=43) or TAU alone (n=36). Accord ing to Blomdahl et al. (2018), phenomenology art therapy focuses how someone perceives the world, th eir lives, and themselves with the aim of increasing self-awareness and understanding, accepting one's strengths and limits, and learn to prioritize these based on self-knowledge. Treatment as usual is this study mo stly included various fo rms of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, but also include acupuncture for three of the participants. Treatment as usual was determined and performed by participants' regular physi cians or therapists. Participation in the study did not affect the content or number of treatments in TA U in either group, rather the authors added TAU to PATd in order to test its impact. PATd consis ted of 10, 60-minute long treatment sessions delivered weekly and both groups received the same number of TAU. The primary outcome of interest includes depression levels, and the secondary outcome of interest includes suicide ideation. The other RCT, Ciasca et al. (2018) randomized 56 elderly women with MDD and were stable on pharmacotherapy to art therapy (n=31) or the c ontrol group which did not receive any adjunctive intervention. The art therapy group received 20, 90-mi nute weekly sessions provided by an art therapist. The primary outcome of interest includes depression levels. Study Quality Using the AMSTAR instrument, we rated the quality of the Meekums et al. (2015) review as high (see Table 4 for the quality ratings). The authors of the review by Meekums rated the RoB of the included RCTs as moderate to high using criteria from the Cochra ne tool. The authors indicated that some of the studies did not blind patients, clinicians, or outcome assessors. We rated the RoB of the Blomdahl and Ciasca trial as having some concerns due to lack of information on blinding of the outcome assessors and lack of information on the randomization process used (see Table 7 for individual quality ratings). Key Findings Below, we describe the key findings for the outcom es of interest with the GRADE strength of the evidence (SOE) rating. See Table 1 for factors that influenced the SOE ratings. COVER Commission Systematic Review Page 17 of 145 Evidence from 2 RCTs suggest that Dance Movement Therapy led to a reduction in depression compared to standard care, howev er the findings did not reach clinical significance (SOE: Low). Evidence from 1 RCT suggests that there is no statistically significant difference between Dance Movement Therapy and standard care in improving quality of life (SOE: Very low). Evidence from 1 RCT suggests that PATd in conj unction with TAU resulted in a statistically significantly reduction in depression symptoms co mpared with TAU alone (SOE: Very low) Evidence from 1 RCT suggests that there is no statistically significant difference between PATd in conjunction with TAU compared to T AU alone in change in suicide intentions (SOE: Very low). Evidence from 1 RCT suggests that art therapy as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy in older adults statistically significantly improved depressive symptoms when compared to pharmacotherapy alone (SOE: Low). Evidence from 1 RCT suggests that art therapy in conjunction with pharmacotherapy in older adults statistically significantly improved symptoms of anxiety when compared to pharmacotherapy alone (SOE: Low). Discussion Overall, the results of the Meekums review suggest s that, while there was evidence of a reduction in depression for group Dance Movement Therapy (DMT ) conducted over a period between 4 and 10 weeks with a total of 20 sessions and combined with standa rd care vs. standard care alone, the result was not statistically significant (standardized mean differen For quality of life, one study showed no eff ect in either direction (SMD: 0.30, 95% CI -0.60 to 1.20). Blomdahl et al. RCT suggests that manual-based Art Therapy in addition to treatment as usual (PATd/TAU) demonstrates a statistically significan t difference for improvement in depression levels (MADRS-S) compared to treatment as usual (TAU) alone . Those in the art therapy group (n=43) received 10, 1-hour weekly sessions including various tasks that served as prompts for the participant to paint. This study also examined suicide ideation as a secondary ou tcome, but no statistically significant difference was found in suicide ideation between the PATd/TAU group and the TAU group. Ciasca et al. RCT showed statistically significant improvements in depression levels (GDS and BDI scales) as well as anxiety (BAI) in female older adults (age 60 yrs. or older) who were stable on pharmacological treatments for MDD and were randomized to the art therapy group (n=31) compared to the control group (n=25). The art therapy intervention consisted of 20, 90-minute sessions that were all provided by the same art therapist and workshops th at included a brief relaxation exercise that utilized guided imagery, followed with artistic output and then the participants sharing their thoughts and feelings with the therapist and group members. No adverse ev ents were reported for any of the included RCTs. The strength of the evidence for these studies w as rated as low due to small sample sizes and methodological limitations that include unclear info rmation about the randomization process and lack of blinding of patients, clinicians, and outcome assessors.

Page 26 of 145 Tai Chi Evidence Base Our searches of the literature identified 3 RCTs that asses sed the use of Tai Chi in the treatment of adults with MDD. Yeung et al. (2017) randomized 67 adults with DSM-IV MDD receiving no treatment for depression to Tai Chi (n=23), an education program (n =22), or waitlist (n=22). The Tai Chi and education program consisted of 1-hour classes twice a week for 12 weeks. The primary outcomes of interest measured in this study were the response and remission rates for depression. Yeung et al. (2012) randomized 39 adults with DSM-IV MDD to either a 1-hour twice a week for 12- weeks Tai Chi intervention group (n=26) or a waitlis t control group (n=13). The primary outcomes of interest measured in this study were the response and remission rates for depression. Lavretsky et al. (2011) recruited and treated 112 older adults (age 60) diagnosed with MDD with 10-20 mg per day of escitalopram for 4 weeks. The au thors then randomized 73 partial responders who continued to receive escitalopram daily to either Tai Chi Chih (n=36) or a health education program (n=37). The Tai Chi Chih (TCC) sessions were 2-hour s once a week and included 10 minutes of warm-up (e.g. stretching and breathing) and 5 minutes of cool -down. The TCC protocol was designed for older adults to address depression, fatigue , and perceived physical limitations and is described by the authors as \"meditation through movement.\" The health educati on sessions were 2-hours once a week and lasted over the 10-week treatment period using a didactic a pproach. The sessions consisted of lectures, group discussions, and self-help quizzes to asses participan t learning. The purpose of the sessions was to provide education about depression stress, sleep, and othe r health-related issues that play a role in helping individuals with depression understa nd and manage their symptoms and factors that contribute to their mood. Study Quality Using the Cochrane tool, we rated the RoB of th e Yeung (2012) and Lavretsky RCTs as Some Concerns due to lack of information about the randomizati on process and lack of information about blinding (see Table 4 for individual quality ratings). Key Findings Below, we describe the key findings for the outcom es of interest with the GRADE strength of the evidence (SOE) rating. See Table 1 for factors that influenced the SOE ratings. Evidence from 1 RCT suggests that Tai Chi statistically significantly improves depression levels and remission when compared to waitlist only with the improvements sustained at 24 weeks follow-up (SOE: Low). Evidence from 1 RCT suggests that there is no st atistically significant difference between Tai Chi and waitlist in improving depression le vels or remission rates (SOE: Low). Evidence from 1 RCT suggests that Tai Chi as an adjunct to escitalopram statistically significantly improves depression symptom severity but did not reach statistical significance in remission (SOE: Low). Page 27 of 145 Discussion The evidence from 1 RCT suggests th at Tai Chi compared to waitlist demonstrates positive responses in both depression levels and remission with those impr ovements being sustained at 24 weeks follow-up. Tai Chi also led to improvements in Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scores with a medium effect size. Another RCT found that Tai Chi as an adjunct treatment to escitalopram is more effective in depression response and remission rates than a health education program as an adjunct to escitalopram. Over time, while both groups improved in term s of depression severity (HAM-D scores), greater reduction was observed among those in the Tai Chi plus escitalopram intervention group. The study also showed that patients who received Tai Chi in add ition to escitalopram had better outcomes in health- related quality of life. However, the findings of a third RCT suggest that, while patients in a Tai Chi intervention group had improved depression response and remission rates compar ed to those in a waitlist group, the differences were not statistically significant. In addition, ther e were no statistically significant differences between the Tai Chi and waitlist groups in terms of scores on the HAM-D, Q-LES-Q, CGI-S, or CGI-I. Page 28 of 145 Table 1.

GRADE Factors Used to Assess the Quality of a Body of Evidence Evidence Category Definition Study Quality (Internal Validity or Risk of Bias) Study quality considers the overall risk of bias rating of all the studies included in the evidence base. In this review, the overall risk of bias would be the average or median USPSTF rating for studies comprising an evidence base for a key outcome. Consistency of Evidence Consistency of evidence refers to the degree of similarity in the direction of effects or the degree of similarity in the effect sizes (magnit ude of effect) across individual studies within an evidence base. Directness of Evidence Direct evidence directly compares interventions of interest in populations of interest and measures patient-oriented outcomes. Evidence can be indirect if the tested intervention differs from the intervention of interest, the study population differs from the population of interest, the outcomes differ from those of primary interest, or treatment comparisons have not been tested in head-to-head comparisons. Precision of Evidence Precision is the degree of certai nty surrounding an estimate of effect with respect to an outcome. Precision is primarily assessed by examining the 95% confidence intervals around the summary effect size.

Page 38 of 145 Music Therapy Evidence Base Our searches of the literature identified 1 RCT that met inclusion criteria and assessed the effects of music therapy (MT) in the treatment of adults diagnosed with depression. See Table 3 for details about the patients, interventions, outcomes and findings of the identified study. Erkkila et al. (2011) looked at the possible efficacy of MT as an adjunct treatment to standard care for depression compared with standard care alone in adults aged 18-50 years. In this study, 79 patients diagnosed with unipolar depression ( ICD-10-CM or DSM-III-R ) were randomized to receive either MT or treatment as usual (TAU). Standard care consiste d of 5 to 6 individual psychotherapy sessions, antidepressants, and psychiatric counseling. Music ther apy consisted of 20 bi-weekly sessions which were 60 minutes each. Patients were permitted to continue taking medication during the study. The main purpose of the MT intervention was to have patients engage in expressive musical interaction with a therapist supporting and facilitating the therapeutic pr ocess using musical elements (i.e. rhythm, harmony, melody, etc.). The primary outcome of interest was depression severity. Secondary outcomes include anxiety, general functioning, and quality of life. Study Quality Using the Cochrane tool, we rated the RoB of the Erkkila (2011) RCT as having some concerns due to lack of blinding. (see Table 4 for individual quality ratings). Key Findings Below, we describe the key findings for the outcom es of interest with the GRADE strength of the evidence (SOE) rating. See Table 1 for factors that influenced the SOE ratings. Evidence from 1 RCT suggests that, while music therapy in conjunction with standard care statistically significantly improves depression upon completion of treatment (3 mos.) compared to standard care alone (SOE: Low) , those differences do not reach statistical significance at 6 months follow-up (SOE: Very low). Evidence from 1 RCT suggests that, while music therapy in conjunction with standard care statistically significantly improves anxiety upon completion of treatment (3 mos.) compared to standard care alone (SOE: Low), those differences do not reach statistical significance at 6 months follow-up (SOE: Very low). Evidence from 1 RCT suggests that, while music therapy in conjunction with standard care statistically significantly improves functioning upon completion of treatment (3 mos.) compared to standard care alone (SOE: Low) , those differences do not reach statistical significance at 6 months follow-up (SOE: Very low). Evidence from 1 RCT suggests there is no statis tical significance between music therapy in conjunction with standard care and standard car e alone in improving health-related quality of life (SOE: Very low). Page 39 of 145 Discussion Overall, the results of the Erkkila et al. RCT sugg ests that music therapy in conjunction with standard care demonstrates positive responses in depression levels , anxiety, and functioning when compared to standard care immediately following treatment, whic h in this case, was 3 months. These effects were statistically significant with effect sizes in the medium-to-large range (0.65 for depression and 0.49 for anxiety). However, these differences did not reach statistical significance in the 6-month follow-up assessments. The overall strength of the evidence for a ll the reported outcomes of interest was rated low to very low ( See Table 1 ). This is largely due to limitations in the methodological quality of the study and the small sample size. Page 40 of 145 Table 1.

Page 47 of 145 Yoga Evidence Base Our searches of the literature identified 1 SR that assessed the use of yoga in the treatment of adults diagnosed with depression. See Table 3 for details about the patients, interventions, outcomes and findings of the identified studies. In brief, Vollbehr et al. (2018) conducted a SR with meta-analysis that evaluated the effects of hatha yoga for adults diagnosed with depression on depressive symptoms. The evidence base for the SR included a total of 11 RCTs enrolling 1,327 patient s (range per study 20 to 620) that we re used in the meta-analysis. Study Quality Using the AMSTAR instrument, we rated the qualit y of the Vollbehr review as low as there was no evidence that a protocol was developed prior to conduct of the review (See Table 4 for the review ratings). The authors of this review assessed the RoB of the RCTs using the Clinical Trial Assessment Measure (CTAM). The overall RoB of the trials in cluded in the Vollbehr review was mainly low to moderate due to lack of adequate description of th e intervention, lack of reporting around attrition, and lack of blinding of patients, pr oviders, and outcome assessors. Key Findings Below, we describe the key findings for the outcom es of interest with the GRADE strength of the evidence (SOE) rating. See Table 1 for factors that influenced the SOE ratings. Evidence from 6 RCTs suggests that yoga statis tically significantly improves depressive symptoms in adults diagnosed with clinical depression when compared to a psychoeducation control (SOE: Very low). Evidence from 6 RCTs suggest that there is no significant difference between yoga and an active control (other than psychoeducation) in improving depressive symptoms in adults diagnosed with clinical depression (SOE: Very low). Evidence from 6 RCTs suggest there is no signi ficant difference between yoga and TAU in improving depressive symptoms in adults dia gnosed with clinical depression (SOE: Very low). Evidence from 4 RCTs suggest there is no signifi cant difference between yoga and an active control (psychoeducation and other) in improving depressive symptoms in adults diagnosed with clinical depression at 6 months follow-up (SOE: Very low). Discussion Overall, the findings of the Vollbehr review sugg est that yoga compared to treatment as usual or compared to all active controls, show no significan t effect on symptoms of depression. However, when comparing yoga to psychoeducation control, yoga did lead to reductions in symptoms of depression. At six months follow-up or longer however, yoga showed no significant effect when compared to active control. Page 48 of 145 The overall strength of the evidence for yoga was ve ry low and limited due to limitations in the methodological quality of the RCTs (e.g. lack of b linding, attrition), statistical imprecision, and considerable heterogeneity. Larger, more rigorous st udies are needed to full y assess the effectiveness of yoga in the treatment of depression. Page 49 of 145 Table 1.

GRADE Factors Used to Assess the Quality of a Body of Evidence Page 51 of 145 Evidence Category Definition Study Quality (Internal Validity or Risk of Bias) Study quality considers the overall risk of bias rating of all the studies included in the evidence base. In this review, the overall risk of bias would be the average or median USPSTF rating for studies comprising an evidence base for a key outcome. Consistency of Evidence Consistency of evidence refers to the degree of similarity in the direction of effects or the degree of similarity in the effect sizes (magnit ude of effect) across individual studies within an evidence base. Directness of Evidence Direct evidence directly compares interventions of interest in populations of interest and measures patient-oriented outcomes. Evidence can be indirect if the tested intervention differs from the intervention of interest, the study population differs from the population of interest, the outcomes differ from those of primary interest, or treatment comparisons have not been tested in head-to-head comparisons. Precision of Evidence Precision is the degree of certai nty surrounding an estimate of effect with respect to an outcome. Precision is primarily assessed by examining the 95% confidence intervals around the summary effect size. Link to GRADE Handbook: http://gdt.guidelinedevel opment.org/app/handbook Table 3.

Page 56 of 145 Meditation Evidence Base Our searches of the literature identified 3 RCTs that assessed the use of meditation in the treatment of adults with MDD. Ionson et al. (2018) randomized 83 older adults (aged 60-85) with a current major depressive episode (confirmed with Mini Neuropsychi atric Interview) and receiving treatment as usual (TAU) to either a Sahaj Samadhi meditation (SSM) group (n=40) or a TAU alone group (n=43). The SSM groups consisted of 4 or more participants led by certified teachers . An instructional phase consisted of 4 sessions with a duration of 90-120 min. each where participants received a sound (mantra) and a method of using the mantra. The correct practice a nd understanding of meditation was then reinforced. After the instructional phase was complete, 60-minute weekly sessions occurred over the next 11 weeks. Participants were expected to attend at least 75% of the sessions and engage in home SSM for 20 min. two times a day. Participants in the SSM group continued to receive TAU. The TAU control group continued to receive TAU including non-structured supportive therapy and/or antidepressant medications for 12 weeks. The outcomes of interest measured in this study were changes and severity of depressive symptoms, anxiety, quality of life, and adverse effects. Sharma et al. (2017) randomized 25 adults with DSM-IV-TR MDD who had not responded to >8 weeks of antidepressants to either an adjunct Sudarsha n Kriya yoga (SKY), a breathing-based meditation intervention group (n=13) or waitlist control group (n =12). The SKY sessions were provided for 1 hour bi-weekly over 12 weeks and consisted of two phases. The first phase (week 1) was a 6-session group program in which participants e ngaged in sitting meditation, yoga poses, and stress education. The second phase (weeks 2-8) consisted of weekly 1.5 hr. SKY sessions. Participants were also asked to practice SKY at home for 20-25 minutes per day. Those in the waitlist group were offered the SKY intervention once the study was completed. The primary outcomes of interest measured in this study include symptoms of depression and anxiety. Winnebeck et al. (2017) recruited a nd randomized 74 adults diagnosed with DSM-IV-TR MDD to either a brief mindfulness-based meditation intervention (n=38) or a psychoeducation and resting group control group (n=36). The psychoeducation and resting cont rol group learned about the signs and causes of depression, specifically the role of stress and the n eed to balance stress by taking time to rest, which patients in this group were instructed to do in order to disengage from negative thinking. Participants in the intervention group engaged 25 min. of guided meditation twice daily as well as informal short practices including breathing spaces (time to pause, rela x, and decide what to do next). The primary outcome of interest measured in this study is severity of depressive symptoms. Study Quality Using the Cochrane tool, we rated the RoB of th e Ionson (2018), Sharma (2017), and Winnebeck (2017) RCTs as Some due to lack of informa tion about the randomization process and lack of information about blinding (see Table 4 for individual quality ratings). Key Findings Below, we describe the key findings for the outcom es of interest with the GRADE strength of the evidence (SOE) rating. See Table 1 for factors that influenced the SOE ratings. Page 57 of 145 Evidence from 3 RCTs suggest that meditation al one or as an adjunct to treatment as usual (including antidepressants) or waitlist statistically significantly improves depressive symptoms when compared to tr eatment as usual alone, medication alone, or active control at 8-14 weeks follow-up (SOE: Low). Evidence from 2 RCTs suggest that meditation as an adjunct to treatment as usual (including antidepressants) statistically significantly im proves anxiety symptoms 8-12 weeks follow-up (SOE: Low). Evidence from 1 RCT suggests that there is no significant difference between meditation as an adjunct to treatment as usual compared to treatment as usual alone in improving quality of life (SOE: Very low). Evidence from 1 RCT suggests that meditati on in conjunction with treatment as usual statistically significantly improves remission co mpared to treatment as usual alone (SOE: Low) Discussion Overall, the findings from three RCTs suggest that meditation-based interventions offered as an adjunctive therapy to treatment as usual (includi ng antidepressants) or waitlist reduce symptoms and severity of depression. The findings of the Ionson (2 018) RCT also found that meditation used in conjunction with treatment as usual is associated with greater improvements in anxiety symptoms compared to treatment as usual alone. The Ionson study also looked at the outcome of quality of life, however, no significant difference was found between meditation and treatment as usual alone. The overall strength of the evidence for meditation-based interventions ranged from low to very low. In general, the strength of the evidence was limited due to limitations in the methodological quality of the RCTs (e.g. lack of blinding, unclear randomization pr ocess), small sample sizes, and very short follow-up periods. Larger, more rigorously designed studies with longer follow-up periods are needed. Page 58 of 145 Table 1.

Page 67 of 145 Transcranial Magnetic Stimula tion (TMS) or Repetitive (r)TMS Evidence Base Our searches of the literature identified 2 systematic reviews (SRs) and 1 subsequently published RCT that evaluated the efficacy of rTMS on adults with treatment resistant depression (TRD). The first SR by Brunoni et al. (2017) evaluated the efficacy and accepta bility of the different modalities of rTMS used for MDD by performing a network meta-analysis (Brunoni et al., 2017). For this report, we did not consider evidence from this review of studies on newer tec hniques of rTMS, such as synchronized or rTMS with priming stimulati on. We only considered the evidence from studies of more conventional forms of rTMS that includes high or low frequency rTMS applied to either the left or right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPC) or applied bilaterally. The overall evidence base for the Brunoni review included 81 RCTs enrolling 4,233 patien ts, most of whom (74%) were diagnosed with TRD. In most of the studies included in this revi ew, rTMS was an add-on or augmentative therapy to pharmacotherapy (88%) and was co mpared to sham rTMS with or without pharmacotherapy. The second review was conducted by Health Quality On tario (Ontario's Health Technology Assessment center, 2016). This review focused specifically on the efficacy of high frequency ( 5 Hz) rTMS applied to the left DLPC. Because this review had more direct evidence on this application of rTMS, we did not include evidence from the Brunoni review on high frequency left DLPC. The evidence base for this review included 23 RCTs comparing rTMS to sham and enrolling a total of 1,156 patients with TRD. In 16 studies, patients received rTMS while receiving antid epressants, and in seven studies patients did not receive any antidepressant during rTMS treatment. The RCT by Yesavage et al., (2018), published subsequent to the 2 SRs randomized 164 adults with TRD to receive rTMS applied to the left DLPC (n=81) or to receive sham rTMS (n =83). This study enrolled only US m ilitary veterans receiving care at a VA medical centers. Our searches also identified an RCT that considered the use of rTMS among patients with first episode major depression. Wang et al (2017) randomized 43 patients with first episode depression to receive rTMS combined with an antidepressant drug (paroxetin e, n=22) or to sham rTMS plus an antidepressant (n=21). The primary outcomes in all the studies considered as evidence for rTMS were response to therapy (typically defined as 50% or greater improvement from baseline according to the study's primary depression scale), any improvement in symptoms of depression, complete remission of depression, and adverse events. Two studies included in the Brunoni review (Blumberg et al. 2012 & Blumberg et al. 2016) and the RCT by Yesavage also reported on suicidality. See Tables 3 and 6 for more information about the studies included as evidence for th e use of rTMS to treat depression. Study Quality Using the AMSTAR instrument, we rated the quality of the review by Brunoni as moderate primarily because this review did not include a list of excluded studies with reasons for exclusion (see Table 4 for quality ratings of SRs). The authors of the review used the Cochrane risk of bias (ROB) tool to rate the methodological quality of the included studies. According to the authors, 21.0%, 67.9%, and 11.1% of studies had an overall low, unclear, and high ROB. Th e unclear ratings were due mostly to lack of reporting of randomization or allocati on procedures and/or imperfect blinding. We rated the quality of the review by Health Quality Ontario as High quality. The au thors of this review also used the Cochrane tool Page 68 of 145 to rate individual study ROB. Most of the include d studies received a quality rating of moderate as only three studies performed allocation concealment and not all studies blinded patients. Using the Cochrane tool, we rated the ROB of the two additional RCTs as Low. In both studies, patients and outcomes assessors were adequately bli nded and there was little to no attrition (See Table 7 for quality ratings of individual studies). Key Findings Below, we describe the key findings for the outcom es of interest with the GRADE strength of the evidence (SOE) rating. See Table 1 for factors that influenced the SOE ratings. Treatment-Resistant Depression High-Frequency rTMS (>5 Hz) Evidence from 17 RCTs suggests that high frequency rTMS is more effective than sham rTMS in reducing symptoms of depression. (SOE: Moderate) Evidence from 13 RCTs suggests that high frequency rTMS leads to significantly higher rates of remission from depression compared to sham rTMS. (SOE: Moderate) Evidence from 20 RCTS suggests that significantl y more patients with treatment-resistant depression responded to high frequency rTMS co mpared to sham rTMS. (SOE: Moderate) Evidence from 1 RCT suggests that there is no difference between high frequency rTMS and sham rTMS in reducing symptoms of suicidality or PTSD. (SOE: Moderate) Evidence from 1 RCT suggests that there is no difference between high frequency rTMS and sham rTMS in improving mental or physical quality of life. (SOE: Moderate) Low-Frequency rTMS (<5 Hz) Evidence from 1 SR (with 81 studies overall) suggests that significantly more patients with treatment resistant depression respond to low fre quency rTMS compared to sham rTMS. (SOE: Moderate) Evidence from 2 RCTs suggests that there is no difference between low frequency rTMS and sham rTMS in resolving suicide ideation. (SOE: Low) Bi-lateral rTMS (any frequency) Evidence from 1 SR (with 81 studies overall) suggests that significantly more patients with treatment resistant depression respond to bilateral rTMS compared to sham rTMS. (SOE: Moderate) Evidence from 1 SR (with 81 studies overall) sugg ests that bilateral rTMS leads to significantly higher rates of remission from depression co mpared to sham rTMS. (SOE: Moderate) Evidence from 2 RCTs suggests that patients who receive bilateral rTMS are more likely to experience resolution of suicidal ideation compared to patients who receive sham rTMS. (SOE: Moderate) Page 69 of 145 Acute Depression Evidence from 1 RCT suggests that rTMS plus paroxetine reduces symptoms of depression among adults with acute depression compared to sham rTMS plus paroxetine. (SOE: Low) Evidence from 1 RCT suggests that significantly more patients who received rTMS plus paroxetine responded to and experienced remiss ion from depression compared to patients who received sham rTMS and paroxetine. (SOE: Low) Discussion Overall, the findings of the RCTs that made up th e evidence base for rTMS suggest that significantly more patients with treatment resistant depression w ho received active rTMS alone or as an adjunct to medication respond to therapy, experience improvement in overall symptoms of depression, and achieve remission from depression compared to patients who received sham rTMS. The strength of the evidence supporting the findings for rTMS for these outcomes w as rated as moderate due to some concerns about the methodological quality of some of the included RCTs. Evidence from two RCTs further suggests that active rTMS is more effective in reducing sympto ms of suicidality among patients with treatment resistant depression compared to sham rTMS. However, no differences were found between active and sham rTMS for mental or physical quality of life. This finding, however, is based on evidence from one relatively small RCT. A single RCT found that significantly more patients with first episode (or acute) depression who received rTMS plus paroxetine responded to therapy, experi enced improvement in overall symptoms of depression and achieved remission from depression compared to pa tients who received sham rTMS plus paroxetine. The strength of the evidence supporting these findings w as low due to the very small sample size of the study. Few studies reported on adverse events. Among those th at did, headache and scalp discomfort were the most commonly reported events. In general, lack of reporting of adverse events was a limitation of the evidence supporting the use of rTMS for treating depression. Additional limitations included small evidence base for patients with first time depression, and limited length of treatment and follow-up to assess adverse events associated with repeated exposures to rTMS or for follow-up periods longer than 6 months.

GRADE Factors Used to Assess the Quality of a Body of Evidence Evidence Category Definition Study Quality (Internal Validity or Risk of Bias) Study quality considers the overall risk of bias rating of all the studies included in the evidence base. In this review, the overall risk of bias would be the average or median USPSTF rating for studies comprising an evidence base for a key outcome. Consistency of Evidence Consistency of evidence refers to the degree of similarity in the direction of effects or the degree of similarity in the effect sizes (magnit ude of effect) across individual studies within an evidence base. Directness of Evidence Direct evidence directly compares interventions of interest in populations of interest and measures patient-oriented outcomes. Evidence can be indirect if the tested intervention differs from the intervention of interest, the study population differs from the population of interest, the outcomes differ from those of primary interest, or treatment comparisons have not been tested in head-to-head comparisons. Precision of Evidence Precision is the degree of certai nty surrounding an estimate of effect with respect to an outcome. Precision is primarily assessed by examining the 95% confidence intervals around the summary effect size.

The SR by Kvam et al. (2016) was a me ta-analysis of RCTs that examined the efficacy of physical exercise as a treatment of depression, both as an independent intervention and as an adjunctive treatment to pharmacotherapy for depression. Physical exercise could be aerobic (e.g. walking, running or cycling) or non-aerobic (e.g. resistance, weightlifting, or strength). Comorbid conditions were allowed if the primary mental health condition was unipolar de pression. The main outcome measure needed to be depression symptoms measured by a validated scale. A total of 23 RCTs and 977 subjects were included in the study. Physical exercise had a large to mode rate statistically significant effect on depression when compared to control, but the effect size was small and not significant at follow-up. Exercise compared to no intervention also had a large and significant e ffect. Exercise compared to TAU had a moderate and significant effect. However, the effects of exerci se compared to either behavioral treatments or pharmacotherapy were small and not significant. Exer cise as an adjunct to behavioral treatments had a moderate but nonsignificant effect. When analysis was restricted to the six studies with methods that included allocation concealment, blinded outcomes a nd intention to treat analysis, the effects of depressive symptoms were small and no longer significant. The trial by Abdollahi et al. (2017) randomized 54 mildly to moderately depressed individuals (54% women; average age 48.25 years old) to receive e ither combined (adjunctive) CBT and exercise or CBT only. Both groups received one session of CBT weekly for 12 weeks while the CBT/exercise group also completed exercise 3 times each week supervised by a PhD in trained in sports science. Exercise consisted of warm up, cardiovascular exercise, walki ng and cool down at moderate intensity. Multilevel modeling demonstrated greater improvement in suicidal ideation, depression, and activities of daily living in the combined CBT/exercise group when compared to CBT only. The study was limited by drop-outs and lack of follow-up. Belvederi-Murri et al. (2015) studied the effects of augmenting sertraline treatment with exercise in late- life depression. The investigators randomized 121 prim ary care patients > 65 years who had MDD to one of three groups: 1) higher-intensity, progressive aerobic exercise plus sertraline (S+PAE); 2) lower- intensity, non-progressive aerobic exercise plus sertra line (S+NPAE); or 3) sertraline only, for 24 weeks. At the end of the study, a significantly higher number of individuals in the exercise groups achieved remission; 45% of the sertraline group, 73% of the S+NPAE group, and 81% of the S+PAE group attained remission (as measured by a HSRD score of <10). Another trial by Combs et al. (2014) studied exercise as a monotherapy for major depressive disorder as diagnosed by the SCID and meeting DSM VI criteria. This study randomized 202 adults to one of four arms: 1) supervised aerobic exercise, 2) home-based supervised exercise that identically matched the intensity and frequency of the supervised exercise group, 3) sertraline treatment, or 4) placebo pill. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of either exer cise or sertraline on disordered sleep in adults with MDD. Participants were followed for 12 months. Th e study demonstrated that the active treatment and placebo groups showed no differences in the HAM-D sleep components after 4 months. Neither sertraline Page 89 of 145 nor exercise was associated with greater improvement s in sleep when compared with placebo. However, residual symptoms of insomnia after successful MDD treatment predicted relapse. In Doose et al. (2015), the purpose of the study w as to determine the effect of physical exercise on unipolar depression. The investigators randomized 46 a dult outpatients, aged 18 - 65 years old, who met ICD-10 criteria for mild to severe MDD. All but 3 had recurrent MDD; 58.7% received concurrent psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy. Participants we re randomized to a walking/running aerobic exercise program at the local sports club or to a wait list control group. The study period was eight weeks and involved exercise three times in a one-hour group session. The study was limited by a 24% drop out and a 58% session attendance. There was a large and clini cally significant decrease in depressive symptoms measured by HSRD- 17 but BDI -II and VO 2 did not change significantly. The intervention group, as measured by HSRD-17, was considered \"recovere d\" while the control group was described as \"unchanged\". Kerling et al. (2015) studied 42 inpatients in German hospitals with moderate to severe depression. The aim of the study was to examine whether exercise as an adjunct to inpatient treatment improved psychological and physiological factors. Twenty-two patients were randomized to exercise (cycling and crosstraining, stepping, upper body, treadmill, recumb ent, or rowing) three times per week for six weeks compared to twenty individuals who received TAU (CBT and pharmacotherapy). The investigators reported that there were no dropouts and a 90% pa rticipation rate. This study found that exercise improved physical fitness (VO2 and ventilatory anaer obic threshold). Both grou ps showed improvements in depressive symptoms (BDI-II and MADRS), however significantly more patients in the exercise group were classified as responders. Changes in BDI-II, MADR S sum score, and remission were not significant. In a study by LeGrand et al. (2016), the effects of physical exercise as adjunctive treatment in patients hospitalized for MDD (DSM-IV and score of > 29 on BDI - II). Patients on antidepressants for < 2 weeks were included in the study. Thirty-five patient s (mean age 45.3 + 13.2 yrs.; 71% women) were randomized to one of three groups 1) aerobic exercise (30 minutes of brisk walking or running); 2) placebo stretching exercises; or 3) no treatment. They found a large and significant effect on BDI - II in both the aerobic exercise and stretching group but no significant change in depressive symptoms in the controls. Schuch et al. (2015) performed an RCT to evaluate the effects of adjunctive exercise in hospitalized patients with severe MDD. Fifty patients (were randomi zed to exercise plus TAU (n =25) or TAU control (n = 25). 52.8% of patients refused to participate in the trial. The twenty-five patients randomized to the exercise (stretching, walking on a treadmill, and exer cise of patient's preference) group did three exercise sessions per week throughout the period of hospita lization. Depression symptoms and quality of life (QoL) were evaluated at baseline, 2 weeks, and di scharge. Significant differences in depression symptoms and QoL (both physical and psychological) at 2 weeks and at discharge. However, there was no significant difference in the response or remission ra tes when the exercise group was compared to usual care. Siquiera et al. performed a randomized single-blind study that aimed to evaluate the effect of aerobic exercise as an adjunct to antidepr essant therapy. Fifty-seven patients (41 women with a mean age of 38.82+ 10.72 years) were randomized to either a 4 week, 4 times/week program of aerobic exercise or no activity. Depression severity measured using the HAM -D and BDI. The dropout rate was 29.8%. Page 90 of 145 Depression severity decreased signifi cantly in both groups but there were no differences between the exercise and usual care groups. The authors noted th at the exercise group required lower doses of sertraline monotherapy. In the final RCT, Verrusio et al. randomized 24 elderly subjects with mild to moderate MDD according to DSM-IV criteria (mean age 75.5 + 7.4, 11 M and 13 F) into a pharmacotherapy group and exercise combined with listening to music. The authors stated that all subjects completed the study. There was a significant reduction of depression and anxiety at 12 and 24 weeks compared to baseline in the exercise/music listening group (p = 0.05). While th e pharmacotherapy group showed a reduction in anxiety only at 24 weeks. Study Quality We rated the strength of evidence of the individual RCTs as Low or Very Low due to concerns regarding risk of bias due to lack of information on allocation concealment, lack of blinding of patients, lack of blinding of some clinicians and/or outcome assessors , and attrition. In additio n, small sample size and short study duration was characteristic of many studi es. In most studies, long term outcomes were not available. (See Table 7 for the RoB ratings). We rated the Kvam et al. meta-analysis as being of Moderate quality using AMSTAR criteria (see Table 4 for the rating). Key Findings Below, we describe the key findings for the outcom es of interest with the GRADE strength of the evidence (SOE) rating. See Table 1 for factors that influenced the SOE ratings. Evidence from 1 systematic review with 23 RCTs su ggest that exercise statistically significantly reduces depressive symptoms immediately following treatment when compared to no treatment or WL control (SOE: Low) Evidence from 3 RCTs suggest that adjunctive aerobic exercise therapy of any kind (e.g., running, cycling, stretching, or walking) statistically significantly improves symptoms of depression in outpatients compared to controls (e .g., WL, TAU, or other active treatment with pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy). Results were inconsistent as 1 RCT showed no significant effects. (SOE: Low) Evidence from 3 RCTs suggest that adjunctive aerobic exercise therapy statistically significantly improves symptoms of depression in inpatients comp ared to controls (e.g., WL, TAU, or other active treatment with pharmacotherapy or psychot herapy). 1 RCT showed increased remission at discharge for aerobic exercise compared to controls. (SOE: Low) Evidence from 1 RCT suggests that aerobic exercise of any kind (e.g., aerobic, strength training, sailing) statistically significantly improves psychological quality of life compared to WL. (SOE: Low) Evidence from 1 RCT of mild to moderate depressi on suggests that the addition of exercise to CBT produces a short-term reduction of suicidal ideation compared to CBT alone. Long term follow-up studies were not available. (SOE: Very Low). Page 91 of 145 Evidence from 1 RCT suggests that exercise alone may reduce symptoms of anxiety compared to controls. (SOE: Very low) Evidence from the secondary analysis of 1 RCT suggests that there is no statistically significant difference in sleep quality betw een exercise therapy plus treatment as usual and treatment as usual alone. (SOE: Very low) Discussion Overall, the findings of a single SR and the 9 RCTs that made up the evidence base for exercise suggest that exercise (e.g., aerobic, stretching, or walking) when used as an adjunct to medication and/or psychotherapy reduces symptoms of depression compared to controls (e.g., waitlist, TAU, or other active treatment). One study in elderly individuals with mi ld to moderate depression demonstrated that exercise and listening to music alone reduced both depression and anxiety when compared to medication alone. See Table 1 for a summary of all the findings for exercise to treat adults with MDD. The strength of the evidence supporting the findings for exercise in reducing symptoms of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation was rated as low or very low mainly due to methodological limitations of the included studies. These limitations included lack of blinding of partic ipants, clinicians and outcome assessors and high rates of attrition and nonadherence. However, limite d evidence (1 RCT each) suggest that there is no significant difference between exercise and controls in improving psychological quality of life or sleep quality.

GRADE Factors Used to Assess the Quality of a Body of Evidence Evidence Category Definition Study Quality (Internal Validity or Risk of Bias) Study quality considers the overall risk of bias rating of all the studies included in the evidence base. In this review, the overall risk of bias would be the average or median USPSTF rating for studies comprising an evidence base for a key outcome. Consistency of Evidence Consistency of evidence refers to the degree of similarity in the direction of effects or the degree of similarity in the effect sizes (magnit ude of effect) across individual studies within an evidence base. Directness of Evidence Direct evidence directly compares interventions of interest in populations of interest and measures patient-oriented outcomes. Evidence can be indirect if the tested intervention differs from the intervention of interest, the study population differs from the population of interest, the outcomes differ from those of primary interest, or treatment comparisons have not been tested in head-to-head comparisons. Precision of Evidence Precision is the degree of certai nty surrounding an estimate of effect with respect to an outcome. Precision is primarily assessed by examining the 95% confidence intervals around the summary effect size.

Bubble maps provide a visual overview of the distribution of evidence for the complementary and in tegrative health and other interven tions included in these systematic reviews. The bubble maps display information about the research meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria (see Appendix A) for these reviews and include the following: The strength of evidence (y-axis) The y-axis provides an overview of the quantity of research for an intervention. For this estimate, we used the number of individual RCTs and/or the number of RCTs included in previously published systematic reviews. Th e color of the bubbles indicates the strength of evidence (SOE). The lighter the color of a bubble, the higher the SOE and vice versa. The direction of findings (x-axis) The x-axis provides an estimate of the clini cal effectiveness of an intervention with the bubble maps differentiating the findings with thr ee different categories, which are, \"favors control\"; \"no difference\"; and \"favors interv ention\". Control groups are important to consider and have been noted in the maps as well, given that some studies have an active control and others do not. The confidence in the reported effect (bubble size) The size of a bubble indicates the level of confidence in the reported effect. Next to each bubble we abbreviate the intervention, the control group, and note the number of studies conducted. It is important to note that, due to the number of studies included and the scope of these systematic reviews, the bubble maps may only represent limited information. Page 144 of 145 Figure 4.
