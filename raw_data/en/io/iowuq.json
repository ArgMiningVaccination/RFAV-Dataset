Every episode has been full of insight and \"ah ha\" moments for me. Many eye-opening revelations have given me optimism that her guidance will help me to change long-standing patterns. I'm excited for each new episode. Recently Started Enjoying the variety of topics and presenters. So many to catch up on. Love JJ I have started listening to JJ since 2016 and love her content. I'm not only a listener but my husband and I also went to a event. It was amazing learned so much and JJ is just a natural in teaching us about all spiritual purpose and energy. I love always re-listening to her podcast when I have questions of certain things because listening allows me to take away different info I didn't take the first time. Thank you JJ for the amazing information you provide. "}
