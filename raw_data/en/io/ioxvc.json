We are exposed to them everyday through junk and processed foods, food additives, chemicals and pollution. These toxins can negatively impact the body, lowering our immune system and causing symptoms such as body pain, fever and tiredness. Fortunately, there are many ways the body can be detoxified, one of which is the ancient healing art of acupressure. Acupressure is the technique of applying pressure to key healing points in the body and stimulating the body's natural self-healing capabilities. Also known as reflexology or zone therapy, acupressure can be used to stimulate the flow of Qi or \"healing energy\" through vital body organs involved in detoxification, such as the liver, kidney, colon, lungs and skin. It can also be used to improve bladder function to make it more effective in eliminating toxins and other unwanted substances from the body. Best acupressure points for detoxification Flush out those unwanted toxins and improve your body functions by identifying and stimulating these recommended acupressure points: Great Rushing. On the lower part of the webbing between your big toe and your second toe is the Great Rushing point. This point is connected to the liver, the most important detoxifying organ. By alternately stimulating this point on both feet, you can aid in regulating and refreshing your liver. It can also be used to alleviate pain relating to menstrual cramps, headaches, and your lower back. (Related: Pain relief with acupressure. Relieving 10 common body aches and pains.)
