Our skin shows years of happiness, sadness, love, despair, hope, helplessness, blessings and lessons - as well as other lifestyle factors such as diet, lack of sleep and sun exposure. But did you know where you are having troubles on your skin can correlate to other health issues? The several thousand-year-old ancient study of Facial Mapping assigns certain bodily organs and systems to areas of the face. Problems in these areas may indicate what ailments or stressors may be going on in the body. In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Qi, or energy, travels to meridians on our face that correspond to our various organs. This facial mapping allows us to look past the surface of the skin and get to the root of the imbalances that may be impacting our health. Below, we'll dig a little deeper into a few areas where skin ailments can occur, and the offer some recommendations on how to tame them. Forehead According to Chinese Medicine, breakouts, redness, or other irritation on any area above the eyebrows is linked to some areas of the digestive system, including the small intestine and bladder. Cutting down on drinking alcohol, smoking, and rich or processed foods can help reduce inflammation on the skin here. For a more immediate relief from tummy troubles, give [Allevia Natural Elixir](https://www.sourcevital.com/collections/natural-elixirs/products/headache-digestion) a try. This aromatic blend of oils known for comforting upset stomachs includes peppermint, lemon, and vanilla to encourage balance, and instantly uplift the spirit. As a bonus, this blend is also great for a pounding head. We recommend applying 4-5 drops around the temples and back of the neck to soothe an upset stomach. You can also add a few drops in your hands, cup them close to the face and take a series of long deep breathes. Eyebrows Suffering a breakout between your brows? This space can correspond to the liver. Our liver is essential in detoxification, so a poor diet, lack of sleep, or excess drinking or smoking can show up here in the form of lines or breakouts. Getting a good night's rest, cutting back on alcohol or caffeine, and exercising more may help to support a healthy liver, therefor potentially improving the appearance of your skin this area. [Renew Bath & Body Oil](https://www.sourcevital.com/collections/bath-body-oils/products/renew-bath-body-oil) is also an ideal companion to these healthy lifestyle choices as it will further increase the feeling of detoxification if you are feeling a bit sluggish or feeling imbalanced. Our Renew essential oil blend of Rosemary, Cinnamon, and Patchouli are very stimulating to the system and can help support the body's natural processes of elimination to purge toxins and waste. Try rubbing Renew Bath & Body Oil directly to your abdomen anytime you've overindulged for feel like you're in need of some detox. Then either go about your day. When the time allows, after applying to the skin try taking a nice relaxing bath - just be mindful not to use water that is too hot, as it can dehydrate your skin. Undereye Area Skin issues in the undereye area can be related to the kidneys, and more specifically, your bodily fluids. Darkness, lines, or puffiness under the eyes can be due to dehydration, poor elimination, or stress. Upping your water intake is crucial, adding exercise to your routine, and having your blood pressure checked frequently may help to improve the conditions that are stressing your kidneys and causing dark, puffy undereye ailments. Topically, we recommend incorporating an eye cream into your skincare routine if you haven't already. Our [Cucumber Rose Eye Cream](https://www.sourcevital.com/collections/eye-care/products/cucumber-rose-eye-cream) is formulated specifically to improve the look of fatigue, puffiness, and dark circles, thanks to natural extracts derived from Coffee, Arnica Flower, and Organic Prickly Pear Oil. For added benefit, consider keeping your eye cream in the fridge, applying liberally and then using the small end of a [jade facial roller](https://www.sourcevital.com/collections/skin-care-tools/products/jade-facial-roller) to gently massage the skin beneath the eyes. The cold temperature helps to shrink blood vessels, while the facial roller smooths out the look of fine lines and puffiness. Nose Your nose is most closely associated with the heart. Breakouts in this area may show up as blackheads, excess oiliness, or redness. Cutting back on spicier foods, reducing salt and meat intake, and replacing them with healthier alternatives, such as more vegetables and fruits, can help reduce inflammation in the nasal area. Additionally, you can consider doing some heart chakra opening exercises such as [cow pose](https://www.yogajournal.com/poses/types/chest-openers) or simply rolling your shoulders back, lifting your chest and taking some deep breaths. Our favorite skin care line of defense to fight blackheads is [Aromatic Emulsion Pure](https://www.sourcevital.com/collections/facial-toners/products/aromatic-emulsion-pure). This concentrated toner essence is a combination of purified water, and natural essential oils that work together to help purify the pores from dirt and grime build up and diminish the appearance of blackheads and other skin congestion. After cleansing skin, either massage a few drops directly into areas of congestion or soak a cotton ball and press on the affected area. Regular use will help keep the skin clean and looking clear. Cheeks Our cheeks can indicate issues in a few different areas, such as the stomach as well as the lungs. Redness in this area may indicate an inflamed stomach, while breakouts may imply weakened lungs or allergies. Reducing sugar, junk foods, and alcohol can help improve stomach functions, while performing deep breathing exercises will help to strengthen the lungs. To assist in improving your breathing practice, our portable [Respiratory Inhaler](https://www.sourcevital.com/collections/aromatherapy-on-the-go/products/respiratory-aromatherapy-inhaler) is a convenient tool that not only smells great but can promote the focus and relaxation needed to get deeper, cleansing breaths. Eucalyptus, Pine, Peppermint and Thyme essential oils can help kick start your body's natural immune response as well as promote a feeling of opened lungs. Jawline Our chin area can be directly linked to the reproductive system and hormones. Stress, the menstrual cycle, as well as hormonal imbalances in the body can show up as painful, cystic acne, redness, or irritation. Getting your hormone levels checked can be important to obtaining balance, as well as looking for ways to promote self-care to reduce your overall stress level. Avoiding using harsh skincare products is also crucial, so seek out more gentle formulations. A mild cleanser such as our [Geranium Facial Cleanser ](https://www.sourcevital.com/collections/facial-cleansers/products/geranium-cleanser)will help reduce further irritation, and Geranium essential oil is regarded for its affinity to support female hormones. A great way to improve the look of breakouts along the jawline is masking. The [Active Silt Mask](https://www.sourcevital.com/collections/facial-masks/products/silt-mask) is especially good at caring for hormonal breakouts - just be aware, like the name says, it is active. You may experience some purging the first few times as your skin works to expel impurities. Some Additional Tips - If you are experiencing breakouts regularly, your pillowcase may be the culprit. Ensure you are washing regularly, and never wear makeup to bed. - Make it a habit to cleanse your face twice daily. For those times when you are too tired to make it to the sink, leave [Micellar Cleansing Water](https://www.sourcevital.com/collections/facial-cleansers/products/micellar-cleansing-water)and some cotton pads on your nightstand, for an easy, non-rise solution to washing your face prior to drifting off to dreamland - just try to do this sparingly as nothing work as well as cleansing with water and a sponge or wash cloth. - Cleanse makeup brushes and other facial tools (such as rollers or sponges) regularly to avoid a buildup of bacteria, which can transfer to your face. And speaking of makeup, check expiration dates on products, and throw away any products that have changed in smell, texture or that you've had for more than a year.
