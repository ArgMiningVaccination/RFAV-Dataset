MATERIAL AND ENERGY BALANCE Syllabus Material and Energy balance: Facility as an energy system, Methods for preparing process flow, Material and energy balance diagrams. Material quantities, as they pass through processing operations, can be described by materialbalances. Such balances are statements on the conservation of mass. Similarly, energy quanti-ties can be described by energy balances, which are statements on the conservation of energy.If there is no accumulation, what goes into a process must come out. This is true for batch oper-ation. It is equally true for continuous operation over any chosen time interval. Material and energy balances are very important in an industry. Material balances are fun- damental to the control of processing, particularly in the control of yields of the products. Thefirst material balances are determined in the exploratory stages of a new process, improved dur-ing pilot plant experiments when the process is being planned and tested, checked out when theplant is commissioned and then refined and maintained as a control instrument as productioncontinues. When any changes occur in the process, the material balances need to be determinedagain. The increasing cost of energy has caused the industries to examine means of reducing ener- gy consumption in processing. Energy balances are used in the examination of the variousstages of a process, over the whole process and even extending over the total production sys-tem from the raw material to the finished product. Material and energy balances can be simple, at times they can be very complicated, but the basic approach is general. Experience in working with the simpler systems such as individualunit operations will develop the facility to extend the methods to the more complicated situa-tions, which do arise. The increasing availability of computers has meant that very complexmass and energy balances can be set up and manipulated quite readily and therefore used ineveryday process management to maximise product yields and minimise costs. 4.1 Basic Principles If the unit operation, whatever its natureis seen as a whole it may be representeddiagrammatically as a box, as shown inFigure. 4. 1. The mass and energy goinginto the box must balance with the massand energy coming out. Figure 4.1: Mass and Energy BalanceThe law of conservation of mass leads to what is called a mass or a material balance. Mass In = Mass Out + Mass StoredRaw Materials = Products + Wastes + Stored Materials. m R= mP+ mW+ mS (where (sigma) denotes the sum of mR= mR1+ mS1+ mS2+ mS3 = Total Stored Products. If there are no chemical changes occurring in the plant, the law of conservation of mass will apply also to each component, so that for component A: mAin entering materials = mAin the exit materials + mAstored in plant. For example, in a plant that is producing sugar, if the total quantity of sugar going into the plant is not equalled by the total of the purified sugar and the sugar in the waste liquors, then there issomething wrong. Sugar is either being burned (chemically changed) or accumulating in theplant or else it is going unnoticed down the drain somewhere. In this case: M A= (m AP+ m AW+ m AU) where mAUis the unknown loss and needs to be identified. So the material balance is now: Raw Materials = Products + Waste Products + Stored Products + Losses where Losses are the unidentified materials. Just as mass is conserved, so is energy conserved in food-processing operations. The ener- gy coming into a unit operation can be balanced with the energy coming out and the energy stored. Energy In = Energy Out + Energy Stored E R= EP+ EW+ E P1+ E P2+ E P3+ ....... = Total Energy Leaving Products EW= E W1+ E W2+ E W3+ ... = Total Energy Leaving with Waste Materials EL= E L1+ E L2+ E L3+ ....... = Total Energy Lost Surroundings ES= E S1+ E S2+ E S3+ ....... = Total Energy Stored4. Material and Energy Balance 80 Bureau of Energy EfficiencyEnergy balances are often complicated because forms of energy can be interconverted, for example mechanical energy to heat energy, but overall the quantities must balance. 4.2 The Sankey Diagram and its Use The Sankey diagram is very useful toolto represent an entire input and outputenergy flow in any energy equipment orsystem such as boiler, fired heaters, fur-naces after carrying out energy balancecalculation. This diagram representsvisually various outputs and losses sothat energy managers can focus on find-ing improvements in a prioritized man-ner. Example: The Figure 4.2 shows a Sankey diagram for a reheating furnace. From the Figure 4.2, it is clear thatexhaust flue gas losses are a key area forpriority attention. Since the furnaces operate at high temperatures, the exhaust gases leave at high tempera- tures resulting in poor efficiency. Hence a heat recovery device such as air preheater has to benecessarily part of the system. The lower the exhaust temperature, higher is the furnace effi-ciency. 4.3 Material Balances The first step is to look at the three basic categories: materials in, materials out and materialsstored. Then the materials in each category have to be considered whether they are to be treat-ed as a whole, a gross mass balance, or whether various constituents should be treated sepa-rately and if so what constituents. To take a simple example, it might be to take dry solids asopposed to total material; this really means separating the two groups of constituents, non-waterand water. More complete dissection can separate out chemical types such as minerals, or chem-ical elements such as carbon. The choice and the detail depend on the reasons for making thebalance and on the information that is required. A major factor in industry is, of course, thevalue of the materials and so expensive raw materials are more likely to be considered thancheaper ones, and products than waste materials. Basis and Units Having decided which constituents need consideration, the basis for the calculations has to be decided. This might be some mass of raw material entering the process in a batch system, orsome mass per hour in a continuous process. It could be: some mass of a particular predomi-nant constituent, for example mass balances in a bakery might be all related to 100 kg of flourentering; or some unchanging constituent, such as in combustion calculations with air where it4. Material and Energy Balance 81 Bureau of Energy Efficiency Figure 4.2: Energy Balance for a Reheating Furnaceis helpful to relate everything to the inert nitrogen component; or carbon added in the nutrients in a fermentation system because the essential energy relationships of the growing micro-organ-isms are related to the combined carbon in the feed; or the essentially inert non-oil constituentsof the oilseeds in an oil-extraction process. Sometimes it is unimportant what basis is chosenand in such cases a convenient quantity such as the total raw materials into one batch or passedin per hour to a continuous process are often selected. Having selected the basis, then the unitsmay be chosen such as mass, or concentrations which can be by weight or can be molar if reac-tions are important. 4.3.1 Total mass and composition Material balances can be based on total mass, mass of dry solids, or mass of particular compo- nents, for example protein. Example: Constituent balance Skim milk is prepared by the removal of some of the fat from whole milk. This skim milk is found to contain 90.5% water, 3.5% protein, 5.1% carbohydrate, 0.1% fat and 0.8% ash. If theoriginal milk contained 4.5% fat, calculate its composition assuming that fat only was removedto make the skim milk and that there are no losses in processing. Basis: 100 kg of skim milk. This contains, therefore, 0.1 kg of fat. Let the fat which was removed from it to make skim milk be x kg. Total original fat =(x + 0.1)kg Total original mass = (100 + x) kg and as it is known that the original fat content was 4.5% so (x + 0.1) / (100 + x) = 0.045 where = x + 0.1 = 0.045(100 + x) x = 4.6 kg So the composition of the whole milk is then fat = 4.5%, water = 90.5/104.6 = 86.5 %, protein = 3.5/104.6 = 3.3 %, carbohydrate= 5.1/104.6 = 4.9% and ash = 0.8% Concentrations Concentrations can be expressed in many ways: weight/ weight (w/w), weight/volume (w/v),molar concentration (M), mole fraction. The weight/weight concentration is the weight of thesolute divided by the total weight of the solution and this is the fractional form of the percent-age composition by weight. The weight volume concentration is the weight of solute in the totalvolume of the solution. The molar concentration is the number of molecular weights of thesolute expressed in kg in 1 m 3of the solution. The mole fraction is the ratio of the number of moles of the solute to the total number of moles of all species present in the solution. Noticethat in process engineering, it is usual to consider kg moles and in this chapter the term molemeans a mass of the material equal to its molecular weight in kilograms. In this chapter per-centage signifies percentage by weight (w/w) unless otherwise specified.4. Material and Energy Balance 82 Bureau of Energy Efficiency4. Material and Energy Balance 83 Bureau of Energy EfficiencyExample:Concentrations A solution of common salt in water is prepared by adding 20 kg of salt to 100 kg of water, to make a liquid of density 1323 kg/m3. Calculate the concentration of salt in this solution as a (a) weight fraction, (b) weight/volume fraction, (c) mole fraction, (d) molal concentration. (a) Weight fraction:20 / (100 + 20) = 0.167: % weight / weight = 16.7%(b) Weight/volume: A density of 1323kg/m 3means that lm3of solution 1323kg, but 1323kg of salt solution contains(20 x 1323 kg of salt) / (100 + 20) = 220.5 kg salt / m 3 1 m3solution contains 220.5 kg salt. Weight/volume fraction = 220.5 / 1000 = 0.2205 And so weight / volume = 22.1% c) Moles of water = 100 / 18 = 5.56 Moles of salt = 20 / 58.5 = 0.34 Mole fraction of salt = 0.34 / (5.56 + 0.34) = 0.058 d) The molar concentration (M) is 220.5/58.5 = 3.77 moles in m3 Note that the mole fraction can be approximated by the (moles of salt/moles of water) as thenumber of moles of water are dominant, that is the mole fraction is close to 0.34 / 5.56 = 0.061.As the solution becomes more dilute, this approximation improves and generally for dilute solu-tions the mole fraction of solute is a close to the moles of solute / moles of sol-vent. In solid / liquid mixtures of all these methods can be used but in solid mixtures the con- centrations are normally expressed as simple weight fractions. With gases, concentrations are primarily measured in weight concentrations per unit vol- ume, or as partial pressures. These can be related through the gas laws. Using the gas law in theform: pV = n RT where p is the pressure, V the volume, n the number of moles, T the absolute temperature, and R the gas constant which is equal to 0.08206 m 3atm / mole K, the molar concentration of a gas is then n / V = p/RT and the weight concentration is then nM/V where M is the molecular weight of the gas.The SI unit of pressure is the N/m 2called the Pascal (Pa). As this is of inconvenient size for many purposes, standard atmospheres (atm) are often used as pressure units, the conversion being 1 atm = 1.013 x 105Pa, or very nearly 1 atm = 100 kPa.Example: Air Composition If air consists of 77% by weight of nitrogen and 23% by weight of oxygen calculate: (a) the mean molecular weight of air, (b) the mole fraction of oxygen,(c) the concentration of oxygen in mole/m 3and kg/m3if the total pressure is 1.5 atmospheres and the temperature is 25 \u00b0C. (a) Taking the basis of 100 kg of air: it contains 77/28 moles of N2and 23/32 moles of O 2 Total of moles = 2.75 + 0.72 = 3.47 moles. So mean molecular weight of air = 100 / 3.47 = 28.8Mean molecular weight of air = 28.8 b) The mole fraction of oxygen = 0.72 / (2.75 + 0.72) = 0.72 / 3.47 = 0.21 Mole fraction of oxygen = 0.21 (c) In the gas equation, where n is the number of moles present: the value of R is 0.08206 m 3 atm/mole K and at a temperature of 25 \u00b0C = 25 + 273 = 298 K, and where V= 1 m3 pV = nRTand so, 1.5 x 1 = n x 0.08206 x 298 n = 0.061 mole/m 3 weight of air = n x mean molecular weight = 0.061 x 28.8 = 1.76 kg / m3 and of this 23% is oxygen, so weight of oxygen = 0.23 x 1.76 = 0.4 kg in 1 m3 Concentration of oxygen = 0.4kg/m3 or 0.4 / 32 = 0.013 mole / m3 When a gas is dissolved in a liquid, the mole fraction of the gas in the liquid can be determined by first calculating the number of moles of gas using the gas laws, treating the volume as thevolume of the liquid, and then calculating the number of moles of liquid directly. Example: Gas composition In the carbonation of a soft drink, the total quantity of carbon dioxide required is the equivalent of 3 volumes of gas to one volume of water at 0 \u00b0C and atmospheric pressure. Calculate (a) themass fraction and (b) the mole fraction of the CO 2in the drink, ignoring all components other than CO 2and water. Basis 1 m3of water = 1000 kg V olume of carbon dioxide added = 3 m3 From the gas equation, pV = nRT1 x 3 = n x 0.08206 x 273n = 0.134 mole.Molecular weight of carbon dioxide = 444. Material and Energy Balance 84 Bureau of Energy EfficiencyAnd so weight of carbon dioxide added = 0.134 x 44 = 5.9 kg (a) Mass fraction of carbon dioxide in drink = 5.9 / (1000 + 5.9) = 5.9 x 10-3 (b) Mole fraction of carbon dioxide in drink = 0.134 / (1000/18 + 0.134) = 2.41 x 10-3 4.3.2 Types of Process Situations Continuous Processes In continuous processes, time also enters into consideration and the balances are related to unittime. Thus in considering a continuous centrifuge separating whole milk into skim milk andcream, if the material holdup in the centrifuge is constant both in mass and in composition, thenthe quantities of the components entering and leaving in the different streams in unit time areconstant and a mass balance can be written on this basis. Such an analysis assumes that theprocess is in a steady state, that is flows and quantities held up in vessels do not change withtime. Example: Balance across equipment in continuous centrifuging of milk If 35,000kg of whole milk containing 4% fat is to be separated in a 6 hour period into skim milk with 0.45% fat and cream with 45% fat, what are the flow rates of the two output streams froma continuous centrifuge which accomplishes this separation?Basis 1 hour's flow of whole milk Mass in Total mass = 35000/6 = 5833 kg. Fat = 5833 x 0.04 = 233 kg.And so Water plus solids-not-fat = 5600 kg. Mass out Let the mass of cream be x kg then its total fat content is 0.45x. The mass of skim milk is (5833 - x) and its total fat content is 0.0045 (5833 - x) Material balance on fat: Fat in = Fat out 5833 x 0.04 = 0.0045(5833 - x) + 0.45x. and so x = 465 kg. So that the flow of cream is 465 kg / hr and skim milk (5833 - 465) = 5368 kg/hrThe time unit has to be considered carefully in continuous processes as normally such process- es operate continuously for only part of the total factory time. Usually there are three periods,start up, continuous processing (so-called steady state) and close down, and it is important todecide what material balance is being studied. Also the time interval over which any measure-ments are taken must be long enough to allow for any slight periodic or chance variation. In some instances a reaction takes place and the material balances have to be adjusted accordingly. Chemical changes can take place during a process, for example bacteria may bedestroyed during heat processing, sugars may combine with amino acids, fats may be hydrol-ysed and these affect details of the material balance. The total mass of the system will remain4. Material and Energy Balance 85 Bureau of Energy Efficiency4. Material and Energy Balance 86 Bureau of Energy Efficiencythe same but the constituent parts may change, for example in browning the sugars may reduce but browning compounds will increase. Blending Another class of situations which arise are blending problems in which various ingredients are combined in such proportions as to give a product of some desired composition. Complicatedexamples, in which an optimum or best achievable composition must be sought, need quiteelaborate calculation methods, such as linear programming, but simple examples can be solvedby straightforward mass balances. Drying In setting up a material balance for a process a series of equations can be written for the vari- ous individual components and for the process as a whole. In some cases where groups of mate-rials maintain constant ratios, then the equations can include such groups rather than their indi-vidual constituents. For example in drying vegetables the carbohydrates, minerals, proteins etc.,can be grouped together as 'dry solids', and then only dry solids and water need be taken,through the material balance. Example: Drying Yield Potatoes are dried from 14% total solids to 93% total solids. What is the product yield from each 1000 kg of raw potatoes assuming that 8% by weight of the original potatoes is lost in peeling. Basis 1000kg potato enteringAs 8% of potatoes are lost in peeling, potatoes to drying are 920 kg, solids 129 kgMass in (kg) Mass out (kg) Potato solids 140 kg Dried product 92Water 860 kg Potato solids 140 x (92/100) =129 kg Associated water 10 kgTotal product 139 kgLossesPeelings-potato Solids 11 kgWater 69 kg Water evaporated 781 kgTotal losses 861 kgTotal 1000 kg Product yield = 139/1000=14% Often it is important to be able to follow particular constituents of the raw material through a process. This is just a matter of calculating each constituent.4. Material and Energy Balance 87 Bureau of Energy Efficiency4.4 Energy Balances Energy takes many forms, such as heat, kinetic energy, chemical energy, potential energy but because of interconversions it is not always easy to isolate separate constituents of energy bal-ances. However, under some circumstances certain aspects predominate. In many heat balancesin which other forms of energy are insignificant; in some chemical situations mechanical ener-gy is insignificant and in some mechanical energy situations, as in the flow of fluids in pipes,the frictional losses appear as heat but the details of the heating need not be considered. We areseldom concerned with internal energies. Therefore practical applications of energy balances tend to focus on particular dominant aspects and so a heat balance, for example, can be a useful description of important cost andquality aspects of process situation. When unfamiliar with the relative magnitudes of the vari-ous forms of energy entering into a particular processing situation, it is wise to put them alldown. Then after some preliminary calculations, the important ones emerge and other minorones can be lumped together or even ignored without introducing substantial errors. With expe-rience, the obviously minor ones can perhaps be left out completely though this always raisesthe possibility of error. Energy balances can be calculated on the basis of external energy used per kilogram of product, or raw material processed, or on dry solids or some key component. The energy con-sumed in food production includes direct energy which is fuel and electricity used on the farm,and in transport and in factories, and in storage, selling, etc.; and indirect energy which is usedto actually build the machines, to make the packaging, to produce the electricity and the oil andso on. Food itself is a major energy source, and energy balances can be determined for animalor human feeding; food energy input can be balanced against outputs in heat and mechanicalenergy and chemical synthesis. In the SI system there is only one energy unit, the joule. However, kilocalories are still used by some nutritionists and British thermal units (Btu) in some heat-balance work. The two applications used in this chapter are heat balances, which are the basis for heat transfer, and the energy balances used in analysing fluid flow. Heat Balances The most common important energy form is heat energy and the conservation of this can be illustrated by considering operations such as heating and drying. In these, enthalpy (total heat)is conserved and as with the mass balances so enthalpy balances can be written round the var-ious items of equipment. or process stages, or round the whole plant, and it is assumed that noappreciable heat is converted to other forms of energy such as work. Enthalpy (H) is always referred to some reference level or datum, so that the quantities are rel- ative to this datum. Working out energy balances is then just a matter of considering the vari-ous quantities of materials involved, their specific heats, and their changes in temperature orstate (as quite frequently latent heats arising from phase changes are encountered). Figure 4.3illustrates the heat balance.4. Material and Energy Balance 88 Bureau of Energy EfficiencyHeat is absorbed or evolved by some reactions in processing but usually the quantities are small when compared with the other forms of energy entering into food processing such as sensibleheat and latent heat. Latent heat is the heat required to change, at constant temperature, thephysical state of materials from solid to liquid, liquid to gas, or solid to gas. Sensible heat is thatheat which when added or subtracted from materials changes their temperature and thus can besensed. The units of specific heat are J/kg K and sensible heat change is calculated by multi-plying the mass by the specific heat by the change in temperature, (m x c x T). The units of latent heat are J/kg and total latent heat change is calculated by multiplying the mass of thematerial, which changes its phase by the latent heat. Having determined those factors that aresignificant in the overall energy balance, the simplified heat balance can then be used with con-fidence in industrial energy studies. Such calculations can be quite simple and straightforwardbut they give a quantitative feeling for the situation and can be of great use in design of equip-ment and process. Example: Dryer heat balance A textile dryer is found to consume 4 m 3/hr of natural gas with a calorific value of 800 kJ/mole. If the throughput of the dryer is 60 kg of wet cloth per hour, drying it from 55% moisture to 10% moisture, estimate the overall thermal efficiency of the dryer taking into account the latentheat of evaporation only. 60 kg of wet cloth contains 60 x 0.55 kg water = 33 kg moisture and 60 x (1-0.55) = 27 kg bone dry cloth. As the final product contains 10% moisture, the moisture in the product is 27/9 = 3 kg And so Moisture removed / hr = 33 - 3 = 30 kg/hr Latent heat of evaporation = 2257 kJ/KHeat necessary to supply = 30 x 2257 = 6.8 x 10 4kJ/hr Assuming the natural gas to be at standard temperature and pressure at which 1 mole occupies22.4 litresFigure 4.3: Heat Balance4. Material and Energy Balance 89 Bureau of Energy EfficiencyRate of flow of natural gas = 4 m3/hr = (4 x 1000)/22.4 = 179 moles/hr Heat available from combustion = 179 x 800 = 14.3 x 104kJ/hr Approximate thermal efficiency of dryer = heat needed / heat used = 6.8 x 104/ 14.3 x 104= 48% To evaluate this efficiency more completely it would be necessary to take into account the sensible heat of the dry cloth and the moisture, and the changes in temperature and humidity of the combustion air, which would be combined with the natural gas. However, as the latent heatof evaporation is the dominant term the above calculation gives a quick estimate and shows howa simple energy balance can give useful information. Similarly energy balances can be carried out over thermal processing operations, and indeed any processing operations in which heat or other forms of energy are used. Example: Autoclave heat balance in canning An autoclave contains 1000 cans of pea soup. It is heated to an overall temperature of 100 \u00b0C. If the cans are to be cooled to 40 \u00b0C before leaving the autoclave, how much cooling water isrequired if it enters at 15 \u00b0C and leaves at 35 \u00b0C? The specific heats of the pea soup and the can metal are respectively 4.1 kJ/ kg \u00b0C and 0.50 kJ/ kg \u00b0C. The weight of each can is 60g and it contains 0.45 kg of pea soup. Assume thatthe heat content of the autoclave walls above 40 \u00b0C is 1.6 x 10 4kJ and that there is no heat loss through the walls. Let w = the weight of cooling water required; and the datum temperature be 40\u00b0C, the tem- perature of the cans leaving the autoclave. Heat entering Heat in cans = weight of cans x specific heat x temperature above datum = 1000 x 0.06 x 0.50 x (100-40) kJ = 1.8 x 103kJ Heat in can contents = weight pea soup x specific heat x temperature above datum = 1000 x 0.45 x 4.1 x (100 - 40) = 1.1 x 105kJ Heat in water = weight of water x specific heat x temperature above datum= w x 4.186 x (15-40) = -104.6 w kJ. Heat leaving Heat in cans = 1000 x 0.06 x 0.50 x (40-40) (cans leave at datum temperature) = 0 Heat in can contents = 1000 x 0.45 x 4.1 x (40-40) = 0Heat in water = w x 4.186 x (35-40) = -20.9 wHEAT-ENERGY BALANCE OF COOLING PROCESS; AS DATUM LINE Heat Entering (kJ) Heat Leaving (kJ) Heat in cans 1800 Heat in cans 0 Heat in can contents 11000 Heat in can contents 0Heat in autoclave wall 16000 Heat in autoclave wall 0Heat in water -104.6 w Heat in water -20.9 WTotal heat entering 127.800 - 104.6 w Total heat leaving -20.9 W Total heat entering = Total heat leaving127800 - 104.6 w = -20.9 w w = 1527 kg Amount of cooling water required = 1527 kg. Other Forms of Energy Motor power is usually derived, in factories, from electrical energy but it can be produced from steam engines or waterpower. The electrical energy input can be measured by a suitablewattmeter, and the power used in the drive estimated. There are always losses from the motorsdue to heating, friction and windage; the motor efficiency, which can normally be obtained fromthe motor manufacturer, expresses the proportion (usually as a percentage) of the electricalinput energy, which emerges usefully at the motor shaft and so is available. When considering movement, whether of fluids in pumping, of solids in solids handling, or of foodstuffs in mixers. the energy input is largely mechanical. The flow situations can beanalysed by recognising the conservation of total energy whether as energy of motion, or poten-tial energy such as pressure energy, or energy lost in friction. Similarly, chemical energyreleased in combustion can be calculated from the heats of combustion of the fuels and theirrates of consumption. Eventually energy emerges in the form of heat and its quantity can beestimated by summing the various sources. EXAMPLE Refrigeration load It is desired to freeze 10,000 loaves of bread each weighing 0.75 kg from an initial room tem- perature of 18\u00b0C to a final temperature of -18\u00b0C. The bread-freezing operation is to be carriedout in an air-blast freezing tunnel. It is found that the fan motors are rated at a total of 80 horse-power and measurements suggest that they are operating at around 90% of their rating, underwhich conditions their manufacturer's data claims a motor efficiency of 86%. If 1 ton of refrig-eration is 3.52 kW, estimate the maximum refrigeration load imposed by this freezing installa-tion assuming (a) that fans and motors are all within the freezing tunnel insulation and (b) thefans but not their motors are in the tunnel. The heat-loss rate from the tunnel to the ambient airhas been found to be 6.3 kW. Extraction rate from freezing bread (maximum) = 104 kWFan rated horsepower = 80Now 0.746 kW = 1 horsepower and the motor is operating at 90% of rating,And so (fan + motor) power = (80 x 0.9) x 0.746 = 53.7 kW(a) With motors + fans in tunnel4. Material and Energy Balance 90 Bureau of Energy EfficiencyHeat load from fans + motors = 53.7 kW Heat load from ambient = 6.3 kWTotal heat load = (104 + 53.7 + 6.3) kW = 164 kW = 46 tons of refrigeration (b) With motors outside, the motor inefficiency = (1- 0.86) does not impose a load on the refrigeration Total heat load = (104 + [0.86 x 53.7] + 6.3) = 156 kW= 44.5 tons of refrigeration In practice, material and energy balances are often combined as the same stoichiometric infor- mation is needed for both. Summary 1. Material and energy balances can be worked out quantitatively knowing the amounts of materials entering into a process, and the nature of the process. 2. Material and energy balances take the basic form Content of inputs = content of products + wastes/losses + changes in stored materials. 3. In continuous processes, a time balance must be established. 4. Energy includes heat energy (enthalpy), potential energy (energy of pressure or position), kinetic energy, work energy, chemical energy. It is the sum over all of these that is con-served. 5. Enthalpy balances, considering only heat are useful in many processing situations. The objective of M&E balance is to assess the input, conversion efficiency, output and losses. A M&E balance, used in conjunction with diagnosis, is a powerful tool for establish-ing the basis for improvements and potential savings. 4.5 Method for Preparing Process Flow Chart The identification and drawing up a unitoperation/process is prerequisite for ener-gy and material balance. The procedurefor drawing up the process flow diagramsis explained below. Flow charts are schematic representa- tion of the production process, involvingvarious input resources, conversion stepsand output and recycle streams. Theprocess flow may be constructed stepwisei.e. by identifying the inputs / output /wastes at each stage of the process, asshown in the Figure 4.4. 4. Material and Energy Balance 91 Bureau of Energy EfficiencyFigure 4.4: Process Flow Chart4. Material and Energy Balance 92 Bureau of Energy EfficiencyInputs of the process could include raw materials, water, steam, energy (electricity, etc); Process Steps should be sequentially drawn from raw material to finished product. Intermediates and any other byproduct should also be represented. The operating process para- meters such as temperature, pressure, % concentration, etc. should be represented. The flow rateof various streams should also be represented in appropriate units like m 3/h or kg/h. In case of batch process the total cycle time should be included. Wastes / by products could include solids, water, chemicals, energy etc. For each process steps (unit operation) as well as for an entire plant, energy and mass balance diagram should be drawn. Output of the process is the final product produced in the plant. Example: -Process flow diagram - raw material to finished product: Papermaking is a high energy consuming process. A typical process flow with electrical & thermal energy flow for an integrated waste paper based mill is given in Figure 4.5 4.6 Facility as an Energy System There are various energy systems/utility services provides the required type of secondary ener-gy such as steam, compressed air, chilled water etc to the production facility in the manufac-turing plant. A typical plant energy system is shown in Figure 4.6. Although various forms of4. Material and Energy Balance 93 Bureau of Energy Efficiencyenergy such as coal, oil, electricity etc enters the facility and does its work or heating, the out- going energy is usually in the form of low temperature heat. The energy usage in the overall plant can be split up into various forms such as: \u007f Electrical energy, which is usually purchased as HT and converted into LT supply for end use. \u007f Some plants generate their own electricity using DG sets or captive power plants. \u007f Fuels such as furnace oil, coal are purchased and then converted into steam or electrici- ty. \u007f Boiler generates steam for heating and drying demand\u007f Cooling tower and cooling water supply system for cooling demand\u007f Air compressors and compressed air supply system for compressed air needs All energy/utility system can be classified into three areas like generation, distribution and utilisation for the system approach and energy analysis. A few examples for energy generation, distribution and utilization are shown below for boil- er, cooling tower and compressed air energy system. Boiler System: Boiler and its auxiliaries should be considered as a system for energy analyses. Energy manager can draw up a diagram as given in Figure 4.7 for energy and material balance and analysis.

Energy analysis andbest practices measures should be listed in all the three areas. 4.7 How to Carryout Material and Energy (M&E) Balance? Material and Energy balances are important, since they make it possible to identify and quanti-fy previously unknown losses and emissions. These balances are also useful for monitoring theimprovements made in an ongoing project, while evaluating cost benefits. Raw materials andenergy in any manufacturing activity are not only major cost components but also major sourcesof environmental pollution. Inefficient use of raw materials and energy in production process-es are reflected as wastes. Guidelines for M&E Balance \u007f For a complex production stream, it is better to first draft the overall material and energy balance. \u007f While splitting up the total system, choose, simple discrete sub-systems. The process flow diagram could be useful here. \u007f Choose the material and energy balance envelope such that, the number of streams enter- ing and leaving, is the smallest possible.Figure 4.9 Instrument Air System\u007f Always choose recycle streams (material and energy) within the envelope. \u007f The measurement units may include, time factor or production linkages.\u007f Consider a full batch as the reference in case of batch operations.\u007f It is important to include start-up and cleaning operation consumptions (of material and energy resources (M&E). \u007f Calculate the gas volumes at standard conditions.\u007f In case of shutdown losses, averaging over long periods may be necessary.\u007f Highlight losses and emissions (M&E) at part load operations if prevalent.\u007f For each stream, where applicable, indicate energy quality (pressure, temperature, enthalpy, kCal/hr, kW, Amps, V olts etc.). \u007f While preparing M&E balances, precision of analytical data, flow and energy measure- ments have to be accurate especially in case of short time span references. The material and energy (M&E) balances along the above guidelines, are required to be devel- oped at the various levels. 1. Overall M&E balance: This involves the input and output streams for complete plant. 2. Section wise M&E balances: In the sequence of process flow, material and energy bal- ances are required to be made for each section/department/cost centres. This would help to prioritize focus areas for efficiency improvement. 3. Equipment-wise M&E balances: M&E balances, for key equipment would help assess performance of equipment, which would in turn help identify and quantify energy andmaterial avoidable losses. Energy and Mass Balance Calculation Procedure: The Energy and Mass balance is a calculation procedure that basically checks if directly or indi- rectly measured energy and mass flows are in agreement with the energy and mass conserva-tion principles. This balance is of the utmost importance and is an indispensable tool for a clear under- standing of the energy and mass situation achieved in practice. In order to use it correctly, the following procedure should be used: \u007f Clearly identify the problem to be studied.\u007f Define a boundary that encloses the entire system or sub-system to be analysed. Entering and leaving mass and energy flows must be measured at the boundary. \u007f The boundary must be chosen in such a way that: a) All relevant flows must cross it, all non-relevant flows being within the boundary.4. Material and Energy Balance 96 Bureau of Energy Efficiency4. Material and Energy Balance 97 Bureau of Energy Efficiencyb) Measurements at the boundary must be possible in an easy and accurate manner. \u007f Select an appropriate test period depending on the type of process and product.\u007f Carry out the measurements.\u007f Calculate the energy and mass flow.\u007f Verify an energy and mass balance. If the balances are outside acceptable limits, then repeat the measurements. \u007f The energy release or use in endothermic and exothermic processes should be taken into consideration in the energy balance. Example/ Formula i) Energy Supplied by Combustion: Q =Fuel consumed x Gross Calorific value ii) Energy Supplied by Electricity: Q = kWh x 860 kCals Where, Q = thermal energy flow rate produced by electricity (kCals/hr) iii) Continuity Equation A 1V1= A 2V2 v1 v2 the specific volume in m3/kg and 'A' is the cross sectional area of the pipe in m2. iv) Heat addition/rejection of a fluid = mC pT where, m is the mass in kg, C pis the specific heat in kCal/kg\u00b0C, T is the difference in tem- perature in k.Example-1: Heat Balance in a Boiler A heat balance is an attempt to balance the total energy entering a system (e.g boiler) against that leaving the system in different forms. The Figure 4.10 illustrates the heat balance and dif-ferent losses occurring while generating steam. Figure 4.104. Material and Energy Balance 98 Bureau of Energy EfficiencyExample-2: Mass Balance in a Cement Plant The cement process involves gas, liquid and solid flows with heat and mass transfer, combus- tion of fuel, reactions of clinker compounds and undesired chemical reactions that include sul-phur, chlorine, and Alkalies. A typical balance is shown in the figure 4.11 (Source: Based on figure from Austrian BAT proposal 1996, Cembureau for Mass balance for production of 1 Kg cement) Example-3: Mass Balance Calculation This problem illustrates how a mass balance calculation can be used to check the results of an air pollution monitoring study. A fabric filter (bag filter) is used to remove the dust from the inlet gas stream so that outlet gas stream meets the required emission standards in cement, fer-tilizer and other chemical industries. During an air pollution monitoring study, the inlet gas stream to a bag filter is 1,69,920 m 3/hr and the dust loading is 4577 mg/m3. The outlet gas stream from the bag filter is 1,85,040 m3/hr and the dust loading is 57 mg/m3. What is the maximum quantity of ash that will have to be removed per hour from the bag filterhopper based on these test results? Figure 4.11 Figure 4.12 Conservation of Matter4. Material and Energy Balance 99 Bureau of Energy EfficiencySolution: Based on dust balance, Mass (in)= Mass (out) Inlet gas stream dust = outlet gas stream dust + Hopper Ash 1. Calculate the inlet and outlet dust quantities in kg per hour Inlet dust quantity = 169920 (m3/hr) x 4577 (mg/m3) x 57 (mg/m3) x 1/1000000 (kg/mg) = 10.6 kg/hr 2. Calculate the quantity of ash that will have to removed from the hopper per hour Hopper ash = Inlet gas dust quantity - Outlet gas dust quantity = 777.7 kg/hr - 10.6 kg/hr = 767.1 kg/hr Example-4: Material Requirement for Process Operations A scrubber is used to remove the fine material or dust from the inlet gas stream with a spray of liquid (typically water) so that outlet gas stream meets the required process or emission stan-dards. How much water must be continually added to wet scrubber shown in Figure below in order to keep the unit running? Each of the streams is identified by a number located in a diamondsymbol. Stream 1 is the recirculation liquid flow stream back to the scrubber and it is 4.54m 3/hr. The liquid being withdraw for treatment and disposal (stream 4) is 0.454 kg m3/hr. Figure 4.13 Example of Material BalanceAssume that inlet gas stream (number 2) is completely dry and the outlet stream (number 6) has 272.16 kg/hr of moisture evaporated in the scrubber. The water being added to the scrub- ber is stream number 5. Solution: Step 1. Conduct a material balance around the scrubber. 1. For Stream 6, convert from kg/hr to m3/hr to keep units consistent. The conver sion factor below applies only to pure water. Stream 6 = 272.16 kg/hr x m3/1000 kg = 0.272 m3/hr 2. Set up the material balance equation and solve for Stream 3. Input Scrubber = Output Scrubber Stream 1 + Stream 2 = Stream 3 + Stream 64.54 m 3/hr + 0 = y m3/hr + 0.272 m3/hr Stream 3 = y m3/hr = 4.27 m3/hr Step 2. Conduct a material balance around the recirculation tank. Solve for Stream 5. Input Tank = Output Tank Stream 3 + Stream 5 = Stream 1 + Stream 44.25 m 3/hr + x m3/hr = 4.54 m3/hr + m3/hr m3/hr - 4.27 m3/hr = 0.73 m3/hr If it is to calculate only the makeup water at 5, Stream 5 = Stream 4 + Stream 6 = 0.454 + 0.272 = 0.73 m3/hr One of the key steps in solving Example 4 was drawing a simple sketch of the system. This is absolutely necessary so that it is possible to conduct the material balances. Drawings are a valu-able first step when solving a wide variety of problems, even ones that appears simple. The drawing is a very useful way to summarize what we know and what we need to know. It helps visualize the solution. If the problem involves dimensional quantities (such as streamflow quantities), the dimensions should be included on the sketch. They serve as reminders ofthe need to convert the data into consistent units.4. Material and Energy Balance 100 Bureau of Energy Efficiency4.
