It is increasingly clear that drug control must become an essential element of our joint efforts to achieve peace, security and develop-ment. At the same time, we must reinforce our commit-ment to shared responsibility and the basic principles of health and human rights. The World Drug Report documents developments in global drug markets and tries to explain the factors that drive them. Its analysis of trends and emerging chal-lenges informs national and international drug and crime priorities and policies, and provides a solid foun-dation of evidence for counternarcotics interventions. Drug markets and drug use patterns change rapidly, so measures to stop them must also be quick to adapt. Thus the more comprehensive the drug data we collect and the stronger our capacity to analyse the problem, the better prepared the international community will be to respond to new challenges. Recent trends Despite increased attention to drug demand reduction in recent years, drug use continues to take a heavy toll. Globally, some 210 million people use illicit drugs each year, and almost 200,000 of them die from drugs. There continues to be an enormous unmet need for drug use prevention, treatment, care and support, particularly in developing countries. Drug use affects not only individual users, but also their families, friends, co-workers and communities. Children whose parents take drugs are themselves at greater risk of drug use and other risky behaviours. Drugs generate crime, street violence and other social problems that harm communities. In some regions, illicit drug use is contributing to the rapid spread of infectious diseases like HIV and hepatitis. Heroin consumption has stabilized in Europe and cocaine consumption has declined in North America - the most lucrative markets for these drugs. But these gains have been offset by several counter-trends: a large increase in cocaine use in Europe and South America over the last decade; the recent expansion of heroin use to Africa; and increased abuse of synthetic 'designer drugs' and prescription medications in some regions. Meanwhile, new drug use profiles are also emerging: consumption of combinations of drugs rather than just one illicit substance is becoming more common, and this increases the risk of death or serious health conse-quences. On the supply side, illicit cultivation of opium poppy and coca bush is now limited to a few countries, but heroin and cocaine production levels remain high. Although 2010 saw a significant decrease in opium pro-duction, this was largely due to a plant disease that affected opium poppies in the major growing regions of Afghanistan. Yet between 1998 and 2009, global pro-duction of opium rose almost 80 per cent, which makes the 2010 production decline less significant over the last decade. Meanwhile, the market for cocaine has not shrunk substantially, it has simply experienced geo-graphical shifts in supply and demand. Just a decade ago, the North American market for cocaine was four times larger than that of Europe, but now we are wit-nessing a complete rebalancing. Today the estimated value of the European cocaine market ($33 billion) is almost equivalent to that of the North American market ($37 billion). Drug trafficking, the critical link between supply and demand, is fuelling a global criminal enterprise valued in the hundreds of billions of dollars that poses a growing challenge to stability and security. Drug traffickers and organized criminals are forming transnational networks, sourcing drugs on one continent, trafficking them across another, and marketing them in a third. In some coun-tries and regions, the value of the illicit drug trade far exceeds the size of the legitimate economy. Given the enormous amounts of money controlled by drug traf- fickers, they have the capacity to corrupt officials. In recent years we have seen several such cases in which ministers and heads of national law enforcement agen-cies have been implicated in drug-related corruption. We are also witnessing more and more acts of violence, con-flicts and terrorist activities fuelled by drug trafficking and organized crime. A stronger multilateral response to illicit drugs In the face of such diverse and complex challenges, we must improve the performance of our global response to illicit drugs. This year is the 50th anniversary of the keystone of the international drug control system: the 1961 Single Con-vention on Narcotic Drugs. Its provisions remain sound PREFACE9and highly relevant, as does its central focus on the pro- tection of health. The international community must make more effective use of all three Drug Conventions as well as the Conventions against T ransnational Organ- ized Crime and Corruption. Mobilizing these powerful international legal instruments, together with existing law enforcement and judicial networks, can strengthen transnational cooperation in investigating and prosecut-ing drug traffickers, combating money-laundering, and identifying, freezing and confiscating criminal assets. A comprehensive and integrated approach can also help us to confront the global threat from drugs more effec-tively. We must build new partnerships. Governments and civil society must work together. States have to join forces in promoting regional cooperation. This strategy is already having some success against drugs originating in Afghanistan. The Paris Pact unites more than 50 States and international organizations to counter traffic in and consumption of Afghan opiates. Regional coun-ternarcotics information-sharing and joint cooperation initiatives like the T riangular Initiative (involving Afghanistan, the Islamic Republic of Iran and Pakistan), the Central Asian Regional Information and Coordina-tion Centre and Operation TARCET (initiative to pre-vent the smuggling of precursors to Afghanistan) have intercepted and seized tons of illicit drugs and precursor chemicals. Building on the lessons of the Paris Pact, the Group of Eight, under the leadership of the French Presidency, recently launched an initiative to create a unified response to tackle the global cocaine market. We also must ensure that supply and demand reduction efforts work together rather than in parallel. On the supply side, if we are to make real progress against heroin and cocaine, we must address illicit cultivation in a more meaningful and coordinated way. We have many tools at our disposal, including alternative livelihoods. Govern-ments and aid agencies must invest more in development, productive employment and increased security. Crop eradication can also play a role, as a national responsibil-ity with international support and assistance and in com- bination with programmes that help farmers shift to the cultivation of licit crops. We must also develop new strat-egies for preventing the diversion of chemicals that are used to make synthetic 'designer drugs' and to turn coca bush and opium poppies into cocaine and heroin. On the demand side, there is growing recognition that we must draw a line between criminals (drug traffickers) and their victims (drug users), and that treatment for drug use offers a far more effective cure than punish-ment. We are seeing progress in drug use prevention through family skills training, and more attention is being paid to comprehensive HIV prevention, treatment and care. As an essential part of demand reduction efforts, we also need to more vigorously raise public awareness about illicit drugs, and facilitate healthy and fulfilling alternatives to drug use, which must not be accepted as a way of life. Better data and analysis to enrich policy A lack of comprehensive data continues to obstruct our full understanding of the markets for illicit drugs. The gaps are more prominent in some regions, such as Africa and Asia, and also around new drugs and evolving con-sumption patterns. More comprehensive data collection allows for more and better analysis, which in turn enriches our response to the world drug challenge. I urge countries to strengthen their efforts to collect data on illicit drugs, and I encour-age donors to support those countries that need assist-ance in these efforts. If we can strengthen our research and analysis, we can better understand the drug phe-nomenon and pinpoint areas where interventions are most likely to achieve positive results. I would like to thank the teams of skilled surveyors who gather data on cultivation and production levels of illicit crops in the world's major drug-producing regions. The information they collect is of strategic importance to the efforts of both the Governments concerned and the international community to make our societies safer from drugs and organized crime. In addition, their data forms the core of this report. These brave individuals work in challenging and sometimes dangerous condi-tions. Sadly, in May 2011 a team of UNODC crop surveyors in the Plurinational State of Bolivia lost their lives while on the job. I would like to pay tribute to their courage and commitment, and dedicate this report to their memory.

In cases where countries report to UNODC without indicating the specific ATS they are referring to, the term non-specified amphetamines is used. In cases where ecstasy is referred to in enclosed brackets ('ecstasy'), the drug represents cases where the drug is sold as ecstasy (MDMA) but which may contain a substitute chemical and not MDMA. Coca paste (or coca base) - An extract of the leaves of the coca bush. Purification of coca paste yields cocaine (base and hydrochloride). Cocaine (base and salts) - Coca paste, cocaine base and cocaine hydrochloride referred to in the aggregate. Crack (cocaine) - Cocaine base obtained from cocaine hydrochloride through conversion processes to make it suitable for smoking. Heroin HCl (heroin hydrochloride) - Injectable form of heroin, sometimes referred to as 'Heroin no. 4.' Heroin no. 3 - A less refined form of heroin suitable for smoking. Opioid - A generic term applied to alkaloids from opium poppy, their synthetic analogues, and compounds syn-thesized in the body. Opiate - A subset of opioids comprised of the various products derived from the opium poppy plant including opium, morphine and heroin. Poppy straw - All parts (except the seeds) of the opium poppy, after mowing.T erms: Since there is some scientific and legal ambiguity about the distinctions between drug 'use', 'misuse' and 'abuse', this report uses the neutral terms, drug 'use' or 'consumption'. Annual prevalence refers to the total number of people of a given age range who have used a given drug at least once in the past year divided by the number of people of a given age.

About half that number are estimated to have been current drug users, that is, having used illicit drugs at least once during the past month prior to the date of assessment. While the total number of illicit drug users has increased since the late 1990s, the prevalence rates have remained largely stable, as has the number of problem drug users, 1 which is estimated at between 15 and 39 million. Cannabis is by far the most widely used illicit drug type, consumed by between 125 and 203 million people worldwide in 2009. This corresponds to an annual prev-alence rate of 2.8%-4.5%. In terms of annual prevalence, cannabis is followed by ATS (amphetamine-type stimu-lants; mainly methamphetamine, amphetamine and 1 While there is no established definition of problem drug users, they are usually defined by countries as those that regularly use illicit sub-stances and can be considered dependent, and those who inject drugs.ecstasy), opioids (including opium, heroin and prescrip- tion opioids) and cocaine. Lack of information regarding use of illicit drugs - particularly ATS - in populous countries such as China and India, as well as in emerging regions of consumption such as Africa, generate uncer-tainty when estimating the global number of users. This is reflected in the wide ranges of the estimates. While there are stable or downward trends for heroin and cocaine use in major regions of consumption, this is being offset by increases in the use of synthetic and pre-scription drugs. Non-medical use of prescription drugs is reportedly a growing health problem in a number of developed and developing countries. Moreover, in recent years, several new synthetic com- pounds have emerged in established illicit drug markets. Many of these substances are marketed as 'legal highs' and substitutes for illicit stimulant drugs such as cocaine or 'ecstasy.' T wo examples are piperazines and mephe-drone, which are not under international control. A similar development has been observed with regard to cannabis, where demand for synthetic cannabinoids Annual prevalence and number of illicit drug users at the global level, late 1990s-2009/2010 Source: UNODC estimates based on ARQ data and other official sources. 172 155149250 250272 25 25 2638 38 in % of population aged 15-64 Number of illicit drug users Number of problem drug usersPrevalence of illicit drug use in % Prevalence of problem drug use in % 14World Drug Report 2011 ('spice') has increased in some countries. Sold on the internet and in specialized shops, synthetic cannabi-noids have been referred to as 'legal alternatives' to can-nabis, as they are not under international control. The control status of these compounds differs significantly from country to country. In terms of treatment demand, the picture varies between regions. Cannabis contributes significantly to treatment demand in most regions, but it is particularly prominent in Africa and Oceania. Opiates dominate treatment demand in Europe and Asia, whereas cocaine is the main problem drug in South America. In North America, cannabis, opioids and cocaine make up similar shares of total treatment demand. ATS does not dominate any one region but makes a sizable contribution to treat-ment demand particularly in Asia and Oceania, but also in Europe and North America. In terms of the health consequences of drug use, the global average prevalence of HIV among injecting drug users is estimated at 17.9%, or equivalently, 2.8 million people who inject drugs are HIV positive. This means that nearly one in five injecting drug users is living with HIV. The prevalence of Hepatitis C among injecting drug users at the global level is estimated at 50% (range: 45.2%-55.3%), suggesting that there are 8.0 million (range: 7.2 - 8.8 million) injecting drug users world-wide who are also infected with HCV. Deaths related to or associated with the use of illicit drugs are estimated between 104,000 and 263,000 deaths each year, equiva-lent to a range of 23.1 to 58.7 deaths per one million inhabitants aged 15-64. Over half of the deaths are esti-mated to be fatal overdose cases. Production Global opium poppy cultivation amounted to some 195,700 ha in 2010, a small increase from 2009. The vast bulk - some 123,000 ha - were cultivated in Afghan-istan, where the cultivation trend remained stable. The global trend was mainly driven by increases in Myan-mar, where cultivation rose by some 20% from 2009. There was a significant reduction in percent of population age 15-64Annual prevalence of drug use at the global level, by illicit drug category, 2009-2010 Source: UNODC estimates based on ARQ data and other official sources.

The global area under coca cultivation continued to shrink to 149,1002 ha in 2010, falling by 18% from 2007 to 2010. There was also a significant decline in potential cocaine manufacture, reflecting falling cocaine production in Colombia which offset increases identi-fied in both Peru and the Plurinational State of Bolivia. While it is difficult to estimate total global ampheta- mine-type stimulants manufacture, it has spread, and more than 60 Member States from all regions of the world have reported such activity to date. The manu-facture of amphetamines-group substances is larger than that of ecstasy. Methamphetamine - which belongs to the amphetamines-group - is the most widely manu-factured ATS, with the United States of America report-ing a large number of detected illicit laboratories. Cannabis herb cultivation occurs in most countries worldwide. Although there was insufficient data availa-ble to update the global cultivation estimate, the rela-tively stable seizure trend suggests a stable level of production. Indoor cultivation of cannabis herb is still largely limited to the developed countries of North America, Europe and Oceania. Cannabis resin produc-tion estimates were not updated this year, but based on ARQ replies to UNODC, Afghanistan and Morocco were major producers. Trafficking T rafficking flows vary according to the drug type involved. The most commonly seized drug type, can-nabis herb, is often locally produced and thus, interna- 2 The figure for the Plurinational State of Bolivia was not available at the time of printing of this report. The total area under cultivation in 2010 is based on 2009 figures for Bolivia and will be revised when the 2010 figure becomes available.tional trafficking is limited. Cocaine and heroin are trafficked both intra- and inter-regionally, though con-siderable amounts are consumed quite far from the countries of cultivation and production. Most ATS-manufacture occurs in the region of consumption, whereas their precursor chemicals are trafficked inter-regionally. The long-term trends show increased seizures for all the major drug types. Between 1998 and 2009, seizures of cocaine, heroin and morphine, and cannabis almost doubled. ATS seizures more than tripled over the same period. Though it is still the most commonly seized drug, by far, the relative importance of cannabis in total illicit drug seizures has declined, rendering the other drug types - particularly ATS - increasingly prominent. Looking at recent trends, global seizures of ATS rose to a record high in 2009, driven by increases in metham- phetamine seizures. Ecstasy seizures, on the other hand, decreased. The predominant type of ATS seized varies according to region, with methamphetamine dominat-ing in Oceania, Africa, North America and much of Asia. Seizures of opiates remained stable in 2009, with the Islamic Republic of Iran and T urkey continuing to account for the largest national seizure totals. Cocaine seizures also remained largely stable, at a high level. For cannabis, seizures of cannabis herb - the most widely consumed variety - increased, whereas resin seizures decreased. For cocaine and cannabis resin, seizures are shifting away from the main consumer markets to source regions. Both North America and West and Central Europe account for declining shares of global cocaine seizures, while South America is seizing more. Similarly, cannabis resin seizures decreased significantly in Europe but increased in North Africa from 2008 to 2009. The major drug markets Opiates Global use of opiates remained largely stable in 2009. UNODC estimates that some 12 to 21 million people used opiates worldwide; some three quarters of them used heroin. In 2009, an estimated 12-14 million global heroin users consumed some 375 mt of heroin. Europe and Asia remain the key global consumption markets, and they are largely supplied by Afghan opium. In recent years, the non-medical use of various prescrip- tion opioids has become increasingly problematic in some areas of the world, particularly in North America. In the United States, many emergency room visits are now related to prescription opioid use, and this drug class is also responsible for an increasing share of treat-ment admissions in that country. -50100150200250300350 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009Index (1998 = 100) ATS Cocaine Cannabis Heroin and morphTrends in the volume of seizures, by main drug categories(index: 1998 = 100) Source: UNODC ARQ. Cocaine Heroin and morphine16World Drug Report 2011 Afghanistan accounts for 63% of the total global area under opium poppy cultivation. Cultivation there remained stable in 2010. Increases were registered in Myanmar in 2010, however, which resulted in an increasing global trend (5%). The opium yield is also increasing in Myanmar, causing the country's potential opium production to increase by some 75%. Nonetheless, global opium production dropped to 4,860 mt in 2010, from to 7,853 mt the year before. This was largely due to a drastic reduction in Afghani-stan's opium production as a result of disease in opium poppy plants. UNODC forecasts for Afghan production in 2011 predict a further small decline or at least a sta-bilization of overall opium poppy cultivation at the lower levels. If opium yield returns to the average level, opium production is likely to increase in Afghanistan in 2011. Seizures of opium and heroin appeared to stabilize in 2009, amounting to 653 mt and 76 mt, respectively. An estimated 460-480 mt of heroin were trafficked (includ-ing seizures) worldwide in 2009, of which 375 mt reached the consumers. T raffickers' use of maritime transportation and seaports has been identified as a key emerging threat. The global opiate market was valued at US$68 billion in 2009, with heroin consumers contributing US$61 billion of this. Heroin prices vary greatly. Although prices in Afghanistan increased in 2010, one gram costs less than US$4. In West and Central Europe, users pay some US$40-100 per gram, in the United States and northern Europe, US$170-200, and in Australia, the price is as high as US$230-370. While Afghan farmers only earned some US$440 million in 2010, organized crime groups in the main countries of consumption reap the largest profits. Cocaine In 2009, the annual prevalence of cocaine use was esti- mated between 0.3% and 0.5% of the world population aged 15-64, or some 14.2 to 20.5 million people in that age range. Though the lower and upper bounds of cocaine users in 2009 have widened somewhat, con-sumption remains essentially stable. Taking qualitative information into account, the actual number of cocaine users is probably closer to the lower end of the range. Despite significant declines in recent years, the largest cocaine market continues to be that of the United States, with an estimated consumption of 157 mt of cocaine, equivalent to 36% of global consumption. The second-largest cocaine market is that of Europe, notably West and Central Europe, where consumption is estimated at 123 mt. Over the last decade, the volume of cocaine consumed in Europe has doubled. In recent years, there are some signs of stabilization, though at the higher levels. Cocaine use in East Europe is limited. The area under coca cultivation declined by 18% from 2007 to 2010. Considering the past decade (2000-2010), the decrease is even larger, 33%. Global seizures of cocaine have been generally stable over the period 2006-2009, amounting to some 732 mt in 2009. Since 2006 seizures have shifted towards the source areas in South America and away from the consumer markets at the global level, late 1990s-2009/2010 Source: UNODC.17Executive Summary North America and West and Central Europe. The role of West Africa in cocaine trafficking from South America to Europe might have decreased if judged from seizures only, but there are other indications that traffickers may have changed their tactics, and the area remains vulner-able to a resurgence in trafficking of cocaine. Some coun-tries in the Asia-Pacific, with potentially large consumer markets, registered increasing cocaine seizures in 2008 and 2009. The value of the global cocaine market is lower than it was in the mid-1990s, when prices were much higher and the market in the United States was strong. In 1995, the global market was worth some US$165 billion, while in 2009, this had been reduced to just over half of that, some US$85 billion (range: US$75-US$100 bn). As with heroin, almost all the profits are reaped by traf-fickers. Amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) Global ATS use levels remained essentially stable in 2009. ATS can be divided into two main categories: Amphetamines-group (mainly amphetamine and meth-amphetamine) and ecstasy-group (MDMA and its ana-logues). UNODC estimates that the annual prevalence for amphetamines-group substances ranged between 0.3% and 1.3% in 2009, or some 14 to 57 million people aged 15-64 who had used such substances at least once in the past year. For the ecstasy-group, global annual prevalence was estimated at between 0.2% and 0.6% of the population aged 15-64, or some 11 to 28 million past-year users. The predominant substance used varies between and within regions. Amphetamines-group substances domi-nate in Africa, the Americas and Asia, whereas for Europe and Oceania, ecstasy-group prevalence rates are higher. In North America, the two groups are nearly on par. On aggregate, experts who reported their assessment of ATS use in their respective countries perceive that the use of amphetamines-group substances is stable or increasing, whereas for ecstasy, the trend was most often reported as stable (decreasing in Asia). The manufacture of ATS is not geographically bound, and ATS laboratories tend to be located close to the illicit markets for these drugs. Precursors and other chemicals used in the illicit manufacture of ATS are frequently trafficked across regions. Some 10,600 ATS-related laboratories were reported seized in 2009. The vast bulk of the seized laboratories were manufacturing methamphetamine, most of them located in the United States. Methamphetamine is the most widely manufactured ATS worldwide. Amphet-amine and ecstasy manufacture operations tend to be fewer in number but have more sophisticated operations as they require more specialized equipment, precursor chemicals and greater skill levels. In 2009, global seizures of ATS rose significantly, slightly exceeding the high level of 2007. The increase was mainly driven by methamphetamine seizures, which rose by more than 40% to reach 31 mt. Amphetamine seizures rose by some 10% to 33 mt. Ecstasy seizures decreased somewhat from the already low 2008 level, and amounted to 5.4 mt. In East and South-East Asia, ATS markets have expanded over the past year. Expert perceptions indicate that increases in ATS use - notably use of methamphetamine - are significant. Government experts have reported that methamphetamine ranks among the top three illicit drugs consumed in several countries in this region, including China, Japan and Indonesia. Africa is a region of concern with regard to the traffick- ing of ATS. T rafficking of methamphetamine from Africa was reported first at the end of 2008 and reports have continued since. West Africa, in particular, is emerging as a new source of methamphetamine for illicit markets in East Asia, with couriers transiting Europe, West Asia or East Africa. Precursor chemicals are also frequently trans-shipped through the region. In India, the first clandestine ATS manufacture opera- tion was detected in May 2003. Since then, several additional facilities have been uncovered. Attempts at illicit ATS manufacture have also been reported from Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. South Asia has become one of the main regions used to obtain ephedrine and Total ATS (including non-specified a mphetamines; right axis) Amphetamine (left axis) Methamphetamine (left axis) Ecstasy (MDA, MDEA, MDMA; left 2009Ton equivalents 01020304050607080 Ton equivalents18pseudoephedrine for the illicit manufacture of metham- phetamine. India is one of the world's largest manufac-turers of precursor chemicals and Bangladesh also has a growing chemical industry. Amphetamine, metham-phetamine and ecstasy have been regularly seized in South Asia over the past five years. Cannabis Cannabis remains by far the most widely produced and consumed illicit substance globally. In 2009, between 2.8% and 4.5% of the world population aged 15-64 - between 125 and 203 million people - had used canna-bis at least once in the past year. This is similar to last year's estimates. Cannabis herb is the most common type used, produced and seized. Some increases in cannabis use were reported from the Americas, Africa and Asia in 2009, whereas consump-tion in western Europe and Oceania remained stable or declined. Over the past 10 years, experts from an increas-ing number of countries have been reporting stable can-nabis use trends. Despite this, cannabis use accounts for the bulk of treatment demand in Africa and Oceania. Recent studies have shown that intensive (long-term regular use, high doses) exposure to cannabis products with high potency levels may increase the risk of psy-chotic disorders. The average concentration of the major psychoactive substance in cannabis products (THC) seems to be higher than it was 10-15 years ago, though data for the past five years show a stable trend in some countries. The pattern, however, is not consistent for all products and all countries. Cannabis herb cultivation is widely dispersed as it is mostly produced for domestic or regional markets. Therefore, an estimation of total global production is fraught with difficulty. Cannabis resin production is more localized and the drug is trafficked over larger distances. The countries most often identified as sources by the cannabis resin consumer markets are Morocco, Afghanistan, Lebanon and Nepal/India. In Afghanistan, the first UNODC/Government canna- bis survey in 2009 indicated that Afghanistan is indeed among the significant cannabis resin-producing coun-tries. Moreover, cannabis has become a competitor to opium poppy as a lucrative crop for farmers in the coun-try. The preliminary second survey in 2010 gave no indications of major changes in the levels of cultivation and production compared to 2009. Cannabis herb seizures increased somewhat - returning to the levels of 2006-2007 following a drop in 2008 - and amounted to some 6,000 mt. North America accounts for the bulk of herb seizures, and seizures in the United States and Mexico increased in 2009. Cannabis resin seizures, on the other hand, decreased from their peak level in 2008. Resin seizures continued their shift away from West and Central Europe - where seizures are at their lowest level for the last 10 years - to the promi- nent source region of North Africa, where seizures have increased.

OVERVIEW OF GLOBAL AND REGIONAL DRUG TRENDS AND PATTERNS 19The following chapter first draws together information on the global drug problem in its three main sectoral dimensions - production, trafficking and consumption, including prevalence, drug-related treatment, drug-related infectious diseases and drug deaths. This is fol-lowed by a regional overview. More detailed information on specific drug markets (opiates, cocaine, cannabis and amphetamine-type stimulants) can be found in subse-quent chapters. 2) Global overview a) Production The world's largest illicit drug product - in volume terms - is cannabis, that is, the production of cannabis herb, followed by cannabis resin. The second largest illicit drug production is related to cocaine, followed by heroin. Amphetamine-type stimulants production seems to be at comparable levels with heroin. Cannabis - the most widely produced illicit drug worldwide Cannabis herb production takes place across all conti- nents and in almost all countries. Indoor production of cannabis, in contrast, is concentrated in developed countries in North America, Europe and Oceania. No reliable trend information of cannabis herb production at the global level is available. Cannabis herb seizures suggest a stable level of cannabis herb production glo- bally. Cannabis resin production is geographically more lim- ited. Based on information on the origin of cannabis resin, supplied by Member States, this seems to take place primarily in Morocco - mainly producing for the markets in West and Central Europe and North Africa - and Afghanistan - mainly producing for neighbouring countries in South-West Asia and for the local market. Moroccan authorities report that cannabis resin produc-tion has declined in recent years. Cannabis production in Afghanistan - based on joint surveys conducted by UNODC and the Government - seems to show a gener-ally stable level in 2010, compared to a year earlier (which was 1,500-3,500 mt in 2009). Opium and cocaine production falling... Information on production is more readily available when it comes to heroin and cocaine. UNODC and the Governments concerned conduct regular opium and coca surveys in the main opium and coca producing areas. These surveys showed clear declines over the 2007-2009 period (-21% for opium and -13% for coca). The global area under coca cultivation continued 2000 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 1990 1995 2000 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Opium poppy Coca Hectares 262,800Fig. 1: Global opium poppy and coca cultivation, 1990-2010* * For Mexico (opium poppy) and the Plurinational State of Bolivia (coca), in the absence of data for 2010, the estimates for 20 09 were imputed to 2010.

The global area under coca cultivation in 2010 was a third lower than in 2000. The downward trend for the area under opium poppy cultivation did not continue in 2010, mainly due to increases in Myanmar. The global area under opium cultivation in 2010 amounted to some 195,700 ha, which was still some 12% lower than in 2000 and more than a quarter lower than in 1990. Afghanistan contin-ued to account for the bulk of the cultivation with some 123,000 ha (63% of the global total). In terms of production, opium output declined strongly in 2010 (-38%) due to a massive decline of opium pro-duction in Afghanistan (-48%) linked to much lower yields as a consequence of various plant diseases that affected poppy plants. These declines of the yield in Afghanistan more than offset the increases in Myanmar. Nonetheless, Afghanistan remained the world's largest illicit opium-producing country, accounting for 74% of global opium production in 2010, down from 88% in 2009 and 92% in 2007. In parallel, the importance of Myanmar increased, from 5% of total opium produc- tion in 2007 to 12% in 2010. Given the declines of opium production in Afghanistan, global opium pro- duction declined by 45% between 2007 and 2010. In parallel, 'potential' heroin manufacture, that is, the heroin that could have been manufactured from the opium produced (less the amounts of opium consumed as is), fell from some 760 mt in 2007 to less than 400 mt in 2010. These calculations, however, do not take into account the stock and inventory of opium. Based on consumption estimates and the amounts seized, it is 1 The figure for the Plurinational State of Bolivia was not available at the time of printing of this report. The total area under cultivation in 2010 is based on 2009 figures for Bolivia and will be revised when the 2010 figure becomes available.estimated that the 'heroin available in the market' (prior to seizures) was, on average, around 430 mt per year over the 2002-2008 period and between 460 and 480 mt in 2009. There has been a significant decline in potential cocaine manufacture in recent years. Between 2007 and 2010, potential cocaine production shrank by about one sixth, reflecting strongly falling cocaine production in Colom-bia which offset increases identified in both Peru and the Plurinational State of Bolivia. ... while manufacture of ATS appears to be increasing There is no new global ATS production estimate for the year 2009. Available indicators suggest, however, that global manufacture of ATS may have increased in 2009. Seizures of ATS increased by 16% in 2009. The number of ATS laboratory incidents rose by 26% on a year ear-lier to some 10,600, though this figure was still 46% lower than in the peak year of 2004. The increase was mainly linked to methamphetamine laboratories dismantled in the United States of America. Global seizures of the main methamphetamine precur- sor chemicals (ephedrine and pseudoephedrine), taken together, more than doubled in 2009. In contrast, the number of amphetamine and ecstasy laboratories dismantled globally was lower in 2009 than in 2007 and far lower than in 2004. Seizures of the main amphetamine and ecstasy precursors fell in 2009. The importance of Europe as a key location for the manufac-ture of ecstasy continued to decline.

In fact, most cannabis is locally produced and locally consumed and thus does not generally leave domestic frontiers. Most of the cannabis resin produced in Morocco is destined for consumption in West and Central Eu-rope and North Africa. Cannabis resin produced in Afghanistan is primarily destined for neighbouring regions. Cocaine tracking is both intra-regional and inter-re- gional. Cocaine produced in the three Andean coun-tries (Colombia, Peru and the Plurinational State of Bolivia) continues to be primarily destined for North America and West and Central Europe. Actual exports out of Andean countries (after deducting seizures and consumption in the Andean region) are estimated at 788 mt. 378 mt are estimated to have left the Andean region for North America in 2009, of which some 200 mt - purity adjusted - were seized in the process. The importance of North America has declined, how-ever, over the last few years. The next main destina-tions were the countries of West and Central Europe, mostly direct shipments, though some tracking also takes place via countries in Africa, notably West Africa (around 13% of all tracking to Europe). About 217 mt of cocaine are thought to have left the Andean region for West and Central Europe, of which almost 100 mt (purity-adjusted) were seized in the process. In addition, a signicant share of the cocaine produced is also tracked to the Southern Cone countries of South America for domestic consumption. Heroin tracking is both intra-regional and inter- regional in nature. Heroin produced in Afghanistan is consumed within the region and/or tracked to Europe. Some 160 mt of Afghan heroin are estimated to have entered Pakistan in 2009 of which the bulk (some 138 mt) were for nal destinations in Europe, South-East Asia, South Asia and Africa. Some 145 mt of heroin is estimated to have been tracked from Afghanistan to the Islamic Republic of Iran for local consumption and onward tracking in 2009. Some 75-80 mt of heroin are estimated to have reached West and Central Europe, mostly tracked via South-East Europe. About 90 mt of Afghan heroin are esti-mated to have been tracked to Central Asia, mainly for nal destinations in the C.I.S countries, notably the Russian Federation. Heroin manufactured in Myanmar is primarily for the market in other South-East Asian countries. Heroin produced in Mexico and Colombia is mainly destined for the United States and some limited local consumption. T racking in amphetamines continues to be mainly intra-regional, while the tracking in ampheta-mines precursor chemicals continues to be largely inter-regional. Ecstasy-tracking has - traditionally - been intra- regional within Europe (as the origin of most of the ecstasy used to be Europe) and inter-regional for other regions. In recent years, the importance of Europe as a source region has clearly declined. Production has shifted to other regions, notably North America and South-East Asia. Exports from the latter regions to other regions are, however, still very limited. Seizures of cannabis herb and resin have shown a gener- ally stable trend over the 2007-2009 period. In 2009, cannabis herb seizures increased while resin seizures declined. Following strong increases over the 2000-2005 period, Fig. 4: Global seizures of selected drugs (mt), 2005-2009 Source: UNODC ARQ.

The high cocaine seizures indicate ongoing improvements in the cocaine interception rates, given falling cocaine production at the global level. Opium seizures almost doubled between 2005 and 2009, while seizures of heroin and morphine, taken together, remained generally stable over the 2005-2009 period. This suggests that the strong increase of opium production in Afghanistan (until 2007) led to increasing opium exports but was not translated into an equally rapid expansion of heroin production at the global level. Similarly, the declines of Afghan opium production after 2007 did not lead to any declines of heroin and mor-phine trafficking - at least not until 2009. Seizures of amphetamines increased over the 2005-2009 period, mainly reflecting increases in methamphetamine seizures. 2 Ecstasy seizures, in contrast, declined. Between 2007 and 2009 they fell by more than two thirds, which seems to confirm reports of an ecstasy shortage in several markets. Long-term seizure trends show that cocaine, heroin and morphine as well as cannabis seizures - in volume terms - almost doubled between 1998 and 2009, while seizures of ATS more than tripled over the same period. Over the 2005-2009 period, the above-mentioned plant-based drug seizures remained largely stable while ATS seizures, excluding ecstasy, showed a clear increase. 2 Seizures of amphetamines and ecstasy shown in this report differ from those shown in previous reports. Pills have been converted in 'gross weight' terms into amphetamines or ecstasy (instead of the actual amounts of psychoactive substances contained in such pills) as seizures of other substances are also shown in 'gross weight' terms, and not purity-adjusted. The volume of amphetamines and ecstasy, shown in kilogram equivalents, is thus higher than in previ-ous reports. c) Consumption Drug users Globally, UNODC estimates that between 149 and 272 million people, or, 3.3% to 6.1% of the population aged 15-64 used illicit substances at least once in the previous year. About half that number is estimated to have been current drug users, that is, having used illicit drugs at least once during the past month prior to the survey. Thus, the use of illicit psychoactive substances - for which a global control system is in place - continues to be substantially lower than the use of a legal psychoac-tive substance such as tobacco. 3 Some 25% of the adult population (15 years and above) are current tobacco smokers, according to the World Health Organization. 4 Prevalence rates of illicit drug use have remained gen- erally stable over the last decade The overall number of drug users appears to have increased over the last decade, from 180 to some 210 million people (range: 149-272 million). In terms of prevalence rate, the proportion of drug users among the population aged 15-64, however, remained almost unchanged at around 5% (range: 3.4%-6.2%) in 2009/ 2010. Problem drug use remains relatively stable Considering only the problem drug users, estimates range from 15 to 39 million people, equivalent to 0.3%- 3 The WHO places tobacco in the group of psychoactive substances (World Health Organization, Neuroscience of psychoactive substance use and dependence , Geneva, 2004.) 4 World Health Organization, World Health Statistics 2010 . Results were derived from the WHO report on the global tobacco epidemic, 2009. Data on male use of tobacco products (41.1% of the male population aged 15 and above) and female use of tobacco products (8.9% of the female population aged 15 and above) are considered by WHO to be the best estimate for the year 2006.

While there is no established definition of problem drug users, they are usually defined by countries as those that regularly use illicit substances and can be considered dependent, and those who inject drugs. The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) defines problem drug use as \"injecting drug use or long duration/regular use of opioids, cocaine and/or amphetamines.\" 5 A comparison of problem drug use since 2004/2005 shows a fairly stable trend. 5 E MCDDA (2008), Guidelines for Estimating the Incidence of Problem Drug Use , Lisbon.Fig. 6: A nnual prevalence of illicit drug use, late 1990s-2009/2010 Source: UNODC estimates based on UNODC ARQ and other official sources. Fig. 7: P revalence of tobacco and illicit drug use among the adult population, in % * The calculation of monthly use was based on information from 35 countries for which ratios of past month to annual drug use levels were calculated. In case no total drug use figures were avail-able, the ratio of past month cannabis to past year cannabis use was used as a proxy. The unweighted average showed that past- month prevalence was equivalent to 52% of annual prevalence. Applying this to a prevalence rate of 4.8% results in a past-month prevalence estimate of around 2.5%.

The number of cannabis users was estimated between 125 and 203 million in 2009, equivalent to a prevalence rate of 2.8%-4.5% of the population aged 15-64. The second most widely used group of substances seems to be the ATS (including methamphetamine, ampheta- mine, methcathinone and ecstasy). Within ATS, the 'amphetamines' (methamphetamine, amphetamine and methcathinone) is still the most prominent group of substances, used by 14-56 million people in 2009, equivalent to a prevalence rate ranging from 0.3% to 1.3% of the population aged 15-64. The broad ranges are mainly due to major uncertainties regarding the extent of amphetamines consumption in the world's two most populous countries, China and India, as well as uncertainties regarding the spread of amphetamines use in Africa. The same applies to the broad ranges for ecstasy use (11-28 million people, or a prevalence rate ranging from 0.2-0.6% of the population aged 15-64). The third most widely used group of substances appears to be the opioids, with estimates ranging from 24 to 35 million people, equivalent to a prevalence rate of 0.5%-0.8% of the population aged 15-64. The most problem-atic opioids 6 at the global level, as reflected in treatment demand, are the opiates, that is, the various psychoactive substances derived from the opium poppy plant, notably opium and heroin. About 12-21 million people are esti-mated to have consumed illicit opiates in 2009, equiva-lent to a prevalence rate ranging from 0.3% to 0.5%. The most problematic opiate in the world's illegal drug markets continues to be heroin. UNODC estimates that there were some 12-14 million heroin users in the world in 2009. In recent years, problem drug use has also been related to the non-medical use of various prescription opioids, such as oxycodone, fentanyl or pethidine. Cocaine appears to rank fourth in terms of global preva- lence, with estimates ranging from 14 to 21 million people, 7 equivalent to an annual prevalence rate ranging from 0.3%-0.5% of the population aged 15-64. The global use of cocaine seems to be less widespread than the use of opioids, similar to the use of opiates, and more widespread than the use of heroin. 6 Opioid is a generic term applied to alkaloids from opium poppy, their synthetic analogues, and compounds synthesized in the body. In general, a distinction is made between 'opiates' (that is, the various products derived from the opium poppy plant) and synthetic opioids. More detail is available in the chapter on the opium/heroin market. 7 Taking qualitative information into account (regarding Africa and Asia), the best estimate is probably less than 16 million. Generally stable trends for use of main drug categories at the global level... The total number of users for the individual drug cate- gories mentioned above does not appear to have changed significantly over the last few years. All changes occurred well within the existing ranges. If there has been a gen-eral trend, it has been - for most drugs - towards a widening of existing ranges (that is, increases of the upper level and declines of the lower level of the esti-mates), reflecting greater uncertainty about the actual number of drug users. Some of this is a result of statisti- cal good practice, whereby prevalence estimates older than 10 years are now not being used to estimate preva-lence. Since a large number of countries in Africa and Asia do not have recent data on drug use, the levels of uncertainty increase. Using a five-point scale from large decrease to large increase, most government experts perceived a stabiliza-tion of drug use in 2009, as reported through the ARQ. This applied to cannabis, amphetamines, ecstasy, cocaine and the opioids, including heroin. ... while new drugs are emerging The generally positive trends for the 'traditional' drugs, however, do not apply to all illicit drug markets. These markets continue to evolve and every year new products, not under control, are manufactured to supply an increasingly diversified demand for psychoactive sub-stances. Synthetic drugs are the fastest evolving substances in this Fig. 8: Annual prevalence of drug use at the global level, in percent of the popula- tion aged 15-64, 2009/2010 Source: UNODC estimates percent of population age 15-6426World Drug Report 2011 context, but products based on cannabis, cocaine and opiates are also becoming more diversified. In addition, reports of drug-adulterant combinations involving phar-macologically active substances are increasing. New psychoactive substances are supplied to the illicit market as a response to a number of factors: i) the use of different chemicals/precursors to evade an established law enforcement pattern; ii) the use of substances which are not nationally or internationally regulated and con-trolled; iii) the replacement of substances whose supply is decreasing; and iv) the offer of products which can satisfy the evolving requirements of users. The fact that new psychoactive substances are emerging on the drug markets is not a new development. More recently, the market for new substances detected in sei-zures has been expanding quickly. In Europe, one of the most 'innovative' regions when it comes to new drugs, 110 new psychoactive substances were reported to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) and Europol between 1997 and 2009. In 2010, more than 40 new substances were noti-fied in the European early-warning system, compared to 24 in 2009. 8 These included piperazines, cathinones, synthetic cannabinoids, tryptamines and phenethyl-amines. In the last few years, a number of new substances entered the illicit market imitating either the pharmacological properties or chemical structures of existing controlled substances such as amphetamines or ecstasy. Some of these contain unregulated substances and are known as 'legal highs'. The piperazines and the cathinones, for example mephedrone, are examples of unregulated sub-stances which recently entered the markets. 8 EMCDDA, 2010 Annual Report . Piperazines Piperazine was initially developed as an anthelminthic used in the treatment of parasitic worms. Its best known derivative, benzylpiperazine (BZP), was further devel-oped as an antidepressant but was not marketed for this purpose because it produced similar effects to d-amphet-amine, though less potent. These amphetamine-like effects include a sense of euphoria and stimulant proper-ties. Piperazine derivatives such as BZP and 3-trifluor-omethylphenylpiperazine (TFMPP) are often sold as 'ecstasy' to overcome the shortage of MDMA. Mephedrone Mephedrone, also known as 4-methylmethcathinone (4-MMC), is chemically related to the internationally controlled substance cathinone, one of the psychoactive substances in the khat plant. Mephedrone was intro-duced to the drug markets recently and is often touted as a legal alternative to amphetamine or cocaine with increasing reports emanating from Europe, North America and Australia. Although mephedrone and ana-logues such as naphyrone produce effects similar to those of some internationally controlled substances, there are often no legislative restrictions on their manu-facture and distribution due to the chemical differences. 'Spice' The cannabis market has diversified with the introduc-tion of synthetic cannabinoids which emulate the effect of using cannabis. Since 2008, several synthetic can-nabinoids ('spice') have been detected in herbal smoking blends. These products typically contain about 3 grams of finely cut plant material to which one or more syn-thetic cannabinoids have been added. As they do not contain products that are under international control, Fig. 9: Government experts' perceptions of trends in illicit drug use,* 2009 * based on information from 83 countries and territories. Source: UNODC ARQ. 114 110776612 1037 Ecstasy Cocaine Opioids HeroinNumber of countries Large decrease Some decrease No great change Some increase Large increase27Overview of global and regional drug trends and patterns these products have often been marketed as 'legal alter- natives' to cannabis. Little is known about the pharma-cology and toxicology of these compounds, and it is believed that a number of these substances may have a higher addictive potential than cannabis. In response, a number of countries have placed 'spice' and similar products under control, leading to a decrease in the extent of the problem. Drug-adulterant combinations: Cocaine adulterated with levamisole Street dealers have traditionally 'cut' cocaine with dilu- ents such as lactose to increase profits. Recently, there have been reports of the use of more pharmacologically active adulterants such as atropine, phenacetin and methyphenidate. The presence of some of these adulter-ants may serve to increase the desired effects of the illicit substances or even reduce or eliminate some of its adverse effects. Data from the Netherlands (confirmed by data from several other European and North Ameri-can countries) show that in 2008 and 2009, an increased number of cocaine samples contained levamisole, an anthelminthic, effective in infections with the common roundworm. Difficulties in controlling new substances... The large number of new substances that enter the market worldwide is posing a number of challenges to public health and law enforcement systems which require improved monitoring and a coordinated response across countries and regions. While some countries have tried to address the problem via the application of 'emer-gency scheduling' mechanisms, others have started to experiment with 'generic scheduling mechanisms' which automatically also put analogue substances under con-trol. This is, however, difficult to implement in many legal systems. Other countries have started to bring the rapidly growing number of new substances under imme-diate control via the 'Medicines Act' (instead of the 'Narcotics Act'), which typically requires that medicinal products need to be properly tested before they can be sold to the general public. The precursor chemicals for synthetic drugs also con- tinue to change in response to stricter controls. For example, in some countries, traffickers have started to use norephedrine as a precursor for the manufacture of methamphetamine, instead of ephedrine and pseu-doephedrine, which have been under increasing govern-mental scrutiny. ... and problems related to the non-medical use of pre- scription drugs increase While there are stable trends for traditionally used drugs, and in major consumption regions even some decline for heroin and cocaine, there seems to be an increase in the non-medical use of prescription drugs in a number of countries. Non-medical use of prescription drugs, such as a number of synthetic opioids, tranquillizers and sedatives or pre- scription stimulants is reportedly a growing health prob- lem in a number of countries. In the United States, emergency room visits related to the non-medical use of prescription drugs have started to exceed the numbers related to the use of illicit drugs. Prescription drugs may replace certain illicit drugs since their use is perceived to be less harmful, being prescribed by physicians. They are legal, cheaper than illicit drugs and their use is more socially acceptable. Another factor for the growing pop-ularity of prescription drugs is that patients who have been prescribed medications share or sell them to family members, friends or others who approach them. Non-medical use of prescription drugs is a common phenom-enon among young adults, women, elderly patients and health care professionals. Another issue of concern is that the growing numbers of polydrug users among illicit drug users also use prescription drugs in combina-tion with their illicit drug of choice to enhance the effects of the main drug. Treatment demand The need to enter treatment reflects problematic drug use, associated with adverse effects on the health of individuals. In most regions of the world, there continue to be clear regional patterns regarding the main problem drug types. In Europe and Asia, opioids (basically opiates, and in particular heroin) are dominant for problematic use. In some of the Asian countries, ATS - notably methamphetamine in South-East Asia and Captagon (that is, amphetamine, often mixed with caffeine) on the Arabian peninsula - has emerged as the most problematic drug group. ATS in treatment demand is also widespread in Oceania, North America and West and Central Europe. The problematic use of cannabis makes a significant contribution to treatment demand across all regions but is particularly prevalent in Africa. In South America (including the Caribbean and Central America), cocaine is the primary drug responsible for drug treatment. In North America, a more diversified pattern has developed where a single, dominant drug type does not emerge. Cannabis, opioids and cocaine are all equally represented. In Oceania, treatment is linked primarily to cannabis, followed by opioids. 28World Drug Report 2011 Main problem drugs as reflected in treatment demand, by region, 2009 (or latest year available) Notes: Percentages are unweighted means of treat ment demand from reporting countries.

The latest US data 9 show that, on average, three persons per 100 annual drug users had to undergo treatment for drug use in 2008. Opiates use is far more problematic than the use of other illicit drugs. The rate for heroin is much higher than the average, at 22 for 100 users, that is, more than one out of five users enters treatment. Though treatment demand for prescription opioids has been rising far stronger in the USA (460% between 1998 and 2008) than heroin-related treatment demand (8%), only 1 out of 100 people who misuse prescription opioids enter treatment. The corresponding rates amounted to between four and five per 100 users for cocaine and amphetamines ('stimulants') and one per 100 users for cannabis in 2008. Above average treatment demand still exists for crack-cocaine users (14 per 100 users), clearly exceeding overall cocaine-related treat- ment demand, and for methamphetamine users (14 per 100 users), clearly exceeding overall amphetamines- related treatment demand. For users of tranquillizers and sedatives, the rates are between 0.6 and 0.7 per 100 users. Based on the number of past-year users in European countries and the reported numbers in treatment for the 9 SAMHSA, Results from the 2009 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: Detailed T ables ; SAMHSA, T reatment Episode Data Set (TEDS), 1998-2008; estimates on the number of opioid and opiate users have been derived from ONDCP estimates on the number of heroin users and SAMHSA estimates on the number of prescription opioid users. various drug types, data suggest that between one in every four or five opioid users end up in treatment. These rates are comparable to those found in the USA, as most of the reported opioid use in Europe is linked to the abuse of opiates, notably heroin. For cocaine and ATS, available data suggest that around one in every 100 users in Europe end up in treatment, that is, less than in the USA. This would suggest that cocaine and stimulant use in Europe is still not as problematic as in the USA because crack-cocaine and methamphetamine, the two most problematic substances in these categories, are still small in Europe. While treatment related to cannabis use increased in Europe over the last decade, this is still far less common than in the USA. Around one in every 230 cannabis users underwent treatment in Europe, com-pared to one in every 80 in the USA. Differences in treatment policy (notably with regard to compulsory cannabis-related treatment schemes) and recording prac-tices may explain some of the differences. Consequently, opioid/opiate users in Europe are 20 times more likely to end up in treatment compared to cocaine and ATS users, and 50 times more likely compared to cannabis users. In the USA, the likelihood for opiate users to end up in treatment is about five times higher than for cocaine and stimulant users and 20 times higher than for cannabis users. 10 The prevalence of opiate use, compared to other drugs, is relatively low. However, opiates dominate treatment with a disproportionately high percentage of demand. This reflects the considerable harm associated with opi- 10 This analysis is based on macro data and does not take into account polydrug use.Fig. 10: Comparison of drug types between treatment demand and relative number of users,* by region** * Percentage of illicit drug users does not consider polydrug use. ** Seven regions are represented: Africa, Asia, East and Sou th-East Asia, North America, Oceania, South America, West and Central Europe.

As for most regions (except North and South America), the opiate and opioid figures are still almost identical. With the high prevalence rates of ATS in Asia, especially in East and South-East Asia, there remain concerns over an unmet demand for treatment of ATS use there. With most of the treatment services aimed at meeting the needs of opioid and cannabis users, ATS treatment serv-ices are relatively scarce and under-resourced. 11 The vast majority of illicit drug users consume cannabis, and although the harm associated with its use is rela-tively small in comparison with the opiates, cannabis contributes in no small way to treatment demand. The level of treatment demand for cannabis coincides with regional prevalence rates, with the highest levels of con-sumption in Oceania and Africa, followed by the Amer-icas, Europe and Asia. Infectious diseases among injecting drug users A systematic review12 conducted for the Reference Group to the UN on HIV and Injecting Drug Use esti-mated that there are approximately 15.9 million (range 11.0-21.2 million) injecting drug users worldwide, with the largest numbers in China, the United States and the Russian Federation. These figures suggest that close to 60% of all problem drug users worldwide inject drugs, and that injecting drug users account for about 7.5% of all drug users worldwide. Injecting drug use is an extreme form of illicit drug use with serious health implications and costs for the indi-vidual and the community. Risky injecting and sexual behaviour among drug users becomes a major public health concern because of the high risk for the transmis-sion of blood-borne infections such as HIV, Hepatitis C and B, especially among the marginalized and most at risk populations. Around one in five injecting drug users is HIV positive ... Based on information compiled by UNODC, the global average prevalence of HIV among injecting drug users is estimated at 17.9%, or equivalently, 2.8 million people who inject drugs are living with HIV. This is consistent with the estimate of 3.0 million (range 0.8-6.6 million) presented by the Reference Group to the UN on HIV and injecting drug use. 13 High levels of HIV infections 11 UNODC, Patterns and Trends of Amphetamine Type Stimulants and Other Drugs Asia and the Pacific , Global SMART Programme, 2010. 12 Mathers BM, Degenhardt L, Phillips B, et al., (November 2008), 'Global epidemiology of injecting drug use and HIV among people who inject drugs: a systematic review,' Lancet 372 (9651): 1733-45. 13 Ibid.are, in general, found among marginalized populations of drug users as well as among those in prison settings. According to the Reference Group, there are large geo- graphical variations in the prevalence of HIV among injecting drug users, with the largest numbers and high-est rates in Latin America, East Europe, and East and South-East Asia. Combined, these regions account for 73% of the global number of injecting drug users living with HIV. In some countries, the prevalence of HIV among injecting drug users is extremely high, such as in Estonia (72%), Argentina (50%) and Brazil (48%). ... and around half of all injecting drug users are infected with the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) Infections with viral hepatitis C and B also pose signifi- cant public health concerns giving rise to considerable morbidity and mortality among drug users. The hepatitis C virus (HCV) affects around 130-170 million people worldwide 14 (representing 2.2%-3.0% of the global population) and is a major cause of liver dis-ease with the potential for considerable ill health effects and premature death. In developed countries, injecting drug use is the main route for the transmission of HCV. 15 Although HCV and HIV have different viral properties and clinical outcomes, they share parallel risks, and their epidemic follows a similar path. HCV is five times more widespread worldwide than HIV, how-ever, because it is more infectious and has probably been present for longer in human populations. The prevalence of HCV among injecting drug users at the global level is high, at 50.3% (45.2%-55.3%), with 13 out of 51 countries reporting prevalence rates greater than 70%. Africa and Oceania have the highest rates at 73.2% and 63.8% respectively, although the number of countries reporting rates from these two regions is very low. Applying the estimated global average prevalence suggests that there are 8.0 (7.2-8.8) million injecting drug users worldwide who are also infected with HCV. As with HIV, higher levels of HCV infections are found among marginalized populations of drug users and those in prison settings. Most of the information reported to UNODC comes from Europe where the average level of infection of HCV among injecting drug users is 47.0%, but eight out of the 29 countries have prevalence rates above 60% and five over 70%. 14 Daniel Lavanchy. The global burden of hepatitis C, Liver Interna- tional, 2009; 29(s1): Lyn Finelli, Miriam J Alter. Global epidemiology of hepatitis C virus infection. Lancet Infect Dis 2005;5: 558-67.33Overview of global and regional drug trends and patterns Deaths associated with illicit drug use Deaths related to or associated with the use of illicit drugs may include: fatal drug overdoses; suicide; acci-dents (such as motor vehicle accidents) while under the influence of illicit drugs; deaths among injecting and other drug users from infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis C transmitted through the use of contaminated needles; or from medical conditions (such as organ failure) associated with long-term drug use. The information on the number of drug-related deaths reported to UNODC is often based on different criteria of classification of diseases and may include some or all of these categories. Data on drug-related deaths is a measure that provides information on the most extreme consequences and the health impact of drug use in the community. This can also provide essential information on risky patterns of drug use, the risk attributed to certain drugs or combi-nations of substances, the level of risk among the most vulnerable population groups, and to monitor the prev-alence of risks attributed to certain drugs. 17 Toxicologi- cal examinations to identify the cause of death are not standard in most countries and even if such examina-tions are undertaken, they can often only confirm the presence of a psychoactive substance in the dead body but do not provide information on a causal relationship. Thus, drug deaths related to cannabis are often reported, though in most cases, the presence of this drug did not cause the death. Information on drug-related deaths, compiled from different countries using different clas-sification systems, must be treated with caution. Globally, different estimates of drug-related deaths have been published by the World Health Organization in the past. These estimates include: 194,000 (uncertainty interval 113,494 - 276,584) drug-related deaths for the year 2000, based on esti-mates of the following four causes: AIDS, opioid over-dose, suicide among opioid users and trauma. 18 197,400 (uncertainty interval 101,751 - 322,456) for the year 2000, based on all-cause mortality from cohort studies and attributable fractions. 19 245,000 deaths attributed to illicit drug use in 2004, which includes deaths related to heroin and cocaine use, and deaths from HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B and C resulting from illicit drug use. 20 17 EMCDDA, An overview of the drug-related deaths and mortality among drug users (DRD) key indicator, January 2009. 18 Degenhardt L, Hall W, Warner-Smith M, Lynskey M., 'Chapter 13: Illicit drug use,' In: Ezzati M, Lopez A, Rodgers A, Murray CJL, eds. Comparative quantification of health risks: global and regional burden of disease attributable to selected major risk factors , Geneva, World Health Organization, 2003. 19 Ibid. 20 World Health Organization, Global health risks: mortality and burden For 2009, UNODC has compiled information on drug- related deaths based on data reported through the ARQ. The level of reporting on drug-related deaths encom-passes nearly half (49%) of the world's population aged 15-64 - although there are large regional differences in coverage: North America - 100%; Europe - 97%; South America (including the Caribbean and Central America) - 64%; Oceania - 62%; Asia - 42%; and Africa, <1%. Since very little data emerged from countries in Africa, an alternative source on drug-related deaths has been used. 21 According to the data compiled by UNODC, it is esti-mated that globally, there are between 104,000 and 263,000 deaths each year that are attributable to illicit drug use, or equivalently, that there are between 23.1 and 58.7 deaths per million population aged 15-64 due to illicit drug use. These estimates are consistent with other previously published estimates by the WHO. As reported by Member States, approximately 50% of the deaths are fatal overdose cases. Significantly, drug-related deaths occur among a young age group. For example, EMCDDA reports that the mean age for deaths result-ing from overdose in Europe is the mid-30s. 22 In Europe, drug overdoses account for 4% of all deaths for those aged 15-39 23 - and the rates in some countries exceed 10% in this age group. In a study on drug-related mortality in eight European cities, 10-20% of mortality within the 15-49 age group is attributable to opioid use. 24 Data from Europe also suggest that for each drug- induced death, there are an estimated 20-25 non-fatal overdose cases. As such, drug-related deaths are highly premature (and preventable) and account for a dispro-portionate contribution to the burden of disease as measured by potential years of life lost. of disease attributable to selected major risks , 2009. 21 Darke, S., Degenhardt, L. and Mattick, R., Mortality Amongst Illicit Drug Users: Epidemiology, Causes and Intervention , Cambridge Uni- versity Press, 2007. 22 EMCDDA, Annual report: the state of the drugs problem in Europe - 2010, Lisbon, November 2010. 23 Ibid. 24 Bargagli, A.M., Hickman, M., Davoli, M., Perucci, C.A., Schifano, P . et al.

Production Production of illicit drugs in North America is primarily linked to cannabis (mainly cannabis herb), ampheta-mine-type stimulants (ATS) and opiates. Substantial amounts of cannabis are grown in all North American countries and important exports are directed from Mexico to the United States, and, to a lesser extent, from Canada to the United States. Greenhouse cultiva-tion of cannabis is still limited to the USA and Canada. Manufacture of ATS takes place in all three countries and is mainly of methamphetamine and, to a lesser extent, ecstasy. Some 99% of all methamphetamine laboratories worldwide (though mostly 'kitchen labs') are dismantled in North America, notably in the United States. Significant amounts of methamphetamine con-tinue to be shipped across the border from Mexico to the United States. Manufacture of ecstasy is mainly con-centrated in Canada and the USA. A significant share of the Canadian ecstasy production is destined for the US market. Asian groups with links to China and South-East Asian countries are mainly involved in the ecstasy production. Production of opiates in North America only takes place in Mexico. Mexico's opium production accounted for 5% of the world total in 2009. Trafficking T rafficking of drugs continues to be primarily directed towards North America. T rafficking of drugs out of the region to other destinations exists, but is limited. T raf-ficking of cannabis herb is mainly intra-regional, with cannabis herb from both Mexico and Canada being shipped into the United States, in addition to domestic shipments of locally produced cannabis herb across US states. Similarly, methamphetamine trafficking is prima-rily intra-regional, with flows from Mexico into the United States, as well as locally produced methampheta-mine being trafficked domestically in the United States. Ecstasy trafficking used to be intra-regional (from west-ern Europe to North America) but has now become mainly intra-regional, with deliveries from Canada into the United States. Cocaine trafficking, in contrast, remains inter-regional, with shipments of cocaine from the Andean region, notably Colombia, to Central Amer-ica and Mexico for final destination markets in the United States and, to a lesser extent, Canada. The largest seizures in North America are reported for cannabis, followed by cocaine and the amphetamines. Expressed as a proportion of the global total, data show that 70% of global cannabis herb and 70% of global ecstasy seizures took place in North America in 2009, followed by amphetamines (21%) [methamphetamine only: 44%], cocaine (18%) and heroin (4% of the world total). Cannabis resin seizures accounted for less than 1% of the total, showing that hashish does not play a significant role in North America. While cocaine seizures declined markedly between 2005 and 2009 (-43%), reflecting the overall decline of the cocaine market in North America, seizures increased over this period for amphetamines (87%), ecstasy (71%), cannabis herb (32%) and heroin (19%). Illicit drug use The highest levels of illicit drug use are related to the consumption of cannabis, mainly cannabis herb. With a prevalence rate of 10.7% among the population aged 15-64, cannabis use in North America is above the global average. The region accounts for about one fifth of global cannabis users, far above its share of the global population (around 7%). Following years of decline, cannabis use increased again in 2009 in the United States. The annual prevalence of cannabis use in the Table 4: Seizures in North America, in kilogram equivalents, 2005-2009 Source: UNODC ARQ. 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009In % of global total in 2009 Drug Report 2011 USA increased from 10.1% of the population aged 12 and above in 2007 to 11.3% in 2009. The relative importance of North America is larger when it comes to cocaine. Almost 37% of all cocaine users worldwide are found in North America. With a prevalence rate of 1.9% among the population aged 15-64, North America - despite declines in recent years - still has the highest prevalence rate of any subregion, far above the global average (0.4%). The decline was most pronounced after 2006, with the annual preva-lence of cocaine use in the USA falling from 3.0% of the population aged 15-64 to 2.4% in 2009. Significant declines in cocaine use were also reported from Canada in recent years, with the annual prevalence rate falling from 2.3% in 2004 to 1.4% in 2009. About 1.1% of the population in North America uses amphetamines and a similar proportion uses ecstasy. These are - in both cases - above the global average. Use of amphetamine-type stimulants showed a downward trend over the 2006-2008 period and increased again slightly in 2009. The increase was mainly related to the 'recovery' of methamphetamine, rising from 0.3% of the population aged 12 and above in 2008 to 0.5% in 2009. The same applied to the use of ecstasy which rose in the USA from 0.9% of the population aged 12 and above in 2008 to 1.1% in 2009. If opioids are considered, available estimates suggest that more than 40% of global opioid users are found in North America. These high levels are mainly due to widespread non-medical use of prescription opioids, which rose between 2002 and 2006, before falling until 2008 and rising again in 2009. The abuse of opiates is, at 0.4%, close to the global average. Opiate use levels have remained stable in recent years. North America has, in general, a significant problem when it comes to the non-medical use of prescription drugs. In the United States, such use of prescription drugs ('psychotherapeutics') has ranked for some years second after cannabis, with an annual prevalence of 6.4% among the population aged 12 and above. 25 The non-medical use of pain relievers (4.9%) which are pre- scription opioids and of tranquillizers (2.2%) now show higher annual prevalence rates than cocaine (1.9%). The non-medical use of easily available prescription opioids - oxycodone in particular - appears to have increased since 2005. Among the new initiators of drug use in 2009, around 2.2 million people in the USA initiated their drug use with pain relievers, approaching the number of those who initiated their drug use with can-nabis. 25 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Results from the 2009 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: Volume I . Summary of National Findings, 2010, Rockville, Maryland, USA.The main pharmaceutical prescription drug categories used in Canada are 'opioid pain relievers', 'stimulants' and 'tranquillizers and sedatives'. In 2009, prescription opioid misuse in Canada was reported at 0.5%, the same level as 2008, while heroin use was estimated at 0.36%. 26 In Mexico, the annual prevalence of non-medical use of prescription drugs seems to be much lower. The national household survey found prescription opioid prevalence to amount to 0.06% of the adult population in 2008, compared to 0.04% for heroin. 27 Drug-related deaths North America seems to experience a large proportion of drug-related deaths (45,100 deaths) and the highest drug-related mortality rate (148 deaths per million pop-ulation aged 15-64). The United States saw an estimated 38,400 deaths from illicit drug use in 2006, correspond-ing to a drug-related mortality rate of 182 deaths per one million inhabitants aged 15-64. In the United States, overdoses from prescription opio- ids have been steadily increasing from 4,000 in 2001 to 11,000 in 2006 (the most recent year available), an increase of 175%, primarily as a result of the non-med-ical use of diverted prescription opioids. 28 Similar trends in the non-medical use of prescription medicines are also emerging in other countries.29 b) South America, Central America and the Caribbean South America continues to be primarily a subregion known for large-scale cocaine production and traffick-ing, though drug use, notably in the Southern Cone countries, has also become significant. Production Notable illicit drug production continues to take place in the three Andean countries. Colombia, Peru and the Plurinational State of Bolivia are responsible for close to 100% of global coca leaf production, the raw material for the manufacture of cocaine. In 2010, coca was culti-vated on 149,100 30 ha in the Andean countries, down 26 Estimated by UNODC based on 1% prevalence of injecting drug use (estimated 220,690 IDU in 2004) reported by the Reference Group to the United Nations on HIV and injecting drug use, 2008. 27 SALUD, Encuesta Nacional de Adicciones 2008, Instituto Nacional de Salud P\u00fablica, Mexico. 28 U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration, National Drug Intelligence Centre, National Prescription Drug Threat Assessment 2009 ,and National Drug Threat Assessment 2010 . 29 Nicholas R., Lee N., and A.

The total area under cultivation in 2010 is based on old figures for Bolivia and will be revised once the 37Overview of global and regional drug trends and patterns from 221,300 ha in 2000. Cocaine manufacture in clan- destine laboratories also takes place, to a large extent, in the Andean countries. Since 2007, cocaine production has shown a clear downward trend, mainly due to declines of production in Colombia, which also contin-ued in 2010. Cocaine production fell by some one sixth over the 2007-2010 period. Most of the countries in South America, Central Amer- ica and the Caribbean have significant levels of cannabis production, notably of cannabis herb. In 2009, 70% of global cannabis plant seizures, an indirect indicator of cannabis eradication, occurred in this subregion. Three quarters of these seizures took place in South America. Cannabis production seems to be - in most countries - primarily for domestic use. Opium production in South America is almost negligible at the global level. Manufacture of amphetamine-type stimulants is still limited in the region as most of the ATS consumed are still diverted prescription stimulants. However, in recent years, illicit manufacture of ATS has emerged in several countries with little or no previous history of reported manufacture. Trafficking T rafficking flows are primarily directed out of the cocaine-producing countries in the Andean region towards North America, either directly to Mexico and then the United States, or via Central America to Mexico or via the Caribbean to the United States. T rafficking flows to Europe are either directly from the Andean region or via neighbouring countries to Europe, via countries in the Caribbean region as well as via countries in Africa (notably West Africa) to Europe. Cannabis trafficking flows are mainly intra-regional. In addition, there are limited trafficking flows of heroin from Colombia to the United States. In contrast, trafficking flows of amphetamines and 2010 figure becomes available.ecstasy are still mainly from Europe towards South America, though these appear to be declining as they start to be substituted by local production. The largest seizures, in volume terms, are those of coca leaf in South America, which accounts for all global coca leaf seizures. Such seizures declined, however, over the 2007-2009 period by some 25%, partly reflecting a decline in coca leaf production. In contrast, cocaine seizures, for which the countries of South America, Cen- tral America and the Caribbean accounted for 74% of the world total, showed an increase by 27% over the 2007-2009 period. Increasing interdiction efforts by the Andean countries (notably Colombia) as well as improvements in international cooperation - and thus more 'upstream' interdictions - have been responsible for this. Seizures of opium and heroin declined markedly between 2005 and 2009. The decline is in line with reports of strong reductions of opium production in South Amer-ica over the last decade. Illicit drug use Surveys suggest that about 5% of all cannabis users worldwide are found in South America, the Caribbean and Central America, slightly less than the region's share of the global population. Nonetheless, cannabis is the most widely consumed illicit substance in the region. The prevalence rate for cannabis use in South America ranged between 2.9%-3.0% of the population aged 15-64 in 2009, between 1.6%-7.6% in the Caribbean and between 2.2%-2.5% in Central America. The prevalence of cocaine use in South America, Central America and the Caribbean is clearly above the global average. About 0.9%-1.0% of the population aged 15-64 consumes cocaine, equivalent to some 2.6-3.0 million people or 17% of the world's cocaine-using population. Following years of increases, the latest data indicate a Table 5: Seizures in South America, Central America and the Caribbean, in kilogram equivalents, 2005-2009 Source: UNODC ARQ. 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009In % of global total in 2009 Cannabis 519 189 0.3% Ecstasy 141 53 103 46 0.01%Memo: Population 473 million 7%38World Drug Report 2011 stabilization at the higher levels. Cocaine continues to be the main problem drug in South America, Central America and the Caribbean, accounting for some 50% of all drug-related treatment demand in the region. Use of other drugs is below average. This is true for ATS as well as the opioids. Overall opioid use is far more prevalent (some 0.4%) than the use of opiates (0.1%). The most prevalent prescriptions drugs in the region seem to be prescription opioids. High prevalence of the non-medical use of prescription opioids has been reported by Costa Rica, Brazil and Chile. Most of the ATS use in the region is linked to diverted prescription stimulants (legally prescribed mainly as anorectics or for the treat-ment of attention deficit disorders). High levels of con-sumption have been reported for 2009, in particular from Argentina, Brazil and, to a lesser extent, Chile. 31 Drug-related deaths Countries in South America, including the Caribbean and Central America, report relatively few drug-related deaths (between 2,200 and 6,300) with a mortality rate (between seven and 20 deaths per million aged 15-64) well below the global average. Countries consistently rank cocaine first as the primary cause of death, which is in accordance with high prevalence of cocaine use and the dominance of cocaine in treatment demand. c) Europe Production Illicit drug production in Europe is mainly linked to cannabis, amphetamines and ecstasy. Cannabis production in Europe is believed to be increasing, mostly in indoor settings. T wenty-nine European countries reported domestic cultivation of cannabis herb in 2008. In the past, ecstasy-group substances used to be manufactured predominantly in West Europe. The Netherlands and Belgium are still the main sources for ecstasy in Europe. However, manufacture has shifted away from the region and only a few laboratories were reported from Europe in 2008 and 2009. Most amphetamine seized in Europe is manufactured, in order of importance, in the Netherlands, Poland and Belgium. The clandestine manufacture of methamphetamine is concentrated in the Czech Republic, though some production is also taking place in the Baltic countries. Methamphetamine production and consumption are, however, still the exception in Europe. In Spain, there is some evidence of the reconversion of cocaine mixed with other substances back into cocaine. 31 INCB, Report for 2010 - Psychotropic Substances . In East Europe, notably in the Russian Federation and Ukraine, there is domestic production of opium or poppy straw for local consumption purposes ('kompot'). Trafficking Most cannabis seizures are related to cannabis resin in Europe, accounting for 49% of the global total in 2009. Cannabis resin found on the European market origi- nates primarily in Morocco. While cannabis resin sei- zures declined over the 2005-2009 period, those of cannabis herb increased by 88%, confirming reports of increasing levels of (often hydroponic) cannabis herb production within Europe for local consumption. Despite the increasing importance of cannabis herb, overall cannabis seizures declined by 19% between 2005 and 2009. Cocaine is trafficked to Europe mainly by sea, though in terms of reported seizure cases, deliveries by air are higher. The trafficking of cocaine into the EU by mari-time containers seems to have increased in recent years. While the European cocaine market appears to have been fairly stable between 2006 and 2009 - following strong increases in trafficking over the 1998-2006 period - cocaine seizures declined massively over this period (-53%). This partially reflects improved cooperation with law enforcement counterparts in Latin America and thus improved sharing of information, leading to seizures in South Americas rather than waiting for the cocaine to arrive in Europe. Cocaine seizures are still concentrated in western Europe. The countries of West and Central Europe accounted for 97% of all European cocaine seizures in 2009. In addition to direct shipments from South America, shipments via Africa, notably West Africa, gained strongly in importance over the 2004-2007 period, before decreasing over the 2007-2009 period. Though the Iberian peninsula, followed by the Netherlands and Belgium, continue to be main entry points for cocaine shipments into Europe, there have also been reports of shipping cocaine to the Balkan region (by container or air freight) for final destinations in the European Union. Heroin seizures made in Europe accounted for 38% of the world total in 2009. Heroin seizures are mostly con- centrated in South-East Europe (63% of all heroin sei-zures in Europe), mainly reflecting the strong seizure efforts of T urkey as heroin is shipped via the Islamic Republic of Iran to T urkey and then along the various branches of the 'Balkan route' to western Europe. While heroin seizures in West and Central Europe remained largely stable over the 2005-2009 period, they doubled in South-East Europe. Europe is primarily a region of final consumption - except for ecstasy, which is still produced locally and shipped to other destinations as well. Ecstasy exports out of Europe, however, have declined markedly in recent 39Overview of global and regional drug trends and patterns years, which has been linked to improvements in precur- sor control and thus shortages of the traditional ecstasy precursor. Europe's share in global ecstasy seizures declined from 90% in 1996 to 18% in 2009. Europe accounted for 24% of global amphetamine sei- zures in 2009. Amphetamine seizures remained largely stable over the 2005-2009 period. More than 80% of all European amphetamine seizures in 2009 took place in the countries of West and Central Europe. Seizures of benzodiazepines and barbiturates increased by more than 50% between 2005 and 2009. Close to 90% of all benzodiazepines and barbiturate seizures worldwide in 2009 were reported from countries in Europe. Seizures of GHB (gamma-hydroxybutyric acid), fre- quently known in the illicit drug markets as 'liquid ecstasy' and as a 'date rape drug,' increased four-fold in Europe over the 2005-2009 period. European seizures accounted for almost 80% of the world total. Seizures of LSD, which in volume terms are hardly noticeable, have shown a downward trend over the 2005-2009 period. Europe accounts for 80% all LSD seizures made worldwide. Illicit drug use The most prevalent drug in Europe is cannabis, showing an annual prevalence rate of 5.2%-5.3% among the population aged 15-64. Around 18% of the total canna-bis-using population lives in Europe. Following years of significant increases, cannabis use appears to have stabi- lized in Europe. Cocaine is the second most prevalent drug (0.8%-0.9%). With 4.3 - 4.75 million cocaine users, Europe accounts for almost 30% of all cocaine users worldwide. Cocaine use is still concentrated in West and Central Europe, accounting for some 90% of all cocaine users in Europe. Cocaine prevalence rates in West and Central Europe doubled between 1998 and 2006 but remained basically stable over the 2006-2009 period. The next most prevalent substance is ecstasy (0.7% of the population aged 15-64). With 3.7-4 million ecstasy users, Europe accounts for about one fifth of the global ecstasy-using population. Most European countries report stable trends of ecstasy use. Use of amphetamines affects some 2.5-3.2 million people in Europe, or 0.5-0.6% of the population aged 15-64. Most countries report stable trends in amphetamine use. Amphetamine remains the main amphetamines-group substance used in Europe. Methamphetamine use is mainly limited to the Czech Republic, though some consumption also occurs in neighbouring Slovakia, some of the provinces of Germany and Austria bordering the Czech Republic, as well as in the Baltic countries and some of the Nordic countries. If ecstasy and ampheta- mines-group use are combined, use of ATS constitutes the second most prominent drug group after cannabis. In contrast to other regions, non-medical use of pre- scription drugs has not been regarded as a major prob-lem in Europe so far. 32 Denmark, Estonia and Finland are countries with substantial or higher proportions of non-medical use of prescription opioids than heroin. The highest levels of non-medical use of prescription opioids so far have been reported from Northern Ireland (UK). Other countries in Europe reporting a substantial proportion of treatment demand for sedatives and tran- 32 EMCDDA, The State of Drugs Problem in Europe, Annual Report 2010.2005 2006 2007 2008 2009In % of global total 6.1 0.5 0.4 0.1 0.1 80% Memo: Population 808 million 12%Table Source: UNODC ARQ.40World Drug Report 2011 quillizers are found among the Nordic countries, nota- bly Sweden (11.6%), Norway (10.2%) and Finland (8.5%). The use of benzodiazepines is common among drug users all across Europe, including substitution treatment clients. Studies show that between 11% and 70% of clients report current use of benzodiazepines. 33 Drug-related deaths For Europe, the best estimates suggest that there are between 25,000 and 27,000 drug-related deaths annu-ally, with a rate between 46 and 48 deaths per one mil-lion people aged 15-64, though some estimates give substantially higher figures (about twice these numbers). Drug-related deaths due to overdose amounted to some 7,000 in the countries of the European Union in recent years, down from around 8,000 in 2000. 34 Opioids, mainly heroin, are predominantly ranked as the primary cause of death, followed - at much lower levels - by cocaine. Most drug-related deaths seem to occur in Ukraine, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom, Spain and Germany. Combined, these five countries account for some 80% of all reported drug-related deaths in Europe. In terms of mortality rates, Ukraine, Iceland, Ireland and Luxembourg seem to experience some of the highest levels in Europe, with over 100 drug-related deaths per one million inhabitants aged 15-64. d) Africa Production Illicit drug production in Africa is mainly focused on cannabis. While cannabis resin is mainly produced in Morocco, cannabis herb is produced all over Africa. Small-scale opium production is limited to countries in North Africa, notably Egypt, which regularly reports the largest eradication of opium poppy among all countries in Africa. ATS manufacture appears to be emerging in some Afri- can countries. For some time, methamphetamine and methcathinone production has been taking place in South Africa, basically for domestic use. Similarly, Egypt has reported clandestine manufacture of ATS for some years. This production only takes place at low levels and is intended for the domestic market. In contrast, recent reports of shipments of metham- phetamine from countries in West Africa (notably Nigeria) to various destinations in East and South-East Asia is an international concern, and suggest that a more professional ATS production has been emerging in West Africa. Some equipment and chemicals seized in Guinea 33 EMCDDA, Polydrug Use: Patterns and responses , Selected issues 2009. 34 EMCDDA, Statistical Bulletin , Number of drug-induced death recorded in EU Member States according to national definition, Dutal drug-induced deaths, 1995-2008. in 2010 might indicate possible ATS manufacture there. Finally, khat is cultivated in several East African coun- tries. Khat is not under international control, though a number of countries - including countries in Africa -have introduced national legislation to prohibit its cul-tivation and trafficking. Trafficking Most of the cannabis trafficking is for shipments across African countries. Only smaller amounts are destined for overseas markets, mainly in Europe. Most of the can-nabis resin production in North Africa is for final con-sumption in Europe. The largest seizures were reported for cannabis herb, followed by cannabis resin. Africa's share of global cannabis herb seizures amounts to 11% - and is thus below its share of the global population (15%), while its share in global cannabis resin seizures - mostly carried out by countries in North Africa - is equivalent to 25% of the world total. Africa has been affected by significant shipments of cocaine from South America to Europe in recent years. The amounts trafficked via Africa to Europe, however, seem to have decreased in 2008 and 2009, and only partly resumed in 2010. Estimates for 2009 suggest that some 35 mt of cocaine may have left South America for Africa of which some 21 mt actually arrived in Europe. Most of the rest appears to have been consumed locally. In addition, there are some indications that West Afri-can countries are being used to stockpile cocaine which is later trafficked in small quantities to Europe. In addition, African countries are increasingly being used by traffickers to ship Afghan heroin to final destinations in Europe and other regions. Though East Africa is reportedly the main intermediate target for these traf-ficking activities, African heroin seizures were highest in Southern Africa and North Africa. Estimates suggest that 40-45 mt of Afghan heroin was trafficked to Africa in 2009. Methamphetamine seizures have been reported from Nigeria and South Africa. For 2009, however, only South Africa reported such seizures, out of a total of four African countries reporting any ATS seizures in the ARQ. Approximately one half of the ATS seized in Africa was amphetamine. The paucity of the data does not allow for a reliable characterization for the continent as a whole. Several African countries appear to be affected by trafficking in, and consumption of, diverted or counterfeit prescription drugs containing controlled substances whose nature is not always clear, though they appear to include ATS as well as sedatives and tranquil-lizers. Illicit drug use Information on drug use in Africa is extremely limited, given the lack of scientific surveys in the region. The 41Overview of global and regional drug trends and patterns Table 7: Seizures in Africa, kilogram equivalents, 2005-2009 Source: UNODC ARQ. 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009In % of global total in 325 335 328 311 515 0.7% Opium 49 67 57 0.01% Population 1,009 million 15% *Not under international control. high level of uncertainty is reflected in the broad ranges around the best estimates. The available information suggests that cannabis use is widespread, and that other drugs are used as well, notably in urban areas. The limited information on drug-related treatment in Africa identified cannabis as the main problem drug, accounting for 64% of all treatment demand in the region. This is a far higher proportion for cannabis than in any other region. Cannabis was followed and tranquillizers (2%). Given the absence of information on overall drug use patterns, it is also difficult to estimate the extent of non-medical prescription drug use in the region. However, parallel markets exist in many African countries, where prescription drugs are sold outside the control of the health authorities. ARQ data suggest frequent non-medical use of prescription drugs such as buprenor-phine, pentazocine and benzodiazepines in several African countries. In Mauritius, the use of buprenor-phine was reported to be higher than heroin. In Mada-gascar, around 38% of the total treatment demand was for tranquillizers, second to cannabis (>60%). Similarly in South Africa, on average 6.9% of people in treatment reported prescription opioids and tranquillizers as either their primary or secondary drug of abuse. 35 Drug-related deaths Information on drug related deaths in Africa is also lim-ited. The best available estimates suggest that there could be between 13,000 and 41,700 drug-related deaths, equivalent to between 23 and 74 per one million 35 South African Community Epidemiology Network on Drug Use (SACENDU), Monitoring Alcohol and drug abuse trends in South Africa , SACENDU Research Brief Vol 13 (01), 2010.inhabitants aged 15-64. These figures would suggest that drug-related death in Africa is close to the global average. Estimates could of course change substantially were better data to become available. e) Asia Production The main illicit drug produced in Asia is opium. The two largest opium-producing countries are Afghanistan and Myanmar. Though the proportion of Asian opium production in the global total declined from 98% in 2007 to 87% in 2010, Asian opium continues to domi-nate the world opium and thus also the world heroin market. While Afghan opium production declined over the 2007-2010 period, production in Myanmar increased. Cannabis production is widespread across Asia, includ- ing cannabis resin production in Afghanistan and its neighbours in South-West Asia and Central Asia, and cannabis herb production in East and South-East Asia, and South Asia. The preliminary UNODC/Govern-ment of Afghanistan cannabis survey found cannabis resin production of 1,200-3,700 mt in Afghanistan in 2010, and Afghanistan was worldwide the second most frequently mentioned source country for cannabis resin shipments after Morocco. Seizures of cannabis plants - an indirect indicator of cannabis eradication - were higher in Asia 2009 than in North America, Europe or Oceania. Only South America showed higher figures. Asia also plays a major role in the clandestine manufac- ture of ATS, notably of methamphetamine. Metham- phetamine manufacture is mainly concentrated in East and South-East Asia, including the Philippines, China, Malaysia and Myanmar. In addition, since 2009, the Islamic Republic of Iran appears to have emerged as a significant location for the clandestine manufacture of 42World Drug Report 2011 methamphetamine. Limited production of ecstasy also takes place in Asia, notably East and South-East Asia, including Malaysia, China and Indonesia. ATS produc-tion is mainly for consumption within the region. Exports to other regions (with the exception of a few exports to Oceania) hardly take place. Trafficking T rafficking in Asia is dominated by opium and heroin, which are smuggled to final destinations within the region as well as to Europe (from Afghanistan) and China (from Myanmar), though some Afghan opiates also find their way to China (up to 30% of Chinese demand). Overall, Asian opium exports accounted for more than 99% of the world total. Similarly, morphine seizures made in Asia accounted for more than 99% of the world total. More than half of all heroin seizures (56% in 2009) were made by Asian countries. In line with the much larger opium production of Afghanistan compared to Myanmar, opiate seizures have been far larger for the countries surrounding Afghanistan (nota-bly the Islamic Republic of Iran and Pakistan) than for the countries surrounding Myanmar. Cannabis herb seizures in Asia amounted to just 6% of the world total. In contrast, cannabis resin seizures accounted for 24% of the world total in 2009. Cannabis herb and resin seizures in Asia both showed upward trends over the 2005-2009 period (60% and 30%, respectively). A breakdown shows that 98% of Asian can-nabis resin seizures in 2009 took place in the Near and Middle East/South-West Asia. Cannabis herb seizures, in contrast, occurred primarily in South Asia (53% of all Asian seizures) and in East and South-East Asia (36%). In addition, Asia has developed into a major production and trafficking hub for ATS, accounting for 64% of all such seizures worldwide in 2009. Amphetamine seizures (mainly Captagon) happen primarily in the Near and Middle East, notably the Arabian peninsula, accounting for almost all Asian amphetamine seizures. Metham-phetamine seizures, in contrast, affect primarily East and South-East Asia (95% of all Asian methamphetamine seizures). Both amphetamine and methamphetamine seizures increased in Asia over the 2005-2009 period (by 59% and 36%, respectively). Ecstasy seizures, in contrast, declined over the 2005- 2009 period (-58%), which is also in line with reports of improved ecstasy precursor controls. The importance of Asian ecstasy seizures in the global total (9%) is much lower than for the amphetamines. A problem, for countries in East and South-East Asia as well as South Asia, is the increasing popularity of keta- mine, a drug used mainly in veterinary medicine for its analgesic properties. It is not under international con- trol. Ketamine is sometimes sold as 'ecstasy' or mixed with MDMA. Seizures of ketamine tripled over the 2005-2009 period and were in 2009 - in volume terms - some 20 times larger than ecstasy seizures in Asia. Asia accounted for 99% of global ketamine seizures in 2009. Most of the ketamine is produced in the region. Cocaine seizures reported in Asia accounted for just 0.1% of the global total. Nonetheless, except for coun-tries in Central Asia, all other subregions reported sei-zures of cocaine in recent years. Relative concentrations of cocaine trafficking seem to exist in East and South-East Asia as well as in the Near and Middle East. Illicit drug use Information on illicit drug use is only slightly better in Asia than in Africa, which also results in broad ranges around the best estimates. 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009In % of global total in 2009 2005-2009 Source: UNODC ARQ.43Overview of global and regional drug trends and patterns Cannabis is the most widely consumed drug in Asia. Despite national differences, overall cannabis use is, however, rather low in Asia, clearly below the global average. While cannabis resin is mostly used in Afghan-istan and Lebanon and their respective neighbouring countries, cannabis herb is mainly used in South and South-East Asia. The second most widely consumed drug type in Asia is the amphetamines, that is, methamphetamine in East and South-East Asia and amphetamine on the Arabian peninsula. Available information suggests that the use of amphetamines increased in recent years. Asian countries reported mixed trends of ecstasy use. Estimates regarding ecstasy, however, must be treated with caution. Substances other than MDMA are often sold as 'ecstasy' in Asia. By far the most problematic group of substances for most Asian countries are the opiates. It is estimated that more than half of the world's opiate-using population lives in Asia. Opiate prevalence rates are particularly high in the main opium-producing regions as well as in some of their neighbouring countries. The highest esti-mates of opiate consumption are found in the countries of South-West Asia. Cocaine use in Asia is still limited, though there are regular reports that organized crime groups are trying to develop the market, notably in some of the richer parts of Asia, where sufficient purchasing power exists. Due to the absence of regular prevalence studies for the majority of countries in Asia, information on non-med-ical use of prescription drugs is scattered and limited. Available reports nonetheless indicate substantial non- medical use of prescription opioids, tranquillizers and amphetamines in many Asian countries. In Bangladesh, Nepal and India, buprenorphine is com- monly injected. In South-West and Central Asia, among the regular heroin users, the non-medical use of pre-scription opioids, barbiturates and sedatives has been a commonly observed phenomenon. In Afghanistan, an annual prevalence rate of 0.5% for prescription opioids and 0.4% for tranquillizers was reported among the adult population. The annual prevalence of tranquillizer use was about the same among the male and female populations, while other drug use is far more male- dominated. 36 In South-East Asia, along with the use of ATS, the non-medical use of tranquillizers - especially benzodiazepines - is widely reported from various countries in the region, including Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines and Singapore. In the Republic of Korea and the Philippines, prescription opiates are the predomi- 36 UNODC, Drug Use in Afghanistan: 2009 Survey.nantly used opioids. Increased use of synthetic and pre- scription drugs has also been reported in a number of countries, including Jordan, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. In Kuwait, for instance, around 16% of treat-ment demand was related to the use of sedatives and tranquillizers. Drug-related deaths Asia has the largest uncertainty in the estimated range of drug-related deaths: between 6 and 51 deaths per one million persons aged 15-64. This needs to be interpreted with caution, considering the lower coverage and report-ing of mortality data. Nevertheless, due to the consider-able population in Asia, this translates to between 15,000 and 140,000 deaths. In Asia, opioids are almost exclusively reported as the primary substance in drug-related deaths. f) Oceania Production Drug production in Oceania is limited to the cultivation of the cannabis plant, mainly for the production of can-nabis herb. Cannabis production takes place in Aus-tralia, New Zealand and most of the small island countries. Cannabis production is for local consump-tion and there is no information on exports to other regions. In addition, ATS production has started to gain promi- nence over the last decade. This is mainly metham-phetamine and, to a lesser extent, ecstasy. In addition, some amphetamine is also produced. ATS production is concentrated in Australia and, to a lesser extent, New Zealand. Trafficking The amounts of drugs seized in Oceania tend to be very small by international standards. Seizures of cannabis herb continued to decline over the 2005-2009 period and account for just 0.02% of the world total - far less than the share of the population of the Oceania region in the global total (0.5%). This is surprising as Oceania has one of the world's highest cannabis use prevalence rates. The second largest seizures in volume terms were of cocaine, accounting for 0.04% of global seizures. Cocaine seizures increased over the 2005-2008 period, but declined again in 2009. Cocaine is trafficked from South America to Australia, though some recent arrests suggest that Mexican drug cartels may have started to show an interest in the potentially lucrative Australian cocaine market (due to high cocaine prices). The proportion of Oceania in the global total is higher when it comes to ATS. Seizures of amphetamines-group substances accounted for 0.4% of the world total. 44World Drug Report 2011 Amphetamines-group seizures declined by some 85% between 2006 and 2009. The decline was even more pronounced for ecstasy sei- zures, falling by 96% between 2005 and 2009, or by 99% between 2007 and 2009. Nonetheless, with a share in global seizures of 1.2%, ecstasy continues to play an above-average role in this region. Significant amounts of ecstasy - by local standards - are still being smuggled into Oceania (notably Australia) from Europe and South-East Asia, in addition to domestic supply. The importance of heroin seizures in Oceania is also modest (0.3% of global seizures). Heroin seizures, how- ever, showed a clear increase over the 2006-2009 period but were nonetheless some 80% lower than in 2000. LSD seizures declined by some 95% between 2005 and 2009, but LSD was the only substance where Oceania accounted for a substantial share of global drug seizures (16%). Illicit drug use Illicit drug use in Oceania is generally characterized by high prevalence rates, notably for cannabis (9.3%-14.8% of the population aged 15-64), but also for ATS, both ecstasy (3.6%-4%) and amphetamines (2%-2.8%), as well as for cocaine (1.4%-1.7%). Only the prevalence rate for opiates (0.2%) is below the global average - a lasting result of the 'heroin drought' in 2001. At the same time, much progress has been made over the last decade in reducing the prevalence rates. This was particularly true for the opiates, but also for cannabis. Use of ecstasy and cocaine increased. More recently, all indicators show a stabilization of drug use. Though annual drug use prevalence rates are high, per capita consumption of drugs among drug users tends to be low in Oceania, notably for cocaine. Very high drug prices may explain this. Non-medical use of prescription drugs also appears to be widespread in Oceania, and it seems to be mainly linked to some prescription amphetamines and prescription opioids. In Australia, there is substantial non-medical use of both amphetamines (2.7%) and prescription opioids (0.2%) among the general population. Use of tranquillizers is also common. Among students aged 12-17, 16.2% had used tranquillizers without a doctor's prescription in their lifetime. This compares with a lifetime prevalence of 3.8% for amphetamines among students, and 2.3% who had used opiates in their lifetime. 37 Widespread non-medical use of prescription drugs was also reported by New Zealand. Drug-related deaths For Oceania, although the total number of drug-related deaths is small (approximately 2,800 deaths), the mor-tality rate seems to be rather high, at 119 deaths per one million inhabitants aged 15-64. Since Australia is the only reporting country, this rate probably does not reflect the situation across Oceania. Moreover, Australia has a better drug-death registration system than many other countries. 37 White V. and Smith G., Australian secondary school students' use of tobacco, alcohol, and over-the-counter and illicit substance in 2008 , Drug Strategy Branch, Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing, September 2009.2005 2006 2007 2008 2009In % of global Cannabis herb 3,514 2,845 2,730 1,445 Heroin 152 67 65 80 195 0.3%LSD 0.67 0.13 0.13 0.00 0.03 16% Memo: Population 2005-2009 The opium/heroin market 45 2.1 Introduction UNODC estimates that there were between 12 and 21 million opiate users worldwide in 2009. Heroin remains the most commonly used opiate, consumed by a vast majority of global opiate users (about 75%). In 2009, an estimated 12-14 million heroin users consumed some 375 mt of heroin. Europe and Asia remain the key opiate consumption markets. However, a range of opiates are consumed worldwide, including raw opium, morphine and local types of opiates . 1 Consumption of these substances is limited and generally confined to certain geographical areas. In recent years, problem drug use has also been related to the non-medical use of various prescription opioids, such as oxycodone, fentanyl or pethidine. Global opium poppy cultivation amounted to some 195,700 ha in 2010, a 5% increase from 2009, mainly driven by increased cultivation in Myanmar. Cultivation in the Lao People's Democratic Republic increased in 2010, but remains at a low level. Over the last three years, although cultivation in Afghanistan has declined, it remains high (63% of global cultivation). The area under opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan was esti-mated at some 123,000 ha in 2010, the same level as 2009. Global opium production amounted to 4,860 mt in 2010, compared to 7,853 mt the year before. This was largely due to a drastic reduction in Afghanistan's opium production as a result of a disease in opium poppy 1 Produced by mixing locally grown opium poppy with acetic anhy- dride.plants. Forecasts for Afghan production in 2011, based on UNODC's Winter Rapid Assessment (February 2011), project a further small decline or at least a stabilization of overall opium poppy cultivation at the lower levels. Moreover, if the opium yield returns to the average level, it is likely that opium production will increase in Afghanistan in 2011. On the basis of production, seizure and consumption data, an estimated 460-480 mt of heroin were trafficked (including seizures) worldwide in 2009. Of this, 375 mt reached the consumers. Opiate trafficking from produc-tion countries to consumer markets requires a global network of routes as well as facilitation by domestic and international criminal groups. In particular, traffickers' use of maritime transportation and seaports has been identified as a key emerging threat - one which is largely overlooked by international law enforcement. In 2009, more than 420 million containers were shipped world- wide, yet only 2% of these were inspected. Although the trafficking routes are constantly changing, the global movement of heroin from producers to international consumers follows well-established paths. Heroin from Myanmar is mainly trafficked to China and Mexican heroin is mainly trafficked to the United States of Amer-ica, while Afghan heroin is trafficked to every region of the world, except South and Central America. Opiates flow from Afghanistan through Pakistan, the Islamic Republic of Iran and Central Asia before moving to the main consumer markets in West and Central Europe, East Europe, and East and South-East Asia. Opiate users generated an estimated US$68 billion in revenue for traffickers in 2009 - with around US$60 billion from Afghan opiates. Local anti-government ele-46World Drug Report 2011 ments and criminal networks profit from the opiate trade in Afghanistan and neighbouring countries, but the bulk of the profits benefit international drug traf-fickers. According to conservative estimates (with a 10% net-profit margin 2) organized crime groups made net profits of at least US$7 billion from the opiate trade. Organized crime is a threat to political stability, public security and health in transit and destination countries. The underground economy produced by the global opiate trade is undermining legal economies and fuel-ling corruption in some countries. Opiates, especially heroin, also cause serious health problems, including the transmission of blood-borne infections such as HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis C. 2.2 Consumption UNODC estimates that between 12 and 21 (midpoint: 16.5) million people used opiates at least once in the past year 3 in 2009, with an annual prevalence rate between 0.3% and 0.5% of the world's population aged 15-64. Although this section mainly analyses global 'opiate' consumption (heroin and opium), other opio-ids 4 are also considered as some Member States only provide overall opioid statistics rather than individual heroin or opium prevalence rates through the Annual Reports Questionnaire (ARQ). 5 Heroin is the most commonly used opiate, consumed by some three quarters of global opiate users. There were an estimated 12-14 million heroin users worldwide in 2009. A range of opiates are consumed worldwide, how-ever, including raw opium, morphine and local types of opiates, such as kompot or cherniashka. 6 Raw opium consumption is largely restricted to some parts of Asia, kompot or cherniashka are consumed almost exclusively in East Europe, and illicit morphine has an extremely limited consumer base. In recent years, the non-medical use of various prescription opioids 7 has increased in 2 T his is a minimum profit margin. It could be much higher, but needs to be studied in detail. 3 T his refers to the year prior to which the national estimates were derived and not necessarily the year 2009. 4 O pioid is a generic term applied to alkaloids from opium poppy, their synthetic analogues, and compounds synthesized in the body. In general, a distinction is made between 'opiates' (that is, the vari-ous products derived from the opium poppy plant including opium, morphine and heroin) and synthetic opioids. For the purpose of description in this section (and in line with the new Annual Report Questionnaire), 'opiates' in this section only refer to opium and heroin while 'prescription opioids' include morphine and codeine as as methadone, buprenorphine, pro-poxyphene, fentanyl, pentazocine, et cetera. 5 T he ARQ used by Member States until 2010 included the broad cat- egory of opioids and the sub-categories of heroin, opium and 'other opioids.' The new ARQ approved by Member States in 2010 added the category 'misuse of prescription opioids' to the 'other opioids.' 6 P roduced by mixing locally grown poppy with acetic anhydride 7 S uch as oxycodone, fentanyl, or pethidine and in some instances the use of substitution opioids such as buprenorphine or methadone.some countries, becoming one of the drug groups affect- ing problem drug users. In terms of absolute numbers of users, most opioid users are in the Americas, particularly in North America, fol-lowed by Asia and Europe. However, if only opiate use is considered, more than half of the world's estimated opiate (heroin and opium) users are in Asia, followed by Europe and Africa. The global pattern of opioid use varies considerably by region. In the Americas and Oce-ania (New Zealand and Australia, in particular) the use of prescription opioids constitutes the main problem, while the use of heroin is limited. In Europe, in contrast, heroin is the main opiate used, with limited non-medi-cal use of prescription opioids reported. 8 In traditional opium-cultivating countries and some of their neighbours, opium use is more common than heroin use. This is particularly true in Afghanistan, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Myanmar and the Islamic Republic of Iran. In Africa and Asia, while heroin is the main opiate used, there are reports indicat-ing that non-medical use of prescription opioids is increasingly common in some countries. In 2009, heroin users worldwide consumed some 375 mt of pure heroin. 9 In Asia, the vast majority of heroin consumption occurred in China, Pakistan, the Islamic Republic of Iran and India. 10 In the Americas, the United States of America dominated heroin consump-tion. In Europe, several countries, including the Russian Federation 11, the United Kingdom, Italy, France and Germany, are key heroin consumption countries. In Africa, consumption is mainly concentrated in East, West and Central Africa. Raw opium consumption is much more limited than heroin consumption, both in terms of number of users and geographic reach. In 2008, there were an estimated 4 million opium users worldwide, who consumed 1.1 mt of opium. 12 Of the total number of global users, the vast majority - accounting for more than 80% of global consumption - was in Asia. Cultural practices and tradi-tion may explain the concentration of opium use in Asia. Opium smoking is a traditional practice in some South-West Asian and South Asian countries, especially the Islamic Republic of Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan and India, as well as in some areas of South-East Asia, nota- 8 T he extent of prescription opioid use in Europe needs to be further investigated. 9 ' Pure heroin' refers to heroin of 70% purity, which is roughly equiva- lent to 2,600 mt of heroin of 10% purity. 10 UNODC, Addiction, Crime and Insurgency: The transnational threat of Afghan opium , 2009. 11 B ased on preliminary estimates by UNODC, since there are no comprehensive studies on prevalence of opiate use in the Russian Federation. 12 U NODC, Addiction, Crime and Insurgency : The transnational threat of Afghan opium, 2009.49The opium/heroin market Despite far higher levels of non-medical use of prescrip- tion opioids, treatment data suggest that the USA is still facing a serious heroin problem: 71% of all opioid-related treatment admissions in 2008 were due to heroin use. But data also showed that treatment for heroin use remained stable over the last decade, while treatment admissions related to prescription opioids increased strongly, raising its share in total opioid-related treat-ment admissions from 7% in 1998 to 29% in 2008. With regard to Emergency Department visits, data for 2009 suggest that more visits are related to the non-medical use of prescription opioids (narcotic analgesics: 129.4 visits per 100,000 people) than to the use of heroin (69 visits per 100,000 people). 15 However, in 2009, data from the US household survey showed a stronger increase in heroin use than non-medical use of prescription opioids. The number of heroin users identified via the household survey rose by 33% compared to 2008, while the number of users of prescription opioids rose by 4%. None of these increases 15 US Department of Health and Human Services, Highlights of the 2009 Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) Findings on Drug-Related Emergency Department Visits, 2009.Opioids and opiates There are a number of terms used in this chapter in relation to opiates, opioids, synthetic opioids et cetera. The purpose of this box is to clarify the technical definition of these terms and explain the terminology used in present-ing the data in this chapter. Technical definition Opium is produced by the poppy plants and it contains psychoactive substances including morphine, codeine, thebaine, papaverine and noscapine. Opium, together with its psychoactive constituents and their semi-synthetic derivatives, for example heroin (derived from morphine) are described as opiates. Opioid is a generic term applied to two main sets of substances: opiates and synthetic substances (called synthetic opioids), with actions similar to those of morphine, in particular the capacity to relieve pain. The synthetic opioids include substances such as fen-tanyl, methadone, buprenorphine, propoxyphene, pentazocine and oxycodone. Another group of substances included in the generic category of opioids is the endogenous opioids, for example, the endorphins (endogenous morphine) and enkephalins. These are naturally produced by the human body and have actions similar to morphine. Some of these substances, such as the enkephalins, have been synthesized and are available from commercial sources. Data presented on drug use in relation to opiates and opioids Data on drug use provided by Member States, have traditionally included the generic category of opioid users and the sub-classification of heroin users, opium users and users of 'other opiates.' In 2010, the Commission on Narcotic Drugs approved a new questionnaire (Annual Report Questionnaire, ARQ) for future data reporting. The ARQ includes the generic category for opioid use and three sub-categories defined as i) use of opiates (heroin and opium), ii) non-medical use of prescription opioids and other illicit opioids. While morphine and codeine are technically classified as opiates, it is important to note that these have been placed under the sub-category of 'prescription opioids' for the purposes of data reporting to UNODC.

Trends in the world drug markets Opium / heroin market were, however, statistically significant. Nonetheless, the number of first-time heroin users also increased strongly. Around 180,000 persons aged 12 or older had used heroin for the first time within the past 12 months. The number of first-time heroin users in 2009 was signifi-cantly higher than the 2002-2008 average, which was slightly above 100,000. 16 Furthermore, an estimated 2 million people aged 12 years or older had initiated their drug use with prescrip-tion pain relievers. Of these, 55.3% obtained the drug from a friend or relative for free, 17.6% from a doctor, 4.8% from a drug dealer or other stranger, and 0.4% bought them on the Internet. 17 In 2009, non-medical use of prescription opioids in Canada was reported at 0.5%, the same level as 2008, 16 SAMHSA, National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), 2009. 17 Ibid.Region/subregionEstimated number of users annually (lower)-Estimated number of users annually (upper)Percent of population aged 15-64 (lower)-Percent of population aged 15-64 0.2 - 0.2 Global 11,660,000 - 20,660,000 0.3 - 0.5 Table 10: Annual prevalence and estimated number of opiate users,* by region, subregion and globally, 2009 *Opiate estimates for Europe - where countries reported only opioid estimates - were derived by using the distribution of opiat e users within the overall number of opioid users in treatment.

Of the injecting drug users participat-ing in a behavioural surveillance study in Canada in 2006, half of the participants reported injecting non-prescribed morphine, while 27.6% reported injecting heroin in the months prior to the interview. 19 In line with results in other countries, the seroprevalence for HIV among the participants was 13.4% while that of Hepatitis C was 65.7%. 20 In South America, the annual prevalence of opioid use (mainly non-medical use of prescription opioids) is esti-mated at between 0.3 - 0.4% of the adult population, or between 850,000 - 940,000 people aged 15 - 64. The Plurinational State of Bolivia (0.6%), Brazil (0.5%) and Chile (0.5%) remain countries with high opioid use rates. In Central America, Costa Rica's rate is higher than the global average (2.8%). In South and Central America, codeine-based preparations are among the most commonly used opioids. T reatment demand in the entire region has remained stable over the past few years. In 2009, 9.6% of treatment cases were related to opioid use. 18 Estimated by UNODC, based on 1% prevalence of injecting drug use (estimated 220,690 IDU in 2004) reported by the Reference group to the UN on HIV and injecting drug use, 2008. 19 Public Health Agency of Canada, Enhanced Surveillance of Risk Behaviours among injecting drug users in Canada, Phase I Report, 2006. 20 Ibid.Despite stabilizing heroin consumption levels in Europe, associated social and health problems are not diminishing Heroin is the main opiate used in Europe. Opiate (mainly heroin) prevalence in Europe21 is estimated at 0.6% of the population aged 15-64, or between 3.1 and 3.5 million people. At 0.9% - 1.0%, the opiate use prevalence in East and South-East Europe is higher than in West Europe. Overall, experts from more than half of the countries in Europe reporting through the ARQ perceived opioid trends to be stable. New or updated prevalence estimates for a number of countries in Europe were published in 2010, including Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg and Sweden. Among these, Ireland and Sweden reported an increase in the annual prevalence rates, while other countries reported stable opioid use trends. The highest opioid use prevalence rates in West and Central Europe were reported from the United King-dom (estimated 350,000 users), Italy (216,000 users) and France (190,000 users). In East Europe, the Russian Federation (1.7 million opiate users) 22 and Ukraine (370,000 opiate users) had high opiate prevalence rates in 2009. Most of the users in the above-mentioned countries are heroin users. 21 Opiate estimates for Europe - where countries reported only opioid estimates - were derived by using the distribution of opiate users within the overall number of opioid users in treatment. 22 These estimates are preliminary, since there are no comprehensive studies on prevalence of opiate users in the Russian Federation. The estimate of opiate users ranges from 0.3% - 1.64% of the population aged 15-64. The estimate of 1.64% is based on the number of opiate users in treatment for 2007, using a treatment multiplier of 5.3% taken from a study conducted by the National Addiction Centre of the Russian Federation: Dynamics of Drug Related Disorders in the Russian Federation, 2007.Fig. 14: Drugs injected by drug users in Canada, 2006 Source: Public Health Agency of Canada, Enhanced Surveil- lance of Risk Behaviours among injecting drug users in Canada, Phase I Report, 2006. 77.545.932.931.927.6 0 2 04 06 08 0 1 0 0CocaineM orphineHydromorphoneCrackHeroin /g39/g85/g88/g74/g86/g3/g76/g81/g77/g72/g70/g87/g72/g71/g3/g11/g8/g12Fig. 15: Countries with revised estimates of annual prevalence of opioid use in Europe, various years Source: UNODC ARQ. 0.210.20.220.270.270.50.72 0.17 0.23 00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.8 Belgium '08 Germany '07 Germany '08 Greece '07 Greece '08 Ireland '01 Ireland '06 Sweden '04 Sweden '0752World Drug Report 2011 Of the 1 million people in Europe who received treat- ment for illicit drug use in 2007, more than half received opioid substitution treatment (mainly methadone, to a lesser extent buprenorphine and, in some countries, slow-release morphines). Like in the past, heroin and its metabolites were reported as the main cause of the majority of drug-induced deaths in Europe, accounting for more than two thirds of all cases reported from 20 countries. The average age of those who died due to heroin use was the mid-thirties, suggesting a stabiliza-tion or decrease in the number of young heroin users in Europe. The EMCDDA Annual Report 2010 suggests that for each drug-induced death, there are an estimated 20-25 non-fatal overdose cases. Heroin use is stabilizing in East and South-East Asia, but is perceived to be increasing in some other parts of Asia Asian opiate prevalence estimates range between 0.2 and 0.5% of the population aged 15-64, or an estimated 6.5 to 13.2 million people. Most of the opiate users in Asia reportedly use heroin or opium, and more than half of the world's estimated opiate users live in Asia. Although recent prevalence estimates are not available for most countries in Asia, less than half (46%) of the countries that responded to the ARQ perceived an increase in opioid use. However, 38% of the responding countries, mostly in South-East Asia, perceived a decrease in 2009. Countries in South-West Asia continue to have high prevalence rates for opiate use. Together, these countries account for nearly one third of opiate users in Asia. In Afghanistan, around 60% of the estimated opiate users use opium. In the Islamic Republic of Iran, 40% of the estimated opiate users consume opium, and the rest mainly consume heroin. In the Islamic Republic of Iran, 83% of treatment admissions in 2009 were for opiate use, in Pakistan, the share was 41% in 2006/2007. Opi-ates are also the most common cause of drug-related deaths reported in these countries. In the Islamic Repub-lic of Iran, the rate of drug-related deaths was 91 per 1 million people aged 15-64; the majority of these related to opiate use. Moreover, overall opiate use in Afghani-stan increased from 1.4% in 2005 to 2.7% of the popu-lation aged 15-64 in 2009. Heroin remains the most problematic illicit drug in Central Asia and the Cauca-sus. Experts in Central Asia perceived a stabilizing trend of opioid use, but the proportion of officially registered heroin users continued to increase, with 47% of regis-tered drug users in Kyrgyzstan identifying themselves as Fig. 16: Prevalence of opioid use in West and Central Europe, 2009 or most recent year available Source: UNODC. 0.400.400.410.460.470.550.570.590.600.610.720.740.750.811.521.59 WalesEstoniaUK: Scotland Fig. 17: Prevalence of opiate use in East Europe, 2009 or most recent year available *Based on preliminary estimates by UNODC, since there are no comprehensive studies on prevalence of opiate use in the Russian Federation.

With the exception of Azerbaijan, opioids is also the main sub-stance group reported in drug-related death cases in the region, with rates ranging from 7 per million people aged 15-64 in Uzbekistan to 115 in Kazakhstan. Although most of the countries in South Asia lack recent opiate use estimates, use levels seem to vary in the region. 23 UNODC, Compendium of drug related statistics: 2009, Regional Office for Central Asia, 2009. 24 Ibid.A 2006 study of drugs and HIV in South Asia25 found that 90% of the drug users interviewed in Bangladesh and 2% in Bhutan were currently using heroin (either smoking or injecting). Additionally, among the respond-ents, the use of prescription opioids ranged from 1% in Bhutan and Sri Lanka to 20% in India. Heroin injection was most common among drug users in Nepal, followed closely by those in India. In East and South-East Asia, opiates continue to be used at high rates. In 2009, heroin ranked as the main drug used in China, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore and Viet Nam. Most countries in the region have reported stable 25 UNODC, Rapid Situation and Response Assessment of Drugs and HIV in Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal and Sri Lanka: A regional Report , 2006.Fig. 18: Treatment demand in Europe, 2009 or most recent year available* Source : UNODC ARQ. * Treatment definitions and data reporting differ from country to country.

With an estimated prevalence of 0.18% of the population aged 15 and above, 28 heroin use in Myanmar is less widespread than opium use. T reatment demand for heroin dependence remains high across East and South-East Asia, ranging from 50% of all treatment demand in Singapore to around 80% in China and 98% in Viet Nam. Opiate use remains low in the Middle East The opiate prevalence rate remains low in countries in the Middle East, with heroin being the main opiate consumed. In terms of treatment demand, heroin and 26 UNODC, Patterns and Trends of Amphetamine-Type Stimulants and other Drugs: Asia and the Pacific , Global SMART Programme, 2010 27 UNODC, South-East Asia Opium Survey 2010: Lao Myanmar , 2010. 28 Ibid.prescription opioids are reported as the primary sub- stances in many countries, including Oman (100%), the Syrian Arab Republic (95%), United Arab Emirates (64%) and Lebanon (57%). Opiates are also ranked as the main substance among drug-related deaths, with rates ranging from 4.6 per million people aged 15-64 in the United Arab Emirates to 44.3 in Bahrain. 29 Heroin use in Africa is perceived to be increasing In 2009, the annual prevalence of opiate use in Africa was estimated at between 0.2% and 0.6% of the popula- tion aged 15-64, or 890,000-3.2 million people. The wide range reflects missing data from most parts of the continent. Heroin remains the main opiate used in Africa, but there are reports of common non-medical use of prescription opioids in some countries. The majority of African countries that provided infor- mation to UNODC reported that opioid use has increased. In 2009, 60% of the countries that responded to the ARQ reported an increase in the use of opioids in 29 UNODC ARQ.

In East Africa, Mauritius (0.91%) and Kenya (0.73%) have high prevalence rates for heroin use. However, at 1.04%, non-medical use of prescription opioids in Mau-ritius is higher than heroin use. In 2009, a survey of alcohol and drug use was conducted in 4,500 house-holds in the coastal provinces of Kenya; the prevalence of heroin use was reported at 1.9% of the population, with a higher prevalence of 2.5% among young adults aged 18-25. 31 Injecting drug use, especially of heroin, is reportedly common among drug users in Kenya, and the HIV seroprevalence rate for this group was found to be very high, 42.9%. 32 Although there are currently no reliable estimates of opiate use in the United Republic of Tanzania, increas-ing trends of injecting heroin have been reported, espe-cially from the coastal areas. An HIV seroprevalence study conducted in 2006 showed HIV seroprevalence levels at 27% among male and 58% among female injecting drug users. 33 Similarly, in a study of HIV among drug users in Zanzibar, injecting drug users 30 UNODC ARQ. 31 NACADA, Report of Survey on Drugs and Substance Abuse in Coast Province, Kenya, March 2010. 32 Mathers, B., Degenhardt, L., Phillips, B., Wiessing, L., Hickman, M., Strathdee, A., Wodak, A., Panda, S., Tyndall, M., Toufik, A. and Mattick, R., on behalf of the Reference Group to the United Nations on HIV and Injecting Drug Use, 'Global epidemiology of injecting drug use and HIV among people who inject drugs: a systematic review', The Lancet, 2008; 372:1733-1745. 33 Timpson, S., et al, 'Substance abuse, HIV risk and HIV and AIDS in Tanzania,' African Journal of Drug and Alcohol Studies , 5(2), 2006.accounted for 46% of those interviewed, with 30% HIV infected and 22% showing positive Hepatitis C sero- prevalence.34 In 2009, the opiate prevalence rate (mainly heroin) was estimated to have increased from 0.57% to 0.70% in Nigeria. This means that Nigeria would host almost 500,000 - 600,000 heroin users. 34 Dahoma , J., et al, 'HIV and substance abuse: the dual epidemics challenging Zanzibar,' African Journal of Drug and Alcohol Studies , 5(2), 2006.Fig. 20: Number of injecting drug users and HIV seroprevalence in West, Central and South Asia, most recent year available Source: Reference Group to the United Nations on HIV and Injecting Drug North Africa Southern Africa West and Central AfricaAnnual prevalence (as %)Fig. 21: Annual prevalence of opiate use in Africa, by region, 2009 Source: UNODC ARQ.56World Drug Report 2011 Opiates already constitute the main drug group users seek treatment for in many countries in the region, rang-ing from 81% of those treated in Mauritius, 55% in Mozambique, 45% in Seychelles and 33% in the United Republic of Tanzania. Among the limited countries reporting mortality data, opiates were also ranked as the main substance group responsible for drug-related deaths. Stable trend of heroin use in Oceania In 2007, 0.4% of the population aged 15-64 in Aus- tralia, around 57,000 people, were reported to have used heroin, street methadone and/or other opioids in the preceding 12 months. In 2008, 1.7% of students aged 12-17 who participated in the Australian secondary school survey had used opioids, other than for medical reasons. 35 The Illicit Drug Reporting System (IDRS) in Australia showed that heroin continues to be the main drug of choice among injecting drug users. After a strong decline in 2001, the proportion of such users reporting heroin as the last drug or the drug injected most often declined again over the 2004-2006 period. Since then, however, there has been a steady increase in heroin use among injecting drug users, from 27% in 2006 to 43% in 2009, which could be an early indication that the stabi-lization of heroin use in Australia may be coming to an end. The proportions of injecting drug users consuming heroin are, however, still substantially lower than in 35 White V. and Smith, G., Australian secondary school students 'use of tobacco, alcohol, and over the counter and illicit substances in 2008 , Drugs Strategy Branch, Australian Department of Health and Ageing.2000 (58%).36 Furthermore, morphine, followed by oxycodone, remained the most commonly injected pre- scription opioids among injecting drug users. The HIV seroprevalence among injecting drug users in Australia remained low, at 1.5% over the 2005-2008 period, while the Hepatitis C (HCV) seroprevalence was reported at 63%. 37 The rate of HCV seroprevalence was even higher among drug users who reported heroin or 36 Rainsford, C., Lenton, S. and Fetherston, J., 'Indicators of chang- ing trends in heroin and other opioid use in IDRS data nationally and in Western Australia,' Drug Trends Bulletin , April 2010, Sydney: National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, University of New South Wales. 37 UNODC ARQ.Opioids, 18.9 %Cocaine, 5.0 % ATS Africa, 2009 or most recent year available* * Treatment definitions and data reporting differ from country to country.

While Afghanistan continued to account for the bulk of the cultivation, some 123,000 ha, increased cultivation in Myanmar was the main driver behind the global increase. In the 3-year period since 2007, opium cultivation in Afghanistan has actually declined, although it remains at high levels. Cultivation in Myanmar and Mexico has increased significantly. In 2006, opium poppy cultiva-tion in Myanmar was 21,500 ha; the lowest since 1996. Since then, it has been steadily increasing. In addition to Myanmar, opium cultivation increased by almost 60% in the Lao People's Democratic Republic in 2010, although it remains at a low level. A 2010 estimate for opium poppy cultivation in Mexico was not available at the time of writing. Therefore, the 2009 estimate was used to calculate the total global cul-tivation in 2010. Opium poppy cultivation in Mexico appears to have been steadily increasing over the 2005- 2009 period, amounting to 19,500 ha in 2009, the third 050,000100,000150,000200,000250,000 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010Cultivation (ha) Afghanistan Myanmar Mexico OthersFig. 26: Global cultivation of opium poppy (ha),* 2005-2010 * For Mexico, in the absence of data for 2010, the estimate for 2009 was imputed to 2010.

In contrast to the other countries mentioned above, neither the Government nor UNODC has been directly involved in monitoring such cultivation and the esti-mates thus cannot be confirmed. In 2009, the Mexican Government reported eradication of almost 15,000 ha of opium poppy, the highest reported total worldwide for that year. In Myanmar, opium poppy cultivation has increased every year since 2006. Cultivation is concentrated in the Shan State, in the eastern part of the country. At 3,000 ha in 2010, opium poppy cultivation in the Lao People's Democratic Republic was higher than in any year since 2005, and has increased significantly since the lowest level (1,500 ha) in 2007. Cultivation seems to be increas-ingly concentrated in a few provinces in the northern part of the country. In Pakistan, opium poppy is mainly grown in the Khyber District of the Federally Administered T ribal Area (FATA), but smaller pockets were also found in Balo-chistan and Sindh provinces. Since 2006, cultivation in Pakistan has remained below 2,000 ha. Aside from these countries, reports of opium poppy eradication programmes and seizures of plant material indicate the existence of opium poppy cultivation in many other countries and regions. A considerable level of illegal cultivation is estimated in India, as domestic raw opium consumption and half of domestic heroin demand are met by local production. 41 At least 10,000 ha of opium poppy cultivation is estimated in other countries worldwide, with a 30% increase in 2010. 41 UNODC ARQ.Overall, in the last five years, global opium poppy culti-vation has increased by some 40%. UNODC currently implements programmes to monitor the illicit cultiva-tion of opium poppy in cooperation with the Govern-ments of Afghanistan, Myanmar and the Lao People's Democratic Republic. In 2010, potential global opium production dropped by at least 38% from 2009, due to significantly reduced opium yield as a result of disease on opium poppy plants in Afghanistan. Although increases in cultivation (and opium yield) in other countries led to an increase in potential opium production outside Afghanistan, this did not offset Afghanistan's decrease. However, opium production may increase if the opium yield returns to 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Afghanistan 400 121 21,430 546 Egypt 15 34 65 45 50 98 121 89 Guatemala 489 720 449 536 1,345 918 India 29 96 248 153 18 219 494 167 12 247 3,556 2,575 1,518 779 575 651 579 Lebanon 867 654 2,194 1,197 1,704 1,484 4,185 5,200 391 354 614 0 105 68 Peru 4 18 26 155 14 57 98 92 88 28 23 32 21 Thailand 886 1,053 716 808 757 832 989 767 122 110 153 220 285 201 278 Venezuela 51 266 148 137 215 39 0 0 87 154 0 0 0 Viet Nam 1,142 340 439 426 125 100 32 38 99 31 Table 12: Reported opium poppy eradication in selected countries (ha), 1996 to 2010 * Although eradication took place in 2004, it was not officially reported to UNODC.

(c) The Government of Mexico reported a gross opium poppy cultivation of 19,147 hectares (2006) and estimated gross opium prod uction at 211 mt (2006), 122 mt (2007), 144 mt (2008), 162 mt (2009) and 170 mt (2010). These gross figures are not directly comparable to the n et figures pre- sented in this table. The Government of Mexico is not in a position to confirm the US figures as it does not have information o n the methodology used to calculate them. (d) Eradication and plant seizure reports from different sources between 2006 and 2010 indicate that illicit opium poppy culti vation also exists in the following subregions: North Africa, Central Asia and T ranscaucasia, Near and Middle East /South-West Asia, South Asia, East and South-East Asia, East Europe, Southeast Europe, Central America and South America. Starting 2008, a new methodology was introduced to est imate opium poppy cultivation and opium/heroin production in these countries. These estimates are higher than the previous figures but have a similar order of magnitude. A detailed description of the estimation methodology is available in the Methodology section.61The opium/heroin market average levels in Afghanistan in 2011, despite the expec- tation that overall opium poppy cultivation will remain stable there. Despite potential global opium production decreasing to 4,860 mt - a significant decline compared to the peak production from 2006-2009 - this level is similar to average production levels over the past two decades. Afghanistan remained the largest opium-producing country in 2010, with 74% of global potential produc-tion (down from 88% in 2009). In 2009, Mexico for the first time had a higher potential opium production than Myanmar. In 2010, potential opium production in Myanmar amounted to 580 mt, a 76% increase. This is the highest level since 2004 in that country. As in previous years, UNODC has estimated the total potential production of opium and heroin (of unknown purity). According to these estimates, the production of opium in 2010 amounted to 4,860 mt, a 38% decrease from 2009. Potential heroin production amounted to 396 mt, a 40% decline from the 667 mt estimated in 2009. 'Potential heroin production' refers to the amount of heroin that would be produced if all the harvested opium would be either introduced to the market as opium or processed into heroin. 42 The entire amount of opium produced every year may not be either consumed or converted into heroin, how-ever, as seizures of final or intermediate products may take place and opiate stockpiling may be occurring inside and outside of Afghanistan. 43 The amount of heroin available in the market is directly linked with demand and is likely to be less than the potential pro- duction levels (which are calculated by multiplying the cultivated area with yield per hectare). Thus, it is neces- sary to estimate global opiate demand, taking into 42 UNODC estimates heroin production by calculating the proportion of opium that is converted into heroin as a function of seizures and according to information from key informants. 43 Opium stockpiling by opium farmers is an old tradition in Afghanistan.account seizures as well as consumption. On this basis, it is estimated that some 460-480 mt of heroin were available in the worldwide market in 2009. Of this, some 375 mt reached the consumers, whereas the rest was seized. Further details regarding these estimates are provided in subsequent sections. In 2009, there were no reports of laboratories involved in manufacturing heroin outside opium-producing countries. The highest number of laboratories inter- cepted were in Afghanistan (48 44), three laboratories were reported in Myanmar and only one in Mexico, although there was a much higher number of metham-phetamine laboratories - an unspecified number of which also manufactured heroin. Other laboratories processing heroin were discovered in other countries, but these were not involved in manufacturing. One laboratory in the Russian Federation was producing acetylated opium and seven installations in Greece were involved in repackaging and adulterating heroin. Afghanistan is currently the only country known to be involved in manufacturing heroin from Afghan opium. Neighbouring countries and other countries along known trafficking routes have not reported domestic manufacturing of morphine or heroin from Afghan opium. High levels of morphine seizures were reported outside of Afghanistan in 2010, however. Morphine is primarily used to produce heroin as there is limited illicit morphine use worldwide. Thus, it is likely that heroin processing is also taking place outside Afghani-stan. Given the security situation, the vast majority of Afghan heroin is estimated to be produced in the coun-try, especially in the southern provinces. The high number of heroin manufacturing laboratories destroyed in Afghanistan supports this assumption. 44 Information from the Ministry of Interior/Counter-Narcotics Police of Afghanistan.Fig. 28: Potential production of opium and manufacture of heroin of unknown purity (mt), 2004-2010 * Although eradication took place in 2004, it was not officially reported to UNODC.

The largest quantities of opiates continued to be seized by T urkey and the Islamic Republic of Iran, coun-tries that serve as transit points for heroin trafficked from Afghanistan on the 'Balkan route' to West and Central Europe. Although much is known about drug suppliers, con- sumers, traffickers and routes, interdiction remains dif-ficult. Law enforcement efforts are frustrated by the fact that international traffickers constantly change their methods and routes, high profits may fuel high-level corruption, and international cooperation initiatives take time to become effective. The trend in global heroin seizures appears to follow that in opium production with a delay of one year. A decline in opium production in 2001 resulted in a drop in heroin seizures in 2002, the stability in opium pro-duction over the period 2003-2005 was reflected in a relatively stable three-year span in heroin seizure totals over the period 2004-2006, 45 and a marked increase in opium production over the period 2005-2007 was mir- rored in an increase in heroin seizures over the period 2006-2008. The trend in morphine seizures, however, is more erratic. Illicit drug seizure totals can be susceptible to two main factors: 1) the available supply of the drug, and 2) the effectiveness of law enforcement efforts. Since law enforcement efforts and practices do not necessarily evolve in concert in different countries, at a global level, the law enforcement component plays a smaller role in determining the trend. The increased heroin seizures therefore likely reflect, at least in part, an increased supply of heroin in the world. This is in line with the 45 Heroin seizure totals fell slightly in 2005 and 2006, but only by 3.5% and 2.7% respectively.Map 10: Seizures of heroin and morphine, 2009 (countries and territories reporting seizures* of more than 10 kg) * Seizures as reported (no adjust ments made for purity) Source: UNODC Annual Reports Questionnaires data supple mented by other sources Note: The boundaries and na mes shown and the designations used on this map do not i mply official endorse ment or acceptance by the United Nations.Increase (>10%) Stable (+/- 10%) Decrease (>10%)Seizures in 2009 Weight in metric tons Trend 2008-2009 Heroin and morphine seizures reported to UNODC (2005-2009) No heroin and morphine seizures reported to UNODC (2005-2009)Islamic Republic of iran 41.07Turkey 16.4 Afghanistan7.4West & Central Europe 7.5 China 5,8 Pakistan4.0Russian Federation 3.2 United States of A merica 2.4 Myanmar1.4Bulgaria 1.2 Tajikistan1.1 India1.1North Africa0.19Uzbekistan Central Africa 0.11 Central A merica0.12 Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) 0.08Taiwan, Province of China0.06Hong Kong, 0.06 of heroin(a) and morphine(b): 1999-2009 (a) Seizures as reported (no adjust ment for purity).

In comparison with 1998,46 the growth in heroin seizures has kept pace with, and slightly outperformed, the growth in opium production. In 2009, heroin seizures stood at 2.3 times the level in 1998, while opium production in 2008 stood at 1.8 times the 1997 level. 47 In order to assess the impact of drug seizures on global supply, total seizures of a given drug may be expressed as a percentage of global production; this percentage is often referred to as an 'interception rate.' Such a calcula-tion is subject to a number of caveats, however, the first of which is the time lag between cultivation of an illicit crop and the resulting effect on the availability of the derived drug in the illicit market. Assuming that one kilogram of heroin or morphine is equivalent to 7-10 kg of opium, and comparing total seizures in 2009 with the average opium production in 2008 and 2009, 48 a range of 16-20% for the interception rate for opiates can be 46 The year 2008 is chosen as a baseline because, over the period 1996- 1998, seizures of opium and heroin, as well as opium production, were all relatively stable, suggesting that the opiates market was close to equilibrium. 47 Heroin seizures in a given year are compared to opium production in the previous year to allow for the time required for processing opium into morphine and heroin, and for the heroin to reach the markets where it is seized. 48 Opium production in 2008 is considered along with that in 2009 to allow for the time required for processing and for the opiates to reach the markets where they are seized.derived. Opium seizures in a given year are compared to the average opium production in that year and the previ- ous year. Seizures of opium and morphine are concen-trated in Afghanistan and neighbouring countries, but heroin seizures are much more dispersed.Map 11: Opium seizures in Asia, 2009 Source: UNODC Annual Reports Questionnaires data supple mented by other sources Note: The boundaries and na mes shown and the designations used on this map do not imply official endorse ment or acceptance by the United NationsDecrease (>10%)Increase (>10%) Stable (+/- 10%)Seizures in 2009 Weight in kilograms Trend 2008-2009 Main production areas580,478Islamic Republic Hong Kong, 45.7Armenia 26.9 Jordan 21.0 0100200300400500600700 1998 1999 2000 200120022003 2004 200520062007 2008 2009Opium in mt 0 2 04 06 08 0 Heroin and morphine in mt Opium (raw and prepared) opiate seizures, Report 2011 Afghanistan and neighbouring countries Opium and heroin seizures in Afghanistan remained limited in 2009, amounting to 36 mt of opium and 2.2 mt of heroin. These seizures accounted for 5.5% and 2.9% of global opium and heroin seizures, respectively, in 2009. Neighbouring Islamic Republic of Iran, however, con- tinued to make large seizures. In 2009, 89% of global opium seizures were made by that country. The global increase in opium seizures since 2002 is mainly due to increasing quantities seized in the Islamic Republic of Iran, which since 1996 have accounted for more than three quarters of annual global opium seizures. In 2006, the Islamic Republic of Iran replaced T urkey as the country reporting the largest heroin seizures worldwide. Since then, the Islamic Republic of Iran and T urkey have seized the largest and second-largest, respectively, annual heroin totals worldwide. Over the period 2002-2008, heroin seizures in both these countries increased mark- edly, but in 2009, seizures stabilized both in the Islamic Republic of Iran, at 25 mt (compared to 23 mt in 2008) and in T urkey, at 16 mt (compared to 15 mt in 2008). Heroin seizures in Central Asian and East European countries have been erratic in recent years, but over the long term, a distinct increase has been observed. Over the period 2003-2009, heroin seizures in East Europe were much higher than in previous years. West and Central Europe The trend in bulk heroin seizures in West and Central Europe does not mirror the increased supply of Afghan opium or the increased levels of heroin seizures in the Islamic Republic of Iran and T urkey. Indeed, seizures in West and Central Europe peaked at 11.6 mt in 2000 and appear to have stabilized at a lower level, ranging between 7.5 mt and 7.9 mt annually over the 2005-2009 period. The Asia-Pacific region In the past, the supply of heroin in China has been mainly sourced from South-East Asia (notably Myan-mar). However, significant quantities of heroin have begun to reach China from Afghanistan. Heroin from northern Myanmar enters China via Yunnan province; according to Chinese authorities, heroin seizures in Yunnan province rose from 2.9 mt in 2008 to 3.3 mt in 2009. Seizures of heroin originating in Afghanistan registered a more pronounced increase, rising from 390 kg (seized in 234 cases) in 2008 to 1.5 mt (seized in 333 cases) in 2009. 49 Heroin trafficking from Afghanistan to the Asia-Pacific region is increasing, also supported by drug seizures reported by Pakistan. Among those cases in which the destination of the consignment was identified as a coun-try or region other than Pakistan, the proportion of heroin seizures destined for the Asia-Pacific region increased from around 12% prior to 2006 to 40-44% every year since. The emergence of this new route around 2005-2006 also appears to have caused a drop in heroin seizures in the region, suggesting that regional law enforcement needs time to adapt to the new route. This was also concurrent with a sharp increase in opium production in Afghanistan. This increase may have led to a surplus of opiates, some of which may have found their way to the Asia-Pacific region. 49 National Narcotics Control Commission of China, presentation at the T wentieth Anti-Drug Liaison Officials' Meeting for International Cooperation (ADLOMICO), October 2010, Seoul, *Aggregate of heroin, morphine and opiu m.

The results of the Heroin Signature Program (HSP) of the US Drug Enforcement Agency pointed to an increase in the availability of heroin from Mexico. In 2008, the wholesale purity of heroin of Mexican origin was at its highest (40%) since 2005, while Mexican heroin repre-sented 39% (by weight) of all heroin analysed through the HSP , the highest percentage since 1987. Seizures of heroin by US authorities along the US-Mexico border increased from 404 kg in 2007 to 556 kg in 2008, and the partial total for 2009 amounted to 642 kg. 50 In 2009, large quantities of heroin were also seized in Colombia (735 kg), Mexico (283 kg) and Ecuador (177 kg). Seizures in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela have declined significantly since the peak level of 2004 (658 kg), amounting to 81 kg in 2009. Heroin seizures also increased sharply in Canada, from 16 kg in 2007 to 102 kg in 2008 and 213 kg in 2009. However, the increase in 2009 can be attributed to a single maritime shipment of 108 kg. In contrast with the United States, Canada assessed that 98% of heroin reaching its market in 2009 originated from South Asia. In 2009 Canada also seized 20 mt of a preparation 50 National Drug Intelligence Center, United States Department of Justice, National Drug Threat Assessment 2010 , February 2010.0510152025 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009mtTurkey Iran (Isla mic Republic of) West & Central Europe East Europe Central Asia and Transcaucasian countriesFig. 34: Heroin seizures in selected regions or countries supplied by Afghan opium, 1998-2009 Source: UNODC ARQ/DELTA.

Canada assessed that 94% of the 'dode' that reached its market originated in the United States, with the remaining 6% originating in the Netherlands, and that the affordability of 'dode' had the potential to create a market beyond the tradi- tional cultural groups. The United States is also affected by non-medical use of prescription opioids, and reported significant seizures of oxycodone and hydrocodone. AfricaHeroin seizures in Africa rose sharply, from 311 kg in 2008 to 515 kg in 2009. This is the highest level since 1993. South Africa registered the largest seizure total as well as the largest year-on-year increase, with seizures rising from 41 kg in 2008 to 198 kg in 2009. In recent years, heroin seizures have increased signifi- cantly in Egypt. In 2008, Egypt seized 211 kg of heroin, accounting for two thirds of total heroin seizures in Africa, and registering the third consecutive year-on-year increase. In 2009, seizures fell to 159 kg, remaining significantly higher than the levels registered in this country over the period 1995-2006. In the past, Egypt has also reported seizures of opium and opium capsules. In 2009, significant quantities of heroin were also seized in Nigeria, 104 kg. Although this represents a sharp increase from the level in 2008 (12 kg), seizures were already high in 2007 (121 kg).

Over the 2004-2008 period, Pakistan reported significant, albeit declining, numbers of seized heroin consignments intended for Nigeria (36 such seizures in 2008 and 16 in 2009). According to the United States Department of Justice, organizations responsible for trafficking heroin originating in South-West Asia into the United States included some that were based in West Africa. Nigeria has been mentioned as a transit country for heroin by Australia and the United States in recent years. Nigeria assessed that one half of the heroin traf- ficked on its territory in 2009 was intended for the United States, with 40% intended for Europe and 10% for China. Trafficking routes and volumes Global heroin-producing countries supply different markets. Heroin from Myanmar is mainly trafficked to China and Mexican heroin is mainly trafficked to the United States of America. Afghan heroin, however, is trafficked to every region of the world except Latin America. As such, trafficking routes for Afghan heroin are the main focus of this section. Heroin trafficking routes are complex. Estimating the volumes, that is, the global flow of opiates, requires data on global opiate demand. Global heroin and opium seizures are used to identify opiate trafficking routes and to help estimate the size of the flows in each country. In addition to seizure data, information was drawn from official country reports such as ARQ responses. Available demand data was used as the key variable to estimate the size of the global heroin and opium flows. The robustness of demand data varies considerably, and the data are subject to frequent revisions and changes. Most countries still lack structured data collection sys- tems capable of producing scientifically sound demand, supply and seizure statistics. Accordingly, the statistics and estimates provided on opiate demand and flows should be viewed as the best current approximations. Heroin flow figures used in this section are indicative and should be taken with caution. The purpose of pro-ducing these statistics is to estimate i) the main flows and changes in the routes over time, and ii) provide threat and risk analysis for production, transit and des-tination countries. The volumes and routes discussed are not fixed and change according to changes in demand, drug availability, or risk perceptions of drug traffickers. Therefore, it is essential to monitor flows every year to observe changes in the market and routes, which can inform global strategies and policies regarding public health and security ramifications. Heroin trafficking from production countries to con- sumer markets requires a global network of routes and facilitation by domestic and international criminal groups. Although the exact routes are constantly chang- ing, the global movement of heroin from Afghanistan and other producers to international consumers follows well-established paths. Some routes are chosen for geo-graphic reasons, while others are preferred due to a lack of law enforcement. It is estimated that some 460-480 mt of heroin was available in the global market in 2009. Of this, some 375 mt reached consumers and the rest was seized. Afghanistan continued to be the main supplier for the global heroin market, producing 380 mt (83%). Despite the complexity of heroin trafficking routes, some global movements can be generalized for Afghan heroin, which flows from Afghanistan through Pakistan, 050100150200250300350400450500550 1999 2000 20012002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 20082009/g46/g76/g79/g82/g74/g85/g68/g80/g86 /g58/g72/g86/g87/g3/g68/g81/g71/g3/g38/g72/g81/g87/g85/g68/g79/g3/g36/g73/g85/g76/g70/g68 /g40/g68/g86/g87/g3/g36/g73/g85/g76/g70/g68 050100150200250 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 20082009Fig. 39: Seizures of opium (raw and prepared), opium capsules and opium poppy seeds in Egypt, 2002-2009 Source: ARQ/DELTA. /g50/g83/g76/g88/g80/g3/g11/g85/g68/g90/g3/g3/g68/g81/g71/g3/g83/g85/g72/g83/g68/g85/g72/g71/g12 /g50/g83/g76/g88/g80/g3/g70/g68/g83/g86/g88/g79/g72/g86 /g50/g83/g76/g88/g80/g3/g83/g82/g83/g83/g92/g3/g86/g72/g72/g71/g46/g76/g79/g82/g74/g85/g68/g80/g8671The opium/heroin market the Islamic Republic of Iran and some Central Asian countries before moving to the main consumer markets in West and Central Europe, East Europe, and East and South-East Asia. Heroin flows from Afghanistan... Afghanistan continues to dominate global heroin supply. In 2009, an estimated 6,900 mt of opium were pro-duced in Afghanistan. Almost 95% of Afghan opium is grown in some of the country's southern provinces, including Hilmand, Kandahar, Farah, Nimroz and Uruzgan. Heroin processing laboratories are also con-centrated in these provinces. From the production areas, heroin is trafficked overland in three main directions: i) to Nimroz, Farah and Hirat provinces along the border with the Islamic Republic of Iran, ii) to eastern and northern Afghanistan, or iii) to Pakistan's Balochistan borders. UNODC estimates that 365 mt of Afghan heroin were trafficked into the inter-national market in 2009. Afghanistan's neighbours received the largest volumes of heroin. Some 160 mt were trafficked to Pakistan, 115 mt to the Islamic Republic of Iran and 90 mt to some Central Asian coun-tries (Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and T urkmenistan). ...to Pakistan An estimated 160 mt of heroin were trafficked from Afghanistan to Pakistan in 2009. The majority is thought to have entered overland into Pakistan's Balochistan province from Afghanistan's Hilmand and Kandahar provinces, facilitated by the limited law enforcement capacity on both sides and the strong presence of the Taliban and other anti-government elements. The bor-ders of Afghanistan's Nangarhar and Kunar provinces with Pakistan's Federally Administered T ribal Area also figure as prominent heroin crossing areas, although to a lesser extent. Of the 160 mt of heroin that entered Pakistan, 138 mt Map 12: Afghan heroin trafcking routes and volumes, 2009 Source: UNODC.

At least 30 mt were trafficked from Balochistan to the Islamic Republic of Iran. The remaining 108 mt were moved internally to Pakistan's industrial capitals, Karachi and Lahore, as well as to other coastal or border locations for onward trafficking to Europe, South-East Asia, South Asia and Africa by sea and air. The declining opium production in Myanmar has increased heroin trafficking via Pakistan to South-East Asia, especially in 2009. ...to the Islamic Republic of Iran An estimated 145 mt of heroin were trafficked into the Islamic Republic of Iran from Afghanistan and Pakistan in 2009. Although the majority of heroin enters from Afghanistan, increasing security along the Islamic Republic of Iran - Afghanistan border is likely to cause an increase in heroin flows through Pakistan. 51 Accord- ing to heroin seizures, once heroin enters the Islamic Republic of Iran, it is transported in four main direc-tions: i) through central parts of the country to the border with T urkey, ii) to the seaports and coastline, iii) to the border with Iraq, or iv) to the border with Azerba-ijan. Despite high levels of domestic consumption, the major- ity of the heroin that enters the Islamic Republic of Iran is trafficked onwards, especially along the 'Balkan Route' towards West and Central Europe. In 2009, an esti-mated 82 mt were trafficked to T urkey, 6 mt to Africa, 3 mt to countries of the Caucasus and small quantities directly to Europe. ...to Central Asia In 2009, 90 mt of Afghan heroin were trafficked into Central Asia, namely Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, T urkmeni-stan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan from Afghanistan. Afghan heroin enters the region mainly via the porous Tajikistan-Afghanistan border, delineated by the Pianj River. 52 Afghan heroin also enters via Uzbekistan, although in smaller quantities. Once in Tajikistan, heroin generally moves through Uzbekistan and Kyr-gyzstan before transiting Kazakhstan into the Russian Federation. Of the 90 mt that entered the region, the majority - 75 mt - was trafficked onwards to the Russian Federation. Given that the only land border between the Russian Federation and Central Asia is Kazakhstan, almost the entire amount of heroin trafficked by land to the Rus-sian Federation passed through that country. Central Asia forms the gateway for heroin destined for the Rus-sian Federation and onwards to East Europe, a route known as the 'Northern Route.' 51 According to Pakistan's ANF , 2010. 52 Drug Control Agency (DCA) of Tajikistan.Main destination markets Once Afghan opiates have entered neighbouring Paki- stan, Islamic Republic of Iran and Central Asia, it is trafficked to the main international consumption mar-kets - West and Central Europe, East Europe, East and South-East Asia and South Asia. Limited amounts also reach other smaller consumption markets. West and Central EuropeIn 2009, users in West and Central Europe consumed some 70 mt of pure heroin. An additional 7.5 mt were seized by law enforcement institutions. Thus, an esti-mated 75-80 mt of heroin were trafficked to West and Central Europe. The bulk, some 60 mt, were trafficked from the countries of South-East Europe (via the Balkan route). Moreover, some 7 mt were trafficked from Africa, 4 mt from Pakistan, 3 mt from the Near and Middle East/South-West Asia (mainly the Islamic Republic of Iran, Qatar and Jordan) and 1 mt from South Asia (mainly India, Bangladesh and Nepal). The source and route of the remaining 3 mt are undetermined. Heroin is trafficked into West and Central Europe by land, sea and air. The Balkan route dominates land and sea shipments, while Africa is now emerging as the lead-ing origin of air shipments. One reason for this is that law enforcement capacity in East Africa is scarce and trafficking heroin by sea from Pakistan poses few chal-lenges to experienced traffickers. The Balkan route originates in Afghanistan, passes through the Islamic Republic of Iran and T urkey, and reaches the Balkans via Bulgaria, with a smaller flow through Greece. Once the heroin enters T urkey, most is trafficked to Istanbul and then onwards to the borders with Bulgaria and Greece. T raffickers are able to take advantage of the lack of visa requirements between the Balkan countries. In 2009, an estimated 65 mt of heroin reached the Balkan countries, of which some 60 mt were trafficked onwards to West and Central Europe, mainly to the United Kingdom, Italy, Netherlands, Germany, France and Belgium. Limited heroin trafficking also occurred via air directly from T urkey to West and Cen-tral European countries. The majority of the heroin trafficked through the Islamic Republic of Iran and T urkey is believed to be intended for western Europe. Recent seizures at seaports indicate that maritime transportation might be used more than estimated for heroin trafficking worldwide. In the first three months of 2011, there were big heroin seizures reported in East Africa (Kenya and the United Republic of Tanzania). In addition, recent reports indi-cate that the average seizure per case has decreased in the Islamic Republic of Iran and T urkey, two countries that have strengthened their law enforcement capacity in recent years. This might force heroin traffickers to find alternative routes to Europe. 73The opium/heroin market East Europe In 2009, users in East Europe consumed an estimated 73 mt of heroin. In the Russian Federation, the opiate prevalence rate for the adult population was 1.64% in 2009. 53 This is equivalent to around 1.7 million opiate users, who consumed some 70 mt of pure heroin. In total, including the 3.1 mt of heroin seized and 2-3 mt of heroin trafficked onward, an estimated 75-80 mt of heroin were trafficked into the Russian Federation in 2009. The route through Central Asia, the Russian Fed-eration and into East Europe is known as the 'Northern Route.' The majority of heroin trafficked to the Russian Federation came from Central Asia, and to a lesser extent Azerbaijan. 54 East Europe received the majority of its heroin from the Russian Federation, as well as from T urkey and countries of the Caucasus. 53 These estimates are preliminary, since there are no comprehensive studies on prevalence of opiate users in the Russian Federation. The estimate of opiate users ranges from 0.3% - 1.64% of the population aged 15-64. The estimate of 1.64% is based on the number of opiate users in treatment for 2007, using a treatment multiplier of 5.3% taken from a study conducted by the National Addiction Centre of the Russian Federation: Dynamics of Drug Related Disorders in the Russian Federation, 2007. 54 UNODC ARQ.East and South-East Asia In 2009, opiate demand in East and South-East Asia was met by both local production and Afghan supply. Myan-mar and the Lao People's Democratic Republic are the main producing countries, exporting an estimated 25 mt of heroin. The total estimated heroin demand was 90 mt (including seizures and onward trafficking) in East and South-East Asia in 2009. An estimated 65 mt of pure Afghan heroin was traf- ficked to the region to fill the gap in local production - 25 mt to South-East Asia and 40 mt to China. Given that the majority of heroin from Myanmar is trafficked Map 13: Heroin flows to West and Central Europe in 2009 Source: UNODC.

However, exact drug trafficking routes and sources in 2009 are difficult to determine due to a lack of seizures. Given the low prices of heroin in Pakistan, it may be cheaper for drug trafficking networks to transport Afghan heroin to China and South-East Asia rather than use heroin from Myanmar. Heroin trafficking from Afghanistan to the Asia-Pacific region is an increasing trend, visible in individual drug seizures reported by Pakistan. Among those cases in which the destination of the consignment was identified as a country or region other than Pakistan, the propor-tion destined for the Asia-Pacific region underwent a distinct change in the transition from 2005 to 2006. This proportion (by number of seizure cases) was rela-tively stable over the period 2002-2005 (ranging between 11 and 13%), rose distinctly to 44% in 2006, to remain relatively stable since then, ranging between 40 and 44%. It is likely that a significant proportion of these consignments was intended for China. The proportion of cases in which China was identified as the country of destination rose sharply from less than 1% in 2004 to 28% in 2006, possibly reflecting the route identified by Chinese authorities involving direct shipments to north-western China. Since 2006, these shipments appear to have been gradually replaced by shipments to other countries in the Asia-Pacific region, possibly for further trans-shipment to their final destinations (which may include China as well as other countries in South-East Asia and Oceania). This proportion also reached record levels in the case of several other countries in this region, such as Malaysia (22% in 2008), Thailand (7% in 2009), Nepal (6% in 2009) and Sri Lanka (5% in 2009). The shipments may reflect the recent trafficking route to south-eastern China. Indeed, although limited quantities of Afghan heroin were trafficked by air from South-West Asia to the north-west of China (notably Urumqi), an increas-ingly important route went from Afghanistan and neighbouring countries to the south-eastern Chinese province of Guangdong, via transit countries such as Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines and Viet Nam. Five of the seizure cases in Guangdong province in 2009 together accounted for 1 mt of heroin. 55 The emergence of this new route around 2005-2006 also appears to have caused a drop in heroin seizures in this region, sug-gesting that law enforcement needed time to adapt. 55 N ational Narcotics Control Commission of China, presentation at the Fifteenth Asia-Pacific Operational Drug Enforcement Confer- ence, February 2010, Tokyo, Japan, and National Narcotics Control Commission of China, presentation at the T wentieth Anti-Drug Liai-son Officials' Meeting for International Cooperation (ADLOMICO), October 2010, Seoul, Republic of Korea.Map 14: H eroin flows to the Russian Federation and East Europe, 2009 Source: UNODC. The Russian Federation East Europe Georgia Azerbaijan TurkeyKazakhstan Flows of heroin (in metric tons) (not actual trafcking routes) 15-2070-8075The opium/heroin market Heroin trafficking from East and South-East Asia is limited. In 2009, 3-4 mt of heroin were trafficked from South-East Asia to Australia and, to a lesser extent, New Zealand. There are no reports of onward heroin traffick-ing from China in 2009. South AsiaSouth Asia was an important consumption and transit point for Afghan heroin in 2009. Some 25 mt of pure heroin were consumed in the region and 15 mt were trafficked onwards. Of this, some 6 mt went to South-East Asia, 6 mt to Africa, 1-2 mt to North America and 1 mt each to China and Europe. Although the majority of users in India use Indian heroin, drug traffickers prefer to export Afghan heroin due to its higher purity. Of the 40 mt of heroin that were available in South Asia, an estimated 25 mt were trafficked from Afghanistan to South Asia, and a further 15 mt were manufactured domestically. Indian heroin supplied regional markets including Bangladesh, 56 Nepal57 and Sri Lanka. Africa In 2009, an estimated 40-45 mt of Afghan heroin were trafficked to Africa, of which some 25 mt were likely trafficked from Pakistan, 5-6 mt from the United Arab Emirates, 5-6 mt from India and 5 mt from the Islamic Republic of Iran. The majority of heroin is still smug-gled into South Africa, mainly from South-West Asia and, to a lesser extent, South-East Asia. Major hubs in Africa include Nigeria and South Africa. The majority of heroin that reached the continent was 56 Interviews with Bangladeshi officials, March 2009. 57 Interviews with Nepalese officials, March 2009. consumed there, although Africa is now emerging as a heroin trafficking hub. In 2009, an estimated 7 mt of heroin were trafficked from Africa to Europe, almost 1 mt to China and a small amount to Australia. Heroin flows to other destinations Aside from the above-mentioned destination markets, there are other international consumption markets, including the Americas and Oceania. In 2009, an estimated 40 mt of heroin were available in the Americas, the majority of which was grown and produced regionally. Only a limited amount of Afghan heroin was available in the market, as production in Mexico was higher than regional demand. However, the heroin market in Canada is mainly supplied by Afghan heroin. In 2009, Mexico produced 426 mt of opium, which may be converted into 40 mt of Mexican (black tar) heroin. However, such a level of heroin production in Mexico would be equivalent to almost double the esti-mated consumption in its main destination market of North America (22 mt). In the absence of regional opiate stocks, either production figures are over-esti-mated or consumption is under-estimated. Production in Colombia is similarly opaque. Almost 58% of the heroin seized in the United States of Amer- ica is reportedly of Colombian origin. 58 However, Colombia's total opium production was 9 mt in 2009, with a maximum yield of 1 mt of heroin. As Colombian law enforcement bodies seized 650 kg of heroin in 2009, 350 kg of heroin were left for trafficking. This would 58 USA Drug Enforcement Administration, Heroin in Pakistan intended for the Asia-Pacic, as a percentage of all seized heroin consignments with known destination (by number of cases), 2002-2009 Note: Consignments where the destination was identified as Pakistan itself are excluded from the total. Source: UNODC IDS.76World Drug Report 2011 not even satisfy heroin consumption in South America (2 mt), and nothing would be left for trafficking to the US. The currently available data is insufficient to prop-erly understand heroin supply and demand in the Americas. In 2009, almost 4 mt of heroin were trafficked to Oce- ania, mainly to Australia. Of this, 3.2 mt were con-sumed in Australia and 0.6 mt in New Zealand. Heroin use was almost negligible in other countries of the region. Afghan heroin dominated the markets in Aus-tralia and New Zealand, likely trafficked via Pakistan and South-East Asian countries. Indeed, Australia regis-tered a significant diversification in the countries of departure for heroin trafficking into the country (of which there were 11 in 1999-2000 and 29 in 2008-2009), 59 and identified Cambodia, Malaysia, Pakistan, Thailand and Viet Nam as the most common departure countries in 2008-2009. Although heroin trafficking from South and East Africa to Australia was limited in 2009, shipments from Africa are emerging as a new trend, according to the Australian Government. 60 59 Both reporting periods from July 1 to June 30 of the following year. 60 UNODC ARQ.Map 15: Heroin trafcking from South Asia, 2009 Flows of heroin (in metric tons) (not actual trafcking routes) 5-7 1-3Near and Middle AsiaRegions The opium/heroin market 77The findings in this section were calculated by examin- ing a range of indicators, including demand statistics, opiate seizure databases of the World Customs Organi- zation and UNODC, ARQ responses and individual country reports. Experts from international organiza-tions, Member States and UNODC field offices have been consulted. Heroin and opium prices depend on a number of fac- tors, including purity, supply and demand, distance from the source and risk of interception. For example, one gram of good quality heroin costs around US$2-3 in Afghanistan, whereas the price is between US$40 - US$400 at consumption markets. Although farmers in Afghanistan supply much of the world's opiates, it is the international criminal networks along trafficking routes that earn billions of dollars every year. Heroin market values for each main consumption coun- try or region were calculated by using the amount of estimated heroin consumption as well as the average price. Regional/country-level heroin consumption and average prices are detailed elsewhere in this chapter. Heroin consumption amounts for each country/region were calculated by multiplying the estimated number of opiate users by the average heroin consumption per capita per year. The average heroin consumption figures reported in the 2005 World Drug Report have been updated with the help of several Member States, UNODC field offices and other relevant organizations since 2008. 61 In order to compare the market values between regions and countries, all prices were adjusted for purity. This information was collected through ARQ responses or bilateral meetings with officials. However, there is lim- ited information available about purity levels. To calculate the amount of opiate flows through a coun- try or a region, analyses of both opiate use and seizure data from 2009 were carried out to track the patterns and estimate the magnitude of opiate flows. The total amount of heroin used was calculated for each country, then combined with official seizure data and balanced against total manufacture. Manufacture, consumption and seizure data were analysed together. For example, 61 UNODC, Addiction, Crime and Insurgency: The Transnational Threat of Afghan Opium , 2009.the size of estimated heroin flows from Afghanistan or Pakistan to country 'X' should be similar to the amount of heroin used and intercepted in country 'X' and the destination and transit countries receiving heroin via country 'X'. First, heroin or opium demand in the main destination regions or countries was calculated. Then, by drawing on seizure statistics from each country, the amounts of heroin or opium flowing between the coun-tries were estimated. Regarding the analysis on groups that benefit from the heroin trade, arrestee statistics provided by Member States were analysed, supplemented by extensive consul-tations with various Government experts and institu-tions. As this report aims to provide global insights as well as orders of magnitude, the flows represented on maps should be considered broadly indicative rather than definitive. Flows may deviate to other countries along the routes and there are numerous secondary flows that may not be represented. Moreover, trends respond rap-idly to changes in law enforcement and demand. Opiate flow estimations would, therefore, need to be revised if demand statistics were to change. The estimates will be updated periodically as new drug use data is provided by Member States. Purity and prices Both heroin (wholesale) and opium (farm-gate) prices in Afghanistan have increased in the last year, despite a steady decline from 2006 to 2009. At the end of March 2011, the national average price for one kilogram of dry opium in Afghanistan at the farm-gate level was US$274/kg, 180% higher than the US$98/kg reported in March 2010. 62 The dry opium price at the farm-gate level has been increasing since July 2009. The current farm-gate price is the highest price reported since November 2004. Similarly, at the end of March 2011, heroin cost US$3,815/kg, compared to US$2,506/kg in March 2010, an increase of 52%.63 Afghan heroin has, on aver- age, a purity level of around 70%, much higher than that what reaches global consumption markets. 62 Ministry of Counter Narcotics Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and UNODC, Afghanistan Opium Price Monitoring Monthly Report , Feb- ruary 2011. 63 Ibid.2.5 Market analysis78World Drug Report 2011 Heroin prices in western Europe do not show a clear response to opiate prices in Afghanistan. A long-term comparison of the trader price of opium in Afghanistan with heroin prices in Europe shows that, despite a marked hike in opium prices between early 2000 and late 2002, which coincided with a marked drop in opium production in 2001, the retail heroin price, measured in euros, did not decrease in western Europe. In view of the large mark-up between prices in Afghani-stan and western Europe (the price per pure gram of heroin in Afghanistan is approximately 1% of the retail price in western Europe), one possible explanation for this is that the impact on the final price of price changes at the source is only cumulative, rather than propor-tional, resulting in a non-discernible effect at the much higher order of magnitude of retail prices. For example, an increase in the wholesale price of heroin in Afghani-stan from US$2 to US$3 per gram (a spike of 50%) would bring about, if the impact is indeed cumulative, an increase of US$1 per gram in the final retail price, e.g. from US$70 to US$71 per gram (an increase of 1.4 %).

Although seizures in West and Central Europe do not mirror the increased supply of Afghan opium or the increased levels of heroin seizures in the Islamic Repub-lic of Iran and T urkey, heroin price data for western Europe are compatible with increased supply. UNODC estimates of purity-adjusted heroin retail prices based on 12 countries in western Europe indicate a decrease of 35% between 2003 and 2009 in the price per pure gram of heroin, measured in euros and unadjusted for infla-tion. 64 The decrease is less evident in bulk retail prices, suggesting that the increase in heroin supply may have translated into increased purity. The equivalent average purity rose from 23% in 2003 to 28% in 2009. Heroin from Mexico and heroin from South America are rather distinct products in the main consumer market, the United States of America. Heroin from South America is more expensive and of higher purity. In 2009, the US reported typical wholesale purity of 52% for heroin from South America, compared to 40% for heroin from Mexico, and a price range of 44,000-113,333 US$/kg for heroin from South America, com-pared to 32,880-70,000 US$/kg for heroin from Mexico. Based on all heroin purchases performed by law enforce- ment in the United States, in the last quarter of 2009, the average price per pure gram of heroin was at the 64 Adjusting for inflation using Eurostat's euro area index would result in a further 11% decrease.highest level over the period 2006-2009, while the aver- age purity was the lowest over 2000 20012002 2003 20042005 2006 20072008 2009 2010 European retail prices, weighted average, and opiu m production in Afghanistan Afghanistan opiu m production (hundreds of tons, right axis) Opium trader price in Afghanistan, 3- month moving average, US$/kg Retail, weighted average, Euro/gra m (right axis) Retail, weighted average, US$/gra m (right axis)Fig. 45: Opium price and production in Afghanistan compared to heroin retail process in western Europe, 1998-2010 Sources: UNODC DELTA; UNODC Country Office in Afghanistan; UNODC estimates.

The value of the world heroin market tends to increase according to the number of international bor- ders crossed by traffickers. That is, heroin is generally cheaper in Afghanistan, a production country, than in West and Central Europe, where the drugs have been transported by various means across long distances and changed hands a number of times. However, this pattern can be deceptive, as heroin prices and consumption levels vary significantly across countries and regions. Heroin prices fluctuate significantly across the globe, and Australia is the starkest example of global price variation. Although Australian users represent just 0.85% of total global heroin consumption, they contrib-ute 4% of the global market value. The street value per gram of heroin is between US$230-370 in Australia whereas one gram of heroin was worth around US$170-200 in the USA and northern Europe, and consumers in West and Central Europe paid US$40-100 per gram. Overall, the Russian Federation and West and Central Europe contributed almost half of the total global market value, accounting for US$31 billion in 2009. Beneficiaries Given the geographic spread of heroin users and the fact that heroin prices increase roughly according to distance from the source, it is not surprising that criminal net- works in Europe, the Russian Federation and South-East Asia pocketed most of the profits in 2009. Indeed, ben- eficiaries in Afghanistan, for example, earned signifi-cantly less than international criminal networks. Although international organized crime groups domi-nate transnational trafficking, local sales in each country are conducted almost entirely by local groups, including domestic illegal armed groups and separatist move-ments.There is a strong link between insecurity and the opiate trade in Afghanistan, as opiates constitute the main income source for anti-government elements like the Afghan Taliban. Almost all of the opium produced in Afghanistan was grown in the provinces of southern Afghanistan where anti-government elements are active. Although the Afghan Taliban's role in drug trafficking is not clear, opium poppy farmers, drug traffickers and heroin lab owners paid the group up to 10% of the value of their opiate shipments as 'tax' or protection fees. In 2009, the Taliban's total income from the opiate trade was likely around US$155 million. However, Afghan opium farmers likely earned US$440 65 million and Afghan drug traffickers almost US$2.2 billion. In total, Pakistan's opiate market was worth US$1.2 bil- lion in 2009 - counting both transnational trafficking and domestic consumption. The exact beneficiaries of the opiate trade through Pakistan are difficult to specify, although it appears that extremist groups in the Feder- ally Administered T ribal Areas (FATA) and criminal groups in Balochistan are key recipients. Opiates enter Pakistan via these areas, which border Afghanistan. In 2009, the opiate market in the Islamic Republic of Iran was estimated at around US$3 billion. The major- ity of the profits went to Iranian criminal groups and, to a lesser extent, foreign drug traffickers based in the country. Although each Central Asian country has domestic criminal groups, it is possible that Tajik and Russian criminal groups organize heroin trafficking all the way from Afghanistan to the Russian Federation. Russian is the common language along this route. In 2009, the heroin trafficking market in Central Asia was worth an estimated US$1.4 billion, most of which went to regional criminal groups. In 2009, the total value of the heroin trafficked via South-East Europe was around US$2 billion, whereas the domestic heroin markets in the region were worth US$500 million. Thus, the total value of the opiate trade was US$2.5 billion in South-East Europe in 2009. T urkish, Kurdish and Balkan-based organized crime groups benefited from this trade. West and Central Europe remains one of the most lucra- tive drug markets, worth an estimated US$13 billion in 2009. The heroin market in the United Kingdom was estimated at US$3 billion in 2009, facilitated by British, Dutch and T urkish organized crime groups, and, to a lesser extent, South Asian groups. The heroin market in Italy was worth US$3 billion, which mainly went to Italian and Albanian organized crime groups. The value of the French heroin market was estimated at US$2 bil- 65 UNODC and Afghanistan Ministry of Counter Narcotics, Afghani- stan Opium Survey, 2009 .Africa, 3.2, 5% United States of America, 8, 12% China, 7.3, 11% Is lamic Republic of Iran, 3, 4% Ru ssi an Federation, 18, 25%Northern Europe, 1.8, 3%Aus tralia, 2.8, 4%Others , 10.1, 15% India, 1.5, 2% Wes t and Central Europe, 13, 19%Fig. 48: Shares of the global opiate market value, 2009 (in billions of US$) Source: UNODC.84World Drug Report 2011 lion, which was pocketed almost entirely by France- based distributors. The heroin market in Germany yielded a profit of approximately US$1.3 billion, with heroin mainly trafficked by T urkish and Balkan groups. In 2009, Russian criminal networks made an estimated US$18 billion from heroin. Based on drug-related arrests, the Russian drug market is dominated by Rus-sian citizens, followed by Tajiks as the most active for- eign nationals. Drug trafficking in East Europe is most likely conducted by local groups; however, the picture regarding criminal activity in this region is not very clear. In 2009, China's 2.3 million opiate users consumed some 55-60 mt of pure heroin and paid US$7.3 billion to local drug dealers. In other South-East Asian coun-tries, the total heroin market was worth US$2.4 billion. Chinese and other local organized crime groups control the South-East Asian heroin market at both retail and wholesale levels. The heroin trade in Indonesia is pre-dominantly controlled and directed by West Africans, particularly Nigerians. 66 In 2009, the total value of the South Asian heroin market - estimated at US$1.9 billion - mostly went to Indian local criminal groups. With a value of US$1.4 billion, the biggest market is in India. In 2009, Africa's drug trafficking market was worth an estimated US$3.2 billion - most of which went to Nige-rian organized crime groups. Nigerian groups likely dominate the African drug trade and are active in many countries around the world, including destination coun-tries in Europe. However, drug trafficking in Africa involves both African networks, including Nigerians and Tanzanians, as well as foreign networks, including Chi-nese and Pakistanis. The United States of America dominated regional demand for heroin, with a heroin market worth an esti- mated US$8 billion in 2009. North America-based organized crime groups (such as Mexican drug cartels) are the main beneficiaries. In 2009, Oceania's heroin market was worth an esti- mated US$3.5 billion as Australia and New Zealand had the highest heroin prices in the world. In 2009, both South-East Asian and African - mainly Nigerian - drug traffickers were involved in shipping heroin to Australia. Although information is limited, domestic sales were likely conducted by local groups. Heroin traffickers continue to adapt their techniques and alter trafficking routes to exploit international paths of least resistance. Numerous global vulnerabilities remain and some new areas are emerging. 66 US Department of State, Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, 2009.Removal of trade barriers in many parts of the globe has not only facilitated the movement of illicit goods, but also closer interaction between organized criminal groups from different locations and cultures. In 2009, many international borders became more transparent due to international trade agreements. Drug traffickers are likely to exploit this situation and make connections with other criminal networks to facilitate the smooth movement of heroin. Given the ongoing removal of trade barriers globally, traditional methods of border control may become increasingly unable to stem the flow of opiates into des-tination markets. In particular, traffickers' use of mari-time transportation and seaports has been identified as a key emerging threat. T raffickers are already capitalizing on increased global trade along sea routes. In 2009, only a tiny fraction of the more than 400 million containers that were shipped worldwide were inspected. In 2009, just 6% of global heroin seizures made by customs departments occurred at seaports. There are indications that drug traffickers are utilizing maritime transporta-tion much more intensively than currently believed. Drug trafficking through international seaports must be further studied and monitoring mechanisms enacted. In 2009, Africa emerged as a cost-effective heroin traf- ficking route to Europe, North America and Oceania. Drug seizures and the arrest of traffickers indicated that Africans - particularly West African networks - are increasingly transporting Afghan heroin from Pakistan into East Africa for onward shipment to Europe and elsewhere. The emergence of Africa as a heroin traffick-ing hub is likely due to corruption, limited law enforce-ment capacity and increased pressure on 'traditional' drug trafficking routes. The most fragile African states are particularly vulnerable. East Africa's minimal law enforcement at ports of entry has encouraged drug traf-fickers to transit heroin through that region. Increasing flows of heroin to Africa have also led to increases in drug use across the continent. Sporadic reports indicate a heroin shortage in Europe, particularly in the United Kingdom, where good-quality heroin was in short supply in the market. Indeed, the mean purity of heroin seizures made by UK police forces and analysed by the UK Forensic Science Service dropped from 46.4% in the third quarter of 2009 to 33.7% in the third quarter of 2010, while the mean purity of seizures made by the UK Border Agency fell from 58.2% to 46.2%. Anecdotal information points to a shortage in some countries, but not in all, suggesting that increased law enforcement efforts and decreased opium production in Afghanistan have played a role.3. The coca/cocaine market 85 3.1 Introduction Most indicators and research suggest that cocaine is - after heroin - the second most problematic drug world-wide in terms of negative health consequences and probably the most problematic drug in terms of traffick-ing-related violence. The overall prevalence and number of cocaine users globally remain at stable levels. There are regional differ- ences in recent trends, however, with significant decreases reported in North America, stable trends in West and Central Europe and increases in Africa and Asia. The estimated consumption of cocaine in terms of the quan- tities consumed appears to have declined, mainly due to a decrease in the United States and low levels of per capita use in the emerging markets. The most developed cocaine market outside of the Americas continues to be Europe, notably West and Central Europe, while cocaine use in East Europe is still limited. While demand in the United States was more than four times as high as in Europe in 1998, just over a decade later, the volume and value of the West and Central European cocaine market (US$33 billion) is approaching parity with that of the US (US$37 billion). The volume of cocaine consumed in Europe, however, has doubled in the last decade, even though data for the last few years show signs of stabiliza-tion at the higher levels. Harm associated with cocaine use in terms of treatment demand, overdose cases and deaths, complications in health status due to polydrug use among cocaine users and from adulterants in cocaine, remain substantial in the major regions of consumption.There has been a decline in the area under coca cultiva- tion, as well as in cocaine production. Global seizures of cocaine have been generally stable over the period 2006-2009. Since 2006, seizures have shifted towards the source areas in South America and away from the con-sumer markets in North America and West and Central Europe. Some secondary distribution countries in South America seem to have acquired increasing importance as cocaine trafficking transit countries. T rafficking through West Africa continues to be significant, in spite of a reduction of seizures since 2007 (from 25% of European cocaine seizures that transited countries of West and Central Africa in 2007 to 13% in 2009). The area remains vulnerable to a resurgence. Some countries in the Asia-Pacific - with large potential consumer markets - have registered increasing cocaine seizures in 2008 and 2009. The expansion of the cocaine market across the Atlantic and, more recently, in South America and beyond, high-lights the need to treat cocaine as a global problem, and to develop strategies on the scale of the threat. Efforts must be increasingly coordinated and integrated into an international approach that adapts to new developments and trends. 3.2 Consumption UNODC estimates the annual prevalence of cocaine use in 2009 at between 0.3% and 0.5% of the world popu- lation aged 15-64, corresponding to some 14.3 to 20.5 million people in this age range who used cocaine at least once in the preceding year. The lower and upper 86World Drug Report 2011 ranges of cocaine users in 20091 have widened, suggest- ing some increase in the estimated number of users, but also the increasing uncertainty in these estimates. The main difference from previous years is the widening of the ranges, arising from a lack of recent or reliable infor- mation in Africa - particularly West and Central Africa2 1 In 2008, the estimated annual prevalence number of cocaine users ranged between 0.3% and 0.4% of the population aged 15-64, or between 15.1 and 19.4 million people. 2 This is partly due to the fact that in previous years, estimates for the Democratic Republic of the Congo were included in the Southern - and East and South-East Asia, where starting from low levels, the use of cocaine may have increased. There is no information on the extent of cocaine use in South or Central Asia. In 2009, a substantial decrease in the esti- mates of cocaine users was recorded for North America, while cocaine use in Europe appeared to have stabilized. In geographical terms, however, cocaine use appears to have spread. In 2009, nearly half of the Member States Africa subregion and for consistency were moved to the West and Central Africa subregionTable 15: Annual prevalence and estimated number of cocaine users, by region, subregion and globally, 2009 Region/subregionEstimated number of users annually (lower)-Estimated number of users annually (upper)Percent of population age 15-64 (lower)-Percent of population age 15-64 (upper) Africa East AfricaWest and Central Africa940,000 - 30,000 730,000 2,300,0000.2 0.30.3- - 400,000 40,000 -- ----2,300,000 - 1,070,000 650,000 -0.02 - 0.030.01 - 400,000 1.4 - 1.7 Global 14,250,000 - 20,520,000 0.3 - 0.5 Table 16: Expert perceptions of trends in cocaine use, by region, 2009 Source: UNODC ARQ.

This was particularly noticeable in Africa and Asia, where increasing seizures of cocaine, though still at low levels, have also been reported in countries that had never reported any in the past. The long-term trends in expert perceptions officially reported to UNODC also point to a continuing perceived increase in the use of cocaine in Africa and Asia. Experts from half of the countries in Europe, especially West and Central Europe, considered cocaine use to be stable, while the other half of the coun-tries perceived an increase. The main stabilization or decrease in cocaine use trends is perceived to be taking place in the Americas. Cocaine use is decreasing in North America - one of the major regions of cocaine consumption North America is still the subregion with the largest number of cocaine users worldwide (5.7 million in 2009), accounting for more than a third of all cocaine users worldwide. Household surveys in the countries of North America reveal a prevalence rate of annual cocaine use affecting 1.9% of the population aged 15-64 in 2009, down from 2.4% in 2006. The United States of America has the highest prevalence of cocaine use in the region (2.4% of the population, or 5 million people aged 15-64), but there are indications of cocaine use declining over the past few years. Since 2006, among the population aged 12 years and older, there has been a continuing decline in the annual prevalence of cocaine use (from 2.5% in 2006 to 1.9% in 2009), though crack use shows a less rapidly declining trend. The reduction coincided with a supply squeeze in the US cocaine market as less cocaine arrived via Mexico. Purity-adjusted cocaine prices rose by more than 80% between 2006 and 2009.

As in the United States, cocaine use has also been decreasing considerably in Canada since 2004, when it was reported as 2.3%. In 2008, it was 1.9% among the 15-64 age group. The past-year prevalence of cocaine use in 2009 was nearly the double (3.0%) among young people (15-24 years old); a rate that has also declined since 2008, when it was reported at 5.9%. 7 In Mexico, compared to Canada and the United States, the annual prevalence of cocaine use is much lower, at 0.4%.

Cocaine use in South and Central America remains at levels higher than 8 This decline in treatment demand may stem from a change in treat- ment reporting.

The estimated annual prevalence among the adult population ranges between 0.9% and 1% in South America and 0.5% to 0.6% in Central America. The prevalence of cocaine use in South Amer-ica, though much lower than North America, is compa-rable to that in Europe. The upward trend of cocaine use reported in previous years did not continue in 2009. Except for Ecuador and Guatemala, which reported increases, experts from most of the other South and Central American countries perceived stable trends. Nearly 50% of all treatment demand reported from South and Central America (including the Caribbean) is reportedly for cocaine use, while cocaine is also ranked as the number one substance causing drug-induced or related deaths in the subregion. There is no update on the extent of cocaine use in South and Central America. Argentina (2.6%), Chile (2.4%) and Uruguay (1.4%) remain countries with high preva-lence of cocaine use among the general population in these subregions. The three Southern Cone countries, Brazil, Argentina and Chile, together account for more than two thirds of all cocaine users of South America, Central America and the Caribbean. The Caribbean countries account for 7% of the total and Central Amer-ica for 5%. Although Brazil has a lower prevalence rate of 0.7% of the population aged 15-64, because of its large popula-tion, the country has the highest number of cocaine users (900,000) in South America. According to a national survey conducted in 2009 among university students in Brazil, the annual prevalence of cocaine use was 3% of students aged 18 to 35. Cocaine use was much lower among female students than male. Among the students aged 18-24 and 25-34, comparable levels of recent and current cocaine use were reported, which was much higher than compared to cocaine use reported among the students 18 or 35 years old. 9 9 Andrade, A.G., Duarte, P . and Oliveira, L.G., I use in South and Central American and Caribbean countries, in million persons and % of total (N = 2.7 million in 2009) Source: UNODC ARQ.

In Europe and the United States of America, cocaine use is commonly reported among polydrug users. In Europe, the prevalence of polydrug use has been reported as being higher among cocaine users than can-nabis users, while cocaine users also reported higher rates of concurrent stimulant use. A study conducted in 14 European countries in 2006 revealed that around 62% of cocaine users were polydrug users. Alcohol, cannabis and heroin were the three main substances reportedly used by cocaine users. Among the clients entering treatment in Europe, the most frequently reported secondary drug - by nearly one third - was cocaine (including crack). Among cocaine users in treatment, two main groups were identified: the socially integrated individuals using powder cocaine, often during the weekend, at parties or other social occa-sions. These users typically snort cocaine, sometimes in conjunction with alcohol or cannabis. The second group is a more marginalized group of clients, often injecting and using cocaine or crack-cocaine in combination with opioids. The marginalized group of cocaine users also presented precarious health and social conditions and included former opioid users re-entering treatment for cocaine use. In a study conducted in the United States, after alcohol, cocaine was the second most used substance in combina-tions. It was included in combinations with alcohol, cannabis, alcohol and cannabis, and alcohol and opioids. Speedballing - the concurrent or simultaneous use of cocaine and heroin - has also been commonly reported in countries with high prevalence of cocaine use includ- ing the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Italy and Spain. In 14 European countries, more than a quarter of clients seeking treatment in 2006 reported concurrent use of cocaine and heroin. In a Canadian study, equal proportions of drug users were using cocaine and heroin sequentially, within the same hour or simul-taneously - as in combination. A Mexican study among drug users in prison settings reported that nearly all of them (92%) were injecting drugs and less than half were speedballing. Some reasons for speedballing suggested in the literature are: 1) when cocaine and heroin are used together, no new or novel subjective effect is experienced. Instead it simultaneously induces effects that are typical to both drugs; 2) using cocaine and heroin in low doses simulta-neously could mutually reinforce their effects; 3) cocaine enhances some effects of opioids (as a group) and reduces some adverse effects of heroin or other opioids while maintaining the 'rush' induced by heroin use; 4) for some opioid users, including those on substitution or maintenance therapy, the use of opioids would be con-sidered normal or 'medicinal' to prevent withdrawals and maintain normalcy while crack would be used to get a high. As for subsequent use of heroin or cocaine, it is suggested that heroin use could occur after cocaine to induce a depressant effect to deal with the over-excitement caused by cocaine, while cocaine could be used to reduce unpleasant side-effects of heroin, such as adverse symp-toms of withdrawal. Risks and consequences The main consequences of polydrug use, as in the case of cocaine use, are higher risks of overdose and chronic health damage. Using alcohol with cocaine can increase the levels of cocaine in the blood, enabling a longer psy-choactive effect, but also increasing the risk of cardiovas-cular problems caused by increased heart rate and blood pressure. Cocaine can also decrease the perception of alcohol intoxication effects. Suicidal ideation and violent behaviour have been linked with the concurrent use of alcohol and cocaine. When alcohol and cocaine are com-bined, the liver produces a third substance called cocae- thylene which intensifies the euphoric effects of cocaine. It has been associated with higher risk of heart attacks in users under 40 or even sudden death. Similarly, when cocaine is mixed with opioids, the nega- tive cardiovascular effects of cocaine are expanded, which can induce respiratory depression and hide the sedative effects related to opioids, thus leading to higher overdose risks. In Europe, deaths caused by the use of cocaine with other drugs represented 21% of drug-induced deaths, with opioids involved in 8% of these cases (2009). The concurrent use of cocaine and heroin has also been related with a higher probability of dropping out from treatment, relapse and co-morbidity with psychopathol-Cocaine users % of total 28Heroin 16Overall polydrug use among cocaine 65Cocaine 13Heroin 12Overall among cannabis users85Polydrug use and cannabis users* * The table compares polydrug use among long-term cocaine users and cannabis users entering treatment. Source: EMCDDA, Annual report 2009: the state of the drugs problem in Europe.93The coca/cocaine market Most countries in Europe now report a stable trend in cocaine use The annual prevalence of cocaine use in Europe is esti- mated at between 0.8% and 0.9% of the population aged 15-64, corresponding to some 4.3 to 4.8 million people who used cocaine at least once in the past year. These estimates are slightly lower than those for the previous year. Cocaine use is reportedly much higher in West and Central Europe (1.2%-1.3%) than in East and South-East-Europe (0.1%-0.3%). In 2009, many coun- tries in Europe - mainly West and Central Europe - that provided expert opinion on trends reported a perceived stabilization in cocaine use for the year 2009. Estimates of the prevalence rate for the 27 EU 10 and 4 EFTA11 countries suggest that the number of cocaine users doubled over the 1998-2006 period. Between 2006 and 2009 consumption appears to have stabilized. Despite the increase over the last decade in Europe and the decline in North America, overall cocaine use levels in the EU/EFTA region (annual prevalence of 1.2%) are still only half as high as in the USA (2.4% of the popu-lation aged 15-64 in 2009). High prevalence rates of cocaine use limited to a number of countries in western Europe T wo thirds of European cocaine users live in just three countries: the United Kingdom, Spain and Italy. With Germany and France, these countries represent 80% of European cocaine consumption. In terms of annual 10 EU countries: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and United Kingdom. 11 EFTA countries: Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.ogy than only opioid use. Users of opioids and cocaine experience more depression, anxiety and related symp-toms than users of cocaine only. There is also a higher frequency of injecting among heroin and cocaine users that may result in more sharing of contaminated inject-ing equipment. Additionally, the reported use of citric acid to prepare the injection, and flushing,* 1 increase the risk of HIV and other blood-borne infections such as hepatitis B and C as well as more soft tissue and vein damage at the injecting site. Polydrug use - particularly with cocaine - and its associ- ated risks therefore has important public health and policy implications in terms of prevention, treatment and care for heroin and cocaine users.

Cocaine use is considered to be particularly high among young people, especially males aged between 15 and 34. In the five high prevalence countries, annual prevalence among those aged 15-34 ranged from 4% to 8.4%. In these countries, cocaine is also reportedly used by opioid users who are undergoing substitution treatment. 12 In 2009, Belgium, Cyprus, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom (England and Wales) reported new prevalence data on cocaine use. Among these countries, 12 EMCDDA, Annual Report 2010: The state of the drugs problem in Europe , Lisbon, 2010Cyprus and Spain reported a substantial decrease in cocaine use. The overall trend in England and Wales over the last few years has been fluctuating, following major increases since the late 1990s. Among the other countries with high cocaine prevalence rates, Italy showed a stabilizing trend, but preliminary data from a survey undertaken in 2009 may indicate a decline. In contrast, older data for Denmark (2008) and Ireland (2007) showed rising trends in cocaine use over the previous survey period. The situation in Central Europe is mixed, where coun- tries such as the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia and Slovakia showed increases in cocaine use while others, such as Hungary and Lithuania, reported decreases in the latest surveys. In West and Central Europe, cocaine was reported as the Fig. 58: Europe: Trends in cocaine use in countries that reported new data Source: UNODC ARQ; EMCDDA.

Within West and Central Europe, treatment demand for cocaine use also varied considerably. The highest treatment demand for cocaine-related problems was in Spain (46% as a proportion of all drug-related treatment) and the Netherlands (30%). In Germany, Italy, Switzerland and the United King-dom, treatment demand for cocaine as a proportion of all treatment was around 15%. Limited information on the extent of cocaine use is reported from Africa, however, experts from the countries that have reported information perceive increases Information on the extent of cocaine use is only availa- ble from a limited number of countries in Africa. The annual prevalence of cocaine use is estimated between 0.2% and 0.8% of the population aged 15-64, corre-sponding to between 940,000 and 4.4 million people estimated to have used cocaine in the past year. The actual number of cocaine users in Africa is probably close to the lower end of the estimates. The wide range in the estimates points to an increase in the uncertainty of the data available from Africa. Among the eight countries that provided expert opinion on trends of cocaine use in Africa, four reported increases. In North Africa, where cocaine use is consid-ered to be low (0.03% - 0.04%), Algeria and Morocco reported perceived increases. The other two countries that reported an increase in cocaine use in 2009 were C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Mozambique. Nigeria and South Africa reported decreases in cocaine use as perceived by the experts. In Kenya, a household survey conducted in the coastal provinces of the country in 2009 showed a lifetime prevalence of cocaine use of 1.6% and current 13 preva- lence of 1.2% among the population aged 12-51. The small difference between current and lifetime use indi- cates that cocaine use in these coastal provinces might be 13 Current use of drugs was defined as use in the four weeks prior to the interview.Cocaine adulterants A general phenomenon in recent years has been the decline of cocaine purity in the main consumer markets of North America and Europe. This went in parallel with an increasing role played by adulterants, which are changing the pharmacological properties of the white powder that is being sold as 'cocaine.' While diluents or cutting agents (such as lactose) are simply used to increase the weight of the drugs, adulter-ants are typically psychoactive substances used to com-pensate for some of the pharmacological effects of the drug lost by lower levels of purity. The mixing of the drug with adulterants can lead to additional health problems for the users. In the case of cocaine, different substances have been used as adulterants, including the following: One of the adulterants that has been increasingly reported in cocaine samples in the United States and Europe since 2004 is levamisole. This is an anti-parasitic agent used in veterinary medicine in South America. In the United States, this was also used for the treatment of colon cancer and rheumatoid arthritis, but due to its adverse side effects, was removed from the market. When levamisole is used for longer period and in high doses, it may cause serious adverse effects, one of which is agranulocytosis. This is a condition that results in a lowering of the white blood cell count, thereby imped-ing the body's mechanism to fight infection. In Europe and the United States, up to 70% of the analysed cocaine samples were reported to contain levamisole. This led the European Early Warning System to issue a warning and initiate additional data collection. In 2009, SAMHSA also issued a public health warning on the risks of cocaine adulterated with levamisole.

The extent of current cocaine use was comparable among all age groups in the 12-50 years age range, but, as in other countries, much higher among male (2.7%) than female (0.4%) survey respond-ents. 14 T reatment demand for cocaine-related problems in Africa, from the countries that have provided data, is reported at around 5% of all treatment admissions. The highest treatment demand for cocaine-related problems, as a proportion of all treatment, was reported from Namibia and Burkina Faso. In South Africa, as reported by the South African Community Epidemiology Net- 14 National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Authority (NACADA), Report of Survey on Drug and Substance Abuse in Coast Province Kenya - Main Report, March 2010.work on Drug Use, treatment demand for cocaine use appears to have declined over the past few years, follow- ing increases in the previous years. Cocaine was reported by 5%-15% of clients in treatment as either a primary or secondary drug of abuse in the different reporting regions in the first half of 2010. 15 Several countries in Asia - especially in East and South-East Asia - perceive cocaine use to be increasing Information on the extent of cocaine use in Asia is scant and limited mainly to some countries in East and South- 15 Pl\u00fcddemann A. et al, Monitoring Alcohol & Drug Abuse Trends in South Africa (July 1996 - June 2010), Phase 28, SACENDU research brief, Vol. 13 (2), 2010, South African Community Epidemiology Network on Drug Use.Fig. 62: Range of the estimated number of cocaine users in Africa, 2009 Source: UNODC.Fig. 63: Range of the annual prevalence of cocaine use in Africa, 2009 Source: UNODC. 0500,0001,000,0001,500,0002,000,0002,500,0003,000,0003,500,0004,000,0004,500,0005,000,000 Africa North AfricaSouthern AfricaWest and Central AfricaUpper and lower range (nu mbers) 0.00.20.40.60.81.01.2 Africa North Africa Southern AfricaWest and Central AfricaUpper and lower range (%) Fig. 64: Kenya (coastal provinces): Lifetime and current use of cocaine, by age, 2009 Source: NACADA, Report of Survey on Drug and Substance Abuse in Coast Province Kenya. 1.9 1.8 1.41.6 1.41.3 0.51.21.31.2 1.21.3 00.20.40.60.811.21.41.61.82 12-17 18 - 28 20 - 39 40 - 50 51+ totalPrevalence (%) Ever Current Year Cocaine Namibia 2006 24% Burkina Faso 2008 21% Mozambique 2004 11% Kenya 2005 10% Eritrea 2009 2004 1%Table 17: Africa: Cocaine as primary drug of abuse as a proportion of all treatment admissions, recent years97The coca/cocaine market East Asia. Nevertheless, with this information gap, the annual prevalence of cocaine use in Asia is estimated between 0.02% and 0.2% of the population aged 15-64, or between 400,000 and 2.3 million people who may have used cocaine in the past year. The actual number of cocaine users in Asia is probably closer to the lower end of the range. In Asia, most of the countries that provided expert per- ception on cocaine use, perceived that use had been increasing over the past year. In 2009, 7 out of 13 coun- tries or territories reported a perceived increase in cocaine use. Many of the countries that had previously not identified any cocaine use now perceive an increase. Most of the countries that have perceived an increasing trend (starting from low levels of use) are located in East and South-East Asia; notably, China is among them. Some countries in other subregions have also perceived an increase. Hong Kong, China, is one territory - although with a very small number of cocaine users - that has been reporting continuous decreases in cocaine use over the past years. This is also reflected in the decreasing number of cocaine users registered by the authorities between 2007 and 2009, reversing the upward trend noted between 2004 and 2007. In a limited study among cocaine users and key informants conducted in 2008, the pattern of cocaine use in Hong Kong, China, showed that nearly two thirds of respondents were using crack-cocaine. Respondents strongly associated their cocaine use with night life and entertainment - clubs, discos and karaoke. 16 Cocaine use in New Zealand and Australia appears to be stable following a period of strong increases Cocaine use in the Oceania region appears generally stable following strong increases over the 2004-2007 period in Australia and over the 2003-2006 period in New Zealand. Information on cocaine use from Oceania essentially comprise survey data from Australia and New Zealand. The annual prevalence in Oceania is estimated to range between 1.4% and 1.7% of the population aged 15-64. The estimates are still lower than the levels reported from North America, but higher than those found for West and Central Europe. In Australia, the annual prevalence of cocaine use in 2007 was estimated at 1.9% of the population aged 15-64, which is comparable to the level reported from North America. As reported in the Australian Illicit Drug Data Report (2008-2009), \"recent increases in cocaine arrests and reported use, as well as considerable seizures of the drug in recent years, indicate a potential expansion of the Australian cocaine market.\" 17 There are indications that this rise did not continue, however. Cocaine use among students has shown a decline in recent years. In 2008, among the 12-17 year old students, the lifetime prevalence of cocaine use was reported at 2.4%, while the past month prevalence was 1.1%. Among the students who participated in the 16 Yueying, L., Wing, D. and Fai, J., Study of Cocaine Abuse in Hong Kong , Report to the Narcotics Division, Department of Applied Social Studies, City University of Hong Kong, November 2008. 17 Australian Crime Commission, Illicit Drug Data Report 2008-2009 June 2010.Table 18: Expert perception of trends in cocaine use in Asia, 2008 and 2009 Source: UNODC ARQ. 2008 2009 Armenia /g108 /g110 Kong, /g112 /g112 Macao, China /g110 /g3/g112 Lebanon /g112/g3Decrease; /g111/g3StableFig. 65: Hong Kong, China: cocaine and other registered drug users, 2000-2009 Source: Central Registry Drug Abuse, Narcotics Division, Security Bureau, Hong Kong, China. 05001,0001,5002,0002,500 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009Numbers Cannabis Ecstasy Ketamine Cocaine98World Drug Report 2011 survey, cocaine use across all time periods, that is, life- time, last year and past month use, increased by age and was highest among the 17-year-old students.18 Lifetime prevalence of cocaine use among 12-15-year -old students in Australia decreased significantly between 2002 and 2008 as well as between 2002 and 2005. The past month prevalence among this group was lower in 2008, but this was not statistically significant. The life-time and past month prevalence among 16-17-year-old students has been at similar levels and has not signifi-cantly decreased over the three survey periods. 19 In 2008, among the detainees tested for drug use in Australia, cocaine was found in 1% of urinalysis results. Male detainees were more likely to test positive, while the highest rates of positive urinalysis was among detain- ees aged 21 and 35 years. The prevalence of cocaine use among the detainees tested for drug use has remained consistently low over the previous years 20 which is in contrast to the high prevalence of cocaine use among the general population. Similarly, among the injecting drug users, relatively small proportions (2%-3%) have reported cocaine as the last drug injected,21 while cocaine accounted for less than 1% of the total treat- 18 White V. and Smith G., Australian secondary school students' use of tobacco, alcohol, and over the counter and illicit substances in 2008 , Drugs Strategy Branch, Australian Department of Health and Ageing. 19 Ibid. 20 Gaffney A., Jones W., Seeney J. amd Payne J., Drug Use monitoring in Australia:2008 annual report on drug use among police detainees, Monitoring Reports 09, Australian Institute of Criminology. 21 National Centre in HIV Epidemiology and Clinical Research, Australian NSP Survey National Data Report 2005-2009 , National Centre in HIV Epidemiology and Clinical Research, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, 2010.ment demand in 2007-2008.22 This also indicates that cocaine use in Australia remains more common among the socially integrated groups of mostly recreational users. The latest information on cocaine use from New Zea- land dates back to 2008, when it was estimated that 0.6% (range 0.3% - 0.8%) of the population aged 16-64 had used cocaine in the year prior to the survey. The highest annual prevalence of cocaine use (1.8%) was found among youth aged 25-34. 23 As reported by New Zealand, experts perceive cocaine use to have been stable over the past couple of years. For the remaining parts of Oceania, there is no recent or reliable information on the extent or pattern of cocaine use. 22 UNODC ARQ. 23 Drug use in New Zealand, Key Results 2007/08 New Zealand Alcohol and Drug Use Survey , Ministry of Health, 2010.Fig. 66: Australia: Cocaine use among secondary school students, 2008 Source: Australian secondary school students' use of tobacco, alcohol, and over the counter and illicit substances in 2008.Table 19: Trends in cocaine use among secondary school students in Australia, 2002, 2005 and 2008 * Significantly different from 2008 at p <.01.

The 2010 coca cultivation figure for Bolivia was not yet available at the time of printing of this report. In 2010, the global area under coca cultivation decreased by 6%, mainly due to a significant reduction in Colom- bia which was not entirely offset by a small increase in Peru. The reduction of the global area under coca culti-vation since 2007 has been driven by significant decreases in Colombia, which have been only partially offset by increases in the Plurinational State of Bolivia and Peru over the same period. A major difference between coca and other narcotic plants such as opium poppy and cannabis is that the coca bush is a perennial plant which can be harvested several times per year. This longevity of the coca plant should, in principle, make it easier to measure the area under coca cultivation. In reality, the area under coca cultivation is dynamic, changes all the time and it is dif-ficult to determine the exact amount of land under coca cultivation at any specific point in time or within a given year. There are several reasons why coca cultivation is dynamic: new plantation, abandonment of fields, reac-tivation of previously abandoned fields, manual eradica-tion and aerial spraying. There are different methods to measure the area under coca cultivation which can be affected by some or all of these factors. From a govern-ment's perspective, it may be desirable to monitor illicit cultivation in a given year by measuring all coca fields, irrespective of whether they were being used for the whole year or only part of it (gross cultivation area). For estimating potential coca leaf and cocaine production, however, it is necessary to measure the productive area. This can only be done by determining the period in the year that the coca fields were productive before being, for example, eradicated or abandoned (net productive area). The area under cultivation at a specific cut-off date may be chosen for other reasons, for example, to monitor the effect of law enforcement activities imple-mented in a specific period (net area under cultivation at date x). The national monitoring systems supported by UNODC currently in place in the Plurinational State of Bolivia, Colombia and Peru have developed different ways of tackling the challenge of measuring the dynamics of coca cultivation, depending on specific country factors, the availability of auxiliary information on eradication, as well as practical and financial considerations. While this approach helps to adjust the monitoring systems to the specificities of each country, it also limits the com-parability of the area under cultivation across countries. 3.3 Production Table 20: Global illicit cultivation of coca bush, 1999-2010 Source: Bolivia: 2002 and before: CICAD and US Department of State, INCSR.

For Colombia, the series without adjustment for small f ields was used to keep comparability. (a) Area without adjustment for small fields. (b) Area with adjustment for small fields.100World Drug Report 2011 Since 1999, when the first coca cultivation survey started as a joint activity between UNODC and the Govern-ment of Colombia, the attention of experts has shifted from being primarily concerned with the area under coca cultivation to getting a better understanding of how much cocaine is being produced. This is partly due to more appreciation of the fact that eradication, whether carried out manually or by aerial spraying, does not necessarily translate into a corresponding reduction of the coca area. The impact of eradication carried out between date A and date B may or may not be seen by comparing the area under coca at these two points in time but it will certainly be noticeable in the coca yield as farmers lose harvests or have to replant their fields. Eradication has evolved from a tool to reduce the area under coca to one component of a complex counter-narcotics intervention system, geared towards reducing the productivity of the cocaine production chain from coca leaf to cocaine HCl at different levels. Such a reduction in yield and production is captured by the productive area approach, where each hectare under coca cultivation is considered for the number of months the field is actually productive. For estimating cocaine production, the productive area approach seems to be the most appropriate but it is also the most demanding in terms of data requirements. Currently, the monitor-ing systems used in the three coca cultivating countries contain elements of both approaches, net area and pro-ductive area. In the Plurinational State of Bolivia and Peru, the area estimated from satellite imagery represents the average coca cultivation situation in the second half of the year, and it is used directly to estimate produc-tion. In Colombia, where a cut-off date at the end of the year is used for the area estimation, additional informa-tion is used to model the total productive area that contributes to the production of coca leaf and cocaine. Efforts are being made in all three countries to improve the cocaine production estimates and the concepts of the net area and the productive area - detailed below - are an important part of that process. Colombia In 2010, the area under coca cultivation in Colombia decreased significantly, by 15%. Cultivation of coca bush decreased in all major growing regions of the coun-try. The Pacific region remained the region with the largest coca cultivation, representing 42% (25,680 ha) of the national total, followed by the Central (25% or 15,310 ha) and Meta-Guaviare regions (14% or 8,710 ha). 1 Since the first coca cultivation survey implemented by the national monitoring system supported by UNODC, the average size of coca fields has decreased from around 2 ha in 1999 to about 0.7 ha - 0.9 ha since 2006. An increasing proportion of coca was cultivated on small fields. This raised concerns because the type of satellite imagery used to detect coca fields in Colombia works best for field sizes over 0.25 ha and is not suitable for identifying very small fields. Thus, a study using very high resolution imagery was conducted to determine the proportion of coca grown on fields below the 0.25 ha threshold. Based on this 1 All figures in this paragraph refer to the area adjusted for small fields.

(a) Area without adjustment for small fields.(b) Area with adjustment for small fields.101The coca/cocaine market study, an adjustment factor for small fields was intro- duced. This adjustment allows for the inclusion of coca cultivated fields that are smaller than the detectable threshold, and thereby improves the accuracy of the coca area estimate in Colombia. In 2010, the area under coca cultivation was estimated at 57,000 ha without the adjustment for small fields. This was corrected to 62,000 ha after including the small field factor. To facilitate a comparison with 2009, the 2009 figure was also corrected, from 68,000 ha without to 73,000 ha with the adjustment for small fields. Peru In Peru, in 2010, the area under coca cultivation amounted to 61,200 ha, a 2% increase (+1,300 ha) on 2009, indicating an overall stable situation. However, the coca-growing regions showed diverging cultivation trends. Upper Huallaga, the largest growing region in recent years, experienced a strong decline of almost 4,500 ha due to intense eradication. In Apur\u00edmac-Ene, the second largest growing region until 2009, a signifi-cant increase in the area under coca of more than 2,200 ha was registered, and with 19,700 ha, it became the largest growing region in 2010. Other growing regions such as Palcaz\u00fa-Pichis-Pachitea (+59%) as well as Mara\u00f1on, Putumayo and some smaller growing areas in the Amazon basin grew dramatically (+90%) and contributed to the overall increase. Some smaller growing regions such as Aguatiya and Inambari-Tambopata, which have experienced a signifi- cant increase in the area under coca in recent years, remained relatively stable in 2010. Production Due to the ongoing review of conversion factors, no point estimate of the level of cocaine production can be provided for 2009 and 2010. Because of uncertainties about the level of total potential cocaine production and about the comparability of the estimates between coun-tries, the 2009 and 2010 figures were estimated as ranges (842-1,111 mt and 786-1,054 mt, respectively). 2 High levels of cocaine seizures worldwide support the hypothesis that global cocaine production could be at a much higher level than previously estimated, mainly because traffickers have found ways to improve the effi-ciency of clandestine laboratories in extracting cocaine alkaloids from coca leaves. The lack of precise measure-ments of laboratory efficiency in the different countries increases the level of uncertainty, but does not affect the trend, which shows a clear decline in global cocaine production since 2007. A recent study (PRELAC) con- ducted jointly by UNODC and Governments of the coca cultivation countries confirmed that laboratory efficiency had improved and indicated that traffickers in the Plurinational State of Bolivia and Peru may have already reached efficiency levels comparable to Colom- bia. 3 Thus, in other parts of this Report, the upper end of the global cocaine production range has been used. This, despite the uncertainty associated with the estimate, is considered to be a better approximation of reality. PeruCocaine production in Peru has been going up since 2005 due to an increase in the area under coca cultiva-tion. It is necessary, however, to add a caveat. Coca leaf yields in Colombia have been regularly studied and updated since 2005, and part of the decline in Colom-bian cocaine production is due to declining yields. In Peru, on the other hand, information on coca leaf yields dates back to 2004, and for some of the smaller cultivat-ing regions, which experienced significant increases in the area under coca, no information on region-specific coca leaf yields is available. There are additional chal-lenges involved in estimating the yield of new or reacti-vated coca fields as opposed to mature, well-maintained ones, as well as the effects of continued eradication pres- sure. As noted above, there are indications that the level of cocaine production in Peru could be higher than previously estimated due to improvements in laboratory efficiency, but more research is needed to improve the cocaine estimate for the country. Colombia Cocaine production in Colombia decreased to 350 mt in 2010. The drop since 2005 is the result of a decrease in the area under coca cultivation and a reduction of 2 More information on the review of conversion ratios is available in the Methodology chapter of this Report and in the World Drug Report 2010 (p. 249 ff.). 3 PRELAC ('Prevention of the Diversion of Drugs Precursors in the Latin American and Caribbean Region') is a project financed by the European Commission and implemented by UNODC and Govern-ments in Latin America and the Caribbean.

Figures in italics are being reviewed. Infor mation on esti mation methodologies and definitions can be found in the Methodology chapter of this Report. coca leaf yields. There are also indications of structural changes in the way the processing of coca leaves is organ-ized. Unlike in the Plurinational State of Bolivia and Peru, where farmers sun-dry the coca leaves to increase their shelf life and facilitate transport, in Colombia, farmers typically process the fresh leaves into coca paste or cocaine base immediately after harvest. In 2005, only 24% of the coca leaf produced in that year was sold as fresh leaf, whereas in 2009, this proportion had almost doubled and reached 45%. Expressed in absolute terms, in 2005, farmers sold about 133,000 mt of fresh coca leaf to intermediaries, whereas in 2009, the same figures amounted to almost 155,000 mt, an increase by 16%. This increase is even more remarkable when considering that it happened despite an overall decline in coca leaf production in Colombia over this period. Studies show that farmers can increase their profit when processing coca leaf into coca paste and/or cocaine base rather than selling it. What could lead farmers to stop processing coca leaves themselves and sell them instead? A study on cocaine precursors conducted in 2009/2010 (PRELAC) in South America and additional studies by UNODC and the Government revealed that in Colom-103The coca/cocaine market bia, quality differences in the coca paste and cocaine base provided by coca farmers reportedly became a prob-lem for clandestine cocaine laboratories in recent years. A strategy employed by traffickers to obtain cocaine base of better or more homogeneous quality could be to try to execute more control over the cocaine alkaloid extrac-tion process. Skilled 'cooks' with better know-how, equipment and precursor chemicals may be in a better position than farmers to produce cocaine base with the sought-after properties. It is not yet known how the purchasing of coca leaf from farmers is organized and who the actors are. Neither is sufficient information available on the chemical properties of coca paste or cocaine base produced in Colombia to verify this hypothesis. What could have caused the apparent quality differences in the cocaine base produced by farmers? Since 2005, probably due to increased counter-narcotics pressure, the per-hectare yields of coca fields went down in many growing regions of Colombia and there is a tendency towards smaller fields. This may make the assembly of amounts of coca leaves large enough for cocaine processing more difficult at the farm level. As coca leaf is not sun-dried in Colombia, storing the leaves until a sufficient amount is accumulated is not an option, as fresh coca leaves deteriorate rapidly in quality. An additional reason might be that, in 2009, it was more risky for farmers to engage in coca-processing in areas where the Government has increased its presence compared to 2005. Selling coca leaf rather than keeping processing chemicals and equipment on the farm may be part of a risk-aversion strategy employed by farmers. 24% 45% 0100,000200,000300,000400,000500,000600,000 2005 2009Fresh coca leaf ( mt) Coca leaf processed by far mers (mt) Coca leaf sold as leaf by far mers (mt)Fig. 67: Colombia: Fresh coca leaf production (mt), 2005 and 2009 Source: UNODC/Government of Colombia, Coca cultivation surveys 2005 and 2009.On the other hand, field reports indicate the strong link between armed groups and coca cultivation and cocaine production. Thus, farmers may also have changed their sales strategy because of pressure from these groups. Another measure taken by traffickers was the introduc- tion of a previously unknown process called re-oxidation of cocaine base. This process is apparently an additional step used to homogenize and improve the quality of cocaine base of different quality received from different sources and geographic areas by using potassium per-manganate. According to the information available, re-oxidation is linked to clandestine laboratories producing cocaine HCl, called 'cristalizaderos' in Colombia, which presumably have a wide geographic area from where they source cocaine base. The introduction of this proc-ess into the clandestine cocaine production chain sug-gests that differences in the quality of cocaine base provided by farmers, and maybe partly also the low quality provided, indeed became a problem for traffick-ers producing cocaine HCl in recent years in Colombia. Plurinational State of Bolivia It can be assumed that, following the trend in cultiva- tion, cocaine production in Bolivia increased between 2005 and 2009. 2010 figures were not available at the time of printing of this Report. There are indications that since about 2007, clandestine laboratories in Bolivia have benefited from a transfer of know-how from Colombia. Laboratories using the 'Colombian' method are much more efficient in extracting cocaine from coca leaves. More research is needed to better understand the current efficiency of clandestine laboratories in Bolivia. Clandestine processing installations In 2009, as in previous years, the extraction of cocaine alkaloids and manufacture of cocaine HCl remained geographically concentrated in South America. The illicit extraction of cocaine alkaloids from coca leaves takes place exclusively in the three countries cultivating coca bush, namely, the Plurinational State of Bolivia, Colombia and Peru. In 2009, the destruction of 8,691 installations involved in the production of coca paste or base was reported. This figure does not include the destruction of maceration pits, a typical feature of coca paste production in the Plurinational State of Bolivia and Peru. 104World Drug Report 2011 Coca leaf: fresh - sun-dried - oven-dried In this report, coca leaf production is presented in different ways: as fresh coca leaf, as sun-dried coca leaf and as coca leaf in oven-dried equivalents. There are two main reasons. First, coca leaf is processed or traded in Colombia as fresh coca leaf, immediately after the harvest, whereas in Peru and the Plurinational State of Bolivia, farmers dry the fresh coca leaf before selling, by spreading the leaves on the ground and exposing them to air. The result is coca leaf with a much reduced moisture, which makes transport easier and allows storage of the leaves. Sun-dried leaves are also referred to as air-dried leaf. The second reason is that the moisture content of both fresh and sun-dried coca leaf varies considerably, depending on the biological properties of the leaf as well as environmental factors such as the humidity of the air. A fresh coca leaf harvested in the early morning, for example, will have a different moisture content than leaves from the same bush plucked at noon. Coca leaves sun-dried after a heavy rainfall at a low altitude will have a different moisture content than leaves sun-dried in the dry season at a high altitude. While differences may not matter much to farmers selling coca leaves, it matters from a scientific point of view, when comparing coca leaf production in different countries and estimating how much cocaine can potentially be extracted from the leaves. In other words, scientists are interested in how much dry plant matter is in the leaves, and which proportion of that dry matter consists of cocaine alkaloids. The water content of the leaves is not of interest in that context and has to be taken out of the calculation. Like other live plant material, fresh coca leaves consist mainly of water (~70%). A kilogram of fresh coca leaves would typically lose over half of its weight through sun-drying. Even sun-dried leaves contain residual moisture. When drying in a laboratory oven to remove all moisture from the leaves, sun-dried coca leaves would still lose another third of their weight. In other words, a kilogram of fresh coca leaves weighs only about 300 grams after leaving the drying chamber, which is the weight of dry plant matter. Only a tiny proportion (around 0.5%) of that plant matter is actually cocaine. Thus, when comparing coca leaf production, the weight in oven-dried coca leaf equivalent is the most appropriate. However, currently, not enough information on the moisture content of coca leaf in different regions of coca culti-vating countries is available. Therefore, a direct comparison between fresh coca leaf in Colombia and sun-dried coca leaf in the Plurinational State of Bolivia and Peru by converting all figures into oven-dry equivalents is therefore not possible. 319 77 12408 Coca paste/cocaine base producing installations Cocaine HCI labs in coca cultivating countriesCocaine HCI labs outside coca cultivating countries Other Installations8,691Fig. 68: Seizures of clandestine installations processing coca/cocaine, 2009 Source: UNODC ARQ.In addition to coca paste or cocaine base processing installations, countries reported the destruction of 396 cocaine HCl production laboratories in 2009, 319 or 81% of which were located in coca cultivating countries. This confirms reports from previous years that most of the cocaine base produced in coca cultivating countries is converted into cocaine HCl in the same countries. There are indications of some cross-border trafficking of cocaine base for further processing in other countries in the region: Argentina (36 laboratories), Ecuador (10) and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (26) all reported destruction of cocaine producing facilities. Often reports did not to specify if the installations detected were involved in producing cocaine base or HCl. It is assumed that most installations reported as being cocaine-producing were producing cocaine HCl, not cocaine base. Only a few installations involved in cocaine base or HCl manufacture were reported outside Latin America, for example, in Mexico (4) and Spain (1). Spain also reported the detection of clandestine installa- tions involved in secondary extraction of cocaine. 105The coca/cocaine market Cocaine is sometimes dissolved in other substances to prevent detection. T raffickers use secondary extraction laboratories to revert that process and recover the cocaine. Most of the clandestine installations detected in Spain in 2008 and 2009 were involved in secondary extraction (24 in 2008 and 11 in 2009). Greece also reported detection of clandestine installations involved in cocaine processing. These installations were involved in repackaging and adulterating cocaine. One installa-tion handled only cocaine and four more were also handling heroin (reported under 'heroin'). More information on the detection of clandestine sec- ondary extraction installations and repackaging and adulteration sites from other countries would be useful to understand potential changes in trafficking strategies. It would also indicate the development of trafficking hubs. 106World Drug Report 2011 Global seizures of cocaine, including cocaine salts, cocaine base and crack-cocaine, increased strongly between 2000 and 2005 and were then generally stable over the 2006-2009 period, ranging between a mini- mum of 690 mt in 2007 and a maximum of 732 mt in 2009. Since 2006, seizures have shifted towards the source area of South America away from the consumer markets of North America and West and Central Europe, reflecting better international cooperation and exchange of information. South America accounted for a total of 317 mt in 2006 (44% of the global total for that year) and 442 mt in 2009 (60% of the global total). Over the same period, seizures declined by almost one third in North America (from 194 mt in 2006 to 132 mt in 2009) and by more than one half in West and Central Europe (from 121 mt in 2006 to 55 mt in 2009). Slightly more than 60% of cocaine seizures in 2009 took place in South America. North America accounted for 18% and Europe for 8% of the total. Seizures outside the Americas and Europe accounted for just 0.3% of the total. 1 US Department of State, 2011 International Narcotics Control Strat- egy Report , Washington D.C., 2011. 2 US Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration, Spe- cial Testing and Research Laboratory, Cocaine Signature Program Report, January 2010, quoted in Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission (CICAD), DEA Special Testing and Research Labora-tory and DEA Intelligence Division Briefing, OEA/Ser.L/XIV.2.47, CICAD/doc.1802/10, 3 May 2010. The three main markets for cocaine - in volume terms - are North America, notably the United States of Amer- ica, followed by Europe, notably the EU and EFTA countries, and South America. The US authorities have estimated for the last couple of years that some 90% of the cocaine consumed in North America comes from Colombia,1 supplemented by some cocaine from Peru and limited amounts from the Plurinational State of Bolivia. For the year 2009, results of the US Cocaine Signature Program, based on an analysis of approximately 3,000 cocaine HCl samples, revealed that 95.5% originated in Colombia 2 (down from 99% in 20023) and 1.7% in Peru; for the rest (2.8%), the origin could not be determined. The traf-ficking of cocaine into the United States is nowadays largely controlled by various Mexican drug cartels, while until the mid-1990s, large Colombian cartels domi-nated these operations. The origin of cocaine consumed in Europe seems to be more evenly distributed.

The importance of Colombia is more pronounced in terms of the origin of the quantities of cocaine seized in Europe. Cocaine from Colombia accounted for 25% of all cocaine seizures in volume terms in Europe over the 2008-2010 period, Peru for 6% and the Plurinational State of Bolivia for 2%. If cocaine that could be traced back to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Ecuador and Panama were added to the cocaine from Colombia, the 'Colombia-linked' cocaine seizures in Europe would rise to 69% of the total (2008-2010 period). 5 Cocaine produced in Colombia is mainly destined for consumption in overseas markets. Cocaine produced in Peru and the Plurinational State of Bolivia, in contrast, is used more within South America, notably in countries of the Southern Cone. Even though cocaine produced in Peru seems to be playing a growing role in Europe, the criminal groups organizing the trafficking from South America to Europe are still primarily Colombian (notably for trafficking operations targeting Spain, the main entry point of cocaine into Europe) and - to a lesser extent - from other Latin American countries and 4 Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Germany, Ireland, Poland, Portu- gal, Romania, Spain, Switzerland, T urkey and the United Kingdom. 5 UNODC, Individual Drug Seizures database. from various African and European countries. The influ- ence of the Mexican drug cartels, which dominate cocaine sales to the United States, seems to be limited when it comes to trafficking to Europe or trafficking to countries in South America. The global seizure total of 732 mt in 2009 refers to cocaine seizures as reported, that is, unadjusted for purity. Although precise purity adjustments at the level of individual countries are not feasible with the current available data, a range can be calculated for global purity-adjusted seizures of cocaine. 6 By expressing this quantity as a percentage of the global supply of cocaine, one obtains the interception rate. In order to account for the time lag incurred between cultivation and traffick-ing, one may consider the average production in the preceding two years (2007 and 2008) as a proxy for global supply. This calculation yields a range of 46%- 60% for the interception rate. However, this range should be interpreted with caution, as it depends on the current estimates of cocaine production, which are cur-rently being reviewed. Americas In 2008 and 2009, the Americas accounted for more than 90% of global seizures of cocaine, with seizures amounting to 656 mt in 2008 and 673 mt in 2009. The largest seizures continued to be made by Colombia and the United States. Large quantities of cocaine continue to be trafficked from South America to the United States, with Mexico being the key transit country. Over 6 Considering data for 2009 only, global estimates indicate a range of 431-562 mt. The upper end of the range is obtained by considering purities at wholesale level only, which accounts plausibly for the vast majority of seizures by weight, while the lower end is obtained using both retail and wholesale purities and assuming that the retail level accounts for no more than one half of seizures by weight.Fig. 71: Distribution of global cocaine seizures by region, 2009 Source: UNODC ARQ.

This can be attributed to intensified efforts by the Colombian authorities to fight cocaine trafficking and to improved international cooperation, notably with law enforcement authorities of key countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom and Spain Every year from 2002 to 2009, Colombia registered the highest national cocaine seizure total worldwide. In 2009, seizures amounted to 253 mt, 7 essentially sustain- ing the record level of 2008 (256 mt). According to Colombian authorities, 8 in 2009, 48% of cocaine sei- zures in Colombia were made in territorial waters. Colombia also continued to seize large quantities of substances that may be used in the extraction and processing of naturally occurring alkaloids. 9 It appears that Ecuador, which shares borders with both Colombia and Peru, may have acquired increased impor-tance as a hub for cocaine trafficking. In 2009, seizures in Ecuador reached a record level of 65 mt, 10 the second 7 Data from the Observatorio de Drogas de Colombia, August 2010. Excludes seizures of 'basuco' (1.9 mt).

According to Ecuado- rian authorities,11 seizures of drugs and precursor chem- icals by the Ecuadorian law enforcement agencies suggest that drug traffickers are increasingly seeking to use Ecua-dor for the stockpiling, storage and trans-shipment of vast quantities of cocaine. Cocaine is trafficked into Ecuador across the Colombia-Ecuador border, into the provinces of Esmeraldas, Carchi and Sucumbios, as well as across the Peru-Ecuador border, into the provinces of El Oro, Loja and Zamora Chinchipe, 12 and is then traf- ficked on to the consumer markets in North America and Europe. The country's more prominent role was also visible in reports of cocaine consignments seized in Europe involving Ecuador in the trafficking route, which rose from 6 seizure cases in 2005 (amounting to a total of 25 kg of cocaine) to 67 in 2009 (amounting to a total of 2.5 mt). In the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, seizures peaked at 59 mt in 2005, and have fallen to approximately one half that level since then, amounting to 28 mt in 2009. According to preliminary data, this trend continued into 2010, with seizures falling to 20 mt. 13 The decrease was also reflected in reports of significant individual drug seizures made in Europe; considering reports from nine countries 14 which provided data on the provenance of 11 Country report by Ecuador to the T wentieth Meeting of Heads of National Drug Law Enforcement Agencies, Latin America and the Caribbean, Lima, Peru, 4-7 October 2010. 12 Presentation by Ecuador to the T wentieth Meeting of Heads of National Drug Law Enforcement Agencies, Latin America and the Caribbean, Lima, Peru, 4-7 October 2010. 13 Presentation by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to the T wenti- eth Meeting of Heads of National Drug Law Enforcement Agencies, Latin America and the Caribbean, Lima, Peru, 4-7 October 2010. 14 Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Portugal, Romania, Fig. 72: Cocaine seizures in the Americas, 1999-2009 Source: UNODC DELTA.Fig. 73: Cocaine seizures in South America, by country, 2009 Source: UNODC DELTA. 0100200300400500600700800 1999 2000 2001 200220032004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009Tons Americas (total) Colombia United States of A mericaEcuador, 65 mtColombia, 253 mt Colombia Ecuador Venezuela (Bolivarian Re public of) Bolivia (Plurinational State of) Brazil Peru Argentina Chile Uruguay Other109The coca/cocaine market individual cocaine seizures in both 2006 and 2009, the number of seizures involving the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in the trafficking route fell from 151 (amount-ing to a total of 9.4 mt) in 2006 to 59 in 2009 (amount-ing to a total of 6.6 mt). Expressed as a proportion of the total cocaine seizures made in Europe (where infor-mation on provenance was included), these cases fell from 12% to 4% in terms of the number of seizures, but increased from 36% to 41% in terms of quantity. In 2008, seizures of cocaine reached relatively high levels in both the Plurinational State of Bolivia and Peru, com-pared to previous years. Since then, seizures in Bolivia essentially sustained the high level, amounting to 27 mt in 2009 and 29 mt 15 in 2010, while seizures in Peru receded to 21 mt (from 28 mt in 2008) and rose back to 31 mt 16 in 2010. The Plurinational State of Bolivia assessed that, in 2009, more than 95% of cocaine traf-ficking on its territory occurred by land; moreover, according to Bolivian authorities, 17 cross-border traf- ficking occurred from Bolivia into Argentina, Brazil and Chile and also from Peru into Bolivia. In contrast, according to Peruvian authorities, 18 international traf- ficking organizations operating in Peru preferred mari-time routes, with the ports of Callao, Chimbote and Spain and Switzerland. 15 Preliminary data from the Government of the Plurinational State of Bolivia. 16 Preliminary data from the Government of Peru. 17 Presentation by the Plurinational State of Bolivia to the T wentieth Meeting of Heads of National Drug Law Enforcement Agencies, Latin America and the Caribbean, Lima, Peru, 4-7 October 2010. 18 Country report by Peru to the T wentieth Meeting of Heads of National Drug Law Enforcement Agencies, Latin America and the Caribbean, Lima, Peru, 4-7 October 2010.Paita being the main points of departure. A variety of other trafficking methods are also used in Peru, includ- ing land routes, rivers, couriers, postal services and flights from clandestine airfields. In recent years, seizures of cocaine have also increased significantly in Brazil, going from 8 mt in 2004 to 24 mt in 2009, of which 1.6 mt were seized in five aircraft interceptions. 19 In 2009, Brazil was the most prominent transit country in the Americas - in terms of number of seizures - for cocaine consignments seized in Europe. The number of seizure cases which involved Brazil as a transit country rose from 25 in 2005 (amounting to 339 kg of cocaine) to 260 in 2009 (amounting to 1.5 mt). According to the World Customs Organization, in 2009 the most important secondary distribution countries (apart from the Plurinational State of Bolivia, Colombia and Peru) were the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Ecuador, Brazil and Argentina (ranked in order of the total weight of seized consignments departing from a given country). 20 With regard to cocaine reaching Europe, the World Customs Organization also noted the high quantity of cocaine arriving from Ecuador and the growing significance of Brazil and Suriname. With regard to cocaine reaching Africa, WCO noted that Brazil was the only South American country mentioned as a departure country for customs seizures made in Africa in 2009. In Argentina, cocaine seizures rose steadily from 1.6 mt 19 Presentation by Brazil to the T wentieth Meeting of Heads of National Drug Law Enforcement Agencies, Latin America and the Caribbean, Lima, Peru, 4-7 October 2010. 20 Based on seizures recorded in the Customs Enforcement Network database.

T rafficking of cocaine from Argentina to Chile was reported by both countries in 2009; Argentina also assessed that, in 2009, some of the cocaine trafficked on its territory was intended for Europe, apart from Argentina itself. Seizures in Chile rose markedly in 2007, and have since then declined slightly, amounting to 8.4 mt in 2009. Argentina was also prominent - in terms of number of seizures - as a transit country for cocaine consignments seized in Europe, with 194 such cases reported in 2009. However, these seizures tended to be small in comparison with seizure cases transiting other countries, amounting to a total of 217 kg of cocaine. Other prominent transit countries included countries in Central America and the Caribbean such as the Domin-ican Republic, Costa Rica and Panama. In 2009, sei-zures in Panama were the third largest in Latin America and the Caribbean (53 mt). The Dominican Republic assessed that, in 2009, 18% of cocaine trafficked on its territory was intended for Spain, with the majority intended for the United States. Although the seizures involving the Dominican Republic in Europe were not large in comparison with other transit countries, some large seizures were made in the Dominican Republic itself: five of the seizures in 2009 accounted for almost two thirds of the total seized in the country that year (4.7 mt). According to Costa Rican authorities, 21 in 21 Country report by Costa Rica to the T wentieth Meeting of Heads of recent years, there has been a significant increase in the quantities of cocaine seized on the sea route, involving Costa Rican nationals mostly working in the fishing industry and operating under the direction of Colom-bian nationals, using fishing boats with Costa Rican flags to transport illicit drugs. Seizures in Costa Rica reached 21 mt in 2009. Mexico continued to be a key transit country for cocaine trafficked into the United States. Cocaine seizures in Mexico fell sharply in 2008 (19 mt, down from 48 mt in 2007), in line with the trend in the United States, and increased slightly in 2009, amounting to 22 mt. The vast bulk - almost three quarters - was seized on the maritime route. The decreased level of seizures was reflected in cocaine seizures by US authorities along the border with Mexico, which followed a generally decreasing trend between the last quarter of 2005 and the second quarter of 2008. 22 In 2009, seizures along the US-Mexico border rose slightly, from 17.8 mt in 2008 to 20.5 mt, but remained below the peak level of 28 mt registered in 2006. It appears that several factors have contributed to a shift in the traffick- ing routes from Mexico to the United States, including high levels of inter-cartel violence in Mexico and efforts by Mexican authorities to confront the drug cartels. Seizures by the United States peaked at 201 mt in 2005, and have since fallen considerably. In 2009, seizures appeared to stabilize at slightly more than half the 2005 level - 109 mt. Together with other indicators, this sug-gests that the availability of cocaine in the United States has stabilized at a reduced level.

This was largely due to a decline in purity, which fell from an average of 70% in the last quarter of 2006 to 45% in the last quar-ter of 2008 and 46% in the last quarter of 2009. Seizures by the United States include large quantities of cocaine seized at sea. They accounted for approximately one half of the total for the United States in 2009. In terms of seizure cases, the majority continued to be smaller domestic cases. A comparison of purity-adjusted cocaine prices at key points along the cocaine trafficking route in the Ameri-cas confirms that the mark-up in price occurs largely towards the end of the supply chain. The price at the wholesale level is about one quarter of the price at the retail level, while the price in producing countries only amounts to 1% of the final (retail) price. At the global level, the total reported quantity of crack- cocaine seizures is negligible in comparison with seizures of cocaine base and cocaine salts. This may partly be due to the fact that some countries do not report seizures of crack-cocaine, but also because individual seizures of crack-cocaine, possibly made at street levels, tend to be much smaller. 23 This includes all purchases, irrespective of the size of the transaction, and thus may correspond neither to retail nor wholesale price levels.Several countries in the Americas, notably in Central America and the Caribbean, as well as Brazil, the United States and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, report seizures of crack-cocaine as well as cocaine base or cocaine salts. In 2009, seizures of crack-cocaine amounted to 194 kg in Panama, 163 kg in the United States and 80 kg in the Bolivarian Republic of Vene- zuela; in 2008, the largest quantity was seized in Brazil (374 kg). 24 In 2009, the largest number of such seizures worldwide were reported by the Dominican Republic (4,173 seizure cases), Canada (1,822) and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (1,643). EuropeEurope is the world's second largest consumer market for cocaine and continues to account for the majority of cocaine seizures made outside the Americas. Seizures peaked at 121 mt in 2006, then declined for three years in a row, falling to less than half this level - 57 mt - in 2009. The decreasing trend was observed in the West European countries that account for the biggest seizures in Europe, though several other countries have regis-tered increases. 24 A breakdown of cocaine seizures in Brazil for 2009 was not available.

Spain consistently reports the highest cocaine seizures in Europe, though seizures fell from 50 mt in 2006 to 25 mt in 2009. In neighbouring Portugal, the decrease has been more pro-nounced, from 34 mt in 2006 (the second largest in Europe for that year) to 2.7 mt in 2009 (the seventh largest). Significant declines have also been registered in the Netherlands, where seizures fell from the peak level of 14.6 mt in 2005 to 6.8 mt in 2008. 25 In relative terms, seizure trends across Europe in recent years appear to fall broadly along a continuum ranging from strong declines close to the trafficking hubs that serve as the major points of entry or distribution in Europe to strong increases in countries, notably further east, that historically have not been associated with traf- ficking of cocaine in large amounts. When comparing average seizures over 2005-2006 with 2008-2009, marked declines (in both relative and absolute terms) were registered in Portugal, Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands; 26 more moderate declines were registered in the United Kingdom and France, while seizures were essentially stable in Italy and Germany. On the other hand, increases of more than 30% were observed in 25 Seizure data for the Netherlands for 2009 were not available. 26 Considering data for 2008 only for the Netherlands.several countries further east, including the Russian Federation, T urkey, Poland, Greece, Ukraine and Roma-nia. In Ireland, seizures peaked in 2007, and have also declined significantly since then. This pattern suggests that, while the established trafficking routes for cocaine entering Europe continue to be important, cocaine may be entering Europe along new routes. Romania reported cocaine seizures of 1.3 mt in 2009; this appears to include a single seizure of 1.2 mt at the port of Constanta, from two containers that arrived from the port city of Paranagua, Brazil in January 2009. The ensuing investigation also led to the seizure of 3.8 mt of cocaine in Paranagua in February 2009, also des-tined for Romania. 27 Purity-adjusted cocaine retail prices in West and Central Europe rose markedly in 2006, the year when seizures peaked; this was mainly due to a drop in purity. One pos-sible explanation could be that heightened law enforce-ment efforts impacted on the availability of cocaine in the European cocaine market, and traffickers responded to this by selling the drug at reduced purities rather than raising the bulk price. Since 2006, the purity has remained relatively low, with adjusted prices. The purity-adjusted price - expressed in euros - declined between 2006 and 2008, and appeared to stabilize in 2009. When adjusted for inflation, the purity-adjusted retail price in 2009, expressed in euros, was equal to (within 1%) that in 2005, prior to the increase in 2006. While these data need to be interpreted with caution, it is plau-sible that alternative cocaine trafficking methods and routes adopted by traffickers to counter more effective law enforcement efforts have corrected a short-term drop of cocaine availability in the European market. Moreover, the decline of cocaine prices expressed in euros over the 2006-2008 period went hand in hand with strongly falling value of the US dollar during that period, thus rendering imports, including cocaine imports, cheaper for the consumers. AfricaCocaine seizures remained limited in Africa, amounting to less than 1 mt in 2009, down from 2.6 mt in 2008 and 5.5 mt in 2007. Although this quantity is very small in comparison with the quantities likely to be trafficked in and via Africa, seizure data from other regions also point to a decreasing trend for Africa, notably West Africa, for cocaine trafficking from South America to Europe. Nevertheless, cocaine trafficking in West Africa persisted, and Africa, especially West Africa, remained vulnerable to a resurgence.

However, there were signs that cocaine trafficking might be making inroads into new consumer markets. Seizures in the Asia-Pacific reached a record 1.6 mt in 2008, and stood at 766 kg in 2009. In Australia, seizures rose from 626 kg in 2007 to 930 kg in 2008. In 2009, seizures in this country fell to 288 kg, but in 2010, two large seizure cases alone brought the partial total to more than 700 kg.33 With reference to the period 1 July 2008 to 30 June 2009, Australia reported that nearly 70% of cocaine detections (by number) occurred in the postal stream, and that Mexico, 33 Australian Federal Police, Drug syndicate smashed, 464 kg of cocaine seized , media release, 14 October 2010.Colombia, Panama, Argentina, Canada, the United States, Brazil, the United Arab Emirates, Singapore, South Africa, the Plurinational State of Bolivia, Kenya and the Netherlands were all embarkation countries for the import of cocaine consignments larger than 1 kg. Moreover, Australia pointed to a possible shift away from imports of small quantities of cocaine. In 2008 seizures rose to 664 kg 34 in China, including the 69 kg that were seized in Hong Kong, China and the 64 kg 35 in Taiwan Province of China. In 2009, China reported seizures of 163 kg, including 112 kg in Hong Kong, China. According to Chinese authorities, cocaine was mainly smuggled from South America across the Pacific ocean to cities on China's south-east coast. 36 In 2009, the Philippines registered a record level of cocaine seizures of 259 kg; in contrast, seizures in this country amounted to less than 3 kg annually over the period 2003-2008. The increase was partly due to a large quantity of cocaine that was jettisoned in December 2009 close to the Eastern Samar province from a vessel on its way from South America to China. T wo other significant cases resulted in the seizure of a total of 15.5 kg of cocaine in the Port of Davao. The Philippines assessed that 30% of the total reached the Philippines via Germany, and an additional 30% via Malaysia, and that the cocaine was intended for China (40% was intended for Hong Kong, China). 34 UNODC, data collated by DAINAP , 35 Food and Drug Administration of Taiwan Province of China 36 National Narcotics Control Commission of China, presentation at the T wentieth Anti-Drug Liaison Officials' Meeting for International Cooperation (ADLOMICO), October 2010Fig. 81: Cocaine prices and purity in West and Central Europe, 2003-2009 Source: UNODC ARQ.

The size of the United States' market - the single largest cocaine market for decades - has been shrinking in recent years, mainly due to a reduction of the cocaine flows from Mexico to the United States. The massive decline of the US cocaine market has been partly offset by a rise of cocaine use in new destination markets (mainly in areas with above average purchasing power) and countries caught in the transit flow. Cocaine trafficking and use have started to affect countries in the Oceania region (already showing high annual cocaine use prevalence rates by interna-tional standards), countries in western and southern Africa affected by the transit flow, and in some parts of Asia (some countries in the Near and Middle East as well as some emerging pockets in a few countries in the Far East). The most developed cocaine market outside of the Americas continues to be Europe, notably West and Central Europe. Cocaine use in East Europe, in con-trast, is still limited. The volume of cocaine consumed in Europe has doubled over the last decade, even though data for the last few years show signs of stabilization at the higher levels. While European law enforcement agencies have increased their efforts, traffickers continue to innovate, seeking novel ways of getting their product to the con-sumer. Around 2004, South American traffickers began to experiment with some new trafficking routes via West Africa. In a few years, they managed to undermine secu-rity and sow high-level corruption in a number of West African states. Recognizing the threat, the international community undertook a variety of interventions to address this flow. The novelty aspect was lost, the politi-cal instability proved self-defeating, and some very large seizures were made. By 2008, there was a remarkable decline in the number of both large maritime seizures and the number of cocaine couriers detected flying from West Africa to Europe. Criminal intelligence work indi-cates that the flow may have declined, but it did not stop. This raises the possibility that traffickers had simply modified their techniques, finding new methods for bringing cocaine to Europe, including through West Africa, without detection. Statistical data support this scenario: European cocaine seizures decreased from 121 mt in 2006 to 57 mt in 2009. But demand has not dropped by half during this period. Some (but not all) of the decline may be explained by improved upstream interception efforts as a result of improved sharing of intelligence with counterparts in South America. 37 Cocaine consumption estimates One of the most challenging tasks is to transform esti- mates on the number of cocaine users into quantities of cocaine consumed. Information on per capita use is still limited (a few studies conducted in North America, South America, Europe and Australia) and any calcu-lated results must be treated with caution (and results are subject to change, whenever more reliable informa- tion becomes available). The best reading of existing data and estimates suggests that some 440 mt of pure cocaine were consumed in 2009. This would be in line with a production estimate of some 1,111 mt of cocaine, wholesale purity-adjusted seizures of 615 mt and global losses of some 55 mt (5% of production). Of the 440 mt available for consumption, around 63% were consumed in the Americas, 29% in Europe, 5% in Africa, 3% in Asia and less than 1% in Oceania. The largest subregional markets were found in North Amer-ica (close to 180 mt or 41% of the total), West and Central Europe (123 mt or 28%) and South America (85 mt or 19%). These three subregions account for 63% of global cocaine consumption. The single largest cocaine market - despite strong declines in recent years - continues to be the United States of America, with an estimated consumption of 157 mt of cocaine, equivalent to 36% of global consumption, which is still higher than the cocaine consumption of West and Central Europe. Cocaine consumption in volume terms appears to have declined by more than 40% over the 1999-2009 period in the United States to some 157 mt (range: 133-211 mt), with most of the decline (more than a third) having taken place between 2006 and 2009. As compared to estimates for 1989, cocaine consumption in the United States seems to be now some 70% lower (range: -63% to -77%), in parts reflecting the increase in treatment and successes in prevention, while the latest decline over the 2006-2009 period was attributed more to reduced supply. 37 UNODC, The Transnational Cocaine Market , April 2011.120World Drug Report 2011 Fig. 85: Estimates of the amounts of cocaine consumed, by region, subregion and globally, 2009 Source: UNODC estimates based on ARQ data and the 2005 World Drug Report, as well as updates based on selected scientific studi es.

Cocaine consumption in the EU and EFTA countries is estimated to have almost doubled, from 68 mt in 1999 (range: 57-79 mt) to 123 mt in 2009 (range: 100-142 mt). Between 2006 and 2009, cocaine consumption stabilized, and between 2007 and 2009, it may have slightly declined. Evolution of trafficking flows These shifts in demand have also had an impact on the nature of transnational cocaine trafficking. In the late 1990s, the bulk of the world's cocaine was shipped to the United States, increasingly controlled by Mexican groups. The Caribbean, which was the preferred transit zone when the Colombian cartels dominated the market, saw decreased trafficking as a growing share was moved via the Pacific through Mexico into the United States. Colombian traffickers, who had largely been driven from the more lucrative portions of the supply chain to North America by the Mexican cartels, increasingly focused on the growing European market. T raditionally, there have been several parallel streams of cocaine flowing into Europe. Commercial air couriers, sometimes directed by West African groups in the new millennium, have flown to Europe from various inter-mediate countries in the Caribbean. Colombian groups also made use of commercial air carriers, often in coop-eration with groups from the Dominican Republic, with whom they have a long-standing relationship. Larger maritime consignments were often stored on board 'mother ships' and transported to shore by smaller ves-sels. The primary maritime points of entry were Spain (due to proximity and cultural links) and the Nether-lands (due to the large port). These vessels typically transited the Caribbean.Some time around 2004, the Colombian groups began experimenting with routing their cocaine shipments through West Africa. From 2005 to 2008, a series of very large cocaine seizures took place in or near West Africa. Many of these involved 'mother ships' inter-cepted by European navies. There were also incidents where modified small aircraft were used. High-level officials were involved in some countries. There was also a sharp increase in the number of cocaine couriers found on flights from West Africa to Europe. Around 2008, local political events (leading to the top- pling of some of the regimes in West Africa that cooper-ated closely with the narco-traffickers) 38 coupled with international attention to the issue, led to in a dramatic reduction in the number and volume of seizures, includ-ing both maritime shipments and commercial air couri-ers. In parallel, the proportion of individual cocaine seizures in Europe that transited countries of West and Central Africa declined from around 25% in 2007 (range: 21%-30%) to some 13% in 2009 (range: 11%-17%). In 2008, only four large (over 100 kg) seizures were made, and in 2009, only one. According to IDEAS, an air courier database, in the second quarter of 2007, 59% of cocaine couriers detected were from West Africa, while in the third quarter of 2009, there were none. Since then, some increases - up to 5% of couriers detected - were again reported in the fourth quarter of 2009 and, on average, 11% in 2010. Despite this apparent reduction or even disruption, informal reports indicated that the trafficking contin-ued. The use of jet aircraft, which can fly deeper inland in Africa, might have become an alternative method of moving cocaine through West Africa to Europe. 38 UNODC, The Transnational Cocaine Market , April 2011.Fig. 87: Estimates of cocaine consumption in the EU and countries (mt), 1998-2009 Source: UNODC ARQ; Government reports; UNODC, Drug Report 119114 101123142 020406080100120140160 1998 1999 2000 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009Metric tonsAverage of all esti mates Estimate based on annual prevalence and 2005 WDR per capita esti mates Estimate based on annual prevalence and UK per capitaestimates Estimate based on annual and monthly prevalence and multicity study per capita esti mates Estimate based on annual and past month prevalence (ONDCP model)122World Drug Report 2011 recent data suggest that the downward trend did not continue in 2009 and some early indications for 2010 suggest that the importance of the Caribbean may have started to rise again. Seizures made in South American countries outside the Andean region, in Central America and the Caribbean in relation to shipments towards North America are estimated at slightly less than 100 mt (purity-adjusted). A further 100 mt of purity-adjusted cocaine seizures are made in North America. Thus, out of 380 mt exported to North America, only some 180 are available for consumption, of which the bulk (88%) is consumed in the United States. The second largest flow is to Europe. The global shift in demand has also affected trafficking routes to Europe, with much greater volumes crossing the Atlantic by air and sea. Some 220 mt or 26% of total cocaine exports left the Andean countries for West and Central Europe in 2009. Of this, close to 60 mt (purity-adjusted) were seized in other South American countries or in the Car-ibbean. Thus, close to 160 mt left South America for West and Central Europe in 2009. The seizures in West and Central Europe (including seizures on the open sea off the shores of Europe) amounted to some 35 mt (purity-adjusted), leaving 123 mt for consumption in this region (range: 100-138 mt). This is in line with an overall prevalence rate of 0.8% of the population aged 15-64 and per capita use levels of around 30 grams of pure cocaine per user per year, for a total population of around 480 million people in West and Central Europe (EU and EFTA countries). The overall amount consumed in Europe is estimated at 129 mt, suggesting that West and Central Europe (123 mt) accounts for 95% of the total European cocaine market. An analysis of individual drug seizures reported in Europe suggests that more than 86% of the drugs were trafficked directly to West and Central Europe, while around 13% were trafficked via West Africa. T rafficking via West and Central Africa would have amounted to some 21 mt. 39 In addition, cocaine is trafficked for local demand to West and Central Africa - a subregion with a combined population of more than 400 million people, which may consume some 13 mt.

The bulk of cocaine shipments are still by sea across the Pacific to Mexico and on to the United States. In addition, Central American countries have gained prominence in recent years as trans-shipment locations. The Caribbean, in contrast, has lost signifi-cance as a trans-shipment hub over the last decade.

All numbers in this table have been adjusted to pure cocaine equivalents. Seizure data were adjusted based on reported wholesale purity data. ** The global cocaine production in 2009 was estimated to amount to between 842 mt and 1,111 mt. Actual cocaine consumption for 2009 was esti- mated at 440 mt. Seizures, not adjusted for purity, amounted to 732 mt in 2009.Considering purity-adjusted seizures of cocaine (unweighted average of all purities at retail and wholesale level reported by Member States in 2009), some 481 mt would be available for consumptio n and losses if the lower cocaine production estimate were used. If the higher cocaine production estimate were used, deducting seizures adjusted for wholesale purity (based on 2009 purity data or the latest year available), some 496 mt would be left for consumption and losses. The upper and the lower production estimates could be thus sufficient to cover consumption (440 mt). For the calculation shown above, the higher production estimates and seizures adjusted at wholesale purities were used. This reflects the observation that wholesale seizures account for the bulk of seizures in volume terms and would support the higher production estimates. However, one cannot exclude the possibility that seizures may be over-estimated due to possible double-counting once several law enforcement agencies within or across countries have been involved in cocaine interceptions.124World Drug Report 2011 West Africa could have thus amounted to some 35 mt in 2009 (range: 21-55 mt), equivalent to 4% (range: 2%-6%) of total cocaine exports out of the three Andean countries - of which almost two thirds was for subse-quent onward transit traffic to West and Central Europe. Current value and money flows The value of the global cocaine market is most certainly lower than it was in the mid-1990s, when prices were much higher and the US market was strong. In 1995, the global market was worth some US$165 billion, which had been reduced to just over half of this by 2009 (US$85 billion; range: US$75-US$100 bn). North America and West and Central Europe accounted for 86% of the global cocaine market in economic terms in 2009. North America accounted for 47% and West and Central Europe 39% of the total. While the North American market shrank over the last two decades - due to lower volumes and lower prices - the European market expanded. Nonetheless, the US market remains the largest market globally, but the market of the countries of West and Central Europe (US$33 billion at retail level in 2009) is - in economic terms - now nearly as large as the US market (US$37 billion in 2009).

The rest went to farmers in the Andean region. The largest gross prof-its were reaped from cocaine sales in North America (some US$34 billion), followed by countries of West and Central Europe (some US$23 billion). Expressed as a proportion of GDP , the cocaine profits were rather small (0.2% of GDP in North America and 0.1% in West and Central Europe). Profits from international trafficking to North America and Europe amount to some US$15 bn. This suggests that more than 85% of global cocaine profits were related to demand for cocaine Fig. 88: Value of the global cocaine retail market (in billion constant 2009 US$), 1995, 2008 and 2009 Sources: UNDCP , Economic and Social Consequences of Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking, 1997 (re-valued based on US consumer price index); UNODC estimates on the size of the global cocaine market for 2009, based on ARQ data and other Government sources.

Cocaine-related profits generated in South America, Central America and the Caribbean from trafficking cocaine to North America and West and Central Europe amounted to some US$18 billion in 2009, equivalent to 0.6% of the total GDP of South America, Central America and the Caribbean. Of the cocaine trafficked to meet demand in West and Central Europe, UNODC estimates - based on an analysis of reported individual drug seizures in terms of volumes and number of seizure cases - that some 13% (range: 11%-16%) transited West Africa in 2009. Reports indicated that up to one third of the shipments is paid in kind to service providers in West Africa, who then traffic most of this cocaine to Europe on their own behalf. In addition, profits are made in supplying the West African cocaine market. The potential wholesale profits affecting West Africa in 2009 amount to US$0.8 billion, equivalent to 0.2% of GDP in West and Central Africa. These figures do not include profits made by West African citizens engaged in European cocaine retail sales (often European residents, illegal immigrants or asylum seekers). European retail profits amount to some US$20 billion. Arrest statistics of West African citizens in relation to cocaine trafficking (for example, more than 23% in Portugal in 2008 and more than 16% in France in 2006) suggest that West African groups play an important role in cocaine street sales in several (mainly continental) European countries. Assuming that the West African groups reap, on average, between 5% and 10% of the European cocaine retail profits, this would amount to another US$1-2 billion in potential cocaine-related income.

The ATS market 127 4.1 Introduction The term amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) refers to a group of synthetic substances comprised of ampheta-mines-group substances (primarily amphetamine, meth-amphetamine and methcathinone) and ecstasy-group substances (MDMA and its analogues). ATS are available in diverse forms and purities. Meth- amphetamine or amphetamine can be in powder, tablet, paste or crystalline form while 'ecstasy' is usually avail-able in tablet or powder form. 4.2 Consumption For the past two decades, the use of amphetamine type stimulants (ATS) has been one of the most significant drug problems worldwide. This section describes the trends in the use of amphetamines-group and ecstasy-group substances in the different regions. Amphetamines-group substances In 2009, UNODC estimates that, with an annual prev- alence ranging between 0.3% and 1.3%, between 13.7 and 56.4 million people aged 15-64 globally had used amphetamines-group substances at least once in the past year. While these numbers reflect a slight increase over estimates for previous years, they do not essentially indi- cate a significant difference in the prevalence of amphet- amines-group substances. The type of amphetamines-group substances used in different regions varies considerably. In East and South- East Asia, methamphetamine is the primary substance consumed within this group, while in the Near and Middle East, the use of tablets sold as Captagon is reportedly more common. In Europe, amphetamine is the main substance used within this group with the exception of Czech Republic and Slovakia, where meth-amphetamine has traditionally been the predominant amphetamines-group substance used. In North America as well as Australia and New Zealand, the use of prescription stimulants 1 is as common as methamphetamine. In South America and the Carib-bean, prescription stimulants are more commonly used. In Africa, especially in West, Central and East Africa and some parts of Southern Africa, the use of amphetamines-groups substances may comprise use of prescription stimulants. In South Africa, methamphetamine and methcathinone are the most commonly used ATS. In 2009, out of the 69 Member States that reported expert perception on amphetamines-group use trends through the Annual Reports Questionnaire, an equal number of countries perceived increasing and stable trends in the use of ATS over the past year. In Asia, however - particularly in South and South-East Asia - the majority of countries reported a perceived increase in the use of ATS in their countries. T rends over the past 12 years in the perceived increase in use of ATS as reported by Member States indicate that since 2001, the rate of increase has been much higher and more substantial in the developing (non-OECD) countries than in the developed (OECD) countries. In developing countries and especially emerging econo- 1 Prescription stimulants may include substances such as amfepra- fenetylline, methylphenidate, phenmetrazine, et cetera.128World Drug Report 2011 mies, there is an expanding middle class with more dis- posable income. The association in developed countries of synthetic drugs, especially stimulants, with moderni-zation and affluent lifestyles, combined with increasing demands for higher performance and the availability and reported common use of stimulants in recreational and entertainment settings, may be contributing to an increase in the use of stimulants in developing countries where young people within the growing middle class may want to emulate these lifestyles.

While this estimate was significantly higher than the estimate in 2008 (95,000), it is still substantially lower than the estimate for 2002 (299,000), 2 and far lower than the reported initiates for most other illicit drugs (except for PCP). In line with the annual prevalence, the number and proportion of people who had reported non-medical use of stimulants in the past 30 days (prior to the survey) increased sig-nificantly from 904,000 (0.4%) in 2008 to 1.3 million 2 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Results from the 2009 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: Volume I . Summary of National Findings, Rockville, Maryland, USA, 2010.(0.5%) in 2009. This increase in the prevalence of stim- ulants use is attributed in part to an increase in the number of methamphetamine users. 3 The recent increase in stimulant and notably in meth- amphetamine use among the general US population was not reflected in prevalence data for high school students for 2009. Among secondary school students in the United States, there has been a declining trend in the annual prevalence of amphetamine and methampheta-mine use between 2002 and 2008, and stable trends in 3 Ibid.Fig. 93: Expert perceptions of the trends in amphetamines-group substance consumption, 2000-2009 Source: UNODC ARQ.

Use of methamphetamine, in contrast, increased among 8th graders, remained stable among 10th graders but declined among 12th graders in 2010. Despite some increases in ampheta-mines use and a stable level of methamphetamine use 4 Johnston, L. D., O'Malley, P . M., Bachman, J. G., and Schulen- berg, J. E., Monitoring the Future national results on adolescent drug use: Overview of key findings, 2010 , Ann Arbor, Institute for Social Research, The University of Michigan, USA, 2011.among US high school students in 2010, the overall level in 2010 remained substantially lower than over the 2002-2006 period. In contrast to an overall rising trend of ATS use in the United States, the annual prevalence of ATS use among the general population in Canada (0.7%) was signifi-cantly lower in 2009 than in 2008 (1.5%). The annual prevalence of both amphetamine and methampheta-mine was substantially lower in 2009 than a year earlier (0.5% and 0.1% compared to 1.3% and 0.2% respec-tively). In Mexico, while there has been no update in the annual prevalence of amphetamines-group substance use since the last household survey in 2008, the expert perception in 2009 indicates stable trends for amphetamines use but a great increase in the use of methamphetamine over the past year. In 2009, among school students aged 12-19 in Mexico, the reported lifetime prevalence of amphetamine and methamphetamine use was 1.9% and 0.7% respectively. 5 In previous years, however, the life- time prevalence among youth aged 12-17 was reported as 0.07% for amphetamine and 0.35% for metham-phetamine. 6 Amphetamines-group substance use in South America appears to remain stable There is no updated information on the prevalence of amphetamines-group substance use in South America. Existing information shows that the annual prevalence 5 UNODC ARQ. 6 The information on annual prevalence in the ARQ for Mexico in 2008 was based on the national survey conducted among the general population aged 12-65 with the breakdown of the estimates among the ages 12-17 yearsFig. 96: United States: Annual prevalence of stimulants and methamphetamine use in the population aged 12 and older , 2002-2009 Source: Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Adminis- tration, Results from the 2009 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: Volume I, Summary of National Findings, 2010. 1.4 1.31.4 1.31.5 1.2 1.11.2 0.7 0.70.8 0.70.8 0.5 0.30.5 00.20.40.60.811.21.41.6 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009Annual prevalence (as %) Stimulants (all types) Methamphetamine 4.19 8 10 3.96.47.9 7.88.510.7 7.6 7.58.111.1 7.4 024681012 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010Annual prevalence (%) Amphet 8th grade Amphet 10th grade Amphet 12th grade Meth 8th grade Meth 10th grade Meth12th gradeFig. 97: Annual prevalence of amphetamines use among secondary school students in the United States, 2002-2009 Source: United States Monitoring the Future: national results on adolescent drug use.132World Drug Report 2011 of amphetamines-group substance use in South America remains close to the world average, with estimates rang-ing between 0.5% and 0.7% of the population aged 15-64 or between 1.34 and 1.89 million people in that age group who had used these substances in the previous year. Compared to 2008, most of the countries report-ing from the region perceive trends of amphetamine and methamphetamine use as being stable in 2009. Brazil, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and Argentina remain countries with a high prevalence and absolute number of users of amphetamine and methampheta-mine in South America. In a national survey conducted among university stu- dents in Brazil in 2009, the annual prevalence of amphetamines use among the students was reported as 10.5%. The annual prevalence was higher among female students (14.1%) than male students (5.5%), and was also higher among the older students, that is, those who were 35 years or older (18.6%), followed by students aged between 25-34 years (13.7%). 7 The use of amphet- amine-like substances is reportedly more common among women due to their anorexic effects and a preva-lent culture to use medications for weight loss purposes. 8 Although there are no recent updates on the prevalence of amphetamine and methamphetamine in Central America, as a region, it has a high prevalence of amphet- 7 Andrade, A.G., Duarte, P . and Oliveira, L.

A large pro-portion of the ATS use in these countries is related to the use of prescription stimulants. While most countries in Europe show stabilizing trends in the use of amphetamines-group substances, high levels of injecting amphetamines use are reported by a few In 2009, more than half of European countries reported stable trends of ATS use in their countries. The coun-tries that reported data show a mixed trend from previ-ous years. The annual prevalence of amphetamines-group substance use in Europe is estimated between 0.5% and 0.6%, which corresponds to an estimated 2.6 to 3.3 mil-lion people who had used these substances in the past year. Like in other regions, the majority of amphetamine users fall within the 15-34 years age group, with a much higher estimated annual prevalence of 1.2%. The amphetamines-group substance prevalence is, over- all, higher in West and Central Europe than in East and South-East Europe. In most parts of Europe, ampheta-mine is the more commonly used substance within this group, while the use of methamphetamine remains lim-ited and has historically been highest in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. In 2009 and 2010, countries that reported new data on ATS prevalence include Cyprus, Germany, Spain, Sweden and the United King- dom (England and Wales). Except for Germany and Sweden, many of these countries are showing stabilizing or decreasing trends in the use of amphetamines-group 0.10.20.20.40.50.50.50.50.60.60.70.7 0 amphetamines- group substances use in South America among the population aged 15-64, latest year available Source: UNODC ARQ.Fig. 99: Brazil: Prevalence of amphetamine use among university students, 2009 Source: I Levantamento Nacional Sobre O Uso De 25-34 35 OverallPrevalence (%) LifetimeAnnual Monthly133The ATS market substances. While in Germany, there was an increase in the annual prevalence in 2009 (0.7%) over the previous estimates in 2006 (0.5%), the estimate remains at lower levels than shown for 2003 (0.9%). Within West and Central Europe, the Czech Republic, Denmark, the United Kingdom, Norway and Estonia remain the countries with the highest annual prevalence rates, while in South-East Europe, Bosnia and Herze-govina and Bulgaria have high annual prevalence of amphetamines use. In most West and Central European countries, problem amphetamines use represents a small fraction of overall problem drug use, except for the Czech Republic and some of the Nordic countries. Those who report amphetamine as their primary substance account for less than 5% of drug users in treatment, on average, in Europe. High levels of injecting use are reported from the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Sweden and Finland, ranging from 57% to 82% among amphet-amines users. 9 Mixed trends on use of amphetamines-group substances in Africa The annual prevalence of amphetamines-group sub- stances in Africa is estimated between 0.2% and 1.4% (between 1.2 and 8 million people), reflecting the fact that for most parts of Africa, there is either limited or no recent or reliable data available on the prevalence or trends of amphetamines-group substance use, resulting 9 European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), Annual Report 2010: The State of the drugs problem in Europe , Lisbon, 2010in a wide range and uncertainty of the estimates. The only valid estimates that can be derived in the region are for Southern Africa where the annual prevalence is esti-mated between 0.4% and 1% of the population aged 15-64. Among the limited number of countries that have reported expert opinion on trends in the use of amphet-amines-group substances in Africa, nearly half of the countries report that the trend has increased while a similar proportion report stable trends over the past year. In most parts of Africa, prescription amphetamines comprise the primary substances used within this group. South Africa is one country in the region from which there is more consistent and recent information available on drug use trends. Such data - based on treatment demand - showed a strong increase in the importance of amphetamines until the second half of 2006, followed by a stabilization or small downward trend since. The importance of amphetamines increased again temporar-ily in the first half of 2009, before falling back in the second half of the year to the levels reported in 2008. The past 3 months prevalence of amphetamines-group substances in South Africa was reported at 0.7% in 2008 for the population aged 15 and above. Based on this information, the annual prevalence of amphetamines- group substance use was estimated by UNODC at between 0.7% to 1.4% of the adult population (aged 15-64) in South Africa. In contrast to the patterns in other parts of Africa, meth- amphetamine and methcathinone are the main sub-stances used within the amphetamines-group substances.

In other parts of the country, the proportion has remained very low. 10 For the other countries in Africa, for which information on treatment demand is available, amphet-amines-group substances as the primary substance of abuse among persons treated in the region averaged around 5% of all treatment demand. This ranges from 30% of all treatment admissions reported in Niger to around 2% in Nigeria. Increasing trends of amphetamines-group sub- stances use in Asia with injecting methamphetamine and its associated negative health consequences reported as an increasing problem in East and South-East Asia The annual prevalence of amphetamines-group sub- stance use in Asia ranges between 0.2%-1.4% or from 4 to 38 million people aged 15-64 who are estimated to have used these substances in the past year. The wide range and uncertainty in the estimates derive from miss-ing information on the extent and pattern of use from large countries in Asia, particularly China and India. Due to a lack of recent or reliable estimates from many countries in the region, estimates cannot be calculated for the subregions of Central and South Asia. Nevertheless, among the Asian countries reporting through the ARQ, experts in more than half of the countries, mainly in East and South-East Asia, perceived 10 Pluddemann A., Parry C., et al. Alcohol and Drug Abuse Trends: July - December, 2009 (Phase 27), South African Community Epidemiol- ogy Network on Drug Use (SACENDU) Update June 2010.an increase in the use of amphetamines-group sub- stances, compared to less than a quarter of countries in which experts perceived the problem to have stabilized or decreased over the past year. Outside East and South-East Asia, 11 Armenia, Georgia, Jordan, Pakistan and Qatar are five countries that have reported a perceived increase in the use of amphetamine-type stimulants over the past years. In East and South-East Asia, the annual prevalence of amphetamines-group substances ranges between 0.2%-1.4% of the adult population aged 15-64. 12 Metham- phetamine, both in pill and crystalline forms, is the main substance used within this group. The Philippines (2.1%), Thailand (1.4%) and the Lao People's Demo-cratic Republic (1.4%) are the countries in the subre-gion with prevalence of methamphetamine use higher than the global average. On average, the countries in South-East Asia in 2009 reported a 250% increase in the number of metham-phetamine-related arrests since 2004. The highest increase reported was from Lao People's Democratic Republic, whereas Japan has reported a decline in meth-amphetamine-related attests. 13 11 The countries and areas reporting increases in ATS use in 2009 include China (and Macao, China), Indonesia, Lao People's Demo-cratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar and Viet Nam. On the other hand, Hong Kong China, Kazakhstan, the Republic of Korea and Lebanon have reported decreasing use of ATS. 12 In East and South-East Asia, most of the information on ampheta- mines-group substances is available through the UNODC SMART programme that assists the countries in the region to monitor drug trends with a particular focus on use of amphetamine-type stimu-lants. 13 UNODC Patterns and Trends of Amphetamine-Type Stimulants and Fig. 101: Trends in treatment demand for methamphetamine as the primary sub-stance in Western Cape (Cape Town), South Africa, 2005-2009 (biannual data) Source: Alcohol and Drug Abuse Trends: July - December, 2009 (Phase 27), South African Community Epidemiology Network on Drug Use (SACENDU) Update June 2010.Fig. 102: Percentage of ATS-group substances among primary substance of abuse in treatment in Africa, 2009 or latest year available Source: UNODC AfricaNiger% in treat ment135The ATS market The treatment demand for methamphetamine in East and South-East Asia has also increased considerably over the last decade. It rose from on average a quarter of all treatment demand in 1998 to nearly half of all treatment admissions in 2009. The treatment demand for meth- amphetamine in 2009, or the latest year for which data is available, varied considerably across the countries and areas, ranging from nearly the entire treatment demand for methamphetamine use in Brunei Darussalam, the Republic of Korea and the Lao People's Democratic Republic to only 9% in Indonesia and Hong Kong, China. Heroin and methamphetamine are the two common substances being injected in East and South-East Asia, with increasing trends reported of injecting metham-phetamine in the subregion. In Thailand, injecting is the second most common method for using crystalline methamphetamine and the third most common method for abuse of methamphetamine pills. 14 In 2009, Indo- nesia reported an increasing trend in injecting heroin and crystalline methamphetamine, while Malaysia reported injecting of crystalline methamphetamine for the first time in 2009. 15 As a consequence, many coun- tries in East and South-East Asia also have concentrated HIV epidemics that are in large part driven by sharing of contaminated needles and syringes among the inject-ing drug users.

Marshall Islands, Australia and New Zealand, with annual prevalence rates of 2.7%, 2.7% and 2.1% respec- tively, remain the countries with the highest prevalence rates. The Pacific island states and territories in the region with available data report high prevalence rates of amphetamines-group substances. The annual prevalence of meth/amphetamine use among the population aged 14 and above in Australia declined from 3.4% in 2001 to 2.3% in 2007. Although there is no updated information on annual prevalence of amphetamines use among the general population since 2007, available information points to a continuing decline in the trends of amphetamines use reported through different indicators. Among Australian students aged 12-17 there has been a significant decline in both the lifetime and past month prevalence of amphetamines use from 2002 to 2005 and further to 2008. 17 The lifetime prevalence among the students had declined to 3.7% in 2008 from the 6.6% reported in 2002.18 17 White V., Smith G., Australian secondary school students' use of tobacco, alcohol, and over-the-counter and illicit substance in 2008 , Drug Strat- egy Branch, Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing, September 2009. 18 Like in other countries, the lifetime and past month prevalence of amphetamines use among students aged 16-17 is higher (6.2% and 2.4% respectively) than those aged 12-15 years (2.7% and 1.2% respectively). The monitoring among detainees who were tested for drug use in Australia in 2008 revealed that 22% of detainees tested positive for methamphetamine use, down from 27% in 2007. This proportion was lower than at any point in time since 2000. 19 Among the injecting drug users who were interviewed as part of the Illicit Drug Reporting System (IDRS), the 19 Gaffney A., et al Drug Use Monitoring in Australia: 2008 Annual Report on drug use among police detainees , Australian Institute of Criminology, 2010Fig. 106: Annual prevalence of amphetamines- group substances in selected areas in Oceania, 2007/2008* * In the case of New Zealand the estimates are for 2008, while for the rest of the countries they are from 2007.

The proportion of injectors who had used methamphetamine in the pre-ceding six months dropped from 79% in 2006 to 74% in 2007 and continued to decline to 67% in 2009 and 60% in 2010. 20 The prevalence of Hepatitis C among injecting drug users has remained stable at 61-62% over the period 2005-2008 in Australia, and is lower among those who reported using methamphetamine compared to those who reported heroin as the last drug injected. The HIV prevalence has also remained low at 1.5% among inject-ing drug users, but the prevalence is higher among drug users reporting methamphetamine as the last drug injected compared to those who reported last injecting heroin. 21 The prevalence of amphetamines-group substances in New Zealand is among the highest in the world, where 2.1% of the population aged 16-64 had used ampheta-mine in the past year (2007/2008). Methamphetamine is also injected. About 0.5% of the population had used prescription stimulants for recreational purposes in the past year. 22 As part of the drug use monitoring among arrestees in New Zealand (NZ-ADAM), amphetamines were reported as the second most common drug (10%) 20 Illicit drug reporting system (IDRS), Australian Drug Trends 2010: Key Findings - Drug Trend Conference Handouts, Australian Govern- ment Department of Health and Ageing. 21 National Centre in HIV Epidemiology and Clinical Research., Aus- tralian NSP Survey National Data Report 2005-2009 , The University of New South Wales, Sydney, 2010. 22 Ministry of Health, Drug Use in New Zealand: Key Results of the 2007/08 New Zealand Alcohol and Drug Use Survey, 2010.after cannabis, followed by methamphetamine (9%) among those tested for drug use in 2008.23 In contrast to Australia, methamphetamine use figures seem to be still rising in New Zealand. Among frequent injecting drug users the proportion of those who injected methamphetamine increased from 40% in 2006 to 50% in 2009. Frequent methamphetamine users, that is, those who had used the drug in the past 6 months, interviewed as part of Illicit Drug Monitoring System in New Zealand in 2009, were more likely to have injected methamphetamine in 2009 than in 2008 (35% vs. 23%). 24 23 Hales J and Manser J., Annual report 2008- New Zealand Police NZ- ADAM, Health Outcomes International Pvt.

Around 1.1 million people initiated their drug use with 'ecstasy' in the United States in 2009, signalling a sig- nificant increase over the previous year (894,000 people in 2008). Most (66.3%) of the 'ecstasy' users who had initiated in 2009 were aged 18 years or older, with an average age of 20.2 among those using 'ecstasy' for the first time in 2009. 26 26 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.

Results from the 2009 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: Volume Since the decline in prevalence of 'ecstasy' use in 2002, the trends remained stable between 2003 and 2008, but began to register an increase in 2009. A similar trend was observed among secondary school students, where the annual prevalence of 'ecstasy' use among students in the 8th, 10th and 12th grades, after having remained stable between 2003 and 2008, regis- tered a clear increase over the 2008-2010 period, nota-bly among the younger age groups, the 8th and 10th I.

The increase of 'ecstasy' use went, however, hand in hand with reduced risk perceptions of the harmfulness of using the substance. By contrast, in Canada, 'ecstasy' use declined in 2009 compared to the previous year. The annual prevalence of 'ecstasy' use among the population aged 15-64 was reported at 1.1% in 2009, down from 1.7% in 2008. 28 The annual prevalence among young people, aged 15-19, was 3% in 2009. 29 For Mexico there are no recent quantitative estimates on 'ecstasy' use. Expert perceptions indicate an increasing 'ecstasy' use trend in the country. In Central and South America, 'ecstasy' use remains low in the general population but higher among youth. There is no update on 'ecstasy' use in Central and South America. Available information suggests, however, that the annual prevalence among the general population remains much lower in these subregions than the world average, ranging between 0.1% in Chile and 0.5% in Argentina. El Salvador, Peru and T rinidad and Tobago reported a perceived increase in 'ecstasy' use over the past year. As in other countries, information on 'ecstasy' 27 Johnston, L.

The latest information (2008 or 2009) on lifetime prevalence of 'ecstasy' shows the prev-alence rates ranging from 0.5% in the Bolivarian Repub-lic of Venezuela to 3.7% in Chile. In Brazil, the annual prevalence of 'ecstasy' use accord- ing to a national survey conducted among university students in 2009 was 3.1%, clearly exceeding UNODC's general population estimates of around 0.2%. Like in the rest of the world, 'ecstasy' use was found to be more common among male than female students. The annual and past 30 days prevalence was higher among students aged 18-24 than for any other age group. 30 30 Andrade, A.G., Duarte, P . and Oliveira, L.G., I 111: United States: Trends in prevalence of 'ecstasy' use among the population aged 12 years or older, 2002-2009 Source: Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Adminis- tration, Results from the 2009 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: Volume I.

Between 3.7 and 4 million people aged 15-64 years used 'ecstasy' in the past year in Europe. The 'ecstasy' use prevalence rate is still higher in West and Central Europe (0.8%) than in East and South-East Europe (0.6%). Most of the countries in Europe are now reporting sta- nal Sobre O Uso De \u00c1lcool, T abaco use. Updated or new estimates for 'ecstasy' use were available from some countries in Europe, including Belgium, Cyprus, Germany, Spain Sweden and the United Kingdom (England and Wales, and Scotland). Many of these countries have reported a decline in the annual prevalence in their current surveys compared to previous years. This is in line with reports of manufacturing difficulties in a number of European countries in recent years, and thus the use of various other substances than MDMA in 'ecstasy' tablets. The Czech Republic, Latvia, Slovakia and the United King-dom remain countries with high 'ecstasy' use prevalence rates in the general population. Like in other parts of the world, most of the 'ecstasy' users are young people aged 15-34. The EMCDDA in its annual report for 2010 mentions that practically all of the estimated 2.5 million 'ecstasy' users who had used 'ecstasy' in the past year were between 15 and 34 years old. Targeted surveys in nightlife settings in European coun- tries suggest that the prevalence and patterns of stimu- lants and 'ecstasy' use, together with alcohol, remains high. Some studies even suggest that drug use patterns among club-goers are becoming increasingly 'polarized,' that is, showing ever higher prevalence rates, in sharp contrast to the situation among the general population. 31 Lack of information from Africa makes it difficult to determine any trends in 'ecstasy' use in the region Based on very limited country information, the an - nual prevalence of 'ecstasy' use - based on UNODC's 31 EMCDDA, The State of the Drugs Problem in Europe: Annual Report 2010 , 2010.11 4.9 (%) Lifetime Annual MonthlyFig. 114: Brazil: prevalence of 'ecstasy' use among university students, 2009 Source: I Levantamento Nacional Sobre O Uso De in 'ecstasy' use selected countries and areas, various years Source: 13.2 2.5 1.9 1.4 1.2 1.2 0.8 00.511.522.533.5 Belgium '94 Belgium '07 Cyprus '06 Cyprus '09 Germany '00 Germany '03 Germany '06 Germany Sweden '00 Sweden '07Sweden '08 England and Wales '06/07 England and Wales '07/08 England and Wales '08/09England and Wales '09/10 Scotland '03 Scotland '04 Scotland '06Scotland '09 Spain '01 '03 Spain '05/06 Spain '07/08 Spain '09/10Annual prevalence (%)144World Drug Report 2011 standard model - is estimated between 0.1% and 0.3% in Africa. The actual figures are probably closer to the lower end of the range or perhaps even below that range, as 'ecstasy' use in Africa is still primarily a phenomenon of youth from the upper classes and/or concentrations in some tourist resorts where the prime target group is foreigners from overseas. The wide range in the esti-mates is due to missing data or information on 'ecstasy' use from most of the region. Only three countries in Africa - Algeria, Morocco and South Africa - reported expert opinions on 'ecstasy' use trends through the ARQ in 2009. While Morocco reported an increase in 'ecstasy' use, Algeria and South Africa reported stabilizing trends for 2009. Mixed trends on 'ecstasy' use reported from Asia In 2009, nearly half (47%) of the Asian countries report- ing expert opinion on 'ecstasy' use through the ARQ considered its trends to be decreasing, while one third of the countries reported increasing trends in the past year. The annual prevalence of 'ecstasy' use in Asia is esti-mated between 0.1% and 0.6% of the population aged 15-64, or some 2.4 to 17 million people who could have used 'ecstasy' at least once in the previous year. The wide range in the estimates reflects the uncertainty due to lack of information on 'ecstasy' use for most parts of Asia. 'Ecstasy' use in New Zealand and Australia remains high Oceania (primarily Australia and New Zealand) has the highest prevalence of 'ecstasy' use in the world, with annual prevalence ranging from 3.6% to 4% of the adult population. This corresponds to between 850,000 and 920,000 people who had used 'ecstasy' at least once in the preceding year.The annual prevalence of 'ecstasy' use among the popu- lation aged 16-64 in New Zealand ranged from 2% to 3%, or an estimated 67,000 people which reported having used 'ecstasy' in the previous year (2007/2008). The highest prevalence, like in other countries, was reported among the 18-24 year age group; higher among men than women (annual prevalence of 8.9% among men and 4.9% among women in this age group). Most of the 'ecstasy' users in New Zealand were reported to have used it with alcohol (78.9%), cannabis (42.8%) and benzylpiperazine (BZP) party pills 32 (13.5%).33 In Australia, 'ecstasy' use was estimated at around 4.2% of the population aged 15-64 in 2007. Since then, there has been no update on drug use prevalence in Australia. However, in 2010, a survey carried out among 974 ath-letes indicated that one quarter had been offered or had the opportunity to use 'ecstasy' in the past 12 months. This was a higher proportion than for cannabis (22%) and cocaine (17%). Past year 'ecstasy' use was reported by 3.2% of the sample. 34 32 Products containing benzylpiperazine (BZP) and related substances, with stimulant and euphoric effects. 33 Ministry of Health Drug Use in New Zealand: Key Results of the 2007/08, New Zealand Alcohol and Drug Use Survey , 2010. 34 Dunn, M. and Thomas, J.O., 'Attitudes toward, knowledge of, and prevalence of recreational drug use among elite Australian athletes,' EDRS Drug Trends Bulletin , April 2010, Sydney: National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, University of New South Wales.Decrease Stable Increase ChinaKorea (Republic of)Armenia Hong Kong, ChinaKuwait Georgia Macao, China Malaysia Israel Indonesia LebanonJapan PakistanKazakhstan Viet NamSingaporeThailandTable 34: Asia: countries and areas reporting perception in 'ecstasy' use in 2009 Source: UNODC ARQ.147The ATS market In 2009, the global number of methamphetamine labo- ratories increased significantly, by 22%, to almost 10,200, up from 8,300 in 2008. The numbers of reported methamphetamine laboratories have continued to increase since 2007, but are still significantly lower than their peak in 2004. While the overall number of dismantled methamphetamine laboratories increased at the global level in 2009, the increase was largely concen-trated in the United States. The number of dismantled (and reported) laboratories outside the United States declined in 2009 from a year earlier, but was still at the second highest level so far. Significant manufacturing locations Methamphetamine is manufactured in all North Ameri- can countries. Over the last decade - and notably in 2009 - Mexico has become an important manufacturing location. In 2009, Mexico reported the dismantling of 191 laboratories, up from 21 in 2008. The upward trend in manufacturing appears to have continued in 2010, with 63 laboratories dismantled up to May 2010. 37 While the number of laboratories seized in Mexico is still substantially lower than in the United States, the Mexican operations tend to manufacture large quanti-ties of end products, whereas many laboratories in the United States appear to be manufacturing the substance on a far smaller scale. There are also increasing incidents of methamphetamine-related manufacturing occurring throughout Central and South America. In 2010, for instance, authorities in Nicaragua dismantled a large clandestine methamphetamine laboratory. Another important region in terms of illicit metham- phetamine manufacture is East and South-East Asia, 37 US Department of State, International Narcotics Control Strategy Report , March 2011.where a significant number of clandestine metham- phetamine laboratories have been dismantled over the past several years. 38 Previously, illicit ATS manufactur- ing laboratories were primarily large industrial-scale operations. In recent years, however, several countries reported seizures of a significant number of smaller laboratories, a trend that continued in 2009. China reported the seizure of 391 clandestine synthetic drug laboratories and storage facilities in 2009. Most of these were in Guangdong, Sichuan and Hubei provinces and were primarily manufacturing crystalline metham-phetamine and ketamine. In 2008, a total of 244 unspecified laboratories were dismantled in China. ATS manufacture is becoming increasingly diversified in China with different stages of manufacturing being divided across provinces. Indonesia seized 35 clandestine synthetic drug-manufac- turing laboratories in 2009, the highest figure reported to date. These included 25 large-scale and 10 small-scale laboratories. Clandestine ATS manufacture in Hong Kong, China has been dominated by tableting and repackaging oper-ations. In 2009, two small-scale manufacturing facilities for crystalline methamphetamine were reported in Hong Kong, China. 39 Over the past five years, Malaysia has become a signifi- cant methamphetamine manufacturing location. In 38 For East and South-East Asia, most ATS data is available through the UNODC Global Synthetics Monitoring: Analyses, Reporting and T rends (SMART) Programme, which assists countries in the region in the monitoring of drug trends, with a particular focus on ATS. 39 UNODC, Patterns and trends of amphetamine-type stimulants and other drugs- Asia and the Pacific, Global SMART Programme, November 2010.Fig. 116: Total number of ATS laboratory incidents, 1999-2009 Source: 68 19 5 24 70 282 92 51 35 1 7 Ecstasy group 62 64 70 59 49 87 63 56 72 53 52 Combined ATS 204 221 272 244 314 330 370 361 344 15 300 Amphetamine 59 115 85 132 161 322 159 154 109 44 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009ATS laboratory-related incidents (nu mber)148World Drug Report 2011 2009, 11 clandestine ATS manufacturing laboratories were seized. Most of the laboratories were located in Kuala Lumpur and southern Malaysia. 40 In the Philippines, illicit manufacture of crystalline methamphetamine was first reported in 1996, and in 1997, the first industrial-scale clandestine manufactur-ing facility was reported. The manufacture of crystalline methamphetamine continues in the Philippines, with 9 manufacturing laboratories detected in 2009. Clandes-tine methamphetamine manufacturing laboratories have been seized across the country in recent years and have been located in both rural and urban areas. The labora-tories have also shifted from large and medium-sized facilities in previous years to smaller 'kitchen type' facil-ities in 2009. 41 In 2009, most of the seized clandestine laboratories were again located in urban areas.42 Myanmar main source of methamphetamine pills in South-East Asia Myanmar is the primary source of the region's metham- phetamine in pill form. Reported seizures of clandestine manufacturing laboratories in Myanmar in previous years have mainly consisted of tableting operations. This is inconsistent, however, with the vast number of pills seized throughout the region. Extensive forensic profil-ing of methamphetamine seized in Thailand suggests that there are likely 12 large-scale methamphetamine manufacturing operations in the 'Golden T riangle' 40 UNODC, Patterns and trends of amphetamine-type stimulants and other drugs- Asia and the Pacific , Global SMART Programme, November 2010. 41 Communication with the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency, August 2010. 42 Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency, Philippine National ATS Situation 2008-2009, presented at the Global SMART Programme Regional Workshop, Bangkok, 5-6 August 2010. region. While there have been no facilities seized for crystalline methamphetamine manufacture, authorities in both Myanmar and Thailand confirm that manufac-ture occurs in Myanmar and has been the source of most crystalline methamphetamine seized in the northern part of Thailand in the past few years. In Japan, the illicit manufacture of ATS is rare. In June 2010, however, police arrested two nationals of the Islamic Republic of Iran on suspicion of manufacturing methamphetamine. This was the first such incident in the country since 1995. Australia and New Zealand report methampheta- mine manufacture; little data from the Pacific Island states and territories In Oceania, ATS manufacture has been reported from Australia and New Zealand. Australia reported the dis-mantling of 316 ATS manufacturing laboratories in 2009. Most of the laboratories were identified as manu-facturing methamphetamine and amphetamine. New Zealand reported that a total of 135 laboratories were dismantled in 2009, primarily for methamphetamine. Further increases in the number of laboratories might be recorded in 2010 due to the increased efforts of the Government of New Zealand to tackle methampheta-mine. 43 Little data is available from the Pacific Island states and territories, which remain vulnerable to illicit manufac-ture of amphetamine-type stimulants, given the fact that several of the countries are not parties to the 1988 United Nations Convention Against Illicit T raffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. 44 43 Monthly Illicit Drug Assessment , National Drug Intelligence Bureau (NDIB), Wellington, January 2010. 44 These include Kiribati, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Fig. 117: Number of reported methamphetamine laboratory incidents, 1999-2009 Source: UNODC DELTA. 10,19518,778 -2004006008001,0001,2001,400 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 200905,00010,00015,00020,000 Oceania West & Central Europe Southern Africa East Europe East and South-East Asia USA (right-scale) Global (right scale) Meth laboratories in selected regions (number)Total (and USA) Meth laboratories (number)149The ATS market Level of methamphetamine manufacture in Europe comparatively low Compared to most other regions of the world, illicit manufacture of methamphetamine in Europe is fairly low. Until recently, methamphetamine manufacture was largely confined to the Czech Republic, where some 300-400 mostly small-scale manufacturing sites are being dismantled every year. These are so-called kitchen laboratories, which typically manufacture a few grams of drugs at a time. Seizures of methamphetamine manufac-turing facilities were also reported to Europol in neigh-bouring countries such as Slovakia, Germany, Poland and Austria. The second hub of methamphetamine supply is centred around the Baltic countries, particu- larly Lithuania and Estonia. 45 Methamphetamine manufacture is rarely reported from Africa, except for South Africa and Egypt. In 2009, 10 methamphetamine laboratory incidents were reported from South Africa, compared to 20 such incidents reported for 2008. The global number of dismantled amphetamine laboratories remains stable In 2009, 44 amphetamine laboratories were reported, remaining essentially stable compared to 2008. Most of these laboratories continue to be reported in Europe, particularly West, Central and East Europe. According to the European Monitoring Centre on Drugs and Drug Addiction, most amphetamine seized in Europe is manufactured, in order of importance, in the Netherlands, Poland and Belgium, and to a lesser extent in Estonia, Lithuania and the United Kingdom. In 2007, 29 sites involved in the production, tableting or storage of amphetamine were discovered in the Euro-pean Union and reported to Europol. The relatively low number of amphetamine laboratories reported is inconsistent with the high number of global amphetamine seizures which have continued to rise over the past two years. Increase in seizures of precursors for methamphetamine and amphetamine manufacture Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are the main precursors for methamphetamine and both substances are control-led in Table I of the 1988 United Nations Convention Against Illicit T raffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psycho-tropic Substances. Seizures of these precursors can pro-vide some indications about manufacturing trends. In 2009, 41.9 mt of ephedrine and 7.2 mt of pseudoephe- drine were seized, compared to 18.2 mt of ephedrine Islands and T uvalu, status as of 7 April 2011. 45 EMCDDA, Amphetamine and methamphetamine use in Europe , Lisbon, November 2010.and 5.1 mt of pseudoephedrine in 2008.46 Recently, there has been a shift from bulk substances to pharma- ceutical preparations used in the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine. 46 International Narcotics Control Board, Precursors and chemicals fre- quently used in the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , E/INCB/2010/4, March 2011.050100150200250300350 2003 (nu mber) Europe amphetamine laboratories, Source: 119: Global seizures of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, 2005-2009* * The chart is based on data on domestic seizures and on seizures effected at points of entry or exit.

When con-trols over precursors were strengthened in the United States, manufacture shifted to Mexico. As Mexico has responded with strong counter-methamphetamine ini-tiatives, manufacturing activities are increasingly reported from countries in Central and South America. T raffickers also resort to substitute chemicals. As Gov- ernments have restricted the availability of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, some traffickers could turn to other chemicals such as norephedrine which can replace these two chemicals with only slight modifications to the illicit manufacturing process. T raffickers have also attempted to divert the ephedra plant - a natural source of ephedrine - for illicit ATS manufacture. In addition, there have been reports that traffickers transform exist- ing precursors into new uncontrolled chemicals, which are subsequently converted back to the original precur-sor chemical once in the final destination country. A precursor chemical commonly used in the illicit man- ufacture of methamphetamine and amphetamine is 1-phenyl-2-propanone (P-2-P). The diversion of this chemical may be fuelling the market for amphetamine in the Near and Middle East, where amphetamine is often sold as Captagon on illicit markets. In 2009 and 2010, Jordan reported the world's highest annual legiti- mate requirement of P-2-P to the International Narcot-ics Control Board, accounting for half of the global total. The high legitimate need is based on the pur-ported formulation of P-2-P into cleaning and disinfec-tion products. The volume represents a significant risk of diversion into illicit manufacture, however, particu-larly as P-2-P is not an essential ingredient in the formu-lation of cleaning and disinfection products and alternative chemicals exist. Number of reported ecstasy-group laboratories remains essentially stable In 2009, 52 ecstasy-group laboratories were reported, compared to 53 in 2008. The highest number of dis-mantled laboratories was reported from Asia and Oce-ania, namely Indonesia (18) and Australia (19). This might indicate that Indonesia has replaced Europe as the main source for 'ecstasy' used in South-East Asia. In the past, ecstasy-group substances used to be manu- factured predominantly in West Europe. Manufacture peaked in 2000, when 50 laboratories were reported as having been dismantled in Europe. Since that time, however, manufacture of ecstasy-group substances has shifted away from the region to a number of other mar-kets around the world. Large-scale manufacturing oper-ations are more frequently being dismantled in East and South-East Asia, the Americas and Oceania. In 2008, only four laboratories were reported from Europe; for Notable ephedrine & pseudoephedrine trafficking route cases Routes identified in 2008-2010Established trafficking routes Note: The boundaries and na mes shown and the designations used on this map do not i mply official endorse ment or acceptance by the United Nations.

Shift in ecstasy manufactureManufacture of ecstasy increasingly takes place in regions other than Europe, such as East and South-East Asia, North America, Oceania and Latin America. Illicit manufacture of ecstasy has been reported in Argentina, Belize, Brazil, Guatemala, Mexico and Suriname. In Brazil, a small-scale laboratory was seized in 2008 and another, more commercial-size operation in 2009, which included the seizure of 20,000 tablets. 47 Precursors for ecstasy-group substances include safrole (including in the form of safrole-rich oils), isosafrole, piperonal, and 3,4\u2014MDP-2-P , which are all controlled in Table 1 of the 1988 United Nations Convention Against Illicit T raffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psycho- 47 UNODC, Global SMART Update , vol.2, October 2009.tropic Substances. Reported global seizures of these precursors have strongly declined, reflecting the declin- ing availability of ecstasy in Europe, one of the main markets for the substance. However, in January 2010, authorities in Australia uncovered the country's first clandestine laboratory for the domestic extraction and processing of safrole-rich oil for the manufacture of 'ecstasy'. Significant increase in other synthetic drug manufacture incidents For the first time, the number of other synthetic drug manufacture incidents reported to UNODC through the ARQ has surpassed those of 'ecstasy'. This is due to a significant number of incidents relating to unspecified ATS precursors reported from the United States. Such cases also appear to occur in other parts of the world.Fig. 120: Distribution of global annual legitimate r equirement 2010 Source: INCB.Fig. 1999-2009 Source: UNODC DELTA. 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 ATS precursors 0500200 2 213 4 0 Fentanyl 00000001110 Gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid (GHB)0109 2 1 1 78 1 08 1 29 Ketamine 00000000 4 400 Lysergic (PCP) 1146 1 60 1 140 1 67 Total 2 12 10 21 55 33 25 41 59 33 61Table 35: Other synthetic drug manufacture Report 2011 The number of GHB laboratory incidents decreased from 12 in 2008 to 9 in 2009. No ketamine laboratory was reported through the ARQ. As ketamine is not under international control, however, the extent of man-ufacture is probably underreported. Government sources in China indicate that ketamine laboratories are regu-larly dismantled in that country. Seizures of precursors used in the illicit manufacture of ATS Chemical precursors are necessary for the synthesis of amphetamine-type stimulants, and many of the chemi-cals are controlled internationally through the 1988 United Nations Convention Against Illicit T raffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. Their seizures are reported to the International Narcotics Con-trol Board and can provide some indications about trends in illicit manufacture. Seizures in 2009 included:Amphetamines-group Methamphetamine: 41,931 kg of for amphetamine or methamphetamine. 195 kg of norephedrine, sucient to manufacture 130 kg of amphetamine. Ecstasy-group 40 litres of 3,4-MDP-2-P , enough to manufacture 33 kg of MDMA; 1048 l of safrole oil, sucient to manufacture 222 kg of MDMA; 4.3 mt of piperonal which could be converted into 1.6 mt of MDMA; and 5 l of isosafrole, which could be used in the manufac- ture of 2.36 kg of MDMA. The low amounts of precursor chemicals seized are inconsistent with the size of the consuming market, sug- gesting that much of the trafficking of precursors needed for ATS manufacture goes undetected. Criminal organi-zations adopt several strategies to avoid control by traf-ficking precursors through new locations, such as Africa, by relocating manufacturing operations to new coun- tries and by changing precursor chemicals. Seizure data for precursors can only provide a partial picture of precursor availability. Diversions and stopped shipments are not included in the traditional seizure statistics, neither are domestic diversions followed by onward smuggling. These figures largely represent raw chemical seizures and in some cases pharmaceutical preparations, and thus are not representative of all precursors seized.

The increase was driven by the quantities of seized methamphetamine, which rose markedly to 31 mt (from 22 mt in 2008) and ampheta-mine, which rose more moderately (33 mt, up from 30 mt in 2008). Seizures of ecstasy amounted to 5.4 mt, remaining below the reduced level of 2008. The increases in methamphetamine and amphetamine were also partly offset by a drop in seizures of non-specified ampheta-mines, so that total ATS seizures in 2009 amounted to 71 mt. Due to the paucity of data from some countries, the decline in non-specified amphetamines is not statis-tically significant, and the total for amphetamine, meth-amphetamine and ecstasy rose by 22% in 2009. Seizures of amphetamine-type stimulants are reported by weight (in kg), by volume (in litres, usually when the seized drugs are in liquid form) and by number of tab-lets, doses or 'units'. Although UNODC maintains and publishes records to reflect - as closely as possible - sei-zure quantities as reported by countries, it is often useful to aggregate data of different types to compare over time or across countries and regions. For the purposes of this aggregation, conversion factors are used to convert the quantities into 'kilogram equivalents.'The aggregate statistics used in this report depend on the conversion factors used, and the impact of these conversion factors can be especially pronounced in the case of amphetamine-type stimulants, as a significant share of seizures of these drug types are quantified by number of tablets. In previous editions of the World Drug Report the conversion factors used were intended to reflect the amount of psychoactive ingredient in the seized tablets. In order to enhance the comparability with seizures reported by weight, which are quantified by bulk weight and can only be adjusted for purity in a minority of cases where the availability of data allows, UNODC has revised the conversion factors used for amphetamine-type stimulants to reflect the bulk weight of the seized tablets. The new factors are based on foren-sic studies and range between 90 mg and 300 mg per tablet, depending on the region as well as the drug type. These factors are subject to revision as the available information improves; details can be found in the meth-odology section. Although trafficking in and consumption of ampheta- mine-type stimulants has come to affect all regions of the world, different types of ATS prevail in different regions. In past years, seizures of ATS in Europe have been dominated by ecstasy and amphetamine; however, ecstasy seizures in Europe fell sharply between 2007 and 010,00020,00030,00040,00050,00060,00070,00080,000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009020406080100120 Millions of tablets/units Kilogra ms Litres Units (right axis) Aggregate (kg equivalents)Fig. 122: ATS seizures worldwide, in kg, litres, number of units and aggregates, 2001-2009 Source: UNODC DELTA. kg, litres and kg equivalents155The ATS market 2009, while methamphetamine seizures reached a record level by European standards in 2009. Ecstasy accounted for only 10% of ATS seizures in Europe in 2009, compared with 6% for methamphetamine. In North America, seizures continue to be dominated by metham-phetamine and 'ecstasy'. In relative terms, seizures of 'ecstasy' remained important also in Central and South America and the Caribbean, although the majority of reported ATS seizures in this region consisted of amphet-amine in 2009. The market in Oceania remained diver-sified among the various types of amphetamine-type stimulants. In the Near and Middle East/South-West Asia, seizures of amphetamine-type stimulants are mainly in the form of Captagon, believed to contain amphetamine as the main psychoactive ingredient. Methamphetamine seizures have been reported from Nigeria and South Africa. For 2009, however, only South Africa reported seizures of methamphetamine, out of a total of four African countries reporting any ATS seizures in the ARQ. Approximately one half of the ATS seized in Africa referred to amphetamine. The pau-city of the data thus does not allow for a reliable charac-terization for the continent as a whole.

This was in sharp contrast to prior years; over the period 2001-2008, annual seizures in the United States ranged between 5 and 21 times the level in Mexico.Methamphetamine in the United States' consumer market continued to be supplied by manufacture of methamphetamine in Mexico as well as the United States. Following a substantial decline in 2007, the avail-ability of methamphetamine in the United States appears to have rebounded. According to the United States Department of Justice, 48 methamphetamine availability in the United States seems to be directly related to meth-amphetamine production trends in Mexico. The decline in availability in 2007, possibly triggered by more strin-gent import restrictions of methamphetamine precur-sors in Mexico, was reflected in reduced seizures and 48 US Department of Justice, National Drug Threat Assessment 2010 , February 2010.Fig. 125: Methamphetamine laboratories and seizures of methamphetamine the United States and Mexico, 2001-2009 Sources: UNODC DELTA; US Department of Justice.

The number of methamphetamine laboratories detected in the United States rose from 3,049 in 2007 to 3,873 in 2008 and 5,286 in 2009. The increase was mainly attributable to the number of small-scale laboratories. Moreover, some Mexican drug trafficking organizations shifted their production operations from Mexico to the United States, particularly to California. Since 2007, manufacture of methamphetamine in Mexico appears to have grown significantly. Mexico reported 191 methamphetamine laboratories in 2009, up from 21 in 2008. In 2009, the laboratories were discovered in the central Pacific region (in particular, the states of Michoacan, Jalisco and Sinaloa). Between 2007 and 2009, seizures of methamphetamine by United States authorities along the border with Mexico increased by at least 87%, as the partial total for 2009 amounted to 3,478 kg (compared with 1,860 kg in 2007). 49 The increased availability in the United States is also visible in price and purity data. Between the fourth quarter of 2007 and the fourth quarter of 2009, the average price per pure gram of methamphetamine followed a gener-ally decreasing trend, falling from US$284 to US$119, while the average purity followed a distinct increasing trend, rising from 39% to 72%. 50 The rising purity and falling price are, however, also due to a less potent product being manufactured - a racemic 'd/l methamphetamine'. The loss in potency of this infe-rior product can, however, be compensated by higher purity levels - and this is currently happening. It appears that the reduced availability of ephedrine and pseu-doephedrine (which would be required for the manufac-ture of the more potent 'd-methamphetamine') in Mexico had led to an increased use of alternative meth-ods for the manufacture of methamphetamine. Such techniques either synthesize these chemicals from others more easily available or bypass their use entirely, employ-ing for example the 1-phenyl-2-propanone (P-2-P) method, or its pre-precursor, phenylacetic acid (PAA). The product obtained from the use of PAA or P-2-P is a less potent racemic 'd/l methamphetamine,' unless an additional purification step is added on to obtain again the traditional 'd-methamphetamine.' Mexico made large seizures of phenylacetic acid (31 mt in 2009), which can be used to obtain P-2-P , as well as other closely related chemicals, including some which are not under international control (such as esters of phenylace-tic acid in 2008 51 and phenylacetyl amide in 2009).

The United States alone accounted for 63% of the global total. Contrary to the trend in global seizures, which essentially remained at the significantly reduced level of 2008, in 2009, seizures in North America sus-tained the increased levels of 2007 and 2008. According to the United States Department of Justice, 53 the resur- gence of MDMA availability in the United States was fuelled by the manufacture of MDMA in Canada and subsequent smuggling into the United States across the northern border. MDMA seizures at the northern border more than doubled between 2007 and 2008. Canada reported 23 methamphetamine laboratories and 12 MDMA laboratories in 2009. Although 'ecstasy' seizures in Canada fell for the second year in a row - from 1 mt in 2007 to 715 kg in 2008 and 405 kg in 2009 - Canada reported an increased amount of powder MDMA shipments destined for foreign countries and an apparent expansion of international consumer mar-kets for Canadian-produced MDMA. Destinations for MDMA shipments seized in or en route from Canada included the Philippines, Malaysia, Taiwan Province of China, Mexico and Jamaica. While cross-border meth-amphetamine trafficking between Canada and the United States continued to be limited in comparison with cross-border MDMA trafficking, a slight increase was registered in the number of methamphetamine ship-ments intercepted in both directions. Central America, South America and the Caribbean In this region, seizures of amphetamine-type stimulants are limited. In recent years however, illicit manufacture of amphetamine-type stimulants has emerged in several countries with little or no previous history of reported manufacture. In Argentina, seizures of 'ecstasy' tablets rose from 11,072 in 2008 to 136,550 in 2009. 54 Argentina also seized 20 kg of methamphetamine in 2008, and small quantities of methamphetamine tablets in 2008 and 2009. Argentina reported the seizure of one 'ecstasy' laboratory in 2008. In August 2009, Argentine authori-ties seized 4.2 mt of ephedrine (a precursor for metham- substances, 2008, February 2009. 52 Procuradur\u00eda General de la Rep\u00fablica, Mexico, Secretar\u00eda de Marina, Mexico. 53 US Department of Justice, National Drug Threat Assessment 2010 , February 2010. 54 In addition, Argentina also reported 15 grams and 10 grams of 'ecstasy' seized in 2008 and 2009 respectively.158World Drug Report 2011 phetamine) in two operations in the outskirts of Buenos Aires. Although manufacture in Argentina cannot be ruled out, it is likely that the large quantity of precursor chemical was intended for other destinations, possibly Mexico. 55 In 2010, Brazil seized 2,740 'ecstasy' tablets and 5,910 units of methamphetamine.56 Brazilian authorities seized one 'ecstasy' laboratory in 200857 in the state of Paran\u00e1, and, according to preliminary data, one 'ecstasy' laboratory, again in Paran\u00e1, as well as one metham-phetamine laboratory in the state of Santa Catarina, in 2009. 58 Chile seized one laboratory manufacturing mes- caline59 in 2009. Seizures and investigations by Chilean authorities also point to trafficking of ephedrine from Chile to Mexico. 60 Colombia seized 126,573 ATS tab- lets in 2009, including 23,477 'ecstasy' tablets.61 In the Dominican Republic - for years an important trans-shipment location of ecstasy - seizures of 'ecstasy' tablets fell from 20,861 units in 2007 to 17,885 in 2008 62 and 10,166 in 2009. In August 2009, author- ities in the Dominican Republic intercepted more than 409,000 pseudoephedrine tablets in a shipment en route to Guatemala and originating in Bangladesh. 63 55 UNODC, Global SMART Update , Volume 2, October 2009. 56 Brazil Federal Police. 57 Brazil Federal Police. 58 UNODC, Global SMART Update , Volume 2, October 2009. 59 Although mescaline is not classified as an amphetamine-type stimu- lant, it is a psychotropic substance and a hallucinogen. 60 UNODC, Global Smart Update , Volume 2, October 2009. 61 Observatorio de Drogas de Colombia. 62 In addition, in 2008, 49 grams of 'ecstasy' were seized in the Domini- can Republic. 63 UNODC, Global Smart Update , Volume 2, October 2009.Guatemala reported the seizure of one ATS laboratory in 2008 and three in 2009, as well as the seizure of 12 mt of pseudoephedrine in 2009.

Near and Middle East/South-West Asia: Rise in amphetamine seizures Countries in the Near and Middle East/South-West Asia continued to be affected by trafficking of Captagon on a large scale. The content of tablets bearing the Capta-gon logo is not always clear, but the main psychoactive ingredient in such tablets is now amphetamine (rather than fenetylline, the active ingredient in the licit phar-maceutical preparation some 15 years ago). Caffeine is also frequently found in such tablets. Seizures of amphetamine in the Near and Middle East/ South-West Asia increased steadily between 2000 and 2007, appeared to stabilize in 2008, amounting to 19.6 mt, and resumed the increasing trend in 2009, reaching 24.8 tons. The long-term growth in seizures in this region was driven mainly by seizures in Saudi Arabia, which rose consistently over the period 2000-2007, reaching 13.9 mt 65 in 2007. Seizures in this country have remained stable since then, amounting to 12.8 mt in 2008 and 13.4 mt 66 in 2009. Saudi Arabia has a significant con- sumer market for Captagon tablets. In January 2010, eight million Captagon pills were confiscated in a single seizure in Saudi Arabia. The traffickers were believed to 65 Data relative to the period 2002-2007 and 2009 were sourced from the World Customs Organization and ICPO/INTERPOL. 66 World Customs Organization.have ties to an amphetamine manufacturing and distri- bution ring that was broken in T urkey a few months earlier.67 T urkey is believed to be mainly a transit country for Captagon, and a gateway for illicit trafficking from South-East Europe to the Middle East. Replies to the Annual Reports Questionnaire from the Near and Middle East identified Saudi Arabia as a major destination for amphetamine (specifically Captagon) trafficked on their territory. It also appeared that Egypt had become a point of departure for amphetamine ship-ments. In a single seizure at Dhuba seaport, Saudi Ara-bian Customs seized over 1.3 million tablets that were concealed on board a vessel that had arrived from Egypt. 68 Jordan registered significant increases in amphetamine seizures in 2008 and again in 2009. Seizures in this country averaged 11 million tablets over the period 2004-2007, and rose to 14 million tablets in 2008 and 29 million tablets (specifically Captagon tablets) in 2009. Seizures also continued to increase in the Syrian Arab Republic, from 12 million tablets in 2007 and 2008 to 22 million tablets in 2009. T urkey reported seizures of 2.8 million Captagon tablets in 2009, 69 in addition to 479 kg of amphetamine, of which 473 kg70 were seized at a Captagon laboratory 67 UNODC, Global SMART Update, Volume 3, March 2010. 68 World Customs Organization, Customs and Drugs Report 2009.

According to T urkish authorities,71 such establishments, which are discovered sporadically, carry out the conversion into tablet form, rather than the chemical process whereby amphetamine is manufactured from other substances. In 2010 seizures of Captagon tablets fell to 1.1 million. 72 Increased seizures of methamphetamine in the Islamic Republic of Iran Starting in 2005, the Islamic Republic of Iran has seized increasing quantities of methamphetamine. In the first nine months of 2010, the country seized 883 kg of methamphetamine, up from 571 kg in 2009. 73 The results of research in the country, as reported by the Drug Control Headquarters 74, indicate that the use of methamphetamine has increased. The Islamic Republic of Iran reported that, in 2009, methamphetamine traf-ficked on its territory originated in North-West Asia, South-East Asia and northern and western Europe, with 1% manufactured domestically. It also reported the detection of six 'kitchen' laboratories manufacturing methamphetamine. In 2009, the Islamic Republic of Iran registered legitimate requirements of 55 mt 75 of the precursor pseudoepehedrine, the fourth largest level worldwide for that year. According to Thai authorities, 76 there was an emergent trend of Iranian nationals trafficking methamphetamine into the region. This pattern was also observed in Japan, where Iranian nationals accounted for one fifth of arrests of non-resident foreigners related to methampheta-mine. 77 In two incidents in July 2009 and February 2010, a total of five Iranian nationals were arrested in Malaysia for attempting to traffic a total of 75 kg of methamphetamine on flights from the United Arab Emirates. 78 In August 2010, police in Sri Lanka arrested three Iranian nationals, confiscating 16 kg of metham- Organized Crime 2009. 71 Ibid. 72 Ministry of Interior, T urkish National Police, Department of Anti- Smuggling and Organized Crime.

Indonesia also mentioned the Islamic Republic of Iran as a source country for methamphetamine in 2009, and T urkey as a transit country. T rafficking of metham-phetamine from the Islamic Republic of Iran via T urkey was also confirmed by Philippine authorities. 80 Asia-Pacific: Increased seizures of methamphetamine The Asia-Pacific region - notably the area encompassing Cambodia, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand, Viet Nam and bordering provinces of south China - continued to be affected by manufac-ture, trafficking and consumption of methamphetamine on a large scale. In 2009, seizures in East and South-East Asia rose by more than one third, from 11.6 mt in 2008 to 15.8 mt, mainly due to the quantities seized in Myan-mar. In relative terms, Thailand recently also registered significant increases. The largest seizures in the Asia-Pacific region continued to be made by China, while East and South-East Asia as a whole continued to account for approximately one half of global seizures of methamphetamine. Moreover, there were signs of diver-sification in trafficking routes, with methamphetamine reaching the region from Africa and the Islamic Repub-lic of Iran. In China, aggregate seizures of methamphetamine were remarkably stable over the period 2005-2009, ranging between 6.1 mt and 6.8 mt (6.6 mt in 2009). According to Chinese authorities, 81 there was an increase in traf- ficking of amphetamine-type stimulants from neigh-bouring countries (referred to as the 'Golden T riangle') into Yunnan province. Methamphetamine seizures in this province rose from 2.2 mt in 2008 to 3.2 mt in 2009. There was also an increase in the domestic manu-facture of illicit drugs, with the number of dismantled clandestine laboratories rising from 244 in 2008 to 391 in 2009. Manufacture occurred in particular in the provinces of Guangdong, Sichuan and Hubei, and the substances involved were mainly amphetamine-type stimulants and ketamine. 79 UNODC, Global SMART Update, Volume 4, October 2010. 80 T wentieth Anti-Drug Liaison Officials' Meeting for International Cooperation (ADLOMICO), October 2010, Seoul, Republic of Korea.

This increase was concurrent with a similar increase in heroin seizures in the same country and may reflect a strengthened pres-ence of law enforcement agencies in parts of Myanmar. Thailand continues to constitute a major market for methamphetamine, and there were signs that trafficking methamphetamine was on the rise. According to data collated by the Drug Abuse Information Network for Asia and the Pacific, seizures of methamphetamine tab-lets rose from 14 million in 2007 to 22 million in 2008 and 27 million in 2009, while seizures of crystalline methamphetamine increased from 47 kg in 2007 and 53 kg in 2008 to 209 kg in 2009. 82 According to Thai authorities,83 manufacture of illicit substances was very limited in Thailand, and methamphetamine was traf-ficked into Thailand from neighbouring countries. Thai-land was also being used by traffickers as a transit point for methamphetamine intended for other markets. Large quantities of methamphetamine were seized in the Philippines in 2008 and 2009. The Philippines also dismantled 10 methamphetamine laboratories in 2008 (including four 'kitchen' laboratories) and nine in 2009 82 In its reply to the Annual Reports Questionnaire for 2009, Thailand reported seizures of 2.4 mt of methamphetamine pills and 210 kg of crystalline methamphetamine. 83 Office of the Narcotics Control Board of Thailand, presentation at the T wentieth Anti-Drug Liaison Officials' Meeting for International Cooperation (ADLOMICO), October 2010, Seoul, Republic of Korea.(including eight 'kitchen' laboratories), and further reported an increase of 36% in the average price of methamphetamine hydrochloride in 2009, as compared to that in 2008, suggesting an increased demand for the substance. Methamphetamine seizures in Malaysia amounted to 1.1 mt in 2008 and 1.2 mt in 2009. 84 These levels are significantly higher than those registered prior to 2008. In a single seizure in May 2009, Malaysian police seized 978 kg of high purity crystalline methamphetamine in the city of Johor Bahru. 85 Methamphetamine seizures in Indonesia, in contrast, fell to the lowest level since 2004. Indonesia also reported the seizure of five 'kitchen' methamphetamine laborato- ries in 2008 and 17 in 2009. The general declining trend in ecstasy seizures prevalent worldwide since 2007 (with the exception of North America) was also to be seen in several countries in the Asia-Pacific region. By 2009, ecstasy seizures in China, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia and Thailand had fallen sig- nificantly by comparison with the level in 2007. How- ever, Indonesia reported that nine 'kitchen' laboratories manufacturing ecstasy were seized in 2008 and 18 in 2009. Oceania continued to be affected by trafficking of amphetamine, methamphetamine and ecstasy, with no single type dominating the market. In 2009, Australia seized 56 kg of amphetamine, 150 kg of methampheta-mine and 59 kg of ecstasy. The number of laboratories dismantled in Australia rose significantly, from 11 ATS laboratories in 2007-2008 to 316 in 2008-09, of which 19 were manufacturing primarily MDMA and the rest were manufacturing amphetamine or methampheta-mine. New Zealand also seized smaller quantities of amphetamine, methamphetamine and ecstasy; however, all 135 seized laboratories reported by New Zealand were manufacturing methamphetamine. Africa: Few countries report seizures The variety of substances, combinations of substances, precursor chemicals and chemical processes for manu-facturing ATS hinders the collection of good quality data, in particular the proper identification and classifi-cation of seized controlled substances, especially in countries lacking laboratory services for forensic pur-poses, and this is an issue of concern especially in Africa. The vast majority represent seizures whose precise nature is unknown. Several African countries appear to be affected by trafficking in, and consumption of, diverted or counterfeit prescription drugs containing controlled substances whose nature is not always clear, possibly 84 Data collated by DAINAP . 85 UNODC, Global SMART Update, Volume 2.

Burkina Faso reported seizures of 3,403 kg of 'm\u00e9dicaments de la rue' in 2008. Morocco reported seizures of 48,293 units of psychotropic substances in 2008, rising to 61,254 in 2009 and 105,940 in 2010. 86 South Africa reported aggregate seizures of 48 kg of amphetamine-type stimulants in 2009, including 37 kg of methamphetamine. Algeria reported aggregate sei-zures of 90,630 tablets of sedatives and tranquillisers in 2009. C\u00f4te d'Ivoire seized 43 kg of amphetamine in 2008, as well as 17,155 amphetamine tablets (in addi-tion to seizures of clonazepam and diazepam tablets). 87 In 2009, seizures of amphetamine in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire fell to 1,200 tablets. The World Customs Organization also reported that Sudanese officials foiled an attempt to smuggle 18.3 kg of stimulant tablets at Khartoum air-port. Every year from 2000 to 2009, Egyptian authorities seized small quantities of 'ecstasy tablets'. Seizures exceeded 10,000 tablets in 2006, but had fallen to 203 tablets by 2008 to 76 tablets in 2009. In April 2010, 88 one methamphetamine laboratory was seized in Egypt. According to South African authorities, amphetamine- type stimulants, in particular methamphetamine and club drugs such as ecstasy and cathinone, continued to be used in South Africa. 89 These drugs, with the excep- tion of ecstasy, were manufactured locally in clandestine laboratories, while ecstasy was mainly smuggled in from Europe by air freight and parcel post. Over the period 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2009, 20 clandestine laboratories manufacturing methamphetamine were dismantled, 90 while 10 methamphetamine laboratories and six cathinone laboratories were dismantled during 2009. South Africa also reported that an increase of methamphetamine trafficking allowed for a decrease in prices. 86 Official communication from the Government of Morocco.

In the replies to the ARQ for 2008, South Africa did not report any clandestine laboratories.Methamphetamine trafficking from Africa to Japan One emerging trend identified by Japanese authorities91 was that of methamphetamine trafficking from Africa to Japan. The proportion of methamphetamine seized in Japan that was sourced from Africa increased from 7.4% in 2009 to 36% in the first half of 2010. The West and Central African countries of Benin, Nigeria, Cameroon and Senegal were prominent among the source countries in Africa. It is unclear whether West Africa, already a hub for cocaine trafficking, was beginning to see the emergence of local ATS manufacture, or is simply serv-ing as a transit point for methamphetamine manufac-tured elsewhere, possibly in South Africa. Nevertheless this trend, together with reports from other countries in the region, suggests that African trafficking syndicates active in the Asia-Pacific region may be expanding their activities to include trafficking of methamphetamine in addition to heroin and cocaine. Countries in West Africa, which have assumed an important role in the trafficking of cocaine, are also vulnerable to a potentially increased role in the traffick- ing or manufacture of other drugs, including ampheta- mine-type stimulants. In July 2009, large quantities of chemicals and equipment that could be used in the manufacture of illicit drugs were discovered in multiple facilities in Guinea. Among the seized materials were more than 5,000 litres of sassafras oil and 80 litres of 91 Japan Customs Intelligence and Targeting Centre, presentation at the T wentieth Anti-Drug Liaison Officials' Meeting for International Cooperation (ADLOMICO), October 2010, Seoul, Republic of Korea.Fig. 132: Number of methamphetamine and cathinone/methcathinone laboratories seized Africa (all sizes), 2002-2009 Source: UNODC DELTA. *Covers the period 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2009141117 1220 101336 2328 18 10 Methamphetamine Cathinone/ methcathinone163The ATS market 3,4-MDP-2-P , which can be used to manufacture MDMA. In a separate single seizure, also in July 2009, Nigerian officials seized 10 kg of crystalline metham-phetamine and 10 kg of amphetamine along with 57 kg of the precursor chemical ephedrine. The seizure was made at the departure concourse of a flight en route to South Africa. 92 (The methamphetamine seizures were, however, not reported separately in the ARQ but included in the broad category of psychotropic sub-stances seizures). In 2010, Nigeria seized 75 kg of meth-amphetamine: over the nine-month period May 2010 - January 2011, 11 out of 150 seizures made by author-ities at Murtala Muhammed International Airport involved methamphetamine, intended predominantly for the Asia-Pacific region. 93 Europe: Amphetamine seizures appear to recede Europe, notably West and Central Europe, continues to be an important market for amphetamine, in terms of both manufacture and consumption. Amphetamine seizures in West and Central Europe reached a record level (8.2 mt) in 2007, and essentially sustained this level in 2008 (7.9 mt). In 2007 and 2008, the Nether-lands, the United Kingdom and Germany collectively accounted for more than 70% of annual amphetamine seizures in West and Central Europe, and in 2009 the United Kingdom and Germany accounted for the larg-est and second largest seizure levels in Europe, respec-tively. Seizure data from the Netherlands for 2009 were not available; however, a comparison of seizure totals for 2008 and 2009 excluding the Netherlands indicates a decline of 20%. 92 UNODC, Global SMART Update , Volume 2, October 2009. 93 National Drug Law Enforcement Agency of Nigeria.A sharp drop in seizures in the United Kingdom, from the high level of 2008, was partly offset by increased seizures in France, while seizures in Germany continued the gradually increasing trend that can be traced back to 2002. Among all countries worldwide, the Netherlands continued to be the most frequently mentioned country of origin for amphetamine as well as 'ecstasy'. Poland continued to be the second most frequently mentioned country of origin for amphetamine: Poland dismantled eight amphetamine laboratories in 2009, and identified Germany, Scandinavia and the United Kingdom as the main destinations for amphetamine manufactured in Poland. Ecstasy seizures continue to decline Seizures of ecstasy in Europe have declined sharply, standing at 1.8 mt in 2008 - approximately one third the prior levels - and appearing to decline by a further 59% in 2009 (excluding seizures in the Netherlands). The decreases were prevalent throughout Europe but were more pronounced in some countries than others; due to recent decreases in countries which historically accounted for a dominant portion of European 'ecstasy' seizures (notably the United Kingdom and, up till 2008, the Netherlands), in 2009 the largest 'ecstasy' seizures reported by European countries were made in T urkey (432,513 tablets) and Spain (404,334 tablets), while Poland registered seizures comparable with the quanti-ties seized in the United Kingdom (6% of the European total). Poland assessed that some of the `ecstasy' on its territory originated in Poland itself, as well as the Netherlands.

Similar arrangements were also reported from other European countries in the past. Methamphetamine emerging in Europe While the European ATS market has in the past been dominated by amphetamine and 'ecstasy', recent years have seen the emergence of methamphetamine manu-facture, trafficking and consumption in parts of Europe. Between 2004 and 2009, there was a five-fold increase of methamphetamine seizures in West and Central Europe, driven mainly by seizures in Norway, Sweden and Lithuania. Over the period 2002-2009, Lithuania and the Netherlands were the European countries most frequently mentioned as a country of origin for meth-amphetamine, followed by Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Lithuania assessed that methamphetamine on its territory originated entirely in Lithuania itself in 2009, while the percentage of domestic manufacture was estimated at 98% by Slovakia and 95% by the Czech Republic. The Czech Republic reported seizures of a large number of methamphetamine laboratories (342); one methamphetamine laboratory was also dis-mantled in Lithuania and an unspecified number in Slovakia.Fig. 134: Seizures of ecstasy in Europe, 2000-2009 * Data for the United Kingdom for 2007, 2008 and 2009 are based on incomplete data for some jurisdictions for the financial yea rs 2007/08, 2008/09 and 2009/10 respectively, and adjusted for the missing jurisdictions using the distribution in 2006/07. ** Data for 2009 for the Netherlands were unavailable; the value used is that corresponding to the year 2008, and is only inclu ded to estimate the regional total.

Expert perceptions confirm that ATS - notably methamphetamine - play a significant role in the region. ATS may even have overtaken the use of plant-based drugs in some countries over the past few years. Methamphetamine in pill form has been reported as the primary drug of use in the Lao People's Demo- cratic Republic and Thailand, while methamphetamine in crystalline form has been reported as the primary drug of use in Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Japan, the Republic of Korea and the Philippines. Metham-phetamine in pill and crystalline form ranked as the second most commonly used drug type in China, with 'ecstasy' ranking third. In Indonesia, crystalline meth-amphetamine and 'ecstasy' ranked as the second and third most commonly used drugs, respectively. Crystal-line methamphetamine ranked as the third most com- monly used drug in Malaysia and Singapore. Over the past few years, several expanding markets have emerged in the region. For example, the market for methamphetamine in Viet Nam has grown as the coun-try becomes an attractive target for traffickers due to its large, increasingly affluent and urban population. The use of crystalline methamphetamine, in particular, has increased among young people in major cities and sei- zures of methamphetamine pills have increased signifi- cantly over the past three years. Viet Nam also reports the existence of drug storage points along the northern border with the Lao People's Democratic Republic. In Indonesia, crystalline methamphetamine use has been increasing each year since 2003 according to experts, and the drug now ranks as the second most commonly used drug, after having ranked fifth in 2005. Over the past five years, Indonesia - hitherto primarily a transit country for methamphetamine - has become a manufacturing centre for crystalline methamphetamine. Malaysia is a key transit country for crystalline metham- phetamine trafficking in the region and in recent years has seen seizures of several small and large-scale manu-facturing laboratories, echoing the same pattern as some other countries. Another trend is the increasing trafficking and use of ketamine which is often sold in the traditional ATS markets of South-East Asia. In 2009, 6.9 mt of ketamine was seized in East and South-East Asia. Almost 90% of this was seized in China, which, along with India, is one of the major source countries for ketamine in the region. Ketamine seizure figures are almost certainly under-reported, particularly in Asia. Ketamine is not under international control and only some countries in the region have imposed restrictions on its availability. Use is reportedly increasing in several countries and areas, and in Hong Kong, China, it was the main drug of use, with 2009 seizures reaching five times their 2007 level. One reason for its growing popularity is that ketamine is cheaper than other drugs such as MDMA and its licit use makes it widely available for diversion for illicit pur-poses in many countries in the region. Ketamine is also frequently trafficked in South Asia, particularly from India. Seizures of ketamine in India have increased from 60 kg in 2005 to more than 1 mt in 2009. Ketamine has been trafficked to countries in East and South-East Asia as well as to North America (notably Canada) and some European countries (nota-bly the United Kingdom and the Netherlands). The emergence of analogue substances in established ATS markets The appearance of several new unregulated synthetic compounds in established ATS markets, particularly in 02004006008001,0001,200 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009Quantity (kg)Fig. 136: Seizures of ketamine in India, 2005-2009 Source: Directorate of Revenue Intelligence and Narcotics Control Board, India.166World Drug Report 2011 Europe, the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, has been an important trend observed over the past years. Many of these substances are marketed as 'legal highs' and substitute for illicit stimulant drugs such as cocaine or ecstasy. In Europe, the emergence of these substances coincided with the gradual disappearance of ecstasy from the illicit drugs market. Seizures of ecstasy precursors have con-tinually declined over the past five years. Seizures of the main ecstasy precursor 3,4-MDP-2-P (also known as piperonyl methyl ketone) steeply declined after 2004. The slow and steady disappearance of MDMA from the illicit market coincided with a decline in laboratory activity. In 2009, only one ecstasy-related laboratory incident was reported in Europe. At the same time, other synthetic substances, notably piperazines, have been sold as 'ecstasy' to meet the demand from the illicit market. Manufacturers and traf-fickers have started to exploit the lack of national and international control over piperazines and other new synthetic substances. Piperazines are not under interna-tional control although many countries have introduced national controls over BZP and taken other action to prevent their sale and distribution. As a result, other substances have emerged, notably mephedrone. Mephedrone, 4-methylmethcathinone (4-MMC), first appeared on the illicit market around 2007. The substance has no medical use in either humans or animals and has been associated with a number of fatalities in European countries. In Decem-ber 2010, mephedrone was banned in the countries of the European Union. But it is still available in illicit drug markets and has also appeared on markets in devel-oped countries outside Europe, including the United States and Australia. Methamphetamine trafficking from Africa Africa poses one of the greatest emerging threats with regard to trafficking of amphetamine-type stimulants. T rafficking of methamphetamine from Africa was reported first at the end of 2008 and reports of such trafficking have continued since. West Africa, in particu-lar, is emerging as a source of methamphetamine for illicit markets in East Asia, with couriers transiting Europe, western Asia or East Africa. Few countries in the region have the capacity and governance structures to address the problem. Methamphetamine manufacture is not entirely new to Africa. South Africa has had increasing reports since 2004 and Egypt reported a case as recently as April 2010. There are also indications that ATS manufacture could occur in West Africa. In July 2009, equipment that could be used in ATS manufacture was discovered in Guinea. In June 2010, the United States Government indicted members of a large international cocaine traf- ficking organization for, inter alia, the intent to establish large-scale manufacture of crystalline methamphetamine in Liberia. Precursor chemicals are frequently trans-shipped through the region. The International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) identified Africa as the region with the greatest number of diversions or attempted diversions of ATS precursor chemicals in 2008. Countries import precur-sors in considerable excess of legitimate annual needs and are targets for organized crime. For example, a single shipment to Uganda of 300 kg of pseudoephedrine was seized upon arrival in 2008. At the same time, the INCB notes that precursor trafficking patterns in Africa stand in sharp contrast to the low number of seizures made by Governments in the region. Only two cases were reported in 2009: 1.25 mt of ephedrine to the Central African Republic and 1 mt of pseudoephedrine to Kenya, both of which can be used in the manufacture of methamphetamine. The World Customs Organization (WCO) noted a small number of methamphetamine trafficking cases from Africa (southern) to East Asia in mid-2008 with no prior cases reported. The year 2009 saw both the number of seizures and their quantities originating from Africa more than triple. This trend appears to be growing and spreading. Cases of methamphetamine trafficking have emerged from various West African nations.

The most common destinations for methamphetamine have been outside the region, primarily Japan, followed by the Republic of Korea, with new reports from Malay-sia and Thailand. Cases are typically multi-kilo and transported via air passengers hidden in luggage or by body concealment resembling methods employed by West African syndicates for other drugs. Couriers transit via Gulf countries, East African as well as European countries. Significantly larger shipments have also been reported. For example, in May 2010, Nigerian authori-ties stopped two separate cargo shipments totalling 63 kg of methamphetamine and amphetamine to Japan and South Africa. In July 2009, 10 kg of crystalline metham-phetamine, 10 kg of amphetamine and 57 kg of ephe-drine were seized in Nigeria en route to South Africa. The infrastructure established by transnational cocaine and heroin traffickers in West Africa is readily adaptable to accommodate the flexibility of ATS manufacture. While the capacity to report on the situation in the region remains limited, initial indications suggest that the products are a threat for lucrative markets around the world. This raises the need for a truly global effort to address the synthetic drugs problem. ATS in South Asia Located at the crossroads of drug supply between the sources in South-East and South-West Asia, South Asia has traditionally been affected by illicit manufacture, trafficking and use of drugs, mostly opiates. Over the past few years, however, South Asia has emerged as a source for amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) and the precursors needed to manufacture them. The geographical proximity to East and South-East Asian source countries of illicit methamphetamine is one of several factors which makes South Asia a vulner-able target for illicit manufacture of amphetamine-type stimulants. The first clandestine ATS manufacture oper-ation was detected in India in May 2003. Since then, several additional facilities have been uncovered. In August 2010, a methamphetamine laboratory was dis- covered in India. However, attempts at illicit ATS man- ufacture are not limited to India, they have also been reported from Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. In Sri Lanka, for example, a large-scale methamphetamine laboratory was dismantled in May 2008. In addition, South Asia has become one of the main regions used by drug traffickers to obtain ephedrine and pseudoephedrine for the illicit manufacture of metham-phetamine. India is one of the world's largest manufac-turers of precursor chemicals and Bangladesh also has a growing chemical industry. Despite efforts to control precursor chemicals, both countries have been identified in a number of cases as the source of diverted precursor chemicals for a range of drugs, including methampheta-mine. Several significant seizures of pseudoephedrine in Central America and the Caribbean (such as the Domin-ican Republic, Guatemala and Honduras) are believed to have originated in Bangladesh. Many countries in Central America and the Caribbean are vulnerable as destinations for these shipments. Africa also remains at risk at being used by traffickers to obtain precursor chemicals. Amphetamine, methamphetamine and ecstasy have been regularly seized in South Asia over the past five years. Methamphetamine pills originating from Myan-mar are trafficked into Bangladesh, India and Nepal. The recent upsurge of methamphetamine seizures origi-nating from Myanmar may therefore be felt acutely in the region.168World Drug Report 2011 Fig. 137: Global seizures of amphetamines(a), 2001-2009 (a) Amphetamine, methamphetamine and related non-specified a mphetamines.

The cannabis market 175 5.1 Introduction Cannabis remains the most widely produced and con- sumed illicit substance globally. The extent of the global cannabis problem did not change significantly in 2009, though the consumption estimates show a wider range. This is the result of some increases in cannabis use in the United States of America, Africa, South and Central America and Asia, though consumption in Canada, western Europe and Oceania remained stable or showed a decline. In Europe, cannabis resin seizures are now at their lowest level for the last 10 years, whereas seizures of resin in North Africa have increased. The major cannabis resin-producing countries showed little evidence of changes in the production levels. Global herbal cannabis seizures have increased, principally due to increased seizures in the United States of America and Mexico, where data on use and cultivation also point to an increase in the avail- ability of cannabis herb in the market. There is more and more evidence that intensive expo- sure to cannabis products with high potency levels increases the risk of psychotic disorders (see text box). Some recent studies show that the average concentration of the major psychoactive substance in cannabis prod- ucts (THC) is nowadays at higher levels than 10-15 years ago; however, data for the past five years show a stable trend in some countries although the pattern is not consistent for all products and all countries. From a market perspective, both cannabis producers and users are apparently searching for more diversified prod- ucts which are not only determined by different THC concentrations, but also by choices in 'flavours.' This diversification is illustrated by the rise of synthetic can-nabinoids ('spice'). In a short time, these products have become popular among young adults and teenagers in Europe and the United States. While there are some indications that these products might cause more damage to the health of users, there is a need for more pharmacological and toxicological research in this area. At the same time, the large number of products being marketed as cannabinoids also challenges the control measures taken by regulatory authorities in the Member States, the World Health Organization, the Interna-tional Narcotics Control Board and the Commission on Narcotic Drugs. 5.2 Consumption UNODC estimates that in 2009, between 2.8% and 4.5% of the world population aged 15-64, correspond-ing to between 125 and 203 million people, had used cannabis at least once in the past year. Compared to the previous year, the lower and upper levels of the estimates have increased, thereby widening the range. 1 This is in part due to greater uncertainty in the estimates as there are limited recent or reliable prevalence data available from many countries in Asia and Africa. 1 In 2008, the annual prevalence was estimated between 2.9% and 4.3% of the population aged 15-64.176World Drug Report 2011 In 2009, among the Member States who provided expert perceptions on the trends of cannabis use in their coun- tries, nearly half of the countries reported a stable trend. This number was even higher in countries in the Amer-icas (67%). Less than half of Member States (44%), mainly in Africa, Asia and to a lesser extent Europe, reported that cannabis use had increased in their coun- tries. As an overall trend, over the past 10 years, an increasing number of countries have been reporting stable trends for the use of cannabis.Table 36: Annual prevalence and estimated number of cannabis users, by region, subregion and globally, 2009 Fig. 141: Estimated number of cannabis users by region, 2009 Source: UNODC.Fig. 142: Annual prevalence of cannabis users by region, 2009 Source: UNODC. 050,000,000100,000,000150,000,000200,000,000250,000,000 Global Africa Americas Asia Europe OceaniaLowe/upper range users ( millions) 02468101214 Global Africa Americas Asia Europe OceaniaLower/upper range prevalence (%)Region/subregionEstimated number of users annually (lower)-Estimated number of users annually (upper)Percent of population age 15-64 (lower)-Percent of population age 15-64 14.8 Global 124,810,000 - 202,680,000 2.8 - 4.5178World Drug Report 2011 Cannabis users The typology presented below is based on selected behavioural studies undertaken in a few developed countries (including the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom). It gives an indication of the risk factors and cannabis use patterns in some high-preva- lence countries. Experimental: Experimental cannabis users typically try the drug for the first time in adolescence. They constitute a group of people who want to experience illegal drugs, but for the majority of these people, experience with cannabis suf-fices. A stage pattern suggests that 'experimenters' begin with alcohol and tobacco, followed by cannabis or inha-lants. Poor relations with parents, depression symptoms, exposure to drug-using peers and accessibility of drugs are important factors for initiation into illicit drugs. However, adolescents' beliefs and values favourable to the use of cannabis and association with cannabis-using peers are the strongest predictors of cannabis experi-mentation. Sensation-seeking in adolescence represents a propensity toward novel experiences and could also lead to the experimental use of cannabis. A number of experimental users may continue to use cannabis more regularly for recreational purposes or long-term to become chronic or dependent users. Recreational: During the last quarter of the twentieth century, recrea- tional use of cannabis increased greatly across the world and came to be seen by larger numbers of young people as a normal leisure activity. Recreational users use can- nabis mostly on weekends, are likely to have used or use other drugs and have a more active night life in the city than other users. These users report that the main pur- pose of their use of cannabis is to reach a 'social high' and that they also use it to relax, enhance activity, decrease boredom, increase confidence, reduce anxiety or feel better. These young people do not contact public or private addiction counselling services because they are at times unaware of their existence, do not consider themselves dependent or feel these services are not designed for their specific needs. Early repeated use of cannabis during adolescence may be a risk factor for chronic cannabis use. Long-term or chronic: People who start using cannabis at an early age and those who used other illicit drugs are more likely to continue using cannabis in their mid-30s or beyond, suggesting that cannabis use is part of their routine lifestyle choices. Lower income and marital rates, higher unemployment rates and having cannabis-using friends in young adulthood are commonly reported among this population. Long-term cannabis users express lower levels of satis- faction on measures of quality of life. They report using cannabis to enhance positive feelings and perceive the drug as having calming effects, and may use it for stress-coping purposes. They also report using cannabis to escape from problems, alleviate anger or frustration, and 'get through the day'. Greater antisocial behaviour dis-tinguishes chronic users from experimental and recrea-tional users. It has been reported that psychosocial factors, antisocial personality disorder and alcohol dependence could predict long-term cannabis use. A social taboo against chronic drug use among women may be a protective factor, which is reflected in lower long-term female use rates.

These estimates are higher than the annual prevalence of 9.9% reported in the 2010 World Drug Report , and essentially reflect the increase in the annual prevalence of cannabis use in the United States of America. In the United States, cannabis remained the most common illicit drug used in the past year. The annual prevalence of cannabis use that had been declining stead-ily between 2002 and 2007 begun to show an increase over the past two years, and in 2009 was estimated slightly higher than the prevalence in 2002. 2 Compara- 2 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Results from the 2009 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: Volume I .

In 2009, among the people who had initiated drug use in the past year in the United States, the largest number - 2.4 million people aged 12 years or older - had used cannabis as their first drug. This was followed by the non-medical use of pain relievers (2.2 million). Among the estimated 22.5 million drug users who were classi- fied with substance dependence or abuse in the past year, the highest number was among cannabis users (4.3 million people aged 12 or older).3 Past month prevalence of cannabis use among the US population aged 12 or older increased from 6.1% in 2008 to 6.6% in 2009.

Among secondary school students in grades 8, 10 and 12, after some decreases observed between 2002 and 2006, there has been a steady increase in the annual prevalence of cannabis use since 2007. Use is still not reaching the levels reported in 2002, however. 6 The reversal in cannabis trends from 2006 onwards is in part attributed to a softening of the perceptions related to the risks of cannabis use among the student population, 7 which coincided with a period of public debates around an initiative aiming at the legalization of cannabis in one US state. In 2009, among emergency department visits related to cannabis use, the rate was slightly higher for the popula-tion aged 20 years or younger (125.3 visits per 100,000 people) compared to those aged 21 or older (121.5 visits per 100,000 people). 8 For all other illicit drugs, the rate 4 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Results from the 2009 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: Volume I .

In Canada, the annual prevalence of cannabis use among the adult population remains at levels comparable to those in the United States, although the annual preva-lence has been declining since 2004. In 2009 the annual prevalence was reported at 12.6%, a decrease from 13.6% in 2008 and 14.1% in 2004. 9 There has also been a decline in the annual prevalence of cannabis use among youth aged 15-24, from 37% in 2004 to 26.3% in 2009.10 There is no update on the extent of cannabis use in Mexico, but experts perceive an increase since 2008 when use was reported at 1% among the adult popula- tion. Cannabis use in Mexico remains at much lower levels than in the United States or Canada. Some countries in South and Central America report increases in cannabis use Cannabis use patterns and trends in the Caribbean, South and Central America remain unchanged, with the prevalence of cannabis use at comparable levels in these subregions. One third of the countries that reported expert opinions on trends of drug use considered that cannabis use in their countries had increased.

In Argentina, the annual prevalence of cannabis use among the popu- lations aged 15-64 and 13-17 is almost identical (7.2% and 7.6%, respectively). Profile of clients in treatment with cannabis as the primary drug of concern in the United States (2000-2008) Contrary to the general belief that cannabis use can result in little harm to users, in recent years, an increasing number of people in many regions have entered treatment for problems related to cannabis use. Presented below are some characteristics of a typical cannabis user entering treatment services in the United States, using data aggregated over the years 2000-2008. Based on this information, it can be inferred that cannabis users in treatment: 1. Are most likely adolescents or young adults, single and male with secondary-level schooling. One third of clients are less than 17 years old. 2. Are most likely not in the workforce, that is, unemployed or students. 3. Initiated their use of cannabis at a very young age - more than half by the age of 14 and almost 90% before the age of 18. More than a quarter were daily users immediately prior to entering treatment, although more than a third had ceased use in the month prior to admission. The majority of referrals came through the criminal justice system.

New data are available from a few countries in Europe, and they confirm the stabilization of cannabis use in West Europe. The Czech Republic, Estonia, Italy, Slovakia, Spain and the United Kingdom remain countries with high levels of cannabis use among the general popula-tion and among young adults with perceived trends of increasing use reported in recent years. 11 In Europe, the annual prevalence of cannabis use is esti- mated at 5.2%-5.3% of the population aged 15-64. The prevalence of cannabis use is much higher in West and 11 A new household survey in Italy indicates a strong decline in annual prevalence from 14.3% in 2008 to 5.2% in 2009 as well as a parallel decline in the lifetime prevalence of cannabis use among the general population. The comparability of the findings between these two surveys, however, is uncertain. 64.80.712.36.72.68.5 14.814.210.48.416.26.313.47.27.6 02468 1 0 1 2 1 4 prevalence of cannabis use among adult and youth* populations in selected countries in the Caribbean, Central and South America * Youth: Argentina and Uruguay 13-17 years; Belize ages 13,15 and 17; Brazil, Chile and 15-16 years; Costa '05 '06 Sweden '07 Sweden '08 England & Wales '05/06 England & Wales '06/07 England & Wales '07/08 England & Wales '08/09 England & Wales '09/10Annual pr evalence (%)Fig. 147: Europe: Trends in annual prevalence of cannabis use in countries with new* data * This refers to new or most recent data provided by Member States in 2010, either through the ARQ or in survey reports.

Higher levels of cannabis use are estimated for West and Central Africa compared to other subregions. In Kenya, a 2009 survey conducted among 4,500 house- holds in the coastal provinces indicated that the overall lifetime prevalence of cannabis use was 10.6% among all Central Europe (7.1%) than in East and South-East Europe (2.6%). The use of cannabis is in large part con-centrated among young people, with the highest annual prevalence reported among those aged 15-24 (13.9%), compared to an average annual prevalence of 10% among the population aged 15-34 in West, Central and South-East Europe. The individual risk related to cannabis use seems lower than for heroin or cocaine, but health problems do exist and due to the high prevalence of use, the impact of cannabis on public health may be significant. 12 On aver- age, cannabis was reported as the primary drug in treat-ment for 21% of cases in West and Central Europe and 14% of cases in East and South-East Europe. Cannabis was also reported as a secondary drug by 24% of all outpatient clients in Europe. Among the younger drug users (aged 15-19) in treatment, a much higher propor- tion (83%) were in treatment for primary cannabis use. 13 As reported by EMCDDA, many cannabis clients also report the use of alcohol or other drugs. Based on data collected in 14 EU member states, 65% of the can-nabis users had taken another substance - mostly alco- hol or cocaine - and some reported the use of both alcohol and cocaine in the previous year. 12 European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) Annual Report 2010: The State of the drugs problem in Europe , Lisbon, 2010. 13 Ibid.Fig. 148: Trends in annual prevalence of cannabis use in high prevalence countries Source: '02 Czech Republic '04 Czech Republic '08 Estonia '98 Estonia '03 Estonia '08 Italy '01 Slovakia prevalence (%) 0510152025 East Africa North Africa Southern AfricaWest and Central AfricaAnnual prevalence (%)Fig. 149: Annual prevalence of cannabis use in Africa by subregion, 2009 Source: UNODC.184World Drug Report 2011 Cannabis use and psychosis Evidence suggests that cannabis and other cannabinoids can produce a range of transient psychotic symptoms and cognitive deficits, such as transient deficits in learn-ing, short-term memory, working memory, executive function, abstract ability, decision-making and atten-tion. Increasing evidence also suggests that early onset and heavy cannabis exposure could increase the risk of developing a psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia. In a case control study conducted by Di Forti et al. in the United Kingdom (2009), it was reported that patients with a first episode of psychosis were more likely to have smoked higher potency cannabis (that is, cannabis with higher THC content) with greater fre-quency and for a longer period. The study found that 78% of the case groups used the high potency cannabis (Sinsemilla or Skunk with THC and 0% cannabidiol) compared with 37% of the control group (that smoked cannabis resin with both THC concentration and cannabidiol of 3.4%) (AOR* 6.8); were daily users (AOR = 6.4), and had smoked cannabis for more than 5 years (AOR 2.1). Recent studies also indicate that cannabidiol reduces the acute cognitive effects of THC, an important aspect since the potency of cannabis has increased in Europe during the last 10 years and THC has been associated with the detrimental effects of cannabis on the mental health of at-risk users. A recently published 10-year follow-up cohort study investigated the relationship between cannabis use and the subsequent development of psychosis over time and concluded that cannabis use was a risk factor for the development of incident psychotic symptoms. The study also concluded that continued cannabis use might increase the risk of psychotic disorder by impacting on the persistence of symptoms. * AOR stands for Adjusted Odds Ratio, meaning that adjusting for age, gender, ethnicity, et cetera, those who had smoked higher THC content cannabis were 6.8 times more likely to report psychosis than the other group.

The lifetime prevalence was at similar levels for all age groups except the 12-17 year olds, whereas the current use,14 reported at 5.3% among all age groups, was fairly consistent.15 In terms of treatment demand, compared to the other regions, cannabis remains the most common primary drug for which drug users seek treatment in Africa. This proportion varies from nearly all treatment admissions in countries such as Botswana, Malawi and Ghana to around one third of treatment admissions in Kenya, Mozambique and South Africa. 14 Defined as use in the past 4 weeks before the interview. 15 National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Authority (NACADA), Report of Survey on Drug and Substance Abuse in Coast Province Kenya - Main Report, March 2010.5.411.511.8 Lifetime and current use prevalence of cannabis by age group, 2009 Source: National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Authority (NACADA), Report of Survey on Drug and Substance Abuse in Coast Province Kenya - Main Report.186World Drug Report 2011 For New Zealand, the latest information on cannabis use dates from 2008, when the annual prevalence was estimated between 13.4% and 15.7% of the population aged 16-64. As commonly observed, men (21%) were more likely to have used cannabis in the past year than women (13.9%). Among the adult population, the past year cannabis use was highest among younger age groups and decreased with increasing age in the adult popula-tion. The highest past year use prevalence was among men in the 18-24 year age group and for women in the 16-17 and 18-24 year age groups. 18 As shown in previous years, high annual prevalence of cannabis use is reported from many Pacific Island states and territories, ranging from 24.2% in Palau or 22.2% in Northern Mariana Islands to around 5% in Fiji and Marshall Islands. The emergence of synthetic cannabinoids in herbal products In 2008, several synthetic cannabinoids were detected in herbal smoking blends which were sold on the internet and in specialized shops under a variety of brand names such as profes-sionally designed herbal products typically contain about 3 grams of finely cut plant material to which one or more synthetic cannabinoids have been added. Before 2008, the use of these herbal products seemed to be restricted to a small number of experimental users. However, in 2008, 19 these products achieved immense popularity in Germany and other European countries through the internet and subsequent media reports, where they were referred to as 'legal alternatives' to can-nabis, thus unintentionally promoting the use of these drugs. The synthetic cannabinoids are generally administered by smoking either as a joint or in a water-pipe. These products do not contain tobacco or cannabis but when smoked were claimed to be able to produce cannabis-like effects. Although so far, relatively little is known about the phar- macology and toxicology of the various (and frequently changing) synthetic cannabinoids that are added to the herbal mixtures, a number of these substances may have a higher addictive potential compared to cannabis due to quicker development of tolerance (see text box).

Most coun-tries are challenged by the sheer number of synthetic cannabinoids constantly emerging, which means that control measures targeting individual compounds can be easily circumnavigated. Some Member States, for example, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Luxem-bourg, have adopted a more generic approach to con-trolling synthetic cannabinoids of similarly structured compounds. Nevertheless, effective implementation of control measures could be hampered by the lack of ana-lytical data and reference samples, as well as methodolo-gies for toxicological identification of metabolites in biological specimens.Fig. 153: New Zealand: annual prevalence of cannabis use by gender and age group, 2008 Source: Drug use in New Zealand, Key Results 2007/08 New Zealand Alcohol and Drug Use Survey, Ministry of Health 2010. 35.8 27.1 14 11.7 5.228.1 4.4 1.421.5 7.516.127.1 0510152025303540 16 - 17 18 - 24 25 - 34 35 - 44 45 -44 55 - 64 Age groupAnnual prevalence (%)Male Female 187The cannabis market Chemistry and effects of synthetic cannabinoids Chemistry Synthetic cannabinoids are typically synthetic cannabi- noid agonists that function similarly to D9-tetrahydro-cannabinol (THC), psychoactive component in cannabis. Like THC, synthetic cannabi-noids have structural features that allow binding to one of the known cannabinoid receptors, that is, CB1 or CB2, in the brain and other organs to produce canna-bis-like pharmacological activity. Currently, there are many compounds with chemically unrelated structures that fall under this definition and could be classified as follows:* i) Classical cannabinoids (for example, (for example, Rimonabant\u00ae, JWH 307, CRA-13) Synthesis and precursors A number of methods for synthesizing synthetic can-nabinoids have been described in detail in the scientific literature.** Precursor chemicals can also be obtained from commercial chemical suppliers. In general, synthe-ses of classical, nonclassical or hybrid cannabinoids are much more elaborate and complicated due to the pres-ence of asymmetric centres in these compounds. As a result, stereoselective synthesis or elaborate separation of stereoisomers are often necessary to isolate the desired compound. As for compounds without asymmetric centres like most aminoalkylindoles, a vast variety of similar compounds could be easily synthesized by the addition of a halogen, alkyl, alkoxy or other substituents to one of the aromatic ring systems, or other small changes could be made, such as variation of the length and configuration of the alkyl chain. Most of the aminoalkylindoles can be easily synthesized with standard laboratory equipment and readily availa-ble reagents. The synthesis of nonclassical cannabinoids requires more elaborate equipment and technical know-how, but it should be feasible for a chemist with a sound basic training in organic synthesis. Medicinal use Some synthetic cannabinoids are commercially available for medicinal purposes such as Nabilone (Cesamet\u00ae) for treatment of cancer patients under chemotherapy and Dronabinol (Marinol\u00ae) which is a synthetically pro-duced pure THC applied in multiple sclerosis and pal-liative care. Pharmacology and toxicity So far, little is known about the pharmacology and toxicology of these compounds. Some case reports have shown that health-related problems associated with the use of these herbal products seem to be very similar to problems reported after cannabis use.*** Cardiovascular problems and psychological disorders such as panic attacks were among the frequently reported symptoms. A number of these substances may have a higher addic-tive potential compared to cannabis due to quicker development of tolerance. Some synthetic cannabi-noids, for example, HU-210, CP-55,940 and WIN-55,212-2, which act as full agonists at the CB1 receptor, could possibly cause severe or even life-threatening intoxications when overdosed. Furthermore, due to its structural features in certain aminoalkylindoles, some carcinogenic potential could also be possible. * Howlett et al., 'International Union of Pharmacology.

The cannabis market 1895.3 Production Cannabis is produced in practically every country of the world, making it the most widely produced illicit drug. Cannabis herb is mostly produced for domestic or regional markets, whereas cannabis resin is trafficked over larger distances. The major countries identified as sources by the cannabis resin consumer markets are Afghanistan, Morocco, Lebanon and Nepal/India. Attempts to estimate cannabis production encounter severe deficiencies in the data, which were extensively described in former World Drug Reports and is reflected in the reporting. In the 2009 World Drug Report , it was estimated that the production of cannabis herb ranged from 13,300-66,100 mt and of cannabis resin from 20 UNODC, Afghanistan cannabis survey 2010 (preliminary). 21 OAS, Mecanismo de Evaluaci\u00f3n Multilateral, Evaluaci\u00f3n del progreso de control de drogas 2007-2009 . 22 US Department of State, International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, 2011 .2,200-9,900 mt. The resulting total area under cannabis cultivation was estimated at 200,000-641,800 ha. The calculations were based on the minimum and maximum levels from reported cultivation and production, seizures and user prevalence rates. In 2010, these indicators did not show significant changes that would justify an update of the production estimates, taking into account the large minimum and maximum levels. Therefore, the production estimates were not updated for this World Drug Report . This chapter focuses on some production trends found in the last year, with a focus on trends in potency. 23 Note Verbale to UNODC, 27 December 2010. 24 Calculated from the harvestable area, number of harvests and yield figures in UNODC, ARQ 2009. 25 US Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration, 2009.Table 39: Update of available information on the extent of cannabis cultivation and production in major producing countries, 2009* Source: UNODC ARQ 2009 unless otherwise specified.

The results of the first cannabis survey in 2009 indicated that Afghanistan is among the major cannabis resin producing countries and that can-nabis has become a competitor to opium poppy as a lucrative crop for farmers in the country. The prelimi-nary 2010 survey gave no indications for major changes in the levels of cultivation and production compared to 2009. It showed a cultivation range of 9,000 to 29,000 hectares, compared to 10,000-24,000 hectares in 2009. Resin production ranged between 1,200 and 3,700 mt, compared to 1,500 to 3,500 mt in 2009. The importance of Afghanistan as a cannabis resin pro- ducer is reflected in the seizures reported by other coun-tries. 10% of all countries reporting cannabis seizures mentioned Afghanistan as the source of cannabis. The Government of Morocco reported a reduction of cultiva-tion area to 47,500 ha, 26 however, Morocco continued to be mentioned as source by the majority of countries reporting cannabis resin seizures to UNODC (19%). This suggests that Morocco continued to be a major producer of cannabis resin. Data on seizures and prices in Europe suggest that the supply of cannabis resin from Morocco to the region has remained the same or slightly decreased. Other countries were increasingly reported as sources of 26 The last joint survey by UNODC and the Moroccan Government was carried out in 2005. 27 US Department of Justice, National Drug Threat Assessment 2010. 28 US Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration, 2009.cannabis, including Lebanon, Spain (as a transit country for Moroccan cannabis), T urkey and India. India also reported substantial cannabis cultivation and subse-quent eradication of 4,265 ha. The amount of cannabis herb produced in the United States is unknown but believed to be high and rising. The rise is illustrated by the continuing increase of eradicated cannabis plants, mainly grown on public lands by foreign criminal groups (attributed to Cauca- sian, Asian, Cuban and Mexican criminal groups/drug trafficking organizations. 27) The indoor production is believed to be increasing as well; however, the number of eradicated indoor-grown plants is stable. 28 Although the Mexican Government does not estimate its national production level,29 reports from the United States suggest that cannabis cultivation in Mexico has increased. The US estimates suggest that cultivation in Mexico has increased from 5,600 ha in 2005 to 17,500 ha in 2009. According to the US sources, the increase may be a result of a shifting law enforcement focus from reduction of illicit crop cultivation to public security tasks. 30 Cannabis production in Europe is believed to be in creasing,31 mostly in indoor settings and increasingly controlled by organized crime groups. Herbal cannabis is now commonly produced inside Europe (29 Euro-pean countries reported domestic cultivation in 2008), closer to its intended market and therefore less likely to be intercepted. 32 29 Currently, the Mexican Government is preparing to conduct its own cannabis production surveys in cooperation with UNODC. 30 US Department of State, International Narcotics Control Strategy Report , 2011. 31 EMCDDA, Annual 10% 15% Spain India Pakistan Netherlands C.I.S. excl.

Source: UNODC ARQ.191The cannabis market Changes in THC concentrations In the recent past there were claims of strong increases in THC concentrations (frequently referred to as 'potency') of cannabis, the main active component of cannabis. Cannabis THC contents have changed frequently in dif-ferent countries. The most systematic and standardized collections of THC content are performed in the United States, the Netherlands and Germany 33 and are pre- sented below. 33 Measured from samples: in the USA, from 46,211 samples confis- cated by law enforcement agencies; in the Netherlands, from yearly collected samples from 50 randomly selected coffeeshops; in Ger-many, calculated from seizure data, in 2009 from 9,250 samples.THC concentration in herbal cannabis in the United States, the Netherlands and Germany At the end of the 1990s/beginning of the 2000s, both the US and the Netherlands experienced an increase of the average THC contents in their herbal cannabis prod-ucts. In the US, the average THC concentration of sin-semilla doubled from 6% to 13% from the early 1990s to the late 1990s, after which the level decreased and became practically stable around 11% over the past decade. 34 At the same time, THC contents of the more 34 These are average values and the ranges of potency have not changed.

In the Netherlands, yearly analyses have been performed since 2000, and the results show a sharp increase in THC concentration of sinsemilla in the early 2000s, from nearly 9% to 19%. This is attributed to the increas-ingly common use of improved breeds, indoor cultiva-tion and the use of sophisticated techniques. Although these techniques were already available in the 1980s, the profile of the cultivators has changed to organized pro-fessionals. Nevertheless, since 2004, the general trend was downwards to 15% in 2009. In Germany, the THC concentration of marijuana, which is a broader group than sinsemilla alone, shows a similar trend, doubling its THC content from 5% in 1997 to more than 10% in 2004, dropping back again to around 8% in 2009. The similar patterns probably reflect similar production sources. Reports from other countries are fragmented and less systematic; the European countries that reported sufficient data for herbal cannabis reported divergent trends for the period 2003-2008. Six countries reported an increase, four a decrease. 35 THC concentration in cannabis resin In the Netherlands, THC contents of cannabis resin show a growth trend similar to that of sinsemilla. The level in the Netherlands increased from 20% to almost 40% in the early 2000s, after which it dropped to around 30% during 2005-2010. In Germany, the THC con-tents have been fluctuating around 8%, without show-ing a long-term change. The THC contents of cannabis resin in other European countries followed divergent patterns, with some countries showing an increase and others a decrease. 35 EMCDDA, Annual Report 2010.Fig. 157: THC concentrations for different cannabis products in the Netherlands, United States and Germany, with varying time series Sources: THC-concentraties of 9-THC and Other Cannabinoids in Confiscated Cannabis Preparations from 1993 to 2008,' Journal of Forensic Sciences, September 2010, Vol. 55, No.5, pp. 1209-1217; 2010 national report (2009 data) to the EMCDDA by the Reitox National Focal Point for Germany. 051015202530354045 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010% THC Sinsemilla Dutch resin0246810121416 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 2001 200220032004 2005 2006 2007 2008% THC Sinsemilla in the Netherlands, 2000-2010 Sinse milla and marihuana in the United States of A merica, 1993-2008 Cannabis resin and marihuana in Ger many, 1997-2009 Growth in THC concentration for sinse milla (US and the Netherlands) and marijuana (US and Ger many), 2000-2007 (base year: 2000) 024681012 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009% THC Resin Mari juana00.511.522.5 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007Growth since 2000 Netherlands - Sinse milla Germany - Marijuana - Marijuana USA - Sinse millaThe cannabis market 1935.4 Trafficking Among the four major drug groups, cannabis derivatives constitute the most widely trafficked and most easily available class of illicit drugs. Reports of cannabis sei-zures refer mainly to cannabis herb and cannabis resin, but also cannabis plant, cannabis oil and cannabis seed. Large quantities of cannabis herb are seized worldwide, while seizures of cannabis resin are concentrated mainly in Europe, North Africa and the Near and Middle East/South-West Asia, reflecting the locations of production and main consumer markets for cannabis resin. The fact that production of cannabis resin occurs to a large extent in countries removed from the main consumer markets brings about the necessity for trafficking of cannabis resin across different regions, in contrast with the more localized trafficking patterns of cannabis herb. Cannabis herb Following a slight drop (8%) in 2008, in 2009, global cannabis herb seizures returned to the levels of 2006 and 2007, amounting to 6,022 mt. North America accounted for 70% of global seizures, followed by Africa (11%), South America (10%), Asia (6%) and Europe (3%). Given the relative ease of cannabis cultivation, the supply of cannabis herb can often be locally sourced, with the result that the trafficking patterns tend to be rather localized in comparison with cannabis resin or other drugs. In the ARQ replies for 2009, out of 68 countries that provided information about the country of origin of cannabis herb trafficked in their territories, 44 countries assessed that some or all cannabis herb originated in their own country. For these countries, on average 75% of all herb originated from their own coun- try. 36 Cannabis herb retail prices displayed significant inter-regional as well as intra-regional variation, even when adjusted for purchasing power parity. Retail prices appear to be driven both by the availability of cannabis herb, which is in turn linked to domestic production levels, as well as the disposable income of consumers. Overall, prices were significantly lower in Africa and in Central and South America and the Caribbean. Some of the lowest prices were registered in Togo, India, Guate-mala and the United Republic of Tanzania, while the highest price was registered in Japan. The low prices in some of these countries could be partly due to high production, but income levels likely also play a signifi-cant role. Similarly, the price in Japan may be high partly because of the high income level of consumers and partly because, contrary to the common pattern in other countries, a significant share of cannabis herb in Japan appears to be imported. 36 Calculated based on the 33 countries that gave a percentage. The other 11 countries pointed to their own country without specifying the proportion.Fig. 158: Cannabis herb seizures worldwide, 1999-2009 Source: UNODC DELTA. 01,0002,0003,0004,0005,0006,0007,000 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009TonsRest of the world Africa South A merica North A merica United States of A merica Mexico194World Drug Report 2011 Americas Cannabis herb seizures in North America rose from 3,205 mt in 2008 to 4,189 mt in 2009, driven by increases in both Mexico and the United States, which continued to report the largest cannabis herb seizures worldwide. Large quantities of cannabis herb are pro- duced in Mexico and trafficked to the United States. Seizures in the United States rose to a record level of 2,049 mt in 2009, up by one third on the previous year, and a similar increase was registered in Mexico, with seizures rising from 1,658 mt in 2008 to 2,105 mt in 2009. Seizures in Mexico were made mainly close to the areas of cultivation or close to the border with the United States. In 2009, the contiguous states of Sinaloa, Durango, Chihuahua and Sonora accounted for 75% of cannabis herb seizures, while Sinaloa, Chihuahua and Durango accounted for 76% of eradication, with the states of Nayarit, Jalisco, Michoac\u00e1n, Guerrero and Oaxaca on the Pacific coast accounting for an additional 20% of eradication. The supply of cannabis herb in the consumer market in the United States is partly locally produced and partly trafficked into the country from Mexico as well as, to a smaller extent, from Canada. In 2008, border seizures of cannabis herb made by US authorities amounted to 1,253 mt on the US-Mexico border and 3 mt on the US-Canada border; based on partial data for 2009, sei-zures on both borders rose in 2009, but they remained concentrated on the US-Mexico border. According to US authorities, cannabis herb in Mexico was widely available, in part due to rising production there. 37 37 US Department of Justice, National Drug Threat Assessment 2010 .The United States also reported that foreign drug traf- ficking organizations were increasingly engaging in indoor and outdoor cannabis cultivation, and their dis-tribution networks were growing. Canada reported that Asian organized crime groups continued to specialize in cannabis cultivation while Indo-Canadian and East European organized crime groups were involved in cross-border smuggling. Large quantities of cannabis herb, as well as cannabis plants, continued to be seized in South America. Sei-zures in this region peaked at 946 mt in 2007 and since then fell twice in succession, standing at 598 mt in 2009. The largest seizures were registered in Colombia, where seizures declined from 255 mt in 2008 to 209 mt, and in Brazil, where seizures also fell, from 187 mt in 2008 to 131 mt. In relative terms, a significant increase was registered in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, where seizures rose by 58% in 2009, reaching 33 mt - the highest level since 1990. Considering seizures of the various forms of cannabis collectively (cannabis herb, plant, resin, oil and seed), the Plurinational State of Bolivia recorded a consistent increase over the period 1998-2009. The reported quan-tities, which include predominantly cannabis plant, amounted to 320 kg in 1998, 28 mt in 2004 and 1,937 mt in 2009. According to preliminary data, seizures receded to 1,073 mt in 2010. The recent high levels of cannabis plant seizures in the Plurinational State of Bolivia are comparable with can-nabis plant seizures registered in Paraguay in 2007 and 2008 - 4,667 mt in 2007 and 5,185 mt in 2008. Sei-zures of very large numbers of cannabis plants have also been reported by Guatemala: 10.8 million in 2008 and 4.3 million in 2009.Fig. 159: Cannabis herb retail prices worldwide, by region, 2009 Source: UNODC DELTA.

In 2009, total seizures in Africa fell to 640 mt, from 936 mt in 2008. The decline was partly due to a significant drop in Nigeria. Although cannabis herb continues to be trafficked throughout Africa, seizures tend to be concentrated in a small number of countries. Over the period 2000-2009, UNODC collated records of cannabis herb seizures from 48 countries in Africa. However, seizures in seven of these countries (Egypt, Kenya, Malawi, Morocco, Nigeria, South Africa and the United Republic of Tan-zania) accounted for 90% or more of the annual total for Africa each year from 2000 to 2009 and for 94% of the quantity seized in Africa over the entire period. In 2007 and 2008, the largest annual seizures of can- nabis herb in Africa were reported by Nigeria. However, in 2009 seizures in this country fell by almost two thirds, to 115 mt, from 336 mt in 2008. Nigeria assessed that, in 2009, cannabis herb on its territory originated entirely in Nigeria itself, but was destined for the Netherlands (50%), Japan (30%) and Italy (20%). Nigeria also reported a notable increase in the farm-gate price of can- nabis - from 8,000 Naira per kg in 2008 to 35,000 Naira per kg in 2009. Both the decline in seizures and the increase in price were attributed to the destruction of cannabis farms by law enforcement operatives in Nigeria. Morocco continued to seize large quantities of 'kif,' selected parts of herbal cannabis which can be further processed into cannabis resin. 38 However, Morocco has also been mentioned by other countries as a country of origin for cannabis herb, sometimes in addition to can-nabis resin. Seizures of 'kif'amounted to 223 mt in 2009 to 187 mt in 2010. In 2009, seizures of cannabis herb declined in Egypt, from 81 mt in 2008 to 63 mt, and in the United Republic of Tanzania, from 70 mt in 2008 to 56 mt. 38 Stambouli, H., El Bouri, A., Bellimam, M.

It appears that the ports of South Africa provide a gateway for cannabis herb produced in neighbouring countries, as well as South Africa itself, and exported to consumer markets outside Africa. This reflects the role of this country as a major trans-shipment hub for legitimate trade. South Africa assessed that, in 2009, 80% of cannabis herb on its territory originated in neighbouring countries (Lesotho and Swaziland). Moreover, an estimated 30% were destined for the consumer markets of Europe. Sei-zures in South Africa amounted to 126 mt in 2009. In the ARQ replies for 2007-2009, South Africa was men-tioned eight times by other countries as a country of origin for cannabis herb. Contrary to the prevalent trend of localized trafficking patterns for cannabis herb, seven of these mentions were by countries outside Africa. Asia-Pacific In 2009, the Asia-Pacific region accounted for 5.5% of global cannabis herb seizures. Seizures in this region rose for the second year in a row, standing at 333 mt in 2009. The increases were mainly due to the amounts seized in India and Indonesia, which reported the largest seizures in this region by far. In 2008, seizures in Indonesia reached a record level of 141 mt. In 2009, seizures fell to 111 mt, but remained high in comparison with historical levels, which aver-aged 20 mt over the 2003-2007 period. Indonesia assessed that 99% of cannabis herb on its territory orig-inated in Indonesia itself. The increased levels were attributed to improvements in law enforcement efforts, and the decline in 2009 to the success of alternative development programmes. In 2009, cannabis herb seizures in India rose by almost two thirds, from 103 mt in 2008 to 171 mt - the high- est level since 1994. India assessed that 81% of the can- nabis seized on its territory in 2009 originated in India itself, with the remainder originating in Nepal. An unspecified proportion was intended for Bangladesh. In 2008, seizures of cannabis herb in Nepal rose to 9.6 mt (the highest level since 1987), and increased by a further 73% in 2009, reaching 17 mt. 39 According to Thai authorities,40 cultivation of cannabis herb in Thailand had been drastically reduced over a period of 20 years, and recent trafficking patterns for cannabis herb involved smuggling into Thailand from 39 Fifteenth Asia-Pacific Operational Drug Enforcement Conference, February 2010, Tokyo, Japan, country report by Nepal. 40 Fifteenth Asia-Pacific Operational Drug Enforcement Conference, February 2010, Tokyo, Japan, country report by Thailand and Office of the Narcotics Control Board of Thailand, presentation at the T wentieth Anti-Drug Liaison Officials' Meeting for International Cooperation (ADLOMICO), October 2010, Seoul, Republic of Korea.the Lao People's Democratic Republic and out of Thai- land into Malaysia. Cannabis herb seizures in Thailand amounted to 19 mt in 2008 and 18 mt in 2009. Sig-nificant quantities were also seized in 2009 in Malaysia (2.4 mt, up from 875 kg in 2008 41) and the Philippines (1.9 mt, down from 3.7 mt in 2008). In Japan, seizures declined from 504 kg in 2007 to 207 kg in 2009. Japan attributed the decline to a decrease in cases of illegal importation accompanied by an increase in domestic illicit cultivation of cannabis. According to Japanese authorities, one case of large-scale indoor culti-vation of cannabis was discovered in Japan and involved six Vietnamese and one Japanese national. 42 Moreover, the number of arrests for cannabis cultivation rose from 207 in 2008 to 243 in 2009, while the number of arrests for smuggling of cannabis fell from 85 in 2008 to 48 in 2009. 43 Nevertheless, in 2009 cannabis herb also con- tinued to be smuggled into Japan from other countries, such as Botswana, France, South Africa and the United States.44 Seizures of cannabis herb in Oceania have declined sig- nificantly since the peak level of 2001, mainly due to Australian seizures. In 2009 seizures in New Zealand amounted to 759 kg, while in Australia seizures amounted 41 Data collated by DAINAP . 42 International Intelligence Division, Narcotics Control Department, Japan.

Despite the high prevalence rate of cannabis use in Australia, the seized quantities are relatively low, even when compared on a per capita basis with similar consumer markets such as Europe and the United States. Rest of the world In Central Asia, the largest quantities of cannabis herb continued to be seized by Kazakhstan (26 mt in 2009) where cannabis was partially supplying the domestic market and partially intended for other markets such as the Russian Federation where significant seizures were also registered (33 mt, up from 25 mt in 2008). Seizures in West and Central Europe amounted to 101 mt, essen-tially sustaining the increased level of 2008. In recent years, seizures of cannabis herb in T urkey have followed a notable increasing trend, rising six-fold over a period of 5 years, from 6.8 mt in 2004 to a record level of 42 mt in 2009. According to T urkish authorities, 46 the increase in cannabis trafficking was attributable to illicit cultivation taking place in some rural parts of the country. Cannabis resin Global cannabis resin seizures reached a record of 1,648 mt in 2008, and in 2009 declined to 1,261 mt - a level comparable to those registered in previous years. Every year from 2001 onwards, West and Central Europe, the 45 This figure represents an aggregate of 624 kg of cannabis herb together with 11,042 seeds or bags, converted assuming a weight of half a gram per unit. 46 Ministry of Interior, T urkish National Police, Department of Anti- Smuggling and Organized Crime, Turkish Report on Drugs and Organized Crime 2009 .Near and Middle East/South-West Asia and North Africa together accounted for 95% or more of global cannabis resin seizures. The proportion attributable to West and Central Europe declined gradually from 73% in 2004 to 48% in 2009. The year 2009 marked a sig-nificant shift in cannabis resin seizures, away from the consumer market of West and Central Europe and toward North Africa, an important source region for cannabis resin reaching Europe. The high level of 2008 was partly due to increases in the Near and Middle East/South-West Asia; in particular a single extraordinarily large seizure of 236.8 mt 47of can- nabis resin made by Afghan authorities in Kandahar province in June 2008. A less pronounced increase in seizures was registered in West and Central Europe in 2008; however, in 2009 seizures fell in both West and Central Europe and the Near and Middle East/South-West Asia, and the drop was partially offset by seizures in North Africa. In contrast with cannabis herb, the demand for which tends to be met by production occurring in relative proximity to consumption, large quantities of cannabis resin are trafficked significant distances to reach con-sumer markets. Europe and North Africa Spain continued to report the largest annual seizures of cannabis resin worldwide. Large quantities of cannabis resin are trafficked from the source country of Morocco to Spain, and on to other countries in Europe.

Over the period 1999-2009, approximately one half of significant individual drug seizures reported by Spain involved cannabis resin. Among these seizure cases, Morocco was practically the only country of origin 48 for the seized cannabis resin. However, Morocco is likely not the only source country for cannabis resin reaching Europe, and Spain assessed 48 This excludes mentions of Spain itself as the country of 'origin,' which likely refer to the point of departure of the consignment rather than the actual country of origin of the drug.that the drop in the total quantity of resin seized in Spain was due to the European market drawing from another supplier than Morocco. In 2010, seizures in Morocco fell back to 118 mt. Increases in cannabis resin seizures were also observed in other North African countries. In Algeria and Egypt, seizures more than doubled in 2008, reaching a record level of 38 mt in Algeria and a level of 12.8 mt - the highest since 1989 - in Egypt. In 2009, seizures in Egypt appeared to stabilize, amounting to 11.4 mt, but sei-zures in Algeria rose even further, registering the fourth consecutive year-on-year increase. Indeed, seizures in Algeria amounted to 74.6 mt in 2009, compared with 1.7 mt in 2005. Algeria reported that in 2009 cannabis resin and cannabis herb in its territory originated entirely in Morocco. Seizure data and, to some extent, price data support the flow of cannabis resin from North Africa into western Europe via Spain. Apart from Spain, which reports the largest cannabis seizures in Europe by far, the largest seizures among European countries in 2009 were reported by France and Portugal, followed by Italy and Belgium. The decrease in seizures in Spain in 2009 was reflected in similar decreases in the four European coun-tries which seized the largest quantities in 2008 (apart from Spain): France (-21%), Portugal (-62%), Italy (-43%) and the United Kingdom (-61%). Seizures in Belgium have fluctuated considerably, amounting to 18.7 mt in 2009 (up from 1.5 mt in 2008).Fig. 165: Signicant individual seizures of cannabis resin in Spain originating in Morocco, 1999-2009 Source: UNODC IDS.

Cannabis resin was further distributed from India to other destinations via cargo couriers. Near and Middle East/South-West AsiaSeizures of cannabis resin in Pakistan rose for two years running, reaching 205 mt in 2009 - the highest level since 1995. Pakistan continued to assess the share of cannabis resin originating in Afghanistan at 98%. Over the period 1999-2009, 41% of significant individual drug seizures reported by Pakistan involved cannabis resin; the country of origin for these consignments was identified almost exclusively as Afghanistan. In the Islamic Republic of Iran, seizures of cannabis resin fell twice in succession, from the record level of 2007 (90 mt) to 69 mt in 2009. Based on data for the first nine months of the year, it appears that the decreas - ing trend continued into 2010. The Islamic Republic of Iran assessed that, in 2009, one quarter of cannabis resin trafficked on its territory was intended for the country itself, with the remainder intended for Arab countries, T urkey and Europe. Seizures in Afghanistan fell from the record level of 2008 (271 mt) to the relatively low level of 10.5 mt in 2009, representing slightly less than 1% of the global total for 2009. Seizures in Afghanistan averaged 56 mt over the 2002-2007 period. North America Seizures of cannabis resin in the Americas remained limited. In 2009, seizures rose significantly but at 10.8 mt, remained below 1% of the global total. Neverthe - less, Canada has a significant consumer market for can -nabis resin. In 2008, almost one half of cannabis resin seizures in the Americas were made by Canada (899 kg). In 2009, Canada seized a much larger quantity - 9.7 mt - in 2,045 individual seizures, two of which together accounted for 82% of the total. Moreover, the traffick - ing routes for cannabis resin reaching Canada appeared to undergo significant changes. Canada identified the Caribbean, North Africa and South-East Asia as the origin for cannabis resin reaching its territory in 2008, but these were replaced by Southern Africa and South- West Asia in 2009. In the United States, seizures rose from 367 kg in 2008 to 811 kg in 2009. The United States also assessed that, in 2008, cannabis resin was trafficked both to the United States via Canada (from North Africa), and to Canada via the United States (of Caribbean origin). Seizures of cannabis resin in Mexico rose from 6 kg in 2007 to 297 kg in 2008 - the highest level since 1995. However, seizures fell to 11 kg in 2009. In Brazil, cannabis resin seizures tripled between 2006 and 2008, reaching the record level of 301 kg in 2008, but fell to 204 kg in 2009.Fig. 167: Significant individual seizures of cannabis resin in Pakistan originating in Afghanistan, 1999-2009 Source: UNODC IDS.Significant individual drug seizures of cannabis resin in Pakistan originating in Afghanistan, 1999-2009 0102030405060708090100 1999 200020012002 2003 2004200520062007 2008 Number seizures201The market Fig. 168: Global seizures of cannabis herb, 1999-2009 Year 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Metric Kingdo m for 2009 are based on inco mplete data for so me jurisdictions for the financial year 2009/10, and adjusted for the missing jurisdictions using the latest available co mplete distribution (relative to the financial year 2006/07).(a) Data relative to 2008.

This process is repeated several times and results in different quality of garda (first, second, ...) with varying proportions of resin and other plant matter. Garda is further processed into hashish. 7 Estimates are based on a population of 24.0 million a for 2009 and a population of 24.5 million for 2010 and an average household size of 6.2 persons.

Nonetheless, challenges remain in making such estimates because of data gaps and the varying quality of the available data. One major problem is the irregularity and incompleteness in ARQ reporting by Member States. Irregular reporting may result in absence of data for some years, and may influence the reported trend in a given year. Secondly, submitted questionnaires are not always complete or comprehen-sive, and thirdly, much of the data collected are subject to limitations and biases. These issues affect the reliabil-ity, quality and comparability of the information received. Sources of information Under the International Drug Conventions, Member States are formally required to provide national drug control-related information annually to the 'Secretary-General' of the United Nations (that is, to UNODC). The Commission on Narcotic Drugs, the UNODC governing body on illicit drug issues, developed the Annual Reports Questionnaire (ARQ) to collect this information. The 2011 World Drug Report is based pri- marily on data obtained from the ARQs submitted by Governments over the period March 2010 to December 2010. The data collected during this period normally refer to the drug situation in 2009. UNODC distrib-uted the questionnaire to 194 countries, as well as 15 territories, and received 107 replies to its questionnaire on Drug Abuse (Part II) and 106 replies to its question-naire on Illicit Supply of Drugs (Part III). The best coverage was from countries in Europe (80% of coun-tries filled in Part II and 88% filled in Part III), Asia (64% of countries filled in Part II and 62% Part III) and the Americas (59% of countries filled in Part II and 53% Part III). In the case of Africa, 27% of countries submit-ted Part II and 25% Part III, and for Oceania, 12% of countries submitted Part II and Part III. In general, the quantity of information provided on illicit drug supply is significantly better than data pro- vided on drug use. While 90% of the responses to Part III of the ARQ were 'substantially' completed, this was true for just 53% of the Part II. (ARQs which were more than 50% completed were classified as having been 'sub- stantially filled in'; less than 50% completion was classi- fied as 'partially filled in'). In order to analyse the extent to which Member States provided information, a number of key questions in the ARQs were identified: For Part II, Drug Abuse, the key questions referred to: trends in drug use (78% of the countries return-ing the ARQ), lifetime prevalence among the general population (54%), youth prevalence (54%), treatment (68%), prevalence of Hepatitis C (47%), HIV (48%) and Hepatitis B (41%) among injecting drug users, and drug-related mortality (34%). For Part III, the Supply of Drugs, this included the questions on: quantities of illicit drugs seized (95% of the countries returning the ARQ), tracking (ori-gin, routes and destination) (80%), prices and purity (85%), and drug-related arrests (91%). While the ARQ information forms the basis for the estimates and trend analysis provided in the World Drug Report , often, this is not sufficient to provide a compre- hensive picture of the world's illicit drug markets. When necessary and where available, ARQ data are supple-mented with data from other sources. As in previous years, seizure data was complemented primarily with data and reports from international organizations such as INTERPOL, the World Customs Organization, Europol, the Organization of American States /Inter- American Drug Abuse Control Commission (CICAD) as well as data provided by the Heads of National Law Enforcement Agencies at their regional meetings, and UNODC's 'Drug Use Information Network for Asia and the Pacific' (DAINAP). In addition, Government reports and online resources were used. Other sources included data published by the United States Depart-ment of State's Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs in its International Narcotics Control Strategy Report. Price and purity data for Europe was complemented with data from the Euro-pean Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) and Europol, whereas precursor data are from the International Narcotics Control Board. Demand-related information was obtained through a number of additional sources, including the drug con-trol agencies participating in the DAINAP network, as well as various national and regional epidemiological 257Methodology networks such as EMCDDA and CICAD. National government reports and scientific literature were also used. Data on drug consumption Overview UNODC estimates of the extent of illicit drug use in the world have been published periodically since 1997. Assessing the extent of drug use (the number of drug users) is a particularly difficult undertaking because it involves measuring the size of a 'hidden' population. Margins of error are considerable, and tend to increase as the scale of estimation is raised, from local to national, regional and global levels. Regional and global estimates are reported as ranges to reflect the information gaps. The level of confidence expressed in the estimates varies across regions and drug types. A global estimate of the level of use of a specific drug involves the following steps: 1. Identication and analysis of appropriate sources (starting from the ARQ); 2. Identication of key benchmark gures for the level of drug use in all countries where data are available (an-nual prevalence of drug use among the general popu-lation aged 15-64) which then serve as 'anchor points' for subsequent calculations; 3. 'Standardization' of existing data if reported with a dierent reference population than the one used for the World Drug Report (for example, from age group 12 and above to a standard age group of 15-64) ; 4. Adjustments of national indicators to estimate an an-nual prevalence rate if such a rate is not available (for example, by using the lifetime prevalence or current use rates; or lifetime or annual prevalence rates among the student population). This includes the identica-tion of adjustment factors based on information from neighbouring countries with similar cultural, social and economic situations where applicable; 5. Imputation for countries where data is not available, based on data from countries in the same subregion. Ranges are calculated by considering the 10th and 90th percentile of the subregional distribution; 6. Extrapolation of available results for a subregion were calculated only for subregions where prevalence esti-mates for at least two countries covering at least 20% of the population were available. If, due to a lack of data, subregional estimates were not extrapolated, a regional calculation was extrapolated based on the 10th and 90th percentile of the distribution of the data available from countries in the region.7. Aggregation of subregional estimates rolled-up into regional results to arrive at global estimates. For countries that did not submit information through the ARQ, or in cases where the data were older than 10 years, other sources were identified, where available. In nearly all cases, these were government sources. Many estimates needed to be adjusted to improve comparabil-ity (see below). In cases of estimates referring to previous years, the prevalence rates were left unchanged and applied to new population estimates for the year 2009. Currently, only two countries measure drug prevalence among the gen-eral population on an annual basis. The remaining countries that regularly measure it - typically the more economically developed - do so usually every three to five years. Therefore, caution should be used when inter-preting any change in global prevalence figures, as changes may in part reflect newer reports from countries or the exclusion of older reports, rather than actual changes in use at the global level. Detailed information is available from countries in North America, a large number of countries in Europe, a number of countries in South America, the two large countries in Oceania and a limited number of countries in Asia and Africa. One key problem in national data is the level of accuracy, which varies strongly from country to country. Not all estimates are based on sound epide-miological surveys. In some cases, the estimates simply reflect the aggregate number of drug users found in drug registries, which cover only a fraction of the total drug using population in a country. Even in cases where detailed information is available, there is often consider-able divergence in definitions used, such as chronic or regular users; registry data (people in contact with the treatment system or the judicial system) versus survey data (usually extrapolation of results obtained through interviews of a selected sample); general population versus specific surveys of groups in terms of age (such as school surveys), special settings (such as hospitals or prisons), et cetera. To reduce the error margins that arise from simply aggregating such diverse estimates, an attempt has been made to standardize - as a far as possible - the heteroge-neous data set. All available estimates were transformed into one single indicator - annual prevalence among the general population aged 15 to 64 - using transformation ratios derived from analysis of the situation in neigh-bouring countries, and if such data were not available, using global average estimates. The basic assumption is that though the level of drug use differs between coun-tries, there are general patterns (for example, lifetime prevalence is higher than annual prevalence; young people consume more drugs than older people; males consume more drugs than females; people in contact 258World Drug Report 2011 with the criminal justice system show higher prevalence rates than the general population, et cetera) which apply to most countries. It is also assumed that the difference between lifetime prevalence and annual prevalence among the general population or between lifetime prev-alence among young people and annual prevalence among the general population, except for emerging drug trends, do not vary greatly among countries with similar social, cultural and economic situations. Indicators used The most widely used indicator at the global level is the annual prevalence rate: the number of people who have consumed an illicit drug at least once in the last twelve months prior to the study. Annual prevalence has been adopted by UNODC as one of key indicators to meas-ure the extent of drug use. It is also part of the Lisbon Consensus on core epidemiological demand indicators which has been endorsed by the Commission on Nar-cotic Drugs. The key indicators are: 1. Drug consumption among the general population (prevalence and incidence); 2. Drug consumption among the youth population (prevalence and incidence); 3. High-risk drug use (number of injecting drug users and the proportion engaged in high-risk behaviour, number of daily drug users); 4. Utilization of services for drug problems; 5. Drug-related morbidity (prevalence of HIV, hepati-tis B virus and hepatitis C virus among illicit drug consumers); 6. Drug-related mortality (deaths directly attributable to drug consumption). Efforts have been made to present the drug situation from countries and regions based on these key epide-miological indicators. The use of annual prevalence is a compromise between lifetime prevalence data (drug use at least once in a life-time) and data on current use (drug use at least once over the past month). The annual prevalence rate is usu-ally shown as a percentage of the youth and adult popu-lation. The definitions of the age groups vary, however, from country to country. Given a highly skewed distri-bution of drug use among the different age cohorts in most countries, differences in the age groups can lead to substantially diverging results. Applying different methodologies may also yield diverg- ing results for the same country. In such cases, the sources were analysed in-depth and priority was given to the most recent data and to the methodological approaches that are considered to produce the best results. For example, it is generally accepted that nation- ally representative household surveys are reasonably good approaches to estimating cannabis, ATS or cocaine use among the general population, at least in countries where there are no adverse consequences for admitting illicit drug use. Thus, household survey results were usu-ally given priority over other sources of prevalence esti-mates. When it comes to heroin use (or drug injecting), or problematic use of cocaine and ATS, annual prevalence data derived from national household surveys tend to grossly under-estimate such use, because heroin or other problem drug users often belong to marginalized or less socially integrated groups, and may not be identified as living in a 'typical' household (they may be on the streets, homeless or institutionalized). Therefore, a number of 'indirect' methods have been developed to provide estimates for this group of drug users, including benchmark and multiplier methods (benchmark data may include treatment demand, police registration or arrest data, data on HIV infections, other services utili-zation by problem drug users or mortality data), cap-ture-recapture methods and multivariate indicators. In countries where there was evidence that the primary 'problem drug' was opiates, and an indirect estimate existed for 'problem drug use' or injecting drug use, this was preferred over household survey estimates of heroin use. For other drug types, priority was given to annual prev- alence data found by means of household surveys. In order to generate comparable results for all countries, wherever needed, the reported data was extrapolated to annual prevalence rates and/or adjusted for the preferred age group of 15-64 for the general population. /g3 Extrapolation methods used Adjustment for differences in age groups Member States are increasingly using the 15-64 age group, though other groups are used as well. Where the age groups reported by Member States did not differ significantly from 15-64, they were presented as reported, and the age group specified. Where studies were based on significantly different age groups, results were typically adjusted. A number of countries reported prevalence rates for the age groups 15+ or 18+. In these cases, it was generally assumed that there was no signifi- cant drug use above the age of 64. The number of drug users based on the population age 15+ (or age 18+) was thus shown as a proportion of the population aged 15-64. Extrapolation of results from lifetime prevalence to annual prevalence Some countries have conducted surveys in recent years without asking the question whether drug consumption 259Methodology took place over the last year. In such cases, results were extrapolated to reach annual prevalence estimates. For example, country X in West and Central Europe reported a lifetime prevalence of cocaine use of 2%. Taking data for lifetime and annual prevalence of cocaine use in countries of West and Central Europe, it can be shown that there is a strong positive correlation between the two measures (correlation coefficient R = 0.94); that is, the higher the lifetime prevalence, the higher the annual prevalence and vice versa. Based on the resulting regres-sion curve (y = annual prevalence and x = lifetime prev-alence) it can be estimated that a country in West and Central European with a lifetime prevalence of 2% is likely to have an annual prevalence of around 0.7% (see figure). Almost the same result is obtained by calculating the ratio of the unweighted annual prevalence rates of the West and Central European countries and the unweighted lifetime prevalence rate (0.93/2.61 = 0.356) and multiplying this ratio with the lifetime prevalence of the country concerned (2% * 0.356 = 0.7%). A similar approach was used to calculate the overall ratio by averaging the annual/lifetime ratios, calculated for each country. Multiplying the resulting average ratio (0.334) with the lifetime prevalence of the country con-cerned provides the estimate for the annual prevalence (0.387 * 2% = 0.8%). There is a close correlation observed between lifetime and annual prevalence (and an even stronger correlation between annual prevalence and monthly prevalence). Solid results (showing small potential errors) can only be expected from extrapola-tions done for a country in the same region. If instead of using the West and Central European average (0.387), the ratio found in the USA was used (0.17), the estimate for a country with a lifetime prevalence of cocaine use of 2% would decline to 0.3% (2% * 0.17). Such an esti-mate is likely to be correct for a country with a drug history similar to the USA, which has had a cocaine problem for more than two decades, as opposed to West and Central Europe, where the cocaine problem is largely a phenomenon of the last decade. Therefore, data from countries in the same subregion with similar pat-terns in drug use were used, wherever possible, for extrapolation purposes. Both approaches\u2014the regression model and the ratio model\u2014were used to determine upper and lower uncer- tainty range estimates calculated at a 90% confidence interval among those aged 15-64 years in the given country. The greater the range, the larger the level of uncertainty around the estimates. The range for each country is reported in the statistical annex, where avail-able. Extrapolations based on school surveys Analysis of countries which have conducted both school surveys and national household surveys shows that there is, in general, a positive correlation between the two variables, particularly for cannabis, ATS and cocaine. The correlation, however, is weaker than that of lifetime and annual prevalence or current use and annual preva- lence among the general population. But it is stronger than the correlation between opiate use and injecting drug use-related HIV cases, and between treatment and drug use. These extrapolations were conducted by using the ratios between school surveys and household surveys of coun-tries in the same region or with similar social structure where applicable. As was the case with extrapolation of results from lifetime prevalence to annual prevalence, two approaches were taken: a) the unweighted average of the ratios between school and household surveys in the comparison countries with an upper and lower uncertainty range estimate calculated at a 90% confi-dence interval; and b) a regression-based extrapolation, using the relationships between estimates from the other countries to predict the estimate in the country con-cerned, with an upper and lower uncertainty range esti-mate calculated at a 90% confidence interval. The final uncertainty range and best estimate are calculated using both models, where applicable. Extrapolations based on treatment dataFor a number of developing countries, the only drug use-related data available was treatment demand. In such cases, other countries in the region with a similar socio-economic structure were identified, which reported annual prevalence and treatment data. A ratio of people treated per 1,000 drug users was calculated for each country. The results from different countries were then y = 0.3736x - 0.0455 R = 0.94 R 2 = 0 Life-time prevalence in % of population age 15-64Annual prevalence in % of population age 15-64 Data points Regression curveAnnual and lifetime prevalence rates of cocaine use in West and Central Europe Sources: UNODC, Annual Reports Questionnaire Data / EMCDDA, Annual Report.260World Drug Report 2011 averaged and the resulting ratio was used to extrapolate the likely number of drug users from the number of people in treatment. Making regional and global estimates of the number of people who use drugs and the health consequences For this purpose, the estimated prevalence rates of coun- tries were applied to the population aged 15-64, as provided by the United Nations Population Division for the year 2009. Ranges have been produced to reflect the considerable uncertainty that arises when data are either extrapolated or imputed. Ranges (not absolutes) are provided for estimated numbers and prevalence rates in the Report. Larger ranges are reported for subregions and regions with less certainty about the likely levels of drug use - in other words, those regions for which fewer direct esti-mates are available, for a comparatively smaller propor-tion of the region's population. Countries with one published estimate (typically those countries with a representative household survey, or an indirect prevalence estimate that did not report ranges) did not have uncertainty estimated. This estimate is reported as the 'best estimate'. To account for populations in countries with no pub- lished estimate, the 10th and 90th percentile in the range of direct estimates was used to produce a lower and upper estimate. For example, there are three coun-tries in the North Africa subregion with past year preva-lence estimates for cannabis use: Algeria (a range from 5.2 - 6.4), Egypt (2.9 - 9.6) and Morocco (4.2, a point estimate). These are extrapolated to the population of the remaining three countries without prevalence data, namely the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Sudan and T unisia. The 10th percentile of the lower bound of the uncer-tainty range (5,2, 2.9, and 4.2) is 3.2 and the 90th percentile of the upper bound (6.4, 9.6, and 4.2) is 8.9. The 3.2 and 8.9 figures are applied to the population of the remaining three countries without prevalence data for a subregional total lower and upper estimate. In some cases, not all of a region's subregions had esti- mates due to a lack of country level data. For example, past year amphetamines-group prevalence was calcu- lated for East and South-East Asia and the Near and Middle East/South West Asia, however the remaining subregions - South Asia and Central Asia - had no esti-mates. To calculate an overall Asia lower and upper estimate for populations in subregions with no pub-lished estimate, all of the countries throughout the region were considered using the 10th and 90th percen-tile of the regional distribution. These results were then combined with those subregions where an estimate was possible. One exception was South Asia's subregional opiate and cannabis estimates. In this case, India's popu-lation accounts for 85% of the six countries in the sub-region, but reliable estimates of drug use for India were not available. Instead of using all prevalence estimates for Asia (that is, estimates from the Near and Middle East to East Asia) to determine India's contribution to the subregional uncertainty, it was determined that India's contribution was best reflected by its neighboring countries. This produces conservative (wide) intervals for subre- gions where there is geographic variation and/or vari- ance in existing country-level estimates; but it also reduces the likelihood that skewed estimates will have a dramatic effect on regional and global figures (since these would most likely fall outside the 10th and 90th percentile). Estimates of the total number of people who used illicit drugs at least once in the past year This year's Report used the same approach as last year. T wo ranges were produced, and the lowest and highest estimate of each the approaches were taken to estimate the lower and upper ranges, respectively, of the total illicit drug using population. This estimate is obviously tentative given the limited number of countries upon which the data informing the two approaches were based. The two approaches were as follows: Approach 1.The global estimates of the number of people using each of the five drug groups in the past year were added up. Taking into account that people use more than one drug type and that these five populations overlap, the total was adjusted downward. The size of this adjustment was made based upon household surveys conducted in the USA, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, Italy, Brazil, Mexico, Germany, Spain, Argentina, Chile, the Plurinational State of Bolivia, Peru, Indonesia and the Philippines, which assessed all five drug types, and reported an estimate of total illicit drug use. Across these studies, the extent to which adding each population of users overestimated the total population was a median value of 126%. The summed total was therefore divided by 1.26. Approach 2. This approach was based on the average proportion of the total drug using population that comprises cannabis users. The average proportion was obtained from house-hold surveys conducted in the same countries as for Approach 1 Across all of these studies, the median pro-portion of total drug users that comprised cannabis users was 75%. The range of cannabis users at the global level was therefore divided by 0.75.261Methodology Estimates of the number of 'problem drug users' It is useful to make estimates of the number of drug users whose use is particularly problematic as this sub- group of drug users is most likely to come to the atten- tion of health and law enforcement. Moreover, this subgroup's drug use has been estimated to cause the main public health and public order burden. The number of problem drug users is typically estimated with the number of dependent drug users. Sometimes, an alternative approach is used. The EMCDDA uses 'injecting or long duration use of opioids, ampheta- mines or cocaine' to guide country-level indirect preva-lence estimation studies of problem drug use. In this Report, as in previous years, each of the five range estimates of the number of people using each of the five drug groups was converted into a 'heroin user equiva-lent'. This was calculated through the use of 'relative risk coefficients' (see table) derived from the UNODC Harm Index. This method enables the aggregation of results from different drugs into one reference drug A lower range was calculated by summing each of the five lower range estimates; the upper end of the range was calculated by summing the upper range of the five estimates. To obtain an estimate of the number of 'problem drug users', these totals were multiplied by the proportion of past year heroin users in the United States National Survey on Drug Use and Health (range 53-68% over the past six years of this survey). Hence, The LOW estimate of is the lower proportion (53%) multiplied by the lower estimated size of the heroin use equivalent population (28.6 million heroin user equivalents). The HIGH esti-mate is the higher proportion (68%) multiplied by the higher estimated size of the heroin use equivalent popu- lation (57.5 million heroin user equivalents). This gives a range of 15 to 39 million problem drug users globally. Estimates of the prevalence of hepatitis C virus among injecting drug users The prevalence of hepatitis C among injecting drug users is reported directly by Member States. The number of injecting drug users is obtained from the Reference Group to the UN on HIV and Injecting Drug Use 1 (preferred source), or otherwise as reported via the ARQ. To obtain an estimate of the prevalence at the regional and global level, country-level rates were weighted by the number of injecting drug users. Estimates of the number of drug-related deathsDrug-related deaths include those directly or indirectly caused by the intake of illicit drugs, but it may also include deaths where the use of illicit drugs was a con-tributory cause, including cases where drug use was involved in the circumstances of the deaths (for exam-ple, violence and traffic accidents). Member States report on drug-related deaths according to their own definitions and therefore care should be taken in making country comparisons. The total number of drug-related deaths reported by Member States were aggregated at the regional level. To account for non-responding countries, an upper and lower estimate of the number of deaths was made using the 10th and 90th percentiles of the mortality rates for countries that did report within the same region. In North America, all countries reported and therefore, no range was given. In Oceania, only Australia reported on the number of deaths, and therefore, no variation in mortality rates across the region could be determined. Because of the lack of reported information on drug-related deaths in Africa, an alternative source was used. 2 The global estimate of the number of drug-related deaths is the sum of the regional estimates. The overall estimated number of deaths for a region was presented as a range to account for uncertainty, and also presented as a rate per 1 million population aged 15-64 to allow for some degree of comparison across regions. 1 Mathers BM, Degenhardt L, Phillips B, et al.

Estimates of cannabis cultivation in 2009 and 2010 in Afghani-stan, as well as cannabis cultivation in 2003, 2004 and 2005 in Morocco, have also been produced by the ICMP-supported national monitoring systems. Esti-mates for other countries have been drawn from ARQ replies and various other sources, including reports from Governments, UNODC field offices and the United States Department of State's Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs. A full technical description of the methods used by UNODC-supported national monitoring systems can be found in the respective national survey reports avail-able at http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/crop-monitor-ing/index.html . Net cultivation Not all the fields on which illicit crops are planted are actually harvested and contribute to drug production. For Afghanistan, a system of monitoring opium poppy eradication is in place which provides all necessary infor-mation to calculate the net cultivation area. In Myanmar and the Lao People's Democratic Republic, the eradi-cated area of opium poppy is partly taken into account for the estimation of the net cultivation area. Not enough information is available to consider eradication carried out after the time of the annual opium survey. A major difference between coca and other narcotic plants such as opium poppy and cannabis is that the coca bush is a perennial plant which can be harvested several times per year. This longevity of the coca plant should, in principle, make it easier to measure the area under coca cultivation. In reality, the area under coca cultivation is dynamic, changes all the time and it is dif-ficult to determine the exact amount of land under coca cultivation at any specific point in time or within a given year. There are several reasons why coca cultivation is dynamic, including new plantation, reactivation of pre-viously abandoned fields, abandonment, manual eradi-cation and aerial spraying. 3 Depending on the purpose, different concepts of area 3 Plant disease and pests are not considered here as their impact is likely to be captured in the coca leaf yield estimates.under coca cultivation can by useful, taking into account some or all of the factors described above. From a gov-ernment's perspective, it may be interesting to monitor illicit cultivation attempts in a given year, by trying to capture all coca fields irrespective of whether they existed the whole year or only part of it ( gross cultivation area). For estimating potential coca leaf and cocaine production, it would be necessary to measure the pro-ductive area and how long the fields were productive in the course of a year ( net productive area ). For other reasons, the area under cultivation at a specific cut-off date may be chosen, for example, to monitor the effect of law enforcement activities implemented in the pre-ceding period ( area under cultivation at date x ). By definition, the net productive area and the area under cultivation at point x will be smaller than the gross cul-tivation area. The area affected by coca cultivation in a given year, or gross coca cultivation , can be defined as the totality of all coca fields existing in that year, irrespective of whether they were newly planted, reactivated, abandoned, eradi-cated or sprayed during the course of that year. For the calculation of the net productive area , two dimensions should be considered: the duration over which the field was in existence and productivity. The area of fields which did not exist over the full 12 months of a year should be subtracted from the gross cultivation figure, by a factor expressing their reduced productive time. In addition to the time factor, the reduced produc-tivity of certain field types and the effects of eradication and spraying need to be taken into account. Young plants in new coca elds are not as productive as mature coca bushes. Eradicated coca elds may be replanted but have a lower yields as plants are not mature Coca bushes in a eld sprayed with herbicide may ei- ther die (all or some) or have a reduced yield for some months. A reactivated eld with mature coca bushes may reach full productivity faster than a newly planted eld but still be less productive than a well maintained eld The effect on productivity could be added to the effect of time. For example, 20 ha which were eradicated after six months would only count as 10 productive hectares. Similarly, a factor can be introduced to reflect the reduced productivity as a result of aerial spraying. Efforts are being made to improve the estimation of the net productive area in the context of improving the accuracy of the cocaine production estimate. In 2010, for the first time, the net productive area was estimated in addition to the net cultivation on 31 December, using information on manual eradication 263Methodology and spraying of coca bush and other sources to model the permanence (that is, the productive time span) of coca fields. Permanence factors for abandoned, sprayed and eradicated coca fields were established and applied. The resulting area was considerably larger than the net area on 31 December. In addition, the previous approach of using the average net area on 31 December of the two last surveys was used to calculate coca leaf production to maintain comparability with previous years. More research is needed on the permanence of coca fields and the consequences for coca leaf yield to improve the net productive area estimate. In Colombia, an adjustment factor was introduced to include small coca fields into the area estimate, which could not be captured due to technical limitations. This was necessary as studies showed that the proportion of undetectable small fields below 0.25 ha has been increas-ing in recent years. The adjustment for small fields leads to a higher area estimate and is considered more accu-rate. Area figures for 2009 and 2010 were calculated with and without adjustment for small fields for compa-rability reasons. The adjustment varies from year to year, depending on the proportion of small fields present in each cultivation region, and the contribution of each region to the total in a specific year. Thus, the adjust-ment factor has to be calculated for each year separately. Efforts are under way to recalculate the time series for Colombia with the adjustment factor. As of now, the adjusted figures are only available for 2009 and 2010. In the Plurinational State of Bolivia and Peru, the coca area as estimated from satellite imagery in the second half of the year was used as a proxy for the net produc-tive area. Thus, eradication of coca bush is partly taken into account for the estimation of the net cultivation area. Not enough information is available to also con- sider eradication carried out after the time of the annual survey. For countries not covered by UNODC's Illicit Crop Monitoring Programme, the reported net cultivation figure is used. Yield4 and production To estimate potential production of opium, coca leaf and cannabis (herb and resin), the number of harvests per year and the total yield of primary plant material has to be established. The UNODC-supported national surveys take measurements in the field and conduct interviews with farmers, using results from both to pro-duce the final data on yield. Opium yield surveys are complex. Harvesting opium with the traditional lancing method can take up to two weeks as the opium latex that oozes out of the poppy capsule has to dry before harvesters can scrape it off and several lancings take place until the plant has dried. To avoid this lengthy process, yield surveyors measure the number of poppy capsules and their size in sample plots. Using a scientifically developed formula, the measured poppy capsule volume indicates how much opium gum each plant potentially yields. Thus, the per hectare opium yield can be estimated. Different formulas were developed for South-East and South-West Asia. In Afghanistan and Myanmar, yield surveys are carried out annually. For coca bush, the number of harvests varies, as does the yield per harvest. In the Plurinational State of Bolivia and Peru, UNODC supports monitoring systems that conduct coca leaf yield surveys in several regions, by 4 Further information on the methodology of opium and coca leaf yield surveys conducted by UNODC can be found in United Nations (2001): Guidelines for Yield Assessment of Opium Gum and Coca Leaf from Brief Field Visits , New York (ST/NAR/33).

In Colombia, where the security situation does not allow for surveyors to return to the sample fields, only one harvest was measured, and the others were estimated based on information from the farmer. In all three coca cultivating countries, yield surveys are carried out only occasionally, due to the difficult security situation in many coca regions, and because of funding constraints. Conversion factorsThe primary plant material harvested - opium in the form of gum or latex from opium poppy, coca leaves from coca bush, and the cannabis plant - undergo a sequence of extraction and transformation processes, some of which are done by farmers onsite, others by traffickers in clandestine laboratories. Some of these processes involve precursor chemicals and may be done by different people in different places under a variety of conditions, which are not always known. In the case of opium gum, for example, traffickers extract the mor-phine contained in the gum in one process, transform the morphine into heroin base in a second process, and finally produce heroin hydrochloride. In the case of cocaine, coca paste is produced from either sun-dried (in the Plurinational State of Bolivia and Peru) or fresh coca leaves (in Colombia), which is later transformed into cocaine base, from where cocaine hydrochloride is pro-duced. The results of each step, for example, from coca leaf to coca paste, can be estimated with a conversion factor. Such conversion factors are based on interviews with the people involved in the process, such as farmers in Colombia, who report how much coca leaf they need to produce 1 kg of coca paste or cocaine base. Tests have also been conducted where so-called 'cooks' or 'chemists' demonstrate how they do the processing under local conditions. A number of studies conducted by enforce-ment agencies in the main drug-producing countries have provided the orders of magnitude for the transfor-mation from the raw material to the end product. This information is usually based on just a few case studies, however, which are not necessarily representative of the entire production process. Farmer interviews are not always possible due to the sensitivity of the topic, espe-cially if the processing is done by specialists and not by the farmers themselves. Establishing conversion ratios is complicated by the fact that traffickers may not know the quality of the raw material and chemicals they use, which may vary considerably; they may have to use a range of chemicals for the same purpose depending, on their availability and costs; and the conditions under which the processing takes place (temperature, humid- ity, et cetera) differ. It is important to take into account the fact that the margins of error of these conversion ratios - used to calculate the potential cocaine production from coca leaf or the heroin production from opium - are not known. To be precise, these calculations would require detailed information on the morphine content of opium or the cocaine content of the coca leaf, as well as detailed infor-mation on the efficiency of clandestine laboratories. Such information is limited. This also applies to the question of the psychoactive content of the narcotic plants. UNODC, in cooperation with Member States, is cur- rently reviewing coca leaf to cocaine conversion ratios as well as coca leaf yields and net productive area esti-mates. 5 More research is needed to establish comparable data for all components of the cocaine production esti- mate. Many cannabis farmers in Afghanistan and Morocco conduct the first processing steps themselves, either by removing the upper leaves and flowers of the plant to produce cannabis herb or by threshing and sieving the plant material to extract the cannabis resin. The herb and resin yield per hectare can be obtained by multiply-ing the plant material yield with an extraction factor. The complex area of cannabis resin yield in Afghanistan was investigated in 2009 and 2010. The yield study included observation of the actual production of resin, which is a process of threshing and sieving the dried cannabis plants. In Morocco, this factor was established by using information from farmers on the methods used and on results from scientific laboratories. Information on the yield was obtained from interviews with cannabis farmers. 6 The estimate of global cannabis herb and resin 5 More detailed information on the ongoing review of conversion fac- tors was presented in the 2010 World Drug Report , p.251 ff. 6 For greater detail on studies with farmers, see: UNODC, Enqu\u00eate 2010Cocaine, 100% pure ( mt) Applying the new conversion factors to Bolivia and Peru Using previous conversion factorsImpact of conversion factors on global esti- mates of potential cocaine HCl production (mt)265Methodology production was not updated in 2010, given the high level of uncertainty and the continuing lack of informa-tion in many cannabis-cultivating countries. Potential production 'Potential' heroin or cocaine production shows the total production of heroin or cocaine if all the cultivated opium or coca leaf were transformed into the end prod- ucts in the respective producer country in the same year. However, part of the opium or coca leaf is directly con-sumed in the producing countries or in neighbouring countries, prior to the transformation into heroin or cocaine. In addition, significant quantities of the inter-mediate products, coca paste or morphine, are also con-sumed in the producing countries. Some products such as opium can be stored for extended periods of time and be converted into intermediate or final products long after the harvest year. These factors are partly taken into account: for example, consumption of coca leaf consid-ered licit in the Plurinational State of Bolivia and Peru is not taken into account for the transformation into cocaine. Other factors, such as the actual amount of illicit coca paste or opium consumption and storage, are difficult to estimate and were not taken into account. For cocaine, potential production of 100% pure cocaine is estimated. In reality, clandestine laboratories do not produce 100% pure cocaine but cocaine of lower purity which is often referred to as 'export quality'. For heroin, not enough information is available to estimate the pro-duction of heroin of 100% purity. Instead, potential production of export quality heroin is estimated, whose exact purity is not known and may vary. Although it is based on current knowledge on the alka- loid content of narcotic plants and the efficiency of clandestine laboratories, 'potential production' is a hypothetical concept and is not an estimate of actual heroin or cocaine production at the country or global level. The concept of potential production is different from the theoretical maximum amount of drug that could be produced if all alkaloids were extracted from opium and coca leaf. The difference between the theo-retical maximum and the potential production is expressed by the so-called laboratory efficiency, which describes which proportion of alkaloids present in plant material clandestine laboratories are actually able to extract. ColombiaIn 2010, for the first time, the net productive area was estimated, in addition to the previous approach of using the average area under coca cultivation of the reporting year and the previous year. For reasons of comparability, the latter was presented as the point estimate. A range was calculated whereby the estimate based on the previ- ous methodology forms the lower bound, and the cocaine estimate based on the net productive area the upper bound. For years before 2010, the net productive area had not yet been calculated at the time of printing. 7 Peru Potential cocaine production in Peru is estimated from potential coca leaf production after deducting the amount of coca leaf estimated to be used for traditional purposes according to Government sources (9,000 mt of sun-dry coca leaf). The Plurinational State of Bolivia Potential cocaine production in the Plurinational State of Bolivia is estimated from potential coca leaf produc-tion after deducting the amount of coca leaf produced on 12,000 ha in the Yungas of La Paz where coca cultiva-tion is authorized under national law. Drug trafficking Seizures The analysis presented in this report is mainly derived from the ARQ responses covering the March 2010-December 2010 period. Including information from other sources, UNODC was able to obtain seizure data from 143 countries and territories for 2009. Seizures are thus the most comprehensive indicator of the drug situ-ation and its evolution at the global level. Although sei-zures may not always reflect trafficking trends correctly at the national level, they tend to show reasonable repre-sentations of trends at the regional and global levels. Countries may report seizures of drugs using a variety of units, primarily by weight (kg) but also in litres, tablets, doses, blotters, capsules, ampoules, et cetera. When reporting about individual countries in individual years UNODC endeavours to be as faithful as possible to the reports received, but often it is necessary to aggregate data of different types for the purposes of comparison. For the purposes of aggregation, conversion factors are used to convert the quantities into 'kilogram equiva-lents' (or 'ton equivalents'). The conversion factors affect seizure totals of ampheta- mine-type stimulants in particular, as a significant share of seizures of these drug types is reported in number of tablets. In previous editions of the World Drug Report , the factors used for ATS ranged between 30 mg and 100 mg per tablet, and were intended to reflect the amount of controlled substance in the tablet; these factors depended on the drug type but not on the reporting country. 7 More information on the results of the two approaches and the methodology used can be found in the report on coca cultivation in Colombia (UNODC/ Government of Colombia, June 2011) available on the internet at http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/crop-monitoring/index.html.266World Drug Report 2011 Apart from seizures of ATS tablets, drug seizures are mainly reported to UNODC by weight. This includes seizures of ATS which are not seized in tablet form (for example, crystalline methamphetamine, ATS in powder form) as well as seizures of other drug types, such as heroin and cocaine. Moreover, ATS seizures made in tablet form are also sometimes reported by weight, and in some cases, the reported total weight possibly includes ATS seized in different forms. Reports of seizures by weight usually refer to the bulk weight of seizures, including adulterants and diluents, rather than the amount of controlled substance. Moreover, given the availability of data, accurate purity adjustments for bulk seizure totals in individual countries are feasible in a small minority of cases, as they would require informa-tion on purity on a case by case basis or statistically calibrated data, such as a weighted average or a distribu-tion. The bulk weight of tablets is easier to obtain and less variable. To improve the comparability of seizure totals across different years and countries, UNODC has revised the conversion factors used for ATS tablets to reflect the bulk weight of the tablets rather than the amount of controlled substance. The factors used in this edition of the World Drug Report are based on available forensic studies and range between 90 mg and 300 mg, depend-ing on the region and drug type. The change has been implemented for all years up to and including 2009 (see table). The conversion factors remain subject to revision as the information available to UNODC improves. All other conversion ratios remained unchanged from previous editions. Seizures quantified by volume (litres) are aggregated using a conversion ratio of 1 kilogram per liter, which applies to all drug types. Cannabis plants are assumed to have a weight of 100 grams. Moreover, at various points in the analysis, purity adjust- ments are made where relevant and where the availabil- ity of data allows. UNODC continues to record and report the disaggre- gated raw data, which are available in the seizure listings published online. 8 In these tables, seizure quantities are reproduced as reported. In the rest of the Report, seizure data are often aggregated and transformed into a unique measurement: seizures in 'kilogram equivalents'. For the purposes of the calculations a 'typical consumption unit' was assumed to be for cannabis herb, 0.5 g; for cannabis resin, 0.135 g; LSD, 0.00005 g (50 micrograms); and opium, 0.3 g. For opiate seizures (unless specified differently in the text), it was assumed that 10 kg of opium were equivalent to 1 kg of morphine or heroin. Though these transformation ratios can be disputed, they provide a means of combining the different seizure reports into one comprehensive measure. The transformation ratios have been derived from those normally used by law enforcement agencies, in the scientific literature and by the International Narcotics Control Board, and were established in consultation with UNODC's Laboratory and Scientific Section. Trafficking routes and volumes Information of trafficking routes was mainly obtained from analyses of individual drug seizures reported to UNODC, as well as analyses of trafficking routes reported by Member States. To calculate the volumes of drugs trafficked, the retail market size of each country was established by multiply-ing the number of drug users with best estimates on per capita drug consumption, derived from local studies. There is, however, still a lack of scientific studies on per 8 See http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/WDR.htmlEcstasy (MDMA or analogue)Amphetamine Metha mphetamineNon-specified amphetamines Africa 271 250 250 Asia (excluding Near and Middle East/ South-West Asia)300 250 90 250 Europe 271 253 225 250 Central and South America and the Caribbean271 250 250 250 Near and Middle East/ South-West Asia237 170 250 250 North America 250 250 250 250 Oceania 276 250 250 250Weight of tablets in mg267Methodology capita consumption and results must be treated as pre- liminary. Based on the estimates of the volumes con-sumed and knowing the main origins of the drugs and the seizures made, the volumes of the main drug flows were established Market analysis Drug price and purity data Price and purity data, if properly collected and reported, can be powerful indicators of market trends. T rends in supply can change over a shorter period of time when compared with changes in demand and shifts in prices and purities are good indicators for increases or declines of market supply. Research has shown that short-term changes in the consumer markets are first reflected in purity changes while prices tend to be rather stable over longer periods of time. UNODC collects its price data from the ARQ, and supplements this data with other sources such as DAINAP , EMCDDA and Government reports. Prices are collected at farm-gate level, wholesale level ('kilogram prices') and at retail level ('gram prices'). Countries are asked to provide minimum, maximum and typical prices and purities. When countries do not provide typical prices/purities, for the purposes of cer-tain estimates, the mid-point of these estimates is calcu-lated as a proxy for the 'typical' prices/purities (unless scientific studies are available which provide better esti-mates). What is generally not known is how data were collected and how reliable it is. Although improvements have been made in some countries over the years, a number of law enforcement bodies have not yet estab-lished a regular system for collecting purity and price data. Size and value of the market Multiplying the volumes of drugs consumed in a coun- try with the purity-adjusted retail prices gives the value of the market. In case no country-specific per capita use rates were available, regional estimates were used. Simi-larly, in case no country-specific prices were available, average subregional prices were used as a proxy. The same principle was applied to purities. Average subre- gional purities were used for countries that were not in a position to assess the purities of the drugs seized. Given the large number of assumptions in deriving the various country estimates from subregional or regional averages, all sizes of the market estimates must be treated with caution.
