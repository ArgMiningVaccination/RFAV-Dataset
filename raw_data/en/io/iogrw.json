Everybody knows that. A `spiritual bath', however, is a very different experience. It's a ritual - much like the ritual baths of ancient Rome \u2014 that actually cleanses your chakras, revitalizes your aura, and leaves you feeling more present, and in an extremely positive state of mind. This spiritual regeneration occurs not merely from the comfort of soaking in warm water, but from energies imparted by the powerful oils, herbs or crystals you have added to the bathwater. Here is a quick primer on how to take a spiritual bath. Try it! This amazing journey that will bring more positive changes into your life over time than you can possibly imagine. What Is A Spiritual Bath? Unlike a regular bath with soap, shampoo and water that cleanse the body, a spiritual bath works to cleanse the mind and spirit, using powerful ingredients that charge the bathwater with healing vibrations that help you remove blockages, hurts, pains and situations that are no longer serving you in any constructive way. How To Prepare For A Spiritual Bath? Step 1: Scrub the bathtub thoroughly first to make sure it is really clean. Step 2: Set a mental intention that this time is totally yours and you will not be disturbed by texts, phone calls or visitors for the next hour or so. Step 3: Take a quick shower and clean yourself first. Remember that no soaps or other cleansing agents can be used during a spiritual bath. Step 4: Fill the bathtub with water at a temperature that feels most comfortable. As the tub is filling up, gather all the ingredients you need (ingredients are given below). You may want to light an incense stick or a few candles or play some soothing music - anything that will relax your mind into a calm, meditative state. Release the tensions of the day, like you would in a spa, and focus on just enjoying yourself. Step 5: Step into the bath and soak for about 20-30 minutes. As you relax in the water, clear your mind of all unwelcome thoughts and focus on your intention to let go of all stress and negativity. There is no right or wrong way to do this - as long as you're relaxed and enjoying yourself. Step 6: Spiritual baths are strong, and therefore you should not overdo them. Twice a month should be more than sufficient to start. Your inner guidance will let you know if you need more. Spiritual Bath Ingredients There are countless ways you can prepare spiritual baths with different ingredients of your own choosing. You can use just one or two ingredients or opt for even more. It is entirely your decision, so let your intuition guide you. But here are some very effective ingredients you can consider: 1: Salt: Natural salt is one of the most powerful ingredients to release any kind of negative energies, thoughts and feelings that are proving to be blockages in your path. Pink Himalayan salt, natural sea salt and Epsom salt are great for this purpose and easily available in most grocery stores. Never use regular table salts because they contain anti-caking agents and have gone through a refining process that has removed many of the beneficial minerals. 2: Lavender: Lavender is a great stress reliever, and you can use it in the form of dried buds (soaked in boiling water for an hour and strained) or pure essential oil. 3: Baking Soda: Bicarbonate of soda, or baking soda, helps to clean negative debris from your aura, and leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth as well. 4: Goat's Milk: If you have been having a run of bad luck, then a spiritual bath with goat's milk can help you turn around the situation. In a large bowl, add 3 cups of goat's milk with a cup of holy water, sea salt and a handful of fresh parsley. (Parsley attracts good luck and wealth, and is also an herb associated with protection and purification.) Let the concoction sit for a few hours before straining the parsley out and pouring the remaining liquid into the bathtub. 5: Rose Cologne: Rose cologne or rose water makes an excellent spiritual bath to uplift moods and make you feel more self-love if you've not been taking good care of yourself lately. Throw in some rose petals (fresh or dried) for good measure and let the fragrance of the bath fill your spirits with new energy and appreciation of who you are. 6: Sesame Seeds: If you've been worrying about finances, then a spiritual bathwater infused with the vibration of sesame seeds (soaked for an hour in boiling water and strained) can help remove blockages and bring more abundance into your life. 7: Carnations: Pink and red carnations soothe a broken heart and help guide you if you're struggling with a love relationship. Boil fresh red and pink carnations in a pot of water with some coconut milk and honey. Strain the liquid and use as ingredients in your spiritual bath if you're experiencing complications in your love life. 8: Readymade Spiritual Bath Sachets If you are unable to prepare ingredients for a spiritual bath on your own, you can easy buy them online.
