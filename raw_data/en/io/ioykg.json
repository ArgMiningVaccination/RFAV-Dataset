We know that experiencing trauma can result in both emotional and physical symptoms. Many of our clients report physical symptoms such as pain, physical tension, digestive issues, hormonal imbalances, sexual dysfunction, immune system dysfunction, and other medical issues. A landmark study called the Adverse Childhood Experiences or ACES Study linked early traumatic life events with the development and prevalence of a wide range of serious health and mental health difficulties throughout a person's lifespan. We believe Somatic Therapy is one of the best ways for clients heal from trauma because this modality works with both the client's biography and biology. Traditional psychotherapy tends to be solely focused on the mind, meaning making, and narratives. Somatic therapy, in contrast, is a holistic therapy that focuses on how both the mind and body are impacted by psychological experiences. Somatic therapists work with clients on noticing how past trauma is held in the body and work with their clients to process their trauma somatically. We may ask clients to slow-down, to break their difficult story down into smaller pieces, and to assess their emotional and physiological reaction as they discuss difficult events or emotions. This process allows for optimal healing and resolution as the mind and body have time to work in tandem. We specialize in a variety of body-oriented therapies. - Dance/Movement Therapy (DMT) - Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) - Mindfulness - Neuro-Affective Relational Model (NARM) - Somatic Experiencing Other Servcies What Are Common Issues "}
