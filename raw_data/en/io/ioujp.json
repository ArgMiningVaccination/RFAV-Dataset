It works by exposing you to a small dose of the flu virus which helps your body to develop immunity against the disease. Vaccination will not treat an existing flu virus infection. Influvac Tetra 2022 Vaccine is given as an injection into a muscle by a doctor or nurse. It is usually given just before the cold season when the flu virus begins to increase. Normally, only one injection is required to protect you for a year. You should have the vaccination each year because different new strains of the flu virus emerge frequently and different vaccines are developed. It is especially important to have this vaccine if you are elderly or have chronic health problems such as diabetes, heart failure, kidney failure, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is also recommended for young children over 6 months of age. This vaccine can cause mild side effects, but it is better to get vaccinated than to become infected with flu. Influenza causes thousands of deaths each year. The most common side effects include headache, weakness, tiredness, and pain or swelling at the vaccination site. They do not normally last very long. Consult your doctor if any of the side effects persist or worry you. Before having the injection, you should tell your doctor if you have an illness with a high temperature or if you have ever had an allergic reaction to a vaccine. Some other medicines may react with the flu vaccine so talk to your doctor about other medications you are taking as well. As with any vaccine, vaccination may not fully protect everybody, although it will reduce the symptoms of the flu if you get it. It will not prevent illness from avian flu (bird flu) or a common cold. Consult your doctor first if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.
