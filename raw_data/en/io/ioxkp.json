While the relief of musculoskeletal pain is one of the primary functions of chiropractic care, it is only a fraction of the services provided by a chiropractor. At Druzbik Family Chiropractic, our chiropractor in Statesville also helps with joint function restoration and spinal health. This goes a long way in improving nervous system functionality, which plays a significant role in boosting your immune system. The immune system fights off infections in our bodies with a complex system of cells and proteins to protect you from infectious organisms. To perform its function effectively, the immune center relies on the nervous system. If your spine is misaligned or injured, the nervous system suffers interference with its communication, weakening your body's immunity response. This means that your body's ability to fight off infections naturally is threatened. A chiropractor's services involving spinal manipulation relieve compression in the nerve pathways in the spine, preventing communication interference within the nervous system. Chiropractors use various techniques to relieve compression and misalignment in the spine, including massage therapy, spinal adjustments, structural integration, decompression, and acupuncture therapy. By implementing these therapies in your life, you will enjoy total body wellness. Chiropractic treatment also helps boost your overall health and wellness, not just physically but mentally as well. Increased stress can, for instance, lead to back pain, thereby causing nervous system interference that leads to problems with your immunity. Chiropractic therapy options come with the benefit of stress relief, allowing you to maintain a healthy mind. This trickles down to improved body posture in the shoulders, neck, and back, allowing your nervous system to optimally relay information. Due to this, your body is strengthened to fight infections and heal naturally. Chiropractic services aid in spinal alignment, which goes a long way in boosting your body's immune defenses.
