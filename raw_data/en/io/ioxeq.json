Rep. No. 87-1589, aT19 (1962), as reprinted in 1962U.S.C.C.A.N. 1943, 1961. As relevant here, section 1 I l5(a)(l ) of the Act allows the Secretary to waive compliance with the Medicaid program requirements of section 1902 of the Act, to the extent and for the period he finds necessary to carry out th\u00e9 demonstration project. In addition, section I I l5(a)(2) ofthe Act allows the Secretary to provide federal financial participation for demonstration costs that would not otherwise be considered as federally matchable expenditures under section 1903 ofthe Acte to the extent and for the period prescribed by the Secretary. For the reasons discussed below, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is approving Arizona's December 19,2017, and April 6, 2018, requests to amend its section 1l 15 demonstration project, entitled \"Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System (AHCCCS)\" (Project Number l1-W -0027 5109), in accordance with section I 1 15(a) of the Act. This approval is effective January 18, 2019, through September 30,2021, upon which date, unless extended or otherwise amended, all authorities granted to operate this demonstration will expire. CMS's approval is subject to the limitations specihed in the attached expenditure authorities, waivers, and special terms and conditions (STCs). Implementation ofthe waiver of retr\u00f4active eligibility may begin no sooner than April l,2019. Implementation of the AHCCCS Works (community engagement) program requirements may begin no sooner than January l, 2020. The state may deviate from Medicaid state plan requirements only to the extent those requirements have been listed as waived or as not applicable to expenditures or individuals covered by expenditure authority.Page 2 - Ms. Jami Snyder Obiectives of the Medicaid Proeram As noted above, the Secretary may approve a demonstration project under section I I l5 ofthe Act if, in his judgment, the project is likely to assist in promoting the objectives of title XIX. The purposes of Medicaid include an authorization ofappropriation offunds to \"enabl[e] each State, as far as practicable under the conditions in such State, to furnish (l) medical assistance on behalf of families with dependent children and ofaged, blind, or disabled individuals, whose income and resources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services, and (2) rehabilitation and other services to help such families and individuals attain or retain capability for independence or self-care.\" Act $ 1901. This provision makes clear that an impoftant objective ofthe Medicaid program is to furnish medical assistance and other services to vulnerable populations. But there is little intrinsic value in paying for serviges ifthose services are not advancing the health and wellness ofthe individual receiving them, or otherwise helping the individual attain independence. Therefore, we believe an objective of the Medicaid program, in addition to furnishing services, is to advance the health and wellness needs of its beneficiaries, and that it is appropriate for the state to structure its demonstration projeot in a manner that prioritizes meeting those needs. Section I I l5 demonstration projects present an opportunity for states to experiment with reforms that go beyond just routine medical care and focus on interventions that drive better health outcomes and quality of life improvements, and that may increase beneficiaries' financial independence. Such policies may include those designed to address certain health determinants and those that encourage beneficiaries to engage in health-promoting behaviors and to strengthen engagement by beneficiaries in their personal heallh care plans. These tests will necessarily mean a change to the status quo. They may have associated administrative costs, particularly at the initial stage, and section I I l5 acknowledges that demonstrations may \"result in an impact on eligibility, enrollment, benefits, cost-sharing, or fltnancing.\" Act $ 1115(dXl). But in the long term they may create incentives and opportunities that help enable many beneficiaries to enjoy the numerous personal benefits that come with improved health and financial independence. Section I I l5 demonstration projects also provide an oppo\u00c9unity for states to test policies that ensure the fiscal sustainability ofthe Medicaid program, better \"enabling each [s]tate, as far as practicable under the conditions in such [s]tate\" to fumish medical assistance, Act $ 1901, while making it more practicable for states to furnish medical assistance to a broader range of persons in need. For instance, measures designed to improve health and wellness may reduce the volume of seruices consumed, as healthier, more engaged beneficiaries tend to consume fewer medical services and are generally less costly to cover. Fufther, measures that have the effect ofhelping individuals secure employer-sponsored or other commercial coverage or otherwise transition from Medicaid eligibility may decrease the number ofindividuals who need financial assistance, including medical assistance, from the state. Such measures may enable states to stretch their resources further and enhance their ability to provide medical assistance to a broader range of personsinneed,includingbyexpandingtheservicesandpopulationstheycover.lBythesame I States have considerable flexibility in the design oftheir Medicaid programs, within federal guidelines. Ce\u00cdain benefits are mandatory under federal law, but many benefits may be provided at state option, such as prescription drug benefits, vision benefits, and dental benefits, Similarly, states have considerable latitude to determine whomPage 3 - Ms. Jami Snyder token, such measures may also preserve states' ability to continue to provide the optional services and coverage they already have in place. Our demonstration authority under section I I l5 ofthe Act allows us to offer states more flexibility to experiment with different ways of improving health outcomes and strengthening the financial independence of beneficiaries. Demonstration projects that seek to improve beneficiary health and financial independence improve the well-being of Medicaid beneficiaries and, at the same time, allow states to maintain the long-term fiscal sustainability of their Medicaid programs and to provide more medical services to more Medicaid beneficiaries. Accordingly, such demonstration projects advance the objectives ofthe Medicaid program. Background on Medicaid Coveraee in Arizona The current AHCCCS section I I l5 demonstration project was implemented by the state of Arizona (\"state\") in 2011, and built on the state's original AHCCCS demonstration implemented in 1982. The state administers the delivery of Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) services (including acute care; long term services and supports; home and community-based services (HCBS); and including both mandatory and optional state plan services) to mandatory and optional state plan coverage groups (described in STC l6) through this AHCCCS demonstration. Arizona provides coverage to some non-mandatory populations through expenditure authority under the AHCCCS demonstration, such as certain groups of beneficiaries receiving HCBS. The state also covers some non-mandatory benefits through expenditure authority under the AHCCCS demonstration, including dental for those in the long term care system. On January l, 2014, Arizona amended its state plan to include non-mandatory coverage ofthe new adult group (also known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) expansion population) described at section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIll) of the Act. Extent and Scone of the Demonstration Amendments With approval of these demonstration amendments, Arizona will, beginning no sooner than January l, 2020, require, as a condition ofeligibility, that non-exempt beneficiaries in the new adult group at section 1902(a)(1O)(A)(i)(VIII) ofthe Act, ages 19 through 49, engage in qualifying community engagement activities for at least 80 hours per month, and reporl monthly that they are meeting the community engagement requirements. Beneficiaries who successfully complete and report compliance on a monthly basis will have no disruption in coverage. Arizona will provide a three month grace period for individuals to meet the community engagement requirements once determined otherwise eligible. If a beneficiary does not fully comply with the their Medicaid programs will coyer. Certain eligibility groups must be coveted under a state's prog\u00a1am, but many states opt to cover additional eligibility groups that are optional under the Medicaid statute. The optional groups include a new, non-elderly adult population (ACA expansion population) that was added to the Act at section 1902(aX1o)(AXiXVIII) by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). Coverage ofthe ACA expansion population became optional as a \u00a1esult ofthe Supreme Court's decision in NFIB u Sebelius,567 U.5.519 (2012). Accordingly, several months after the NFIB decision was issued, CMS informed the states that they \"have flexibility to start or stop the expansion.\" CMS, Frequenlly Asked Suesl\u00a1ons on Exchqnge; Market Refotms, and Med\u00a1cqid at I I (Dec. 10, 2012). In addition to expanding Medicaid coverage by covering optional eligibility groups and benefits beyond what the Medicaid statute requires, many states also choose to cover benefits bcyond what is authorized by statute by using expenditure authority under section I115(aX2) ofthe Act. For examplo, recently, many states have been relying on this authority to expand the scope ofservices they offer to address substance use disorders beyond what the statute explicitly authorizes.Page 4 - Ms. Jami Snyder community engagement requirements, including failure to report compliance for any month after the three month grace period, the state will suspend the beneficiary's eligibility for two months. Beneficiaries with suspended eligibility will have their eligibility reactivated immediately after the end ofthe two-month suspension as long as they continue to meet all other eligibility criteria. Beneficiaries in suspension status may have their eligibility reinstated earlier if it is determined that a beneficiary qualifies for another category of Medicaid eligibility that is not subject to the community engagement requirements or is currently exempt from the requirements. Beneficiaries can comply with the community engagement requirements by participating in a number of activities, such as employment (including self-employment); employment readiness activities, which include less than full-time education, job or life skills training, and health education classes; job search activities; or community service. Under the state's program, certain beneficiaries will be exempt from the community engagement requirements. CMS is giving the state flexibility to exempt from the community engagement requirements beneficiaries whom the state believes \u00e2re particularly vulnerable or whose circumstances could make it unreasonably diff\u00cccult or impossible to participate in qualifying activities. This includes: pregnant women and women up to the end ofthe month in which the 60th day of post-pregnancy occurs; former foster youth up to age 26; beneficiaries with a serious mental illness (SMI); beneficiaries receiving temporary or permanent long-term disability benefits; beneficiaries who are medically frail; beneficiaries who are in active treatment with respect to a substance use disorder (SUD); full time high school, trade school, college, or graduate students; victims of domestic violence; beneficiaries who are homeless; designated caretakers ofa child under age l8 or of a child who is 1 8 and is a full-time student in high school or trade school and is expected to graduate before he/she turns l9 (limit one caretaker per child); caregivers who are responsible for the care ofan individual with a disability; beneficiaries with an acute medical condition (physical and/or behavioral) that would prevent them from complying with the requirements; and beneficiaries with a disability as defined by federal disabilities rights laws who are unable to comply with the requirements for disability-related reasons. The state's program would also exempt benef,tciaries who already participate in programs that incentivize community engagement, including those receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Cash Assistance, or Unemployment Insurance income benefits; and beneficiaries participating in other AHCCCS approved work programs. Third, and finally, the state requested an exemption for all American Indian/Alaska Native beneficiaries. CMS is approving an exemption from the AHCCCS Works requirements for beneficiaries who are members of federally recognized tribes. We believe this narrower exemption is consistent with the unique status oftribal governments. AHCCCS will provide reasonable modifications for beneficiaries with disabilities who are not otherwise exempt and who need such modifications. In addition, the state will provide written notices, including information on resources available to beneficiaries who may require assistance completing the community engagement activities. AHCCCS Works will test whether the implementation of the AHCCCS Works requirements will enhance programmatic fiscal sustainability and lead to improved health outcomes and greater independence throughPage 5 - Ms. Jami Snyder participation in qualifying activities that empower members to gain and maintain meaningful employment. CMS is also approving an amendment to the AHCCCS demonstration that will give the state new flexibility in administering its demonstration program, and better enable it to furnish medical assistance in a manner that is cost-effective and sustainable. The waiver authority that CMS is approving wilt permit Arizona to grant eligibility to AHCCCS beneficiaries beginning the month they submit an application, and to waive the three month retroactive eligibility period. The following populations are exempt from the waiver ofretroactive eligibility: pregnant women; women who are 60 days or less postpartum; infants under age l;and children under age t9. Arizona previously had authority to waive retroactive eligibility from January 18, 2001 , through December 31,2013. During that time period the waiver applied to all Medicaid beneficiaries in Arizona. From 20ll through 2013, the waiver of retroactive eligibility was part ofthe state's demonstration to provide health care services through a prepaid, capitated managed care delivery model, and it applied to all Medicaid beneficiaries. The goal of that demonstration was to test health care delivery systems to provide organized and coordinated health care for both acute and long term care. Under this amendment, beginning no sooner than April l, 2019, Arizona will test whether waiving retroactive coverage for certain groups of Medicaid beneficiaries encourages them to obtain and maintain health coverage, even when healthy, or to obtain health coverage as soon as possible after becoming eligible (e.g., ifeligibility depends on a finding ofdisability or a certain diagnosis). The state will evaluate for the first time whether the new policy increases continuity ofcare by reducing gaps in coverage that can occur when beneficiaries churn on and off Medicaid or sign up for Medicaid only when sick, and facilitates receipt ofpreventive services when beneficiaries are healthy. In circumstances where Medicaid eligibility depends upon a finding ofdisability or a certain diagnosis (e.g., ofbreast or cervical cancer), the state will evaluate whether the policy encourages beneficiaries to apply for Medicaid (including through an application for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) in the case that an SSI determination also provides a Medicaid eligibility determination) as soon as possible after the relevant finding or diagnosis. For example, for those who are aged, blind, or disabled, or who may need long-term services and supports through Medicaid, the state will evaluate whether the policy encourages beneficiaries to apply for Medicaid expeditiously when they believe they meet the criteria for eligibility, to ensure primary or secondary coverage through Medicaid in case the need for services arises. By waiving retroactive eligibility for beneficiaries enrolled in AHCCCS (with exceptions for pregnant women, women who are 60 days or less postpartum, infants under age l, and children under age 19), the demonstration will test in a new way the efficacy ofmeasures that are designed to encourage eligible individuals to enroll as soon as possible, and, for certain populations, that are designed to encourage eligible individuals to maintain health coverage even while healthy. This feature ofthe demonstration is designed to encourage enrollment as soon as possible, to facilitate receipt ofpreventive care and other needed services, and to conserve Medicaid resources, with the ultimate objective of improving beneficiary health and better enabling Arizona, as far as practicable under the conditions in the state, to furnish medical assistance. Act $ 1901.Page 6 - Ms. Jami Snyder The state will also evaluate the financial impacts of the waiver of retroactive eligibility. The state expects that the new waiver authority will enable the state to better contain Medicaid costs and more efficiently focus resources on providing accessible and high quality health coverage, thereby promoting the sustainability of its Medicaid program. As described in the amended STCs, if monitoring or evaluation data indicate that demonstration features are not likely to assist in promoting the objectives of Medicaid, CMS reserves tle right to require t\u00a1e state to submit a corrective action plan to CMS for approval. Further, CMS reserves the right to withdraw waivers or expenditure authorities at any time it determines that continuing the waivers or expenditure authorities would no longer be in the public interest or promote the objectives of Medicaid. To increase awareness ofthe new waiver authority and promote the objectives of the Medicaid program (e.g., continuity ofcoverage and care), Arizona will provide outreach and education about how to apply for and receive Medicaid coverage to the public, cunent beneficiaries, and providers who serve vulnerable populations that may be impacted by this change, such as those providing nursing facility or other long-term services a\u00a1d supports. This will help ensure that eligible individuals apply for and receive Medicaid coverage in a timely manner, as well as ensure that providers understand how to assist individuals in gaining coverage. The state will employ an outreach strategy in which materials will be made available through various methods such as mailings and on the state's Medicaid website. The state has a hospital presumptive eligibility strategy under which qualified hospitals provide immediate, temporary enrollment into Medicaid until a Medicaid application is submitted. CMS is not approving Arizona's request to implement a five-year maximum lifetime limit for beneficiaries subject to, but who fail to comply with, the community engagement requirements. Instead, Arizona will impose a two-month eligibility suspension when beneficiaries fail to comply with community engagement requirements, which is expected to incentivize beneficiaries to participate in community engagement activities and take greater responsibility for their health and well-being. Separately, the state expects this requirement to support a pathway out of poverty. CMS is unable to approve Arizona's request for demonstration expenditure authority at the medical assistance matching rate for the costs associated with the design, development, installation, operation, and administration of systems necessary to implement AHCCCS Works community engagement programs and activities. However, CMS can provide technical assistance if the state would be interested in leaming whether costs to update state systems to reflect this approval may be federally matchable at the rates applicable to state expenditures on mechanized claims processing and information retrieval systems, or at the rate applicable to state administrative expenditures.PageT - Ms. Jami Snyder Determination that the demonstration proiect is likelv to assist in nromotins Medicaid's obiectives For re\u00e0sons discussed below, the Secretary has determined that AHCCCS, as amended, is likely to assist in promoting the objectives of the Medicaid program. The demonstration promotes beneficiary health and financial independence. With approval of the amendments, Arizona and CMS will be able to evaluate the effectiveness of policies that are designed to promote the health and financial independence of Medicaid beneficiaries. Promoting beneficiary health and independence advances the objectives ofthe Medicaid program; indeed, in 2012, HHS specifically encouraged states to develop demonstration projects \"aimed at promoting healthy behaviors\" and \"individual ownership in health care decisions\" as well as \"accountability tied to improvement in health outcomes.\"2 AHCCCS Works' community engagement requirement is designed to encourage beneficiaries to obtain employment and/or undertake other community engagement activities that may lead to improved health and wellness. It is also likely to promote the objective of helping beneficiaries attain or retain financial independence. The community engagement provisions generally require AHCCCS Works beneficiaries to work, look for work, or engage in activities that enhance their employability, such asjob-skills training, education, and community service. The demonstration amendment will help the state and CMS evaluate whether the community engagement requirement helps adults in AHCCCS Works transition from Medicaid to financial independence, thus reducing dependency on public assistance. CMS rejected a prior Arizona proposal to require that certain AHCCCS beneficiaries participate in work or other community engagement activities because it determined that the proposal would not promote Medicaid statutory objectives.3 However, given the potential benefits of work and other forms of community engagement, we now believe that state Medicaid programs should be able to design and test incentives for beneficiary compliance with community engagement requirements. Similarly, the waiver of retroactive eligibility, subject to specified exceptions, is also designed to promote improved continuity ofcoverage by discouraging gaps in coverage that can occur when beneficiaries churn on and off Medicaid or sign up for Medicaid only when sick, and by encouraging the receipt of preventive health services when beneficiaries are healthy. If eligible individuals who are able to enroll when healthy wait until they are sick to enroll in Medicaid, they may be less likely to obtain preventive services during periods when they are not enrolled due to out-of-pocket costs, potentially resulting in worse health outcomes. In circumstances where Medicaid eligibility depends upon a finding ofdisability or a certain diagnosis (e.g., of breast or cervical cancer), the state will evaluate whether the policy encourages beneficiaries to 2 CMS, Frequentlt Asked Questions on Exchanges, Market Re\u00ferms, and Medicaid at 15 (Dec. 10, 2012) (noting also that \"states have considerable flexibility under ... [existing] law to design benefits for the new adult group and to impose cost-sharing, particularly for those individuals above 100% ofthe federal I 2.\u00dedt-. approval letter 8 - Ms. Jami Snyder apply for Medicaid (including through an application for SSI in the case that an SSI determination also provides a Medicaid eligibility determination) as soon as possible after the relevant finding or diagnosis. For example, for those who are aged, blind, or disabled, or who may need long-term services and supports through Medicaid, the state will evaluate whether the policy encourages beneficiaries to apply for Medicaid expeditiously when they believe they meet the criteria for eligibitity, to ensure primary or secondary coverage through Medicaid in case the need for services arises. CMS is requiring the state's evaluation design to inolude hypotheses on the effects ofthe waiver on enrollment and eligibility continuity (inctuding for different subgroups of individuals, such as individuals who are healthy, individuals with complex medical needs, prospective applicants, and existing beneficiaries in different care settings, including long- term care), as well as the effects ofthe demonstration amendment on health outcomes and the financial impact ofthe demonstration amendment (for example, an assessment of medical debt and uncompensated care costs). The demonstration will furnish medical assistance in a manner that improves the sustainability of the safety net. CMS has determined that AHCCCS, as amended, is likely to promote the objective of fumishing medical assistance because it provides coverage beyond what Arizona is required to provide. Under AHCCCS, the state provides medical assistance to populations, including certain groups ofbeneficiaries receiving HCBS, whose coverage is not mandated in statute, as well as benefits, including dental for those in long term care, which are not mandated in statute. The AHCCCS Works community engagement requirements may impact overall coverage levels if the individuals subject to this demonstration provision choose not to comply with it. However, the demonstration as a whole is expected to further the Medicaid program's objectives to allow states to experiment with innovative means of deploying their limited state resources in ways that may allow them to provide services beyond the statutory minimum. Enhancing fiscal sustainability allows the state to provide services to Medicaid beneficiaries that it could not otherwise provide. The waiver of retroactive eligibility is also expected to enable the state to better contain Medicaid costs and more efficiently focus resources on providing accessible and high-quality health coverage, thereby promoting the sustainability of its Medicaid program. By incentivizing community engagement and preventive care, as described above, AHCCCS, as amended, is also designed to lead to higher quality care at a sustainable cost. Promoting improved health and wellness ultimately helps to keep health care costs at sustainable levels. To the extent that the amendments help individuals achieve improved health and f\u00ecnancial independence, the amended demonstration may make these individuals less costly for Arizona to care for, thus further advancing the objeotives ofthe Medicaid program by helping Arizona stretch its limited Medicaid resources, ensure the long-term f\u00ecscal sustainability ofthe program, and ensure that the health care safety net is available to those Arizona residents who need it most. And, to the extent the community engagement requirement helps individuals achieve financial independence and transition to commercial coverage, the amended demonstration would enhance the state's ability to provide medical services to those who most need the safety net.Page 9 - Ms. Jami Snyder While CMS and the state are testing the effectiveness of incentive structures that attach penalties for failure to meet community engagement requirements, the program is designed to make compliance \u00a1vith these requirements achievable. Arizona has taken steps to include adequate beneficiary protections to ensure that the demonstration's community engagement requirements apply only to those beneficiaries who can reasonably be expected to meet them, to notify beneficiaries oftheir responsibilities, and to automatically reactivate Medicaid coverage following a suspension period. Any individual whose eligibitity is suspended for failure to meet the requirements will have the right to appeal the state's decision consistent with all existing statutory and regulatory appeal and fair hearing protections. Beneficiaries whose eligibility has been suspended for failure to meet community engagement requirements will have their eligibility automatically reactivated at the expiration ofthe suspension period as long as they meet all other eligibility criteria, and eligibility could be reactivated sooner if the state becomes aware that the beneficiary is no longer subject to the AHCCCS Works requirements. Furthermore, the incentives to meet the requirements, if effective, may result in individuals becoming ineligible because they have attained financial independence - a positive result for the individual. As described in the STCs, if monitoring or evaluation data indicates that demonstration features are not likely to assist in promoting the objectives of Medicaid, CMS reserves the right to require the state to submit a corrective action plan to CMS for approval. Further, CMS reserves the right to withdraw waivers or expenditure authorities at any time it determines that continuing the waivers or expenditure authorities would no longer be in the beneficiaries' interest or promote the objectives of Medicaid. Consideration of Public Comments To increase the transparency of demonstration projects, section I I l5(dX1) and (2) ofthe Act direct the Secretary to issue regulations providing for two periods ofpublic comment on a state's application for a section 1 1 l5 project that would result in an impact on eligibility, enrollment, benefits, cost-sharing, or financing. The f\u00ecrst comment period occurs at the state level before submission ofthe section I I l5 application and the second occurs at the federal level after the application is received by the Secretary. Section I 115(dX2XA) and (C) ofthe Act further specify that comment periods should be \"sufficient to ensure a m\u00eaaningful level of public input,\" but the statute imposes no additional requirement on the states or the Secretary to address those comments, as might otherwise be required under a general rulemaking. Accordingly, the implementing regulations issued in 2012 provide that CMS will review and consider all comments received by the deadline, but will not provide written responses to public comments.a CMS received 126 comments during the federal comment period on the AHCCCS Works amendment and 60 comments during the federal comment period on the waiver of retroactive eligibility amendment. Although CMS is not legally required to provide written responses to 4 42 CFR $ 431.416(d)(2); see also Medicaid Program; Review and Approval Process for Section 'l I l5 Demonstrations; Application, Review, and Reporting Process for Waivers for State Innovation; Final Rules, 77 Fed. Reg. I1678, 11685 (Feb.27,2012) (final rule).Page l0 - Ms. Jami Snyder comments, CMS is addressing some of the central issues raised by the comments and summarizing CMS's analysis ofthose issues for the benefit ofstakeholders. After oarefully reviewing the public comments submitted, CMS has concluded that AHCCCS, as amended, is likely to promote the objectives of Medicaid. General comments The majority of the comments CMS received opposed either the amendments as a whole or certain features of them.. Many ofthose comments expressed general concerns that the amendments will negatively impact beneficiaries and will result in many poor citizens losing Medicaid. CMS shares the commenters' concern that everyone who needs Medicaid and meets programmatic eligibility criteria should have access to it. As previously stated, however, CMS believes the features of this demonstration are wofth testing to determine whether there is a more effective way to furnish medical assistance to the extent practicable under the conditions in Arizona. That is why CMS has carefully reviewed the amended demonstration as a whole to ensure it is likely to promote sometimes competing Medicaid objectives. Specifically, the amended demonstration is designed to improve health outcomes and reduce dependency on public assistance by incentivizing healthy behaviors (community engagement activities) and giving beneficiaries the choice either to engage in those behaviors or to stop participating in Medicaid. CMS has worked together with Arizona to include guardrails that will protect beneficiaries. These guardrails, which are contained in a set ofassurances in the STCs (described in STC 38), include requirements that the state: screen beneficiaries and detemine eligibility for other categories of Medicaid eligibility prior to a suspension, review for eligibility for insurance affordability programs prior to a suspension, piovide full appeal rights prior to suspension, and maintain a system that provides reasonable modifications related to meeting the community engagement requirements to beneficiaries with disabilities, among other assurances. The STCs include a provision granting CMS the authority to discontinue the demonstration if the agency determines that it is not promoting Medicaid's objectives. Moreover, CMS will regularly monitor AHCCCS Works and will work with the state to resolve any issues that arise as Arizona works to implement the demonstration amendment. Some comments argued that a demonstration cannot advance the Medicaid program's objectives if the project is expected to reduce Medicaid enrollment or Medicaid spending. We recognize that some individuals may choose not to comply with the community engagement requirements imposed by the AHCCCS Works program, and therefore may lose coverage, as may occur when individuals fail to comply with other requirements like participating in the redetermination process. Butthe goal ofthis policy is to incentivize compliance, not reduce coverage. Indeed, CMS has incorporated safeguards into the STCs intended to minimize coverage loss due to noncompliance, and CMS is committed to partnering with Arizona to ensure that the. demonstration advances the objectives of Medicaid. Furthermore, we anticipate that some beneficiaries' income will increase above the Medicaid eligibitity threshold as a result ofthe community engagement incentives, and that they will obtain employer-sponsored coverage or other commercial coverage once they no longer qualify for the Medicaid program. Finally, we note that in some cases, reductions in Medicaid costs can further the Medicaid program's objectives, such as when the reductions stem from reduced need for the safety net or reducedPage ll - Ms.Jami Snyder costs associated with healthier, more independent beneficiaries. These outcomes promote the best interests ofthe beneficiaries whose health and independence are improved, while also helping states stretch limited Medicaid resources and ensure the long-term fiscal sustainability of the states' Medicaid programs. As noted above, section 11 15 ofthe Act explicitly contemplates that demonstrations may \"result in an impact on eligibility\"; furthermore, the amended demonstration as a whole is expected to provide greater access to coverage for low-income individuals than would be available absent the demonstration. Other comments predicted that the amendments will fail to achieve their intended effects. For instance, some comments argued that beneficiaries subject to the community engagement requirement will be unable to comply. To some extent, these comments reflect a misunderstanding of the nature of the community engagement requirement, which the commenters described as a work requirement. In fact, the community engagement requirement is designed to help beneficiaries achieve success, and CMS and Arizona have made every effort to devise a requirement that beneficiaries should be able to meet. For example, the community engagement requirement may be satisfied through an array ofactivities, including employment, employment readiness activities (including education, job skills training, life skills training, and health education classes), job search activities, and community service. More generally, these comments reflect a misunderstanding ofthe nature of a demonstration project. It is not necessary for a state to show in advance that a proposed demonstration will in fact achieve pafticular outcomes; the purpose ofa demonstration is to test hypotheses and develop data that may inform future decision-making, As HHS previously explained, demonstrations can \"influence policy making at the [s]tate and Federal level, by testing new approaches that can be models for programmatic changes nationwide or in other [s]tates.\" 77 Fed. Reg. at I I 680. For example, the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) work requirements that Congress enacted in 1996 were informed by prior demonstration projects. See, e.g., Aguayo v. Richardson,4T3 F.2d 1090 (2d Cir.1973) (upholding a section 1115 demonstration project that imposed employment requirements as conditions of AFDC etigibility). Regardless ofthe degree to which Arizona's demonstration project succeeds in achieving the desired results, the information it yields will provide policymakers real-world data on the efficacy ofsuch policies. That in itself promotes the objectives ofthe Medicaid statute. Comments addressing coverage losses Some commenters expressed concern that the state's requested changes to the demonstration will cause some individuals to lose Medicaid coverage, and for that reason, the demonstration cannot be considered consistent with the objectives of the Medicaid program. In its December 2017 amendment submission to CMS, Arizona noted that as of October 2017, there were 398,519 individuals enrolled in the new adult group. Of these, the state estimated that 137,755 would fall into one of three groups that the state requested to exempt from the AHCCCS Works requirements (those groups included American Indians, individuals determined to have a serious mental illness, and individuals who are at least 55 years old) and therefore would not potentially be subject to the AHCCCS Works requirements. The state estimated that 269,507 beneficiaries would not fall into the three above-mentioned exemption groups, but some unknown number of those 269,507 beneficiaries \\\u00a1,/ere expected to fall into other proposed AHCCCS WorksPage 12 - Ms. Jami Snyder exemption categories. The remaining individuals were expected to be subject to the AHCCCS Works requirements, although an unknown number ofthese beneficiaries were expected to be already employed or engaged in activities that satisfy the community engagement requirements. CMS made several changes to the proposed demonstration at approval, including changes to the exemptions and additional beneficiary guardrails expected to help beneficiaries maintain enrollment (including the disapproval ofthe state's request for a flve-year m\u00e2ximum lifetime limit for individuals subject to AHCCCS Works if they did not meet the requirements). Under the approved amendments to the demonstration, beneficiaries who.are noncompliant with the AHCCCS Works requirements after the three month grace period are subject to a two month suspension ofcoverage, not a termination ofeligibility, and there is no lifetime limit on coverage. The state provided estimates for annual changes in enrollment, although CMS recognizes that it is extremely difficult, if not impossible to predict the percentage of non-exempt beneficiaries who might not comply with the community ongagement requirements, because to do so, the state must estimate how beneficiaries will respond to new incentives and eligibility requirements. While some beneficiaries may respond to the new AHCCCS Works requirements by choosing not to comply and forgoing coverage, the goal is for everyone participating in the program to successfully complete its requirements. That said, otherwise potentially eligibte Medicaid beneficiaries lose coverage today for many reasons where they have failed to comply with program requirements. We also note that Arizona provides coverage to individuals in the new adult group (described at section 1902(a)( IOXAXiXVIII) of the Act) that it is not required to cover. Any potential loss of coverage that may result from a demonstration amendment is properly considered in the context ofa state's substantial discretion to eliminate non-mandatory benefits or to eliminate coverage for existing (but non-mandatory) populations, such as (in light of the Supreme Court's ruling in NFIB v. Sebelius) the ACA adult expansion population. As of October 2017, more than 398,000 individuals received medical assistance under the Arizona state plan and through the AHCCCS demonstration as a result of Arizona's decision to participate in the ACA adult eligibility expansion. Moreover, conditioning eligibility for Medicaid coverage on compliance with cert\u00e2in measures is an important element ofthe state's efforts, through experimentation, to improve beneficiaries' health and independence and enhance programmatic sustainability' To create an effective incentive for beneficiaries to take measures that promote health and independence, it may be necessary for states to attach penalties to failure to take those measures, including with conditions designed to promote health and financial independence. This may mean that benpficiaries who fail to comply will lose Medicaid coverage, at least temporarily. However, the inc\u00e9ntive included in AHCCCS Works is not designed to encourage this result; rather, it is intended to incorporate achievable conditions ofcontinued coverage. And any loss ofcoverage as the result ofnoncompliance must be weighed against the benefits Arizona hopes to achieve through the demonstration project, including both the improved health and independence ofthe beneficiaries who oomply and the state's enhanced ability to stretch its Medicaid resources and maintain the fiscal sustainability of the program. It would be counterproductive to deny states the flexibility they need to implement demonstration projects designed to examine innovative ways to incentivize beneficiaries to engage in behaviors that improve health outcomes and lower healthcare costs, as well as innovative ways to stretch limited state resources, given that states have the prerogative toPage 13 - Ms. Jami Snyder terminate coverage for non-mandatory seruices and populations. Because a demonstration project, by its nature, is designed to test innovations, it is not possible to know in advance the actual impact that its policies will have on enrollment. That is one ofthe metrics to be measured Furthermore, the Arizona Medicaid program covers other non-mandatory populations such as certain groups of beneficiaries receiving HCBS, as well as non-mandatory services such as dental for those in the long term care system. As a matter of federal law, it is a state's prerogative to reduce or eliminate non-mandatory coverage. Such judgments are left to the policy preferences ofthe state government and its electorate, and states are to be given great latitude in making tradeoffs in how the state furnishes medical assistance \"as far as practicable under the conditions\" in the state. Act$ 1901. In evaluating Arizona's demonstration project, it is appropriate to consider the possibility of coverage loss against the benefits that may accrue to the beneficiaries subject to the AHCCCS Works requirements, as well as benefits that may accrue to the state's other Medicaid eligibility groups as a result of the beneltciaries who are subject to the AHCCCS Works requirements growing more independent, healthier, and less expensive to cover. Moreover, as noted above, the risk of coverage loss that some commenters attributed to this amendment is attenuated based on additional safeguards made to the approved AHCCCS Works program. Arizona will measure actual effects on enrollment as part of the demonstration amendment, and that information should be useful in informing future Medicaid policy. Commenters also expressed concerns that the AHCCCS Works reporting requirements will cause beneficiaries' Medicaid coverage to be suspended because of failure to report their community engagement hours or because of clerical errors by Arizona's Medicaid agency. We note that beneficiaries will be screened for other bases of Medicaid eligibility and for insurance affordability programs prior to having their Medicaid coverage suspended, and that the beneficiary's Medicaid eligibility will be automatically reactivated following the two-month suspension period. CMS has worked closely with Arizona to ensure there are substantial beneficiary protections in place. The STCs provide for Arizona to educate and reach out to beneficiaries and contain assurances that Arizona will seek data from other sources, including SNAP, TANF, and other existing systems to permit beneficiaries to efficiently report community engagement hours or obtain an exemption. Clerical errors can occur in any program and are not reason to deny approval at the outset. Moreover, CMS will monitor the demonstration, and the STCs provide that CMS can withdraw waivers or expenditure authorities if it determines that continuing them would no longer be in the public interest or promote Medicaid's objectives. Comments addressing proposal completeness Commenters expressed concern that the state did not include in its notice to the publio estimates for how the AHCCCS Works amendment would affect enrollment for the new adult group, and argued that these estimates are essential for making valid budget neutrality conclusions. One commenter also raised concerns that the lack of this level ofdetail means that the state's submission did not satisfy the requirements for a complete amendment application as contained in the state's approved STCs.s The proposed AHCCCS Works amendment that the state 5 STC 7(a) ofthe AHCCCS STCs approved on December Notice 42 CFR Section 431 .40E and Tribal Consultation. The state must provide documentation ofthe state's compliance withPage l4 - Ms. Jami Snyder submitted to CMS included in an appendix the state's abbreviated notice as described in 42 CFR g a3l.a0S(aX2Xii). The state's abbreviated notice provided a link to a state web site where the public could find the state's full public notice. The full state publio notice included budget neutrality worksheets with enrollment projections reflecting the estimated number of covered beneficiary member months for each year of the demonstration through 2021. The state estimated that enrollment in the new adult group would be the same with or without the demonstration, and was unable to estimate the extent to which individuals might lose coverage due to noncompliance with the community engagement requirement-an effect that, as discussed above, is particularly challenging to predict. Additionally, as discussed above, the state's proposed AHCCCS Works amendment submitted to CMS in December 2017 included information on the number of individuals enrolled in the new adult group as ofOctober 2017 (398,519) as well as the number of individuals the state identified as being subject to the AHCCCS Works community engagement requirements (269,507) aft\u00f8r accounting for the number of individuals the state could identify as being part ofthree of its requested exemption populations, as described in the proposal (American Indians, individuals det\u00ecrmined to h\u00e3ve a ieiious mental illness, and individuals who are at least 55 years old),6 The state acknowledged that it did not collect data on some of its proposed AHCCCS Works exemption categories and therefore assumed that the number ofexempt individuals might be higher than what the state could estimate. Some of the assumptions underlying the state's original estimates no longer hold. For example, under the state's original proposal, some beneficiaries would have been subject to a five-year lifetime limit (a limi\u00f8tion that, as noted above, CMS is not approving). Furthermore, precise enrollment projections may not be possible where a state must estimate how beneficiaries will respond to new incentives and eligibility requirements. For example, due to the untested nature ofthe proposed community engagement requirements, it is unlikely that the state would have been able to accurately predict the number of beneficiaries that would participate or not participate in community engagement activities. Nonetheless, we believe that the state's estimate provided sufficient information for us to assess how many beneficiaries may be impacted by the AHCCCS Works proposal and to satisfy the requirements for a complete amendment application. Comments addressing individual demonstration features The community engagement requirement, AHCCCS llorks The majority of the public comments expressed general disagreement with efforts to implement a community engagement requirement. Some commenters expressed concerns that the community engagement rgquirement would be burdensome on families or create barriers to coverage' To address commenters' concerns, the list of exemptions was expanded to allow consideration for families with dependent children or beneficiaries who provide care for other dependents. Arizona also accepted stakeholder feedback and expanded the list ofqualifying activities available in order to comply with AHCCCS Works. Arizona will provide beneficiary outreach and education on how to comply with the new community engagement requirements, including, public notice process as specified in 42 CFR section 431.40E and documentation that the tribal consultation requirements outlined in paragraph l5 have been met.\" 6 CMS notes that the numbers provided by the state in its application on this point do not completely align, however, we believe that the misalignment was not sufficient to impact our analysisPage 15 - Ms. Jami Snyder but not limited to, how to report compliance with community engagement requirements and how to attest to the need for an exemption. Arizona also provides beneficiaries with the opportunity to avoid the consequences for failure to comply with the requirement by demonstrating that they had a good cause not to meet it. Commenters also expressed concern that there are not enough jobs in all locations for all beneficiaries subject to AHCCCS Works requirements. The state assures that it will assess areas within the state that experience high rates of unemployment, areas with limited economies and/or educational opportunities, and areas with lack of public transportation to determine whether there should be further exemptions from the community engagement requirements and/or additional mitigation strategies, so that the community engagement requirements will not be unreasonably burdensome for beneficiaries to meet. Some commenters noted that most Medicaid benef\u00ecciaries are already working. CMS acknowledges that many benef\u00ecciaries are already working or attending school; therefore, those activities are included as qualifying activities that meet the community engagement requirement' CMS notes that the approved terms and conditions provide that a beneficiary may be deemed in compliance with the AHCCCS Works requirements if he or she receives earned income that is consistent with b\u00e9ing employed or self-employed for at least 80 hours per month at the state minimum wage. In order to determine whether community engagement requirements adequately incentivize individuals to work as a condition of receiving Medicaid, the state will be required to track new employment among Medicaid beneficiaries. Many oommenters indicated that many beneficiaries not qualifying for Medicaid on the basis of disability may still have difficulty gaining and maintaining employment due to their medical or behavioral health conditions. To mitigate these concerns, Arizona assures that it will provide beneficiaries with disabilities protected by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, Section 504 ofthe Rehabilitation Act of 1973, or Section 1557 ofthe ACA with reasonable modifications, which could include the reduction of, or exemption from, community engagement requirements. Arizona will also provide exemptions for various groups, including beneficiaries determined to have a serious mental illness, beneficiaries who are medically frail, and beneficiaries who have an acute medical condition (physical and/or behavioral) that would prevent them from complying with the requirements. When considered overall, CMS believes that the amended demonstration adequately protects beneficiaries with circumstances which could prevent them from meeting the community engagement requirements. Where beneficiaries subject to the AHCCCS Works requirements are capable of satisfying them, CMS believes that including these individuals advances the purposes of Medicaid by improving beneficiary health and financial independence and enhancing the program's fiscal sustainabitity. While some of the aotivities that meet the community engagement requirement may not immediately cause all beneficiaries to be financially independent, those activities are nonetheless positive steps for beneficiaries to take on their path to financial independence. In addition, participation in these activities may reduce social isolation, which multiple studies have linked to higher rates of mortality.T At the very least, 7 Julianne Holt-Lun stad, Psychol. (2015).Page 16 - Ms. Jami Snyder whether AHCCCS',s community engagement requirements will lead to beneficiaries' finanoial independence is an open question, which is why this demonstration project is necessary to test whether the incentive structure will have the desired effect. That is also why CMS will regularly evaluate the effects ofAHCCCS Works on affected beneficiaries and reserves the right to discontinue specific waiver and expenditure authorities if CMS determines that it would no longer be in the public interest or promote Medicaid's objectives to continue them. Moreover, even if those activities do not cause beneficiaries to become financially independent, they are nevertheless correlated with improved health outcomes, which itself furthers Medicaid's objectives. Other commenters expressed concerns that the administration ofthe community engagement requirement would be burdensome and costly to the state. Although such measures may have associated administrative costs, particularly at the initial stage, in the long term they may help enable beneficiaries to enjoy the many personal benefits that come with improved health outcomes and increased financial independence AHCCCS Worlrs exemption.\u00fer members of federally recognized tribes CMS received a few comments supporting the state's request to exempt American Indians from the AHCCCS Works program, and other comments discussed the proposed exemption in the context of legal considerations. CMS is approving an exemption from the AHCCCS Works requirements for beneficiaries who are members of federally recognized tribes. We believe that this exemption is consistent with the unique status of tribal governments. Iryaiver of Retroactive Eligibility Commenters on the waiver of retroactive eligibility expressed concern that the waiver could increase uncompensated care costs for hospitals, skilled nursing facilities and other health care providers. Several commenters expressed concern that the waiver of retroactive eligibility will shift health care costs to beneficiaries and providers, increasing out-of-pocket spending and medical bankruptcies, and will lead to potential disruptions in care for individuals with complex medical conditions. CMS has taken these comments into consideration as part of its approval and will require the state to carefully evaluate how the waiver of retroactive etigibility is affecting: beneficiaries and providers; enrollment and eligibility continuity; health outcomes; and the financial impact. CMS will not permit the state to waive retroactive eligibility for pregnant women, for women who are 60 days or less postpartum, for infants under age 1, or for chi\u00ecdren under age 19. The state and CMS agree that it is essential to ensure potential recipients understand the importance ofapplying for AHCCCS timely and for providers and stakeholders who help individuals enroll in AHCCCS to update their business practices and information to help ensure individuals apply at the earliest opportunity. To increase awareness ofthis waiver authority and help ensure that it promotes the objectives ofthe Medicaid program as intended, Arizona will provide outreach and education to the public and to providers about how to apply for and receive Medicaid coverage. The state also has a hospital presumptive eligibility strategy under which qualified hospitals provide immediate, temporary enrollment into Medicaid until aPage 17 - Ms. Jami Snyder Medicaid application is submitted, which may help mitigate these concerns. Additionally, if there were a delay in processing a beneficiary's application, the beneficiary would still receive coverage beginning on the first day ofthe month in which the application was filed. Providing coverage back to the beginning ofthe month in which the application was filed will ensure that beneficiaries are not unintentionally penalized ifapplication processing is delayed by no fault of the beneficiary. Some commenters asserted that there is no experimental purpose associated with the waiver of retroactive eligibility. However, even though Arizona previously had a waiver of retroactive eligibility, this amendment is designed to test a new hypothesis: whether eliminating retroactive eligibility will encourage eligible individuals to enroll as soon as possible, and, for certain populations, whether eligible individuals are encouraged to obtain and maintain health coverage even while healthy. The state will evaluate for the ftrst time whether the new policy increases continuity ofcare by reducing gaps in coverage that can occur when beneficiaries churn on and off Medicaid or sign up for Medicaid only when sick, and facilitates receipt of preventive services when beneficiaries are healthy. In circumstances where Medicaid eligibility depends upon a finding of disability or a certain diagnosis (e.g., of breast or cervical cancer), the state will evaluate whether the policy encourages beneficiaries to apply for Medicaid (including through an application for SSI in the case that an SSI determination also provides a Medicaid eligibility determination) as soon as possible after the relevant finding or diagnosis. For example, for those who are aged, blind, or disabled, or who may need long-term services and supports through Medicaid, the state will evaluate whether the policy encourages beneficiaries to apply for Medicaid expeditiously when they believe they meet the criteria for eligibility, to ensure primary or secondary coverage through Medicaid in case the need for services arises. Some commenters expressed concerns that the waiver of retroactive eligibility will reduce coverage. and therefore it cannot promote Medicaid's objectives. The waiver of re\u00cdoactive eligibility is likely to help promote Medicaid's objectives in at least t\\\u00a1/o ways: (l) it may improve uptake of preventive services for certain beneficiaries and thus improve beneficiary health; (2) it is expected to improve the fiscal sustainability of Arizona's Medicaid program, which might help Arizona continue to provide Medicaid to the ACA expansion population, and continue to cover non-mandatory benefits and eligibility groups' As part of its evaluation of the demonstration, Arizona will be required to test its hypothesis that the waiver will incentivize individuals to obtain and maintain health coverage, even when healthy, or to apply for coverage as soon as possible after the finding or diagnosis that gives rise to their Medicaid eligibility. Arizona will also be required to evaluate the impact of the waiver, with possible areas offocus for hypotheses that include, but are not limited to: the effects ofthe waiver on enrollment and eligibility continuity (including for different subgroups of individuals, such as individuals who are healthy, individuals with complex medical needs, prospective applicants, and existing beneficiaries in different care settings, including long-term care); the effects ofthe waiver on health outcomes; and the financial impact ofthe waiver (for example, such as an assessment of medical debt and uncompensated care costs). As described in the STCs, if monitoring indicates that demonstration features are not likely to assist in promoting the objectives of Medicaid, or ifevaluation data for this demonstrationPage l8- Ms.Jami Snyder indicate that demonstration leatures are not likely to assist in promoting the objectives of Medicaid, CMS reserves the right to require the state to submit a corrective action plan to CMS for approval. Further, CMS reserves the right to withdraw waivers at any time it determines that continuing the waivers would no longer be in the public interest or promote the objectives of Medicaid.

PREFACE The following are the S pecial T erms and C onditions (STCs) for the \" Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System (AHCCCS)\" section 1115(a) Medicaid and CHIP demonstration (hereinafter \"demonstration\") to enable Arizona (state) to operate this demonstration. T he Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has granted the state waivers of requirements under section 1902(a) of the Social Security Act (Act), and expenditure authorities authorizing federal matching of demonstration costs that are not otherwise matchable, and which are separately enumerated . These STCs set forth in detail the nature, character, and extent of federal involvement in the demonstration and the state's obligations to CMS related to this demonstration. Th e AHCCCS demonstration will be statewide, and is approved for a 5- year period, from October 1, 2016, through September 30, 2021, with implementation of the waiver of retroactive eligibility no sooner than April 1, 2019 and implementation of the AHCCCS Works program no sooner than January 1, 2020.

PROGRAM OVERVIEW AND HISTORICAL CONTEXT Until 1982, Arizona was the only state that did not have a Medicaid program under title XIX of the Social Security Act. In October 1982, Arizona implemented the AHCCCS in the state's first section 1115 demonstration project. AHCCCS initially covered only acute care services, however, by 1989, the program was expanded to include the Arizona Long Term Care System (ALTCS), the state's capitated long term care (LTC) program for the elderly and physically disabled (EPD) and the developmentally disabled (DD) populations. In 2000, the state also expanded coverage to adults without dependent children with family income up to and including 100 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) as well as established the Medical Expense Deduction (MED) program for adults with income in e xcess of 100 percent of the FPL who have qualifying healthcare costs that reduce their income at or below 40 percent of the FPL. On March 31, 2011, Arizona requested to eliminate the MED program and implement an enrollment freeze on the adults without depe ndent children population. On April 30, 2011, and July 1, 2011, CMS approved the state's required phase- out plans for the MED program and the adults without dependent children population, respectively. Arizona amended its State Plan, effective January 1, 2 014, to provide coverage under section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII) for certain persons with income not exceeding 133 percent of the FPL. The demonstration provides health care services through a prepaid, capitated managed care delivery model that operates statewide for both Medicaid state plan groups as well as demonstration expansion groups. It affects coverage for certain specified mandatory state plan eligibles by requiring enrollment in coordinated, cost effective, health care delivery systems. In this way, the demonstration will test the use of managed care entities to provide cost effective care coordination, including the effect of integrating behavioral and physical health services for individuals with serious mental illness and children participatin g in the Children's Rehabilitative Services program. In addition, the demonstration will provide for payments to IHS and tribal 638 facilities to address the fiscal burden for certain services not covered under the state plan and provided in or by such fa cilities. This authority will enable the state to evaluate how this approach impacts the financial viability of IHS and 638 facilities and ensures the continued availability of a robust health care delivery network for current and future Medicaid benefici aries. As part of the extension of the demonstration in 2016, based on CMS clarifying its policy for claiming 100 percent federal matching for services received through IHS and 638 facilities , the state can transition from the current uncompensated care reimbursement methodology to service -based claiming. As part of the extension of the demonstration on October 1, 2016, beginning January 1, 2017 the state was approved to implement its AHCCCS Choice Accountability Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 12 Amended: January 18, 2019 Responsibility Engagement (CARE) program. Beneficiaries in the new adult group with incomes above 100 percent of the FPL are required to participate in AHCCCS CARE and will be required to make monthly contributions into A HCCCS CARE accounts. AHCCCS CARE will also provide certain incentives for timely payment of these monthly contributions and completion of \"healthy targets\" under the state's Healthy Arizona program that will also be implemented with AHCCCS CARE. On Jan uary 18, 2017, an amendment was approved which established the \"Targeted Investment s Program .\" The state directs its managed care plans to make specific payments to certain providers pursuant to 42 CFR 438.6(c), with such payments incorporated into the actuarially sound capitation rates, to incentivize providers to improve performance. Specifically, providers are paid incentive payments for i ncreas ing physical and behavioral health care integration and coordination for individuals with behavioral health nee ds. The Targeted Investments Program is expected to : Reduce fragmentation that occurs between acute care and behavioral health care, Increase efficiencies in service delivery for members with behavioral health needs, and Improve health outcomes for the affected populations. On January 18, 2019, CMS approved two amendment s for AHCCCS . Under the first amendment, beginning no sooner than April 1, 2019, Arizona will not provide retroactive eligibility for beneficiaries enrolled in AHCCCS (with exceptio ns for pregnant women, women who are 60 days or less postpartum, infants under age 1, and children under age 19). Under the second amendment, Arizona will, beginning no sooner than January 1, 2020, require, as a condition of eligibility, that non- exempt b eneficiaries in the new adult group at section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII) of the Act, ages 19 through 49, engage in qualifying community engagement activities for at least 80 hours per month, and report monthly that they are meeting the community engagement r equirements. Beneficiaries who successfully complete and report compliance on a monthly basis will have no disruption in coverage. Arizona will provide a three month grace period for individuals to meet the community engagement requirements once determined otherwise eligible. If a beneficiary does not fully comply with the community engagement requirements, including failure to report compliance for any month after the three month grace period, the state will suspend the beneficiary's eligibility for two months. Beneficiaries with suspended eligibility will have their eligibility reactivated immediately after the end of the two -month suspension as long as they continue to meet all other eligibility criteria. Beneficiaries in suspension status may have t heir eligibility reinstated earlier if it is determined that a beneficiary qualif ies for another category of Medicaid eligibility that is not subject to the community engagement requirements or is currently exempt from the requirements . Beneficiaries can comply with the community engagement requirements by participating in a number of activities, such as employment (including self -employment); employment readiness activities, which include less than full- time education, job or life skills training, and health education classes; job search activities; or community service. Under the state's AHCCCS Works program, certain beneficiaries whom the state believes are Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 13 Amended: January 18, 2019 particularly vulnerable or whose circumstances could make it unreasonably dif ficult or impossible to participate in qualifying activities will be exempt from the community engagement requirements. This includes: pregnant women and women up to the end of the month in which the 60th day of post -pregnancy occurs; former foster youth up to age 26; beneficiaries with a serious mental illness (SMI); beneficiaries receiving temporary or permanent long -term disability benefits; beneficiaries who are medically frail; beneficiaries who are in active treatment with respect to a substance use d isorder (SUD); full time high school, trade school, college, or graduate students; victims of domestic violence; beneficiaries who are homeless; designated caretakers of a child under age 18 or of a child who is 18 and is a full -time student in high school or trade school and is expected to graduate before he/she turns 19 (limit one caretaker per child); caregivers who are responsible for the care of an individual with a disability; beneficiaries with an acute medical condition (physical and/or behavioral) that would prevent them from complying with the requirements; and beneficiaries with a disability as defined by federal disabilities rights laws who are unable to comply with the requirements for disability -related reasons. The state's program would also exempt beneficiaries who already participate in programs that incentivize community engagement, including those receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Cash Assistance, or Unemployment Insurance income ben efits; and beneficiaries participating in other AHCCCS approved work programs. CMS also approved an exemption from the AHCCCS Works requirements for beneficiaries who are members of federally recognized tribes. III. GENERAL PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS 1. Compliance with Federal Non -Discrimination Laws . The state must comply with applicable f ederal civil rights laws relating to non -discrimination in services and benefits in its programs and activities .

Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 22 Amended: January 18, 2019 17. Waiver of Retroactive Eligibility . The state will not provide medical assistance for any month prior to the month in which a beneficiary's Medicaid application is filed, except for a pregnant woman (including during the 60 -day period beginning on the last day of the pregnancy), an infant under age 1, or a child under age 19. The waiv er of retroactive eligibility applies to all populations described in STC 16 who are not pregnant ( including during the 60- day period beginning on the last day of the pregnancy), an infant under age 1, or a child under age 19, effective no sooner than Apr il 1, 2019. a) The state assures that , through various methods, it will provide outreach and education regarding how to apply for and receive Medicaid coverage to the public and to Medicaid providers, particularly those who serve vulnerable populations that may be impacted by the retroactive eligibility waiver. V. DEMONSTRATION PROGRAMS 18. Arizona Acute Care Program (AACP) . AACP enrollees receive most Medicaid - covered services through the Health Plans, but receive, on a \"carve out\" basis, behavioral health servic es through a separate MCO contract. The one exception to the behavioral health carve out is for AACP members with a Serious Mental Illness (SMI) who receive their acute care and behavioral health services through a geographically designated Regional Behavioral Health Authority (RBHA) and AHCCCS contracted MCO . In addition, AACP members with a CRS condition receive all of their care - acute care and treatment for CRS and behavioral health care conditions - through a separate MCO contract. a) Enrollment . The Arizona DES processes applications and determines acute care Medicaid eligibility for children, pregnant women, families and non- disabled adults under the age of 65 years. The Social Security Administration (SSA) determines eligibility for the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) cash - related groups, and AHCCCS determines eligibility for the SSI - related aged and disabled groups, Medicare Savings Programs, women diagnosed with breast or cervical cancer, and Freedom to Work recipients. Individuals determi ned eligible must then select and enroll in a Health Plan, or they will be auto -assigned by the AHCCCS administration. b) Benefits . With the exception of the new adult group, benefits for AACP and the expansion population authorized by the 1115 demonstration will consist of all acute care benefits covered under the Medicaid state plan, unless otherwise noted within these STCs. The new adult group will receive benefits for AACP through the state's approved alternative benefit plan (ABP) state plan amendment (SPA). i. Notice . The state must include the CMS Central Office when submitting a SPA to the CMS Regional Office that would impact the expansion population authorized by the 1115 demonstration inclusive of: Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 23 Amended: January 18, 2019 a. The proposed date of implementation; b. The date the state plans to submit the SPA; and c. Revised budget neutrality projections. ii. Demonstration Amendment. CMS reserves the right to require the state to submit an amendment if it is determined that it is warranted. iii. Behavioral health services are outlined in Table 2 and subject to limitations set forth in the existing state plan.

Cost sharing shall be imposed as specified in the Medicaid state plan for all populations. 19. The AHCCCS CARE Program. The AHCCCS CARE program is designed to engage Arizona's new adult group expansion population with income over 100 percent FPL (hereinafter \"Expansion Adults\") to prepare adults for successful transition to Marketplace or other coverage. AHCCCS CARE is als o designed to build health literacy by promoting incentives around achieving identified health targets. The AHCCCS CARE program is comprised of: an AHCCCS CARE Account (the \"Account\"), meeting a Healthy Arizona Target. The AHCCCS CARE program will be adm inistered by a third party AHCCCS contractor (\"Vendor\") upon completion and award of a Request for Proposal by the state. 20. Participation in AHCCCS CARE . Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 24 Amended: January 18, 2019 a) Mandatory Participation . Expansion Adults - beneficiaries enrolled in the new adult group with incomes that exceed 100 percent of the FPL - are required to participate in AHCCCS CARE (hereinafter \"AHCCCS CARE member(s)\"). The following Expansion Adults are exempted from AHCCCS CARE participation: i. Persons with serious mental illness ; ii. American Indi an/Alaska Natives ; and iii. Persons considered \"medically frail\" as described in Attachment H. b) Hardship Exemptions . AHCCCS CARE members may be exempted from the program requirements for a period of one month if the member meets one of the following hardship exemption criteria during the prior month: i. A member of the household dies. ii. The income group has one or more of the following expenses which exceed 10 percent of the countable gross income of the income group: a. Medically necessary expenses for any member of the household that Medicaid or health insurance coverage did not pay for. Medically necessary means a covered service provided by a physician or other licensed practitioner to prevent disease, disability, or other adverse health conditions or their progression or prolong life; b. Health insurance premiums for any member of the household; c. Unexpected expenses for repairs to the home. Repairs include items such as fixing a leaky roof, replacing a non -working air conditioner, repairing plumbing, etc. Repairs do not include remodeling or redecorating; or d. Expenses for repairs to an income group member's transportation so the individual can get to work. This does not include routine maintenance, such as tune- ups, oil changes, etc. iii. Reporting of a hardship exemption should be made by the AHCCCS CARE member directly to the Vendor. AHCCCS CARE members will be provided notice that will explain these hardship exemptions and give instructions for how to request an exemption. iv. AHCCCS CA RE members may seek a hardship exemption at any time. Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 25 Amended: January 18, 2019 The member must provide supporting documentation of the permitted hardship, but there are no limits to the number or duration of hardship exemptions a member may receive during the course of the year. c) Voluntary Participation . Nothing in this demonstration shall preclude the state from permitting a ll Expansion Adults exempted from AHCCCS CARE participation as outlined above as well as new adult group members at or below 100 percent of the FPL to choose to opt in to the AHCCCS CARE program. Opting in allows the member to open and maintain an AHCCCS CARE Account that will be funded by a third party, such as a charitable organization. In addition, members otherwise exempted from AHCCCS CARE may opt in and contribute their own funds. Such contributions would be voluntary with amounts and timing of contribution all at the discretion of the member. None of the other AHCCCS CARE program requirements will apply. Accordingly, members who opt in will not be: i. Required to pay premiums or Strategic Coinsurance based on Medicaid enrollment ; ii. Disenrolled for failure to pay into the AHCCCS CARE Account; or iii. Required to participate in the Healthy Arizona program . 21. Beneficiary Contributions. AHCCCS CARE members must make two types of payments that in total shall not exceed 5 percent of household income, calculated quarterly: strategic coinsurance and premium payments. a) Strategic Coinsurance. Strategic coinsurance will be applied retrospectively, rather th an at the point of service. The strategic coinsurance payments are limited and targeted to support the medical home concept and steer members to the most appropriate care settings and types. Strategic coinsurance will not exceed 3 percent of household income and will be used to offset program costs. AHCCCS CARE members are responsible for making the following coinsurance payments: i. $4.00 for opioids prescriptions or refills . This coinsurance requirement is part of a broader state effort to address the opioid epidemic. The only exceptions to this coinsurance requirement are for AHCCCS CARE members with a cancer diagnosis or terminal illness such that they have qualified for hospice care , or if the beneficiary's physician requests an exemption with supporting documentation as to medical necessity for the opioid prescription. ii. $8.00 for non -emergency use of the emergency room . This strategic coinsurance requirement is designed t o help steer members to lower levels of care that are more appropriate in non -emergency situations. The coinsurance requirement will be paid for the following ED visits: Level 1 Emergency Department Code 99281; and Level 2 Emergency Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 26 Amended: January 18, 2019 Department Code 99282. The state will ensure that hospitals: a. Conduct an appropriate medical screening under 42 CFR 489.24 subpart G to determine that the individual does not need emergency services; b. Inform the individual of the amount of his or her coinsurance obligation f or non- emergency services provided in the emergency department; c. Provide the individual with the name and location of an available and accessible alternative non -emergency services provider; d. Determine that the alternative provider can provide services to the individual in a timely manner with the imposition of a lesser cost sharing amount or no cost sharing if the individual is otherwise exempt from cost sharing; and e. Provide a referral and coordinate scheduling for treatment by the alternative provider. iii. $5 or $10 Specialist Services without a PCP Referral. Because the state is emphasizing the medical home model as part of its managed care system, AHCCCS CARE members will pay a per visit coinsurance payment of $5 for a specialist office visit (when AHCCCS pays $50 - $99.99) or $10 (when AHCCCS pays $100 or more) if there is no referral from their primary care physician (PCP) for that specialist visit. iv. $4.00 Brand Name Drugs when Generic Available. The brand name coinsurance payment will not apply if the phy sician determines that the generic drug is not as effective as the brand name drug. b) Calculation of Retrospective Strategic Coinsurance. AHCCCS CARE members will be responsible for coinsurance liability for the services outlined in (i) through (iv) of par agraph 21 based upon the most recent six months of utilization for which data is complete of the identified services used by the member. The utilization review will occur quarterly; accordingly the AHCCCS CARE member will have a coinsurance liability for a three month period. The amount owed for the quarter will be divided into three monthly payments. The amount owed for the quarter or for any month within that quarter shall not exceed 3 percent of household income. c) AHCCCS CARE Account Contributions or Premium Payments . AHCCCS CARE members will make a monthly premium payment that will serve as their AHCCCS CARE Account contribution. The payment is set at the lesser of 2 percent of household income or $25. AHCCCS CARE members will make these payments to a Vendor, who will credit the amount of the payment to the beneficiary's established AHCCCS CARE Account . The AHCCCS CARE Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 27 Amended: January 18, 2019 member will still access the full array of covered benefits as outline d in the state plan and 1115 demonstration. d) AHCCCS CARE M ember Invoices Payments . AHCCCS CARE members will be sent a quarterly invoice by the state's Vendor that includes the following: i. Amount owed for strategic coinsurance for each month within that quarter that specified the basis for each included coinsurance charge, by the service for which the state charge applies, and explains to the member that the payment is connected to the services already received; ii. Identifies the method by which the individual may dispute incorrect charges; iii. Amount owed for premiums for each month within that quarter; iv. Member's 5 percent threshold articulated in a dollar amount; v. Account balance; vi. Outstanding or past due liabilities. e) AHCCCS CARE Payments . AHCCCS CARE members make their payments directly to the Vendor. The amount of any payment including the premium, or strategic coinsurance will be credited on the CMS -64 against program expenditures claimed by the state for federal matching . No strategic coinsurance payments ar e made to health care provider s; such payments also do not a ffect enrollment. Premium payments made by the AHCCCS CARE member are credited to the member's AHCCCS CARE Account that is recorded with the Vendor . (See Attachment H for example calculations of AHCCCS CARE payments.) f) Grace Period/Payment Period . AHCCCS CARE members will have two months from the date of the payment invoice to make the required monthly premium contribution. g) Disenrollment for Failure to Pay Premiums . AHCCCS CARE members will receive a notice of disenrol lment for failure to make AHCCCS CARE premium payments. There is no lock out period. Anyone that has been disenrolled for failure to pay premiums may re -enroll in the Medicaid program at any time and does not have to pay any past -due liabilities. If re -enrollment occurs within 90 days, a new application is not needed. 22. AHCCCS CARE Contributions by Third Parties . Third parties such as employers or charitable organizations may make contributions on behalf of AHCCCS CARE members. Arrangements for billing the third party will be made on a case -by-case basis to accommodate the unique needs of the third party. Any such arrangement shall be reviewed and approved by CMS and incorporated into the state's AHCCCS CARE Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 28 Amended: January 18, 2019 Operational Protocol. There are no limits on the amounts third parties can contribute to any AHCCCS CARE member's Account. Health care providers or provider -related entities making contributions on individual's behalf must have criteria for providing assistance that do not distinguish between individua ls based on whether or not they receive or will receive services from the contributing provider(s) or class of providers. Providers may not include the cost of such payments in the cost of care for purposes of Medicare and Medicaid cost reporting and cannot be included as part of a Medicaid shortfall or uncompensated care for any purpose. 23. Beneficiary Protections for AHCCCS CARE Account Contributions. a) Arizona and/or its vendor may attempt to collect unpaid premiums and the related debt from beneficiaries, but may not report the debt to credit reporting agencies, place a lien on an individual's home, refer the case to debt collectors, file a lawsuit, or seek a court order to seize a portion of the individual's earnings for enrollees at any income level. The state and/or its vendor may not \"sell\" the debt for collection by a third party. b) Beneficiaries described in 42 CFR 447.56(a) (including American Indians/Alaska Natives, as described therein) must be exempt from all coinsurance and premium contribution requirements, as applicable. c) Beneficiaries may not incur household cost sharing or premiums that exceeds 5 percent of the aggregate household income, following rules established in 42 CFR 447.56(f). d) Coinsurance amounts will not exceed Medicaid cost sharing permitted by federal law and regulation. e) The state may not pass along the cost of any surcharge associated with processing payments to the beneficiary. Any surcharges or other fees associated with payment processing must be considered an administrative expense by the state. f) The state will ensure that all payments from the beneficiary, or on behalf of the individual, are accurately and timely credited toward unpaid premiums and related debt, and will provide the beneficiary an opportunity to review and seek correction of the payment history. 24. The AHCCCS CARE Account. The Account is styled like a flexible spending arrangement. The Account is maintained by the Vendor and will be credited with member premium payments and/or any contributions made by employers or other entities. Beneficiaries can receive direct payments that reflect amounts credited to their AHCCCS CARE Accounts These payments shall be treated as a refund of contributions paid and shall be credited (for federal claiming purp oses) as an expenditure in the quarter paid. The state may make the return of the premium conditioned upon incurred expenses for certain health -care related items; any list of such items must be approved by CMS. The AHCCCS CARE contractor will not credit the Account with strategic Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 29 Amended: January 18, 2019 coinsurance payments. a) Accessing Funds in the AHCCCS CARE Account . The state will establish in the Operational Protocol described in STC 25 how AHCCCS CARE members in good standing may withdraw funds credited to their Account s. b) Good Standing Requirements . To be in good standing, the AHCCCS CARE member must: i. Make timely payments into the AHCCCS CARE Account for premiums and coinsurance liabilities. ii. Meet at least one Healthy Arizona Target. c) Accrual of Monies . AHCCCS CARE members do not have to expend funds within the year. Members may choose to roll funds over from year to year but only if they are in good standing. Interest will not accrue to the Account. Fund balances in the Account will not be treated as income or assets of the beneficiary. d) Healthy Arizona . Healthy Arizona is a small set of health targets that unlock the AHCCCS CARE member's ability to access funds in the AHCCCS CARE Account. i. Healthy Arizona Targets . The Healthy Arizona targets include: a. Preventive Health Targets : 1. Annual well exam 2. Flu shot 3. Mammogram 4. Glucose screening b. Managing Chronic Disease 1. Tobacco cessation defined as having quit smoking or use of tobacco for at least 6 months. 2. Diabetes management, which requires that the AHCCCS CARE member has developed a care management plan with their PCP that includes exercise, steps to help fo llow a proper diet, maintaining blood sugar levels, adherence to medication and managing blood pressure. 3. Asthma management, which includes that the AHCCCS CARE member establish an asthma action plan with their Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 30 Amended: January 18, 2019 PCP that includes guidance on taking medicine s properly, avoiding asthma triggers and tracking level of asthma control. 4. Substance use disorder management, which requires establishing and following a care plan with their primary behavioral health provider that also includes access to peer supports, m edication management, individual or group counseling and any other modalities needed by the member. ii. Member Reporting. AHCCCS CARE members will report having met one of more of these targets to the Vendor. Reporting will be through self-attestation. AHCCCS CARE members can choose to submit documentation or other proof of completion of the Healthy Arizona target to the Vend or, but proof of completion is not required. The Vendor will allow for reporting through the AHCCCS CARE Account online or by phone. iii. Benefits of Meeting the Healthy Arizona Targets. a. Accessing AHCCCS CARE Account funds. AHCCCS CARE members may not with draw funds if they have not completed one of the Healthy Arizona Targets. b. Rolling unused AHCCCS CARE Account funds over into next benefit year. c. Reducing AHCCCS CARE Payments. Meeting one of the Preventive Health Targets or the Chronic Disease Management targets excuses the AHCCCS CARE member from any premium or coinsurance liabilities for a period of six months. The AHCCCS CARE member may choose the quarter to which he or she would like exemption to begin. 25. AHCCCS CARE Operational Protocol. The state must submit a draft Operational Protocol to CMS for review and approval prior to implementing the AHCCCS CARE program. The state's submission must be no later than 90 days prior to the planned implementation. The state may not implement beneficiary contr ibutions and the Healthy Arizona Targets program until 30 days following CMS approval of the protocol pertaining to the program. The protocol will be incorporated into these STCs as Attachment H. The protocol must include, at a minimum, the following ite ms: a) Contributions and Accounts and Payments Infrastructure. i.

If a beneficiary has sought to demonstrate good cause, whether good cause has been approved or denied, with an explanation of the basis for the decision and how to appeal a denial. e. Ensure that speci fic activities that may be used to satisfy the AW requirements are available during a range of times and through a variety of means (e.g., online, in person) at no cost to the beneficiary. f. Conduct active outreach and education beyond standard noticing for AHCCCS beneficiaries for successful compliance with AW requirement s as beneficiaries move toward self -sufficiency and economic security . g. Develop and maintain an ongoing partnership with the Arizona Department of Economic Security to assist AHCCCS beneficiaries with complying with AW requirements and moving toward self -sufficiency. h. Maintain an annual redetermination process, including systems to complete ex parte redeterminations and use of notices that contain prepopulated inform ation known to the state, consistent with all applicable Medicaid requirements. i. Provide full appeal rights as required under 42 CFR, Part 431, subpart E prior to suspension of eligibility, and observe all requirements for due process for beneficiaries who se eligibility will be suspended for failing to meet the AW requirements, including allowing beneficiaries the opportunity to raise additional issues in a hearing, including whether the beneficiary should be subject to the suspension, and provide additiona l documentation through the appeals process. j. Assure that suspension due to noncompliance with AW requirements will occur only after an individual has been screened and determined ineligible for all other bases of Medicaid eligibility and reviewed for el igibility for insurance affordability programs in accordance with 42 CFR 435.916(f). k. Establish beneficiary protections, including assuring that AW program beneficiaries do not have to duplicate requirements to maintain access to all public assistance pro grams that require community engagement and/or employment. l. With the assistance of other state agencies and other public and private partners, make good faith efforts to connect AW beneficiaries to existing community supports that are available to assist beneficiaries in meeting the AW requirements, including employment programs and services offered by the Arizona Department of Economic Security and available non -Medicaid Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 48 Amended: January 18, 2019 assistance with transportation, child care, language access services , and other supports. m. With the assistance of other state agencies and other public and private partners, make good faith efforts to connect beneficiaries with disabilities as defined in the ADA, S ection 504, or S ection 1557 with services and supports necessary to enable them to meet the AW Requirements. The existence of separate programs and services providing such supports does not relieve the state of its obligation to provide reasonable modifications for peopl e with disabilities with respect to the AW Requirements pursuant to STC 36. n. Ensure the state will assess areas within the state that experience high rates of unemployment, areas with limited economies and/or educational opportunities, and areas with lack of public transportation to determine whether there should be further exemptions from the AW requirements and/or additional mitigation strategies, so that the AW requirements will not be unreasonably burdensome for beneficiaries to meet. o. Provide each beneficiary who has been suspended or disenrolled from AHCCCS with information on how to access primary care and preventative care services at low or no cost to the individual.

VII. FUNDING POOLS AND PAYMENTS UNDER THE DEMONSTRATION. 39. Safety Net Care Pool (SNCP). Payments from this pool will assist Phoenix Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 49 Amended: January 18, 2019 Children's Hospital (PCH), which has high levels of uncompensated care related to medical assistance provided to Medicaid eligibles or to individuals who have no source of third party coverage. For PCH, payments from the SNCP will be distributed to PCH based on its uncompensated care (based on prior period data). Payments to PCH for each C Y will be subject to a limit computed in accordance with Attachment F , based on PCH's uncompensated care costs incurred up to December 31, 2017. Specifically, the SNCP for PCH is $110,000,000 for payments based on uncompensated care costs incurred in calendar year 201 6; and $90,000,000 for payments based on uncompensated care costs incurred in calendar year 2017. Any unspent cap amount cannot be used to pay for costs incurred in any following CY and will not be available for payments beyond the demonstration period ending September 30, 2021. a) SNCP Payments. Funds may be used to assist PCH with high levels of uncompensated care related to medical services that meet the definition of \"medical assistance\" contained in section 1905(a) of the Act, that are provided to Medicaid eligible or uninsured individuals incurred by PCH. Expenditures must be claimed in accordance with CMS -approved claiming protocols in Attachment F. For any provider receiving SNCP payments, the total Medicaid payments, Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments, SNCP payments, and any other payments for medical services furnished to Medicaid eligible and uni nsured individuals cannot exceed the actual cost of providing services to Medicaid eligibles and the uninsured as defined in the claiming protocol. SNCP payments will be made directly from the state to Phoenix Children's Hospital for its incurred uncompens ated care costs. b) Prohibited Use of SNCP Funds. SNCP funds cannot be used to pay for costs associated with non- emergency services provided to non- qualified aliens. The state must develop a methodology as part of the claiming protocol to exclude such costs from eligible uncompensated care costs. c) Uncompensated Care Cost Limit . For the calendar year 2016 , up to $110,000,000 total computable payments to PCH can be paid from the SNCP that are based on uncompensated care costs incurred by PCH in calendar y ear 2016. For payments based on uncompensated care costs incurred by PCH in calendar year 2017, up to $90,000,000 total computable may be paid from the SNCP . The SNCP payment distributed to each individual provider will not exceed its uncompensated care costs for providing section 1905(a) medical services to Medicaid eligible and uninsured individuals for the applicable period. To the extent that a provider's cost reporting period does not coincide with the DY (or partial DY or calendar year) , the cost protocol will provide for an allocation of uncompensated care costs to the DY (or partial DY or calendar year) . Any SNCP payments made in excess of the individual provider's uncompensated care cost limit for a demonstration period will be recouped from the provider, and the federal share of the overpayment will be returned to CMS. Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 50 Amended: January 18, 2019 d) Eligible Providers. Phoenix Children's Hospital , for the uncompensated care costs it incurs from January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2017. e) DSH and SNCP. All applicable inpatient hospital and outpatient hospital SNCP payments received by a hospital provider must be included as offsetting revenue in the state's annual DSH audit reports. Hospitals cannot receive total payments, including DSH and SNCP payments, related to in patient and outpatient hospital services furnished to Medicaid eligible and uninsured individuals that exceed the hospital's total eligible inpatient hospital and outpatient hospital uncompensated care costs. f) Intergovernmental Transfers (IGTs). The non- federal share of the SNCP payments for PCH will be funded by contributions from eligible governmental entities through IGTs. The state will submit to CMS for review and approval all IGT agreements to ensure compliance with Section 1903(w)(6)(A) of the Act and Part X I of these STCs. Such agreements should specify the source and use of the IGT money. The agreements shall ensure that the IGT is not derived from an impermissible source, including recycl ed Medicaid payments, f ederal money precluded from use as state match, impermissible taxes, and non -bona fide provider -related donations. The agreements shall also ensure that providers will retain the SNCP payments. g) Annual Reporting Requirements for SNCP Payments . The state will submit to CMS an annual report specifically related to the amount of payments made from the SNCP per DY. The reporting requirements are as follows: Within ninety (90) days after the end of each DY, the state shall provide the following information to CMS: 1) Actual SNCP payments to each provider for each DY, including the interim payments and any overpayments resulting from the recomputations of the uncompensated care cost limits in accordance with the protocol in Attachment F ; 2) The uncompensated care cost limit computed for each provider for each DY, including the projected uncompensated care costs used for interim payment purposes, the uncompensated care costs based on the as -filed cost reports, and the uncompensated care costs bas ed on the finalized cost reports. 3) To the extent that the SNCP limits in paragraph 3 2(c) are stated for a period other than a DY, the state should allocate the SNCP payments to each DY proportionately based on the number of months in each DY that the payme nts cover. 40. Payments to IHS and 638 Facilities. The state is authorized through to make payments to IHS and tribal 638 facilities that take in to account furnishing Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 51 Amended: January 18, 2019 specified types of care furnished by IHS and tribal 638 facilities to Medicaid - eligible ind ividuals. Facilities must use the methodology discussed in Attachment G. VIII. DELIVERY SYSTEMS 41. Arizona Acute Care Program (AACP) . The AACP is a statewide, managed care system, which delivers acute care services through prepaid, capitated Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) that AHCCCS calls \"Health Plans.\" Most Health Plan contracts are awarded by Geographic Service Area (GSA), which is a specific county or defined grouping of counties designated by AHCCCS within which a Contractor provides, directly or through subcontract, covered health care to members enrolled with that Contractor. 42. Arizona Long Term Care Services (ALTCS) . The ALTCS is administered through a statewide, managed care system which delivers acute, long- term care, home- and- community based, CRS and behavioral health care services through capitated MCOs that AHCCCS calls \"Program Contractors.\" The one exception is ALTCS DES/DDD enrollees eligible under the CRS program receive specialty care for treatment of their CRS and behavioral health conditions through a separate MCO contract. Those enrollees will receive services for all conditions other than behavioral health or CRS related conditions through ALTCS DES/DDD. With one exception, ALTCS contracts are awarded in the same geographic service areas as AACP contracts are awarded. The exception is for the ALTCS contract with the Arizona DES/DDD to provide coverage on a statewide basis of the full ALTCS benefit package to all eligible individuals with developmental disabilities. Under state law, A. R.S. 36-2940, AHCCCS is required to enter into an intergovernmental agreement (IGA) with DES/DDD to serve as the managed care organization for individuals with developmental disabilities. The DES/DDD ALTCS contract is an at- risk MCO contract that complies with 42 C.F.R. Part 438 and as such is reviewed and approved by CMS. Payments to DES/DDD under the ALTCS contract shall not include any payments other than payments that meet the requirements of 42 CFR 438.3(c) and 438.4 through 438.8 including the require ment that all payments and risk-sharing mechanisms in the contract are actuarially sound. State law, A.R.S. 36- 2953, requires DES/DDD to maintain a separate fund to account for all revenues and expenditures under the ALTCS contract and limits use of the f und for the administration of the ALTCS contract. ALTCS enrollees in Maricopa and Pima Counties have a choice of Program Contractors, but ALTCS enrollees in the rest of the state enroll in the Program Contractor for their GSA. 43. Children Rehabilitative Se rvices (CRS) . AHCCCS contracts on a sole -source, capitated basis for the CRS program. 44. Regional Behavioral Health Authority (RBHA) . Individuals who are AACP members and who are diagnosed with a serious mental illness will receive their acute care services and behavioral health services through a separate MCO called a RBHA. RBHAs serve as subcontractors of AHCCCS. All other AACP members will receive Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 52 Amended: January 18, 2019 their behavioral health services through the RBHA. 45. American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/AN). Medicaid -eligible AI/AN may opt to receive Medicaid benefits through managed care or through Medicaid fee -for- service. AI/AN members electing to receive benefits through fee -for-service are otherwise included in the demonstration and , as discussed in ST C 33, all members of federally recognized tribes are exempt from the AW requirements. 46. Contracts. All contracts and modifications of existing contracts between the state and MCOs must be prior approved by CMS. The state will provide CMS with a minimum of 45 days to review changes. IX. GENERAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 47. Deferral for Failure to Submit Timely Demonstration Deliverables. CMS may issue deferrals in accordance with 42 CFR part 430 subpart C, in the amount of $5,000,000 per deliverable (federal share) when items required by these STCs (e.g., required data elements, analyses, reports, design documents, presentations, and other items specified in these STCs (herea fter singularly or collectively referred to as \"deliverable(s)\")) are not submitted timely to CMS or are found to be in consistent with the requirements approved by CMS. A deferral shall not exceed the value of the federal amount for the demonstration. The state does not relinquish its rights provided under 42 CFR part 430 subpart C to challenge any CMS finding that the state materially failed to comply with the terms of this agreement. In the event that either (1) the state has not submitted a written request to CMS for approval of an extension, as described below , within thirty (30) days after a deliverable was due, or (2) the state has not submitted a revised submission or a plan for corrective action to CMS within thirty days after CMS has notified the state in writing that a deliverable was not accepted for being inconsistent with the requirements of this agreement including the information needed to bring the deliverable into alignme nt with CMS requirements; the following process is triggered: a) CMS will issue a written notification to the state providing advance notification of a pending deferral for late or non- compliant submission of required deliverable (s). For each deliverable, the state may submit to CMS a written request for an extension to submit the required deliverable that includes a supporting rationale for the cause(s) of the delay and the state's anticipated date of submission. Should CMS agree to the state's request, a corresponding extension of the deferral process can be provided. b) CMS may agree to a corrective action as an interim step before applying the deferral , if corrective action is proposed in the state's written extension request . c) If CMS agrees to an interim corrective process in accordance with subsection (b), and the state fails to comply with the corrective action steps or still fails to submit the overdue deliverable(s) that meets the terms of this agreement, CMS Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 53 Amended: January 18, 2019 may proceed with the issuance of a deferral against the next Quarterly Statement of Expenditures reported in Medicaid Budget and Expenditure System/State Children's Health Insurance Program Budget and Expenditure System (MBES/CBES) following a written deferral notification to the state. d) If the CMS deferral process has been initiated for state non -compliance with the terms of this agreement for submitting deliverable(s), and the state submits the overdue deliverable(s) , and such deliverable(s) are accepted by CMS as meeting the standards outlined in these STCs , the deferral(s) will be released. As the purpose of a section 1115 demonstration is to test new methods of operation or service delivery , a state's failure to submit all required reports, evaluations, and other deliverables will be c onsidered by CMS in reviewing any application for an extension, amendment, or for a new demonstration. 48. Submission of Post -Approval Deliverables. The state must submit all deliverables as stipulated by CMS and within the timeframes outlined within these STCs. 49. Compliance with Federal Systems Updates. As federal systems continue to evolve and incorporate additional 1115 demonstration reporting and analytics functions, the state will work with CMS to: a) Revise the reporting templates and submission processes to accommodate timely compliance with the requirements of the new systems; b) Ensure all 1115, T -MSIS, and other data elements that have been agreed to for reporting and analytics are provided by the state; and c) Submit deliverables to the appropriate system as directed by CMS. 50. AHCCCS Works Implementation Plan. The state must submit an AHCCCS Works Implementation Plan to CMS no later than 150 calendar days after approval of the demonstration. The AHCCCS Works Implementation Plan is an operational companion document and must cover the key policies being tested under the AHCCCS Works (community engagement) program. Once determined complete by CMS, the AHCCCS Works Implementation Plan will be incorporated into t he STCs, as Attachment I. At a minimum, the AHCCCS Works Implementation Plan must include definitions and parameters of key AHCCCS Works policies, as authorized in these STCs, and describe the state's ongoing strategic approach to implementing the policie s, including reports on any recently met milestones and timelines for meeting upcoming milestones associated with these key policies. Other topics to be discussed in the AHCCCS Works Implementation Plan could include application assistance, reporting, and processing; notices; coordinated agency responsibilities; coordination with other insurance affordability programs; appeals; renewals; coordination with other state agencies; beneficiary protections; and outreach. 51. Monitoring Protocol. The state must su bmit to CMS a Monitoring Protocol no later than 210 calendar days after approval of the demonstration. Once approved, the Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 54 Amended: January 18, 2019 Monitoring Protocol will be incorporated into the STCs, as Attachment J. At a minimum, the Monitoring Protocol will affirm the sta te's commitment to conduct quarterly and annual monitoring in accordance with CMS' template. Any proposed deviations from CMS' template should be documented in the Monitoring Protocol. The Monitoring Protocol will describe the quantitative and qualitative elements on which the state will report through quarterly and annual monitoring reports. For quantitative metrics (e.g., performance metrics as described in STC 52( b) below ), CMS will provide the state with a set of required metrics, and technical speci fications for data collection and analysis covering the key policies being tested under this demonstration, including but not limited to the AHCCCS Works ( community engagement ) program and the waiver of retroactive eligibility . The Monitoring Protocol will specify the methods of data collection and timeframes for reporting on the state's progress as part of the quarterly and annual monitoring reports. For the qualitative elements (e.g ., operational updates as described in STC 52( a) below), CMS will pro vide the state with guidance on narrative and descriptive information which will supplement the quantitative metrics on key aspects of the demonstration policies. The quantitative and qualitative elements will comprise the state's quarterly and annual monitoring reports. 52. Monitoring Reports . The state must submit three (3) Q uarterly R eports and one (1) A nnual R eport each DY. The fourth -quarter information that would ordinarily be provided in a separate quarterly report should be reported as distinct inf ormation within the Annual Report. The Quarterly R eports are due no later than sixty ( 60) calendar days following the end of each demonstration quarter. The Annual R eport (including the fourth- quarter information) is due no later than ninety ( 90) calendar days following the end of the DY. The reports will include all required elements as per 42 CFR 431.428, and should not direct readers to links outside the report . Additional links not referenced in the document may be listed in a Reference/B ibliography section . The Monitoring Reports must follow the framework to be provided by CMS, which will be organized by milestones. The framework is subject to change as monitoring systems are developed/evolve, and will be provided in a structured manner that suppo rts federal tracking and analysis. a) Operational Updates . The operational updates will focus on progress towards meeting the milestones identified in CMS' framework. Additionally, per 42 CFR 431.428, the Monitoring Reports must document any policy or administrative difficulties in operating the demonstration. T he reports shall provide sufficient information to document key challenges, underlying causes of challenges, how challenges are being addressed, as well as key achievements and to what conditions and efforts successes can be attributed. The discussion should also include any issues or complaints identified by beneficiaries; lawsuits or legal actions; unusual or unanticipated trends; legislative updates; and descriptions of any public forums held. The Monitoring Report should also include a summary of all public comments received through post -award public forums regarding the progress of the demonstration. b) Performance Metrics . The performance metrics will provide data to demonstrate Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 55 Amended: January 18, 2019 how the state is progressing towards meeting the milestones identified in CMS' framework which include s the following key policies under this demonstration - the AHCCCS Works ( community engagement ) program , the AHCCCS CARE program (including the AHCCCS CARE Account) , ALTCS, funding pools, and the waiver of retroactive eligibility . The performance metrics will also reflect all other components of the state's demonstration, including the managed care programs . For example, these metrics will cover enrollment, disenrollment or suspension by specific demographics and reason, part icipation in community engagement qualifying activities, access to care, and health outcomes . Per 42 CFR 431.428, the Monitoring Reports must document the impact of the demonstration in providing insurance coverage to beneficiaries and the uninsured population, as well as outcomes of care, quality and cost of care, and access to care. This may also include the results of beneficiary satisfaction surveys, if conducted, grievances and appeals. The required monitoring and performance metrics must be inc luded in the Monitoring Reports, and will follow the CMS framework provided by CMS to support federal tracking and analysis. c) Budget Neutrality and Financial Reporting Requirements . Per 42 CFR 431.428, the Monitoring Reports must document the financial pe rformance of the demonstration. The state must provide an updated budget neutrality workbook with every Monitoring Report that meets all the reporting requirements for monitoring budget neutrality set forth in the General Financial Requirements section of these STCs, including the submission of corrected budget neutrality data upon request. In addition, the state must report quarterly and annual expenditures associated with the populations affected by this demonstration on the Form CMS - 64. Administrative costs for this demonstration should be reported separately on the CMS -64. d) Evaluation Activities and Interim Findings . Per 42 CFR 431.428, the Monitoring Reports must document any results of the demonstration to date per the evaluation hypotheses. Addit ionally, the state shall include a summary of the progress of evaluation activities, including key milestones accomplished, as well as challenges encountered and how they were addressed. 53. Corrective Action. If monitoring indicates that demonstration featu res are not likely to assist in promoting the objectives of Medicaid , CMS reserves the right to require the state to submit a corrective action plan to CMS for approval. This may be an interim step to withdrawing waivers or expenditure authorities, as outlined in STC 1 1. 54. Close O ut Report . Within 120 calendar days after the expiration of the demonstration, the state must submit a draft Close Out Report to CMS for comme nts. a) The draft report must comply with the most current guidance from CMS.

Pursuant to 42 CFR 431.420(c), the state must include a summary of the comments in the Monitoring R eport associated with the quarter in which the forum was held, as well as in its compiled A nnual R eport. X. TARGETED INVES TMENT S PROGRAM 60. Description. Arizona will include directed lump sum payments in its capitation rates paid to managed care entities pursuant to 42 CFR 438.6(c). The managed care entities will be directed to use the funding to make sp ecific incentive payments to certain providers to improve performance and increas e physical and behavioral health care integration and coordination for individuals with behavioral health needs. The Targeted Investments Program will: a) Reduce fragmentation that occurs between acute care and behavioral health care, b) Create efficiencies in service delivery for members with behavioral health needs, and c) Improve health outcomes for the affected populations. 61. Funding Limit . Pursuant to 42 CFR 438.6(c), AHCCCS may include in the actuarially sound capitation rates paid to managed care entities up to $300 million total for the period of January 18, 2017, through September 30, 2021, in directed incentive payments to physical and behavioral health care providers that pr ovide integrated services and care to Medicaid beneficiaries and achieve AHCCCS defined targets for performance improvement. In accordance with paragraph 74(f), the actual payment to he managed care entities may occur after September 30, 2021. The lump sum payment s for the Targeted Investments Program will be paid to the managed care entities after the close of the contract period based on provider performance. The final amounts of the targeted payment amounts paid for the contract period must retrospect ively be cost allocated across rate cells in an actuarially sound and justified manner and in alignment with the described payment adjustment in the approved template for payments made under 438.6(c). Additionally, the total of all payments under the cont ract must be actuarially sound and in compliance with part 438. These capitation rates , including the directed incentive payments and any associated taxes and managed care entity administration costs , are eligible for federal financial participation at th e state's FMAP for individual rate cells affected by the incentive payments . Of the total $300 million, the state may expend up to $15 million to support the administration, including state level reporting and evaluation of the T argeted Investments Program. These administrative expenses will be eligible for federal financial participation at the administrative match rate of 50 percent. Pursuant to 42 CFR 438.6(c), AHCCCS will direct payment of the incentive payments Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 58 Amended: January 18, 2019 to be distributed annually to physica l and behavioral health providers based on demonstrated performance improvement and increased integration and coordination of physical and behavioral health across three focus populations: (i) adults, (ii) children, and (iii) adults who have transition ed from a criminal justice facility. Payment of these directed incentive payments will be tied to performance improvement targets. Table 4 - Estimated Annual Funding Distribution for the Targeted Investment s Program Programs Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 Totals Targeted Investments $19 m. $66.5 m. $85.5 m. $66.5 m. $47.5 $90 m. $70 m. $50 m. $300 m. 62. Provider Payment Criteria . The state shall ensure that the contracts with managed care entities for provider performance payments adhere to the requirements in 42 CFR 438.6 (81 FR 27859- 61) and sub- regulatory guidance unless otherwise explicitly modified by these STCs . 63. Designated State Health Programs (DSHP). Federal f unding of DSHPs is to ensure the continuation of vital health care and provider support programs while the state devotes increased state resources during the period of this demonstration for Targeted Investment s Program that will positive ly impact the Medicaid program, and result in savings to the federal government that will exceed the federal financial participation in DSHP funding. a) To the extent that the state increases its Medicaid expenditures through its Targeted Investment s Program , and achieves the measures that are a condition for DSHP payment, the state may claim federal matching funding for certain DSHP expenditures to support the initial investment costs of the Targeted Investment s Program. The expectation, which will be addressed in the demonstration evaluation, is that long -term savings achieved through the targeted investment will offset the amount of time -limited federal DSHP funding, and that the state will be able to continue the T argeted Investment s Program on a self -sustaining basis after the initial demonstration approval period. DSHP expenditures cannot exceed the amount spent on the Targeted Investment s Program and DSHP funding will also be subject to the annual and total DSHP spending limits in Table 5 and the red uctions described in paragraph 56 and Table 6. DSHP funding is at -risk at the statewide level based on the state's ability to meet system transformation targets, as described in Table 7 . DSHP funding will be phased down over the demonstration period. No payments will be available for DSHP expenditures that are claimed under Medicaid or are reimbursed by third parties. DSHP expenditures may be claimed following procedures and subject to limits as described in the T able 5 below. Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 59 Amended: January 18, 2019 b) FFP may be claimed for exp enditures made for services provided by the following two state programs beginning January 18, 2017 through September 30, 2021: i. Division of Developmental Disabilities (DDD), Arizona Early Intervention program (AzEIP) ii. Services to Individuals with Serious Mental Illness (SMI) under Arizona Revised Statute (A.R.S.) \u00a7\u00a7 11- 297. Table 5 - Total Computable Annual DSHP Limits Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 DSHP $6,274,400 $21,137,600 $27,177,000 $21,137,600 $15,098,300 64.

Quarterly Expenditure Reports. Effective with the quarter beginning October 1, 2011, the state shall provide quarterly expenditure reports using the Form CMS -64 to report total expenditures for services provided under the Medicaid program, including those provided through the demonstration under section 1115 authority. This project is approved for expenditures applicable to services rendered during the demonstration period. CMS shall provide FFP for allowable demonstration expenditures only as long as they do not exceed the pre -defined limits on the costs incurred as specified in this Agreement. 84. Reporting Expenditures in the Demonstration. The following describes the reporting of expenditures subject to the budget neutrality cap: a) Tracking Expenditures. In order to track expenditures under this demonstration, Arizona shall report demonstration expenditures through the Medicaid and state Children's Health Insurance Prog ram Budget and Expenditure System (MBES/CBES), following routine CMS -64 reporting instructions outlined in section 2500 of the state Medicaid Manual. All expenditures subject to the budget neutrality cap shall be reported on separate Forms CMS -64.9 Waiver and/or 64.9P Waiver, identified by the demonstration project number assigned by CMS (including the project number extension, which indicates the DY in which services were rendered or for which capitation payments were made). For monitoring purposes, cost settlements must be recorded on Line 10.b, in lieu of Lines 9 or 10.C. For any other cost settlements (i.e., those not attributable to this demonstration), the adjustments should be reported on lines 9 or 10.C through 10.F, as instructed in the state Medicaid Manual. The term, \"expenditures subject to the budget neutrality cap,\" is defined below. b) Use of Forms . For each DY, separate Forms CMS -64.9 Waiver and/or 64.9P Waiver shall be submitted reporting expenditures for individuals enrolled in the demonstrat ion, subject to the budget neutrality cap. The state must complete separate forms for the following categories: i. AFDC/SOBRA Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 69 Amended: January 18, 2019 ii. SSI iii. Expansion State Adults iv. MED v. ALTCS -DD vi. ALTCS -EPD vii. Payments to IHS and 638 Facilities viii. SNCP ix. DSH and Critical Access Hospital Payments (CAHP)** x. New Adult Group xi. TIP - DSHP xii. TIP **Critical Access Hospital Payments as defined in Attachment E c) Expenditures Subject to the Budget Neutrality Cap. For purposes of section X, the term \"expenditures subject to the budget neutrality cap\" shall include all Medicaid expenditures except those as described below, on behalf of the individuals who are enrolled in this demonstration. Expenditures excluded from this demonstration and the budget neutrality cap are Direct Services Claiming program expenditures for Medicaid in the public schools, Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment program expenditures, Freedom to Work program expenditures, and all administrative expenditures. d) Premium and Cost Sharing Adjustment . Premiums and other applicable cost sharing contr ibutions from enrollees that are collected by the state from enrollees under the demonstration shall be reported to CMS each quarter on Form CMS -64 Summary Sheet line 9.D, columns A and B. In order to assure that the demonstration is properly credited with premium collections, premium collections (both total computable and Federal share) should also be reported on the CMS -64 Narrative. The state should include these section 1115 premium collections as a manual adjustment (decrease) to the demonstration's ac tual expenditures on a quarterly basis. e) Administrative Costs. Administrative costs shall not be included in the budget neutrality limit. All administrative costs shall be identified on the Forms CMS - 64.10 Waiver and/or 64.10P Waiver. f) Claiming Period . All claims for expenditures subject to the budget neutrality cap (including any cost settlements) must be made within 2 years after the calendar quarter in which the state made the expenditures. Furthermore, all claims for services during the demonstration pe riod (including any cost settlements) must be made within 2 years after the conclusion or termination of the demonstration. During the latter 2- year period, the state must continue to identify separately net expenditures related to dates of service during the operation of the section 1115 demonstration on the CMS - 64 waiver forms in order to properly account for these expenditures in determining budget neutrality. g) Pharmacy Rebates. The state may propose a methodology for assigning a Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 70 Amended: January 18, 2019 portion of pharmacy re bates to the demonstration. The proposed methodology must determine, in a way that reasonably reflects actual rebate- eligible pharmacy utilization, the amounts of rebate that are attributable to pharmacy utilization under the demonstration vs. outside the demonstration, and appropriate subtotals by EG and DY. The methodology (and any subsequent changes to the methodology) must be approved in advance by the CMS Regional Office prior to use. Rebate amounts assigned to the demonstration must be reported on the appropriate Forms CMS -64.9 or 64.9P Waiver, and not on any other CMS -64.9 form (to avoid double -counting). In the absence of an approved methodology, all pharmacy rebates must be reported on Forms CMS -64.9 or 64.9P Base. 85. Reporting of Member Months. The following describes the reporting of member months in the demonstration. Member months subject to the budget neutrality cap include: a) For the purpose of calculating the budget neutrality expenditure cap described in this Agreement, the state shall pro vide to CMS on a quarterly basis the actual number of eligible member months for: 1) Eligibility Group 1 :AFDC / SOBRA 2) Eligibility Group 2: SSI 3) Eligibility Group 3: Expansion State Adults 4) Eligibility Group 4 ALTCS -DD 5) Eligibility Group 5 : ALTCS -EPD 6) Eligibility Group 6: New Adult Group b) This information shall be provided to CMS 30 days after the end of each quarter as part of the CMS -64 submission, either under the narrative section of the MBES/CBES or as a stand -alone report. c) The term \"eligible member months\" refers to the number of months in which persons are eligible to receive services. For example, a person who is eligible for 3 months contributes three eligible member months to the total. Two individuals who are eligible for 2 months each contribute two el igible member months to the total, for a total of four eligible member months. d) For the purposes of this demonstration, the term \"demonstration eligibles\" refers to all individuals covered by Arizona Medicaid with the exception of individuals in the Freedom to Work and Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment programs 86. Standard Medicaid Funding Process. The standard Medicaid funding process must be used during the demonstration. The state must estimate matchable demonstration expenditures (total computable and Federal share) subject to the budget neutrality expenditure cap and separately report these expenditures by quarter for each Federal fiscal year on the Form CMS -37 for both the Medical Assistance Payments (MAP) and state and Local Administration Costs (ADM). CMS shall make Federal Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 71 Amended: January 18, 2019 funds available based upon the state's estimate, as approved by CMS. Within 30 days after the end of each quarter, the state must submit the Form CMS -64 quarterly Medicaid expenditure report, showing Medicaid expenditur es made in the quarter just ended. CMS shall reconcile expenditures reported on the Form CMS -64 with Federal funding previously made available to the state, and include the reconciling adjustment in the finalization of the grant award to the state. 87. Extent of Federal Financial Participation for the Demonstration. Subject to CMS approval of the source(s) of the non- Federal share of funding, CMS shall provide FFP at the applicable Federal matching rates for the following, subject to the limits described in this Agreement. a) Administrative costs, including those associated with the administration of the demonstration; b) Net expenditures and prior period adjustments of the Medicaid program that are paid in accordance with the approved Medicaid state plan; and c) Net expenditures and prior period adjustments made with dates of service during the operation of the demonstration. 88. Medicare Part D Drugs. No FFP is available for this demonstration for Medicare Part D drugs. 89. Sources of Non -Federal Share. The state certifies that the source of the non- Federal share of funds for the demonstration is state/local monies. The state further certifies that such funds shall not be used as the non- Federal share for any other Federal grant or contract, except as permitted by law. All sources of non- Federal funding must be compliant with Title XIX of the Social Security Act and applicable regulations. In addition, all sources of the non -Federal share of funding are subject to CMS approval. a) CMS shall review the sources of the non- Federal share of funding for the demonstration at any time. The state agrees that all funding sources deemed unacceptable by CMS shall be addressed within the time frames set by CMS. b) The state shall provide information to CMS regarding all sources of the non- Federal share of funding for any amendments that impact the financial status of the program. c) Under all circumstances, health care providers must retain 100 percent of the reimbursement amounts claimed by the state as demonstration expenditures. Moreover, no pre -arranged agreements (contractual or otherwise) may exist between the health care providers and the state and/or local government to return and/or redirect any portion of the Medicaid or demonstration payments. This confirmation of Medicaid and demonstration payment retention is made with the understanding that payments that are the normal operating expenses of conducting business (such as payments related to taxes (including health care provider -related taxes), fees, and business Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 72 Amended: January 18, 2019 relationships with governments that are unrelated to Medicaid or the demonstration and in which there is no connection to Medicaid or demonstration payments) are not considered returning and/or redirecting a Medicaid or demonstration payment. 90. Certification of Public Expendit ures. The state must certify that the following conditions for non- Federal share of demonstration expenditures are met: a) Units of government, including governmentally operated health care providers, may certify that state or local tax dollars have been expended as the non- Federal share of funds under the demonstration. b) To the extent the state utilizes certified public expenditures (CPEs) as the funding mechanism for title XIX (or under section 1115 authority) payments, CMS must approve a cost reimbursem ent methodology. This methodology must include a detailed explanation of the process by which the state would identify those costs eligible under title XIX (or under section 1115 authority) for purposes of certifying public expenditures. i. To the extent tha t Arizona institutes the use of CPEs, the requirements of this term and condition fully apply. The state is subject to any policy guidance or regulation released by CMS regarding the use of CPEs. ii. The disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payment methodology for Arizona State Hospital (ASH) and the Maricopa Medical Center will be cost reimbursement and will utilize CPEs as the funding system. The methodology and the cost identification/reconciliation process, as approved by CMS, are included as an amendment to the DSH methodology in Attachment D. To the extent the state utilizes CPEs as the funding mechanism to claim Federal match for payments under the demonstration to non- governmental providers, the governmental entity appropriating funds to the provider must certify to the state the amount of such tax revenue (state or local) appropriated to the non- governmental provider used to satisfy demonstration expenditures. The non- governmental provider that incurred the cost must also provide cost documentation to support the state's claim for Federal match. c) The state may use intergovernmental transfers to the extent that such funds are derived from state or local tax revenues and are transferred by units of government within the state. Any transfers from governmentally operated health care providers must be made in an amount not to exceed the non- Federal share of title XIX payments. Under all circumstances, health care providers must retain 100 percent of the claimed expenditure. Moreover, no pre -arranged agreements (contractual or otherwise) exist between health care providers and state and/or local government to return and/or redirect any portion of the Medicaid payments. This confirmation of Medicaid payment retention is made Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 73 Amended: January 18, 2019 with the understanding that payments that are the normal operating expenses of conducting business, such as payments related to taxes, (including health care provider -related taxes), fees, business relationships with governments that are unrelated to Medicaid and in which there is no connection to Medicaid payments, are not considered returning and/or redirecting a Medicaid payment. 91. Applicability of Fee for Service Upper Payment Limits. If expenditures (excluding fee for service expenditures for American Indian beneficiaries) for inpatient hospital and long -term care facility services, other institutional and non - institutional services , and drugs provided to AHCCCS fee -for-service beneficiaries equal or exceed 5 percent of the state's total Medical Assistance expenditures, the expenditure authority will be terminated and the state shall submit a demonstration amendment that includes a plan to comply with the administrative requirements of section 1902(a)(30)(A). The state shall submit documentation to CMS on an annual basis that shows the percentage AHCCCS fee- for-service beneficiary expenditures as compared to total Medical Assistance expenditures. XIII. GENERAL FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS UNDER TITLE XXI 92. Quarterly CHIP Expenditure Reports. The state shall provide quarterly expenditure reports using the Form CMS -21 to report total expenditures for services provided to all demonstration populations receiving title XXI funds under section 1115 authority. This project is approved for expenditures applicable to services rendered during the d emonstration period. CMS will provide FFP only for allowable demonstration title XXI expenditures that do not exceed the state's available title XXI funding. 93. Tracking CHIP Expenditures. In order to track title XXI expenditures under this demonstration, the state will report demonstration expenditures, excluding KidsCare II, through the MBES/CBES, following routine CMS -21 reporting instructions. Title XXI demonstration expenditures will be reported on separate Forms CMS -21 Waiver and/or CMS -21P Waiver ident ified by the demonstration project number assigned by CMS (including project number extension, which indicates the DY in which services were rendered or for which capitation payments were made). Expenditures for the KidsCare II program will be reported on the CMS -21 with the state plan population in the MBES/CBES. Separate KidsCare II reporting will be provided in the CMS -21 Narrative using a proportion of KidsCare II to the total KidsCare population based on date of payments. a) CHIP Claiming. All claims for expenditures related to the demonstration (including any cost settlements) must be made within 2 years after the calendar quarter in which the state made the expenditures. Furthermore, all claims for services during the demonstration period (including cost settlements) must be made within 2 years after the conclusion or termination of the demonstration. During the latter 2 -year period, the state must continue to identify separately net expenditures related to dates of service during the operation of the demonstration on the Form CMS -21. Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 74 Amended: January 18, 2019 b) Standard CHIP Funding Process. The standard CHIP funding process will be used during the demonstration. Arizona must estimate matchable CHIP expenditures on the quarterly Form CMS -21B. On a separate CMS -21B, the state shall provide updated estimates of expenditures for the demonstration population. CMS will make Federal funds available based upon the state's estimate, as approved by CMS. Within 30 days after the end of each quarter, the state must submit the Form CMS -21 quarterly CHIP expenditure report. CMS will reconcile expenditures reported on the Form CMS -21 with Federal funding previously made available to the state, and include the reconciling adjustment in the finalization of the grant award to the state. c) Sources of CHIP Non -Federal Share. The state will certify state/local monies used as matching funds for the demonstration and will further certify that such funds will not be used as matching funds for any other Federal grant or contract, except as permitted by Federal law. All sources of non- Federal share of funding and distribution of monies involving Federal match are subject to CMS approval. Upon review of the sources of the non- Federal share of funding and distribution methodologies of funds under the demonstration, all funding sources and distribution methodologies deemed unacceptable by CMS shall be addressed within the timeframes set by CMS. Any amendments that impact the financial status of the program shall require the state to provide information to CM S regarding all sources of the non- Federal share of funding 94. Limit on Title XXI Funding . Arizona will be subject to a limit on the amount of Federal title XXI funding that the state may receive for demonstration expenditures during the demonstration period. Federal title XXI funding available for demonstration expenditures is limited to the state's available allotment, including currently available reallocated funds. Should the state expend its available title XXI Federal funds for the claiming perio d, no further enhanced Federal matching funds will be available for costs of the demonstration until the next allotment becomes available. 95. Compliance with Federal Rules. All Federal rules shall continue to apply during the period of the demonstration if title XXI Federal funds are not available and the state decides to continue the program. XIV. MONITORING BUDGET NEUTRALITY 96. Monitoring Demonstration Funding Flows. The state will provide CMS with information to effectively monitor the demonstration, upon reque st, in a reasonable time frame. These reports must follow the framework provided by CMS, which is subject to change as monitoring systems are developed/evolve, and be provided in a structured manner that supports federal tracking and analysis. a) Each year, AHCCCS will monitor and ensure that for each contract year, the DES/DDD have provided the appropriate state match necessary to draw down the FMAP for title XIX services provided, respectively, to ALTCS eligible persons. Specifically, AHCCCS and DES/DDD ent ered into an Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 75 Amended: January 18, 2019 Intergovernmental Agreement, effective July 1, 1998, whereby DES/DDD transfers to AHCCCS the total amount appropriated for the state match for title XIX ALTCS expenditures. AHCCCS deposits the monies transferred into an Intergovernmental Fund from which AHCCCS has sole disbursement authority. b) AHCCCS will report on a comparison of revenues and costs associated with the DES Interagency Agreement, including how any excess revenues are spent. The report will be due by January 15 of each year for the state fiscal year ending the previous June 30. 97. Limit on Title XIX Funding. The state shall be subject to a limit on the amount of Federal title XIX funding that the state may receive on selected Medicaid expenditures during the period of approval of the demonstration. The limit is determined by using a per capita cost method, and budget neutrality expenditure caps are set on a yearly basis with a cumulative budget neutrality expenditure limit for the length of the entire demonstration. The data suppli ed by the state to CMS to set the annual limits is subject to review and audit, and if found to be inaccurate, will result in a modified budget neutrality expenditure limit. 98. Risk. The state shall be at risk for the per capita cost (as determined by the method described below) for demonstration eligibles under this budget neutrality agreement, but not for the number of demonstration eligibles in each of the groups. By providing FFP for all demonstration eligibles, the state shall not be at risk for changin g economic conditions that impact enrollment levels. However, by placing the state at risk for the per capita costs for demonstration eligibles under this agreement, CMS assures that Federal demonstration expenditures do not exceed the level of expenditures that would have occurred had there been no demonstration. 99. Demonstration Populations and Programs Subject to the Budget Neutrality Cap. The following demonstration populations are subject to the budget neutrality cap and are incorporated into the following eligibility groups: a) Eligibility Group 1: AFDC / SOBRA b) Eligibility Group 2: SSI c) Eligibility Group 3: Expansion State Adults d) Eligibility Group 4: ALTCS -DD e) Eligibility Group 5: ALTCS -EPD f) Eligibility Group 6 : New Adult Group g) Program Group 1: DSH h) Program Group 2: Payments to IHS and Tribal Facilities Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 76 Amended: January 18, 2019 i) Program Group 3: SNCP j) Program Group 4: KidsCare II 100. Budget Neutrality Expenditure Cap: The following describes the method for calculating the budget neutrality expenditure cap for the demonstration: a) For each year of the budget neutrality agreement an annual budget neutrality expenditure cap is calculated for each eligibility group described in paragraph 89 as follows: i. An annual eligibility group expe nditure cap must be calculated as a product of the number of eligible member months reported by the state under paragraph 75 for each eligibility group, times the appropriate estimated per member per month (PM/PM) costs from the table in subparagraph (iii) below. ii. The PM/PM costs in subparagraph (iii) below are net of premiums paid by demonstration eligibles. iii. The PM/PM costs for the calculation of the annual budget neutrality expenditure cap for the eligibility groups subject to the budget neutrality agreement under this demonstration are specified below. The Expansion State Adults population is structured as a \"pass -through\" or a \"hypothetical state plan population\" . Therefore, the state may not derive savings from these populations. Eligibility Gr oup Trend Rate DY 6 DY 7 DY 8 DY 9 DY 10 FFY 2017 FFY 2018 FFY 2019 FFY 2020 iv. The annual budget neutrality expenditure cap for the demonstration as a whole is the sum of DSH allotment, the uncompensated care payments to IHS and tribal facilities, expenditures for the SNCP and KidsCare II program plus the annual expenditure caps for each eligibility group calculated in subparagraph (a) (i) above. b) The overall budget neutrality expenditure cap for the 5- year demonstration period Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 77 Amended: January 18, 2019 is the sum of the annual budget neutrality expenditure caps calculated in subparagraph (a) (iv) above for each of the 5 years. The f ederal share of the overall budget neutrality expenditure cap represents the maximum amount of FFP that the state may receive for expenditures on behalf of demonstration populations and expenditures described in paragraph 90 during the demonstration period. c) Apply the effective FMAP, o r enhanced 90 percent match for family planning services, that is determined from the MBES/CBES Schedule C report. 101. Monitoring of New Adult Group Spending and Opportunity to Adjust Projections. For each DY, a separate annual budget limit for the new adult group will be calculated as the product of the trended monthly per person cost times the actual number of eligible/member months as reported to CMS by the State under the guidelines set forth in paragraph 46. The trend rates and per capita cost estimates f or the new adult group are listed in the table below. Eligibility Group Trend Rate DY 6 DY 7 DY 8 DY 9 DY 10 FFY 2017 FFY 2018 FFY 2019 FFY 2020 FFY 2021 New Adult Group 3.30% $655.13 $676.75 $699.08 $722.15 $745.98 a) If the State's experience of the take up rate for the new adult group and other factors that affect the costs of this population indicates that the new adult group PMPM limit described above may underestimate the actual costs of medical assistance for the new adult group, the State has the opportunity to submit an adjustment to the PMPM limit, along with detailed expenditure data to justify this, for CMS review without submitting an amendment pursuant to paragraph 7. In order to ensure timely adjustments to the PMPM limit for a demonstration year, the revised projection must be submitted to CMS by no later than the end of the third quarter of the demonstration year for which the adjustment would take effect. b) The budget limit for the new adult group is calculated by taking the PMPM cost projection for the above group in each DY, times the number of eligible member months for that group and DY, and adding the products together across DYs. The federal share of the budget neutrality cap is obtained by multiplying total comput able budget neutrality cap by the federal share. c) The State will not be allowed to obtain budget neutrality \"savings\" from this population. d) If total FFP reported by the state for the new adult group should exceed the federal share of FFP for the budget li mit for the new adult group by more than 3 percent following each demonstration year, the state must submit a corrective action plan to CMS for approval. 102.Enforcement of Budget Neutrality. CMS shall enforce budget neutrality over the life of the demonstration rather than on an annual basis. The budget neutrality test for the demonstration extension will incorporate net savings from the immediately prior Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 78 Amended: January 18, 2019 demonstration period of October 1, 2011 through September 30, 2016, but not from any earlier approval period. 103. Budget Neutrality Savings Phase -Down. Beginning with the demonstration period that begins on October 1, 2016, the net variance between the without -waiver and actual with -waiver costs will be reduced. The reduced variance, calculated as a percentage of the total variance, is used in place of the total variance to determine overall budget neutrality of the demonstration. The formula for calculating the reduced variance is, reduced variance equals total variance times applicable percent age. The percentages are determined based on how long Medicaid populations have been enrolled in managed care subject to the demonstration. In the case of Arizona, the managed care program will retain 25 percent of the total variance as future savings fo r the demonstration. Should the state request an extension of its demonstration beyond September 30, 2021, the state must provide actual managed care capitation rate data for AHCCCS enrollees. Budget neutrality will be adjusted again to reflect revised P MPMs based on this data. 104.Exceeding Budget Neutrality. If, at the end of this demonstration period the overall budget neutrality expenditure cap has been exceeded, the excess Federal funds must be returned to CMS. If the demonstration is terminated prior to the end of the budget neutrality agreement, an evaluation of this provision shall be based on the time elapsed through the termination date. Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 79 Amended: January 18, 2019 Attachment A Developing the Evaluation Design Introduction For states that are testing new approaches and flexibilities in their Medicaid programs through section 1115 demonstrations, evaluations are crucial to understand and disseminate what is or is not working and why. The evaluations of new initiatives seek to produce new knowledge and direction for p rograms and inform Medicaid policy for the future. While a narrative about what happened during a demonstration provides important information, the principal focus of the evaluation of a section 1115 demonstration should be obtaining and analyzing data on the process (e.g., whether the demonstration is being implemented as intended), outcomes (e.g., whether the demonstration is having the intended effects on the target population), and impacts of the demonstration (e.g., whether the outcomes observed in the targeted population differ from outcomes in similar populations not affected by the demonstration). Both state and federal governments need rigorous quantitative and qualitative evidence to inform policy decisions. Expectations for Evaluation Designs All states with Medicaid section 1115 demonstrations are required to conduct an evaluation, and the Evaluation Design is the roadmap for conducting the evaluation. The roadmap begins with the stated goals for the demonstration followed by the measurable evaluation questions and quantifiable hypotheses, all to support a determination of the extent to which the demonstration has achieved its goals. When conducting analyses and developing the evaluation reports, every eff ort should be made to follow the approved methodology. However, the state may request, and CMS may agree to, changes in the methodology in appropriate circumstances. The format for the Evaluation Design is as follows: A. General Background Information; B. Evaluation Questions and Hypotheses; C. Methodology; D. Methodological Limitations; E. Attachments. Submission Timelines There is a specified timeline for the state's submission of Evaluation Design and Reports. (The graphic below depicts an example of this timeline). In addition, the state should be aware that section 1115 evaluation documents are public records. The state is required to publish the Evaluation Design to the state's website within 30 days of CMS approval, as per 42 CFR 431.424(e). CMS will also publish a copy to the Medicaid.gov website. Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 80 Amended: January 18, 2019 Required Core Components of All Evaluation Designs The Evaluation Design sets the stage for the Interim and Summative Evaluation Reports. It is important that the Evaluation Design explain the goals and objectives of the demonstration, the hypotheses related to the demonstration, and the methodology (and limitations) for the evaluation. A copy of the state's Driver Diagram (described in more detail in paragraph B2 below) should be included with an explanation of the depicted information. A. General Background Information - In this section, the state should include basic information about the demonstration, such as: 1) The issue/s that the state is trying to address with its section 1115 demonstration and/or expenditure authorities, the potential magnitude of the issue/s, and why the state selected this course of action to address the issue/s (e.g., a narrative on why the state submitted an 1115 demonstration proposal). 2) The name of the demonstration, approval date of the demonstration, and period of time covered by the evaluation; 3) A brief description of the demonstration and history of the implementation, and whether the draft Evaluation Design applies to an amendment, extension, renewal, or expansion of, the demonstration; 4) For renewals, amendments, and major operational changes: A description of any changes to the demonstration during the approval period; the primary reason or reasons for the change; and how the Evaluation Design was altered or augmented to address these changes. 5) Describe the population groups impacted by the demonstration. B. Evaluation Questions and Hypotheses - In this section, the state should: 1) Describe how the state's demonstration goals are translated into quantifiable targets for improvement, so that the performance of the demonstration in achieving these targets could be measured. 2) Include a Driver Diagram to visually aid readers in understanding the rationa le behind the cause and effect of the variants behind the demonstration features and intended outcomes. A driver diagram is a particularly effective modeling tool when Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 81 Amended: January 18, 2019 working to improve health and health care through specific interventions. The diagram includes information about the goal of the demonstration, and the features of the demonstration. A driver diagram depicts the relationship between the aim, the primary drivers that contribute directly to achieving the aim, and the secondary drivers that a re necessary to achieve the primary drivers for the demonstration. For an example and more information on driver diagrams: https://innovation.cms.gov/files/x/hciatwoaimsdrvrs.pdf . 3) Identify the state's hypotheses about the outcomes of the demonstration: a. Discuss how the evaluation questions align with the hypotheses and the goals of the demonstration; b. Address how the research questions / hypotheses of this demonstration promote the o bjectives of Titles XIX and/or XXI. C. Methodology - In this section, the state is to describe in detail the proposed research methodology. The focus is on showing that the evaluation meets the prevailing standards of scientific and academic rigor, and the results are statistically valid and reliable, and that where appropriate it builds upon other published research (use references). This section provides the evidence that the demonstration evaluation will use the best available data; reports on, controls for, and makes appropriate adjustments for the limitations of the data and their effects on results; and discusses the generalizability of results. This section should provide enough transparency to explain what will be measured and how. Specifically, this section establishes: 1) Evaluation Design - Provide information on how the evaluation will be designed. For example, will the evaluation utilize a pre/post comparison? A post -only assessment? Will a comparison group be included? 2) Target and Comparison Populations - Describe the characteristics of the target and comparison populations, to include the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Include information about the level of analysis (beneficiary, provider, or program level), and if populations will be stratified into subgroups. Additionally discuss the sampling methodology for the populations, as well as support that a statistically reliable sample size is available. 3) Evaluation Period - Describe the time periods for which data will be included. 4) Evaluation Measures - List all measures that will be calculated to evaluate the demonstration. Include the measure stewards (i.e., the organization(s) responsible for the evaluation data elements/sets by \"owning\", defining, validating; securing; and submitting for endorsement, etc.) Include numerator and denominator information. Additional items to ensure: a. The measures contain assessments of both process and outcomes to evaluate the effects of the demonstration during the period of approval. b. Qualitative analysis methods may be used, and must be described in detail. c. Benchmarking and comparisons to national and state standards, should be used, where appropriate. Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 82 Amended: January 18, 2019 d. Proposed health measures could include CMS's Core Set of Health Care Quality Mea sures for Children in Medicaid and CHIP, Consumer Assessment of Health Care Providers and Systems (CAHPS), the Initial Core Set of Health Care Quality Measures for Medicaid -Eligible Adults and/or measures endorsed by National Quality Forum (NQF). e. Proposed performance metrics can be selected from nationally recognized metrics, for example from sets developed by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation or for meaningful use under Health Information Technology (HIT). f. Among considerations in s electing the metrics shall be opportunities identified by the state for improving quality of care and health outcomes, and controlling cost of care. 5) Data Sources - Explain where the data will be obtained, and efforts to validate and clean the data. Discu ss the quality and limitations of the data sources. If primary data (data collected specifically for the evaluation) - The methods by which the data will be collected, the source of the proposed question/responses, the frequency and timing of data colle ction, and the method of data collection. (Copies of any proposed surveys must be reviewed with CMS for approval before implementation). 6) Analytic Methods - This section includes the details of the selected quantitative and/or qualitative measures to adequately assess the effectiveness of the demonstration. This section should: a. Identify the specific statistical testing which will be undertaken for each measu re (e.g., t -tests, chi -square, odds ratio, ANOVA, regression). Table A is an example of how the state might want to articulate the analytic methods for each research question and measure. b. Explain how the state will isolate the effects of the demonstratio n (from other initiatives occurring in the state at the same time) through the use of comparison groups. c. A discussion of how propensity score matching and difference in differences design may be used to adjust for differences in comparison populations over time (if applicable). d. The application of sensitivity analyses, as appropriate, should be considered. 7) Other Additions - The state may provide any other information pertinent to the Evaluation Design of the demonstration. Table A. Example Design Table for the Evaluation of the Demonstration Research Question Outcome measures used to address the research question Sample or population subgroups to be compared Data Sources Analytic Methods Hypothesis 1 Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 83 Amended: January 18, 2019 Research question 1a -Measure 1 -Measure 2 -Measure 3 -Sample e.g. All Medicaid beneficiaries -Beneficiaries with diabetes diagnosis -Medicaid fee- for-service and encounter claims records -Interrupted time series question 1b -Measure 1 -Measure 2 -Measure 3 -Measure 4 -sample, e.g., PPS patients who meet survey selection requirements (used services within the last 6 months) -Patient survey Descriptive statistics Hypothesis 2 Research question 2a -Measure 1 -Measure 2 -Sample, e.g., PPS administrators -Key informants Qualitative analysis of interview material D. Methodological Limitations - This section provides detailed information on the limitations of the evaluation. This could include the design, the data sources or collection process, or analytic methods. The state should also identify any efforts to minimize the limitations. Additionally, this section should include any information about features of the demonstration that effectively present methodological constraints that the state would like CMS to take into consideration in its review. E. Special Methodological Considerations - CMS recognizes that there may be certain instances where a state cannot meet the rigor of an evaluation as expected by CMS. In these instances, the state should document for CMS why it is not able to incorporate key components of a rigorous evaluation, including comparison groups and baseline data analyses. Examples of considerations include when the demonstration is considered successful without issues or concerns that would require more regular reporting, such as: a. Operating smoothly without administrative changes; and b. No or minimal appeals and grievances; and c. No state issues with CMS -64 reporting or budget neutrality; and d. No Corrective Action Plans (CAP) for the demonstration. F. Attachments 1) Independent Evaluator. This includes a discussion of the state's process for obtaining an independent entity to conduct the evaluation, including a description of the qualifications that the selected entity must possess, and how the state will assure no conflict of interest. Explain how the state will assure that the Independent Evaluator will conduct a fair and impartial evaluation, prepare an objective Evaluation Report, and that there would be no conflict of interest. The evaluation Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 84 Amended: January 18, 2019 design should include a \"No Conflict of Interest\" statement signed by the independent evaluator. 2) Evaluation Budget. A budget for implementing the evaluation shall be provided with the draft Evaluation Design. It will include the total estimated cost, as well as a breakdown of estimated staff, administrative, and other costs for all aspects of the evaluation. Example s include, but are not limited to: the development of all survey and measurement instruments; quantitative and qualitative data collection; data cleaning and analyses; and reports generation. A justification of the costs may be required by CMS if the es timates provided do not appear to sufficiently cover the costs of the draft Evaluation Design or if CMS finds that the draft Evaluation Design is not sufficiently developed. 3) Timeline and Major Milestones. Describe the timeline for conducting the various evaluation activities, including dates for evaluation- related milestones, including those related to procurement of an outside contractor, if applicable, and deliverables. The Final Evaluation Design shall incorporate an Interim and Summative Evaluation. Pursuant to 42 CFR 431.424(c)(v), this timeline should also include the date by which the Final Summative Evaluation report is due. Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 85 Amended: January 18, 2019 Attachment B Preparing the Evaluation Report Introduction For states that are testing new approaches and flexibilities in their Medicaid programs through section 1115 demonstrations, evaluations are crucial to understand and disseminate what is or is not working and why. The evaluations of new initiatives seek to produce new knowledge and direction for programs and inform Medicaid policy for the future. While a narrative about what happened during a demonstration provides important information, the principal focus of the evaluation of a section 1115 demonstration should be obtaining and analyzing data on the process (e.g. , whether the demonstration is being implemented as intended), outcomes (e.g., whether the demonstration is having the intended effects on the target population), and impacts of the demonstration (e.g., whether the outcomes observed in the targeted populat ion differ from outcomes in similar populations not affected by the demonstration). Both state and federal governments need improved quantitative and qualitative evidence to inform policy decisions. Expectations for Evaluation Reports Medicaid section 1115 demonstrations are required to conduct an evaluation that is valid (the extent to which the evaluation measures what it is intended to measure), and reliable (the extent to which the evaluation could produce the same results when used repeatedly). To this end, the already approved Evaluation Design is a map that begins with the demonstration goals, then transitions to the evaluation questions, and to the specific hypotheses, which will be used to investigate whether the demonstration has achieved its goals. States should have a well-structured analysis plan for their evaluation. With the following kind of information, states and CMS are best poised to inform and shape Medicaid policy in order to improve the health and welfare of Medi caid beneficiaries for decades to come. When conducting analyses and developing the evaluation reports, every effort should be made to follow the approved methodology. However, the state may request, and CMS may agree to, changes in the methodology in appropriate circumstances. When submitting an application for renewal, the interim evaluation report should be posted on the state's website with the application for public comment. Additionally, the interim evaluation report must be included in its entire ty with the application submitted to CMS. Intent of this Attachment Title XIX of the Social Security Act (the Act) requires an evaluation of every section 1115 demonstration. In order to fulfill this requirement, the state's submission must provide a comprehensive written presentation of all key components of the demonstration, and include all required elements specified in the approved Evaluation Design. This Attachment is intended to assist states with organizing the required information in a standardized format and understanding the criteria that CMS will use in reviewing the submitted Interim and Summative Evaluation Reports. The format for the Interim and Summative Evaluation reports is as follows: A. Executive Summary; B. General Background Informat ion; C. Evaluation Questions and Hypotheses; D. Methodology; Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 86 Amended: January 18, 2019 E. Methodological Limitations; F. Results; G. Conclusions; H. Interpretations, and Policy Implications and Interactions with Other State Initiatives; I. Lessons Learned and Recommendations; and J. Attachment(s). Subm ission Timelines There is a specified timeline for the state's submission of Evaluation Designs and Evaluation Reports. These dates are specified in the demonstration Special Terms and Conditions (STCs). (The graphic below depicts an example of this timel ine). In addition, the state should be aware that section 1115 evaluation documents are public records. In order to assure the dissemination of the evaluation findings, lessons learned, and recommendations, the state is required to publish the evaluation design and reports to the state's website within 30 days of CMS approval, as per 42 CFR 431.424(d). CMS will also publish a copy to the Medicaid.gov website. Required Core Components of Interim and Summative Evaluation Reports The section 1115 Evaluation Report presents the research about the section 1115 Demonstration. It is important that the report incorporate a discussion about the structure of the Evaluation Design to explain the goals and objectives of the demonstration, the hypotheses related to the demonstration, and the methodology for the evaluation. A copy of the state's Driver Diagram (described in the Evaluation Design Attachment) must be included with an explanation of the depicted information. The Evaluation Report should present the relevant data and an interpretation of the findings; assess the outcomes (what worked and what did not work); explain the limitations of the design, data, and analyses; offer recommendations regarding what (in hindsight) the state would further advanc e, or do differently, and why; and discuss the implications on future Medicaid policy. Therefore, the state's submission must include: A. Executive Summary - A summary of the demonstration, the principal results, interpretations, and recommendations of the evaluation. B. General Background Information about the Demonstration - In this section, the state should include basic information about the demonstration, such as: Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 87 Amended: January 18, 2019 1) The issues that the state is trying to address with its section 1115 demonstration and/or expenditure authorities, how the state became aware of the issue, the potential magnitude of the issue, and why the state selected this course of action to address the issues. 2) The name of the demonstration, approval date of the demonstration, and period of time covered by the evaluation; 3) A brief description of the demonstration and history of the implementation, and if the evaluation is for an amendment, extension, renewal, or expansion of, the demonstration; 4) For renewals, amendments, and major operational changes: A description of any changes to the demonstration during the approval period; whether the motivation for change was due to political, economic, and fiscal factors at the state and/or federal level; whether the programmatic changes were implemented to improve beneficiary health, provider/health plan performance, or administrative efficiency; and how the Evaluation Design was altered or augmented to address these changes. 5) Describe the population groups impacted by the demonstration. C. Evaluation Ques tions and Hypotheses - In this section, the state should: 1) Describe how the state's demonstration goals were translated into quantifiable targets for improvement, so that the performance of the demonstration in achieving these targets could be measured. Th e inclusion of a Driver Diagram in the Evaluation Report is highly encouraged, as the visual can aid readers in understanding the rationale behind the demonstration features and intended outcomes. 2) Identify the state's hypotheses about the outcomes of the demonstration; a. Discuss how the goals of the demonstration align with the evaluation questions and hypotheses; b. Explain how this Evaluation Report builds upon and expands earlier demonstration evaluation findings (if applicable); and c. Address how the resea rch questions / hypotheses of this demonstration promote the objectives of Titles XIX and XXI. D. Methodology - In this section, the state is to provide an overview of the research that was conducted to evaluate the section 1115 demonstration consistent with the approved Evaluation Design. The evaluation Design should also be included as an attachment to the report. The focus is on showing that the evaluation builds upon other published research (use references), and meets the prevailing standards of scientific and academic rigor, and the results are statistically valid and reliable. An interim report should provide any available data to date, including both quantitative and qualitative assessments. The Evaluation Design should assure there is appropriate data development and collection in a timely manner to support developing an interim evaluation. This section provides the evidence that the demonstration evaluation used the best available data and describes why potential alternative data sources were not used; reported on, controlled for , and made appropriate adjustments for the limitations of the data and their effects on results; and discusses the generalizability of results. This section should provide enough transparency to explain what was measured and how. Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 88 Amended: January 18, 2019 Specifically, this sectio n establishes that the approved Evaluation Design was followed by describing: 1) Evaluation Design - Will the evaluation be an assessment of: pre/post, post -only, with or without comparison groups, etc? 2) Target and Comparison Populations - Describe the target and comparison populations; include inclusion and exclusion criteria. 3) Evaluation Period - Describe the time periods for which data will be collected 4) Evaluation Measures - What measures are used to evaluate the demonstration, and who are the measure stewar ds? 5) Data Sources - Explain where the data will be obtained, and efforts to validate and clean the data. 6) Analytic Methods - Identify specific statistical testing which will be undertaken for each measure (t -tests, chi -square, odds ratio, ANOVA, regression, etc.). 7) Other Additions - The state may provide any other information pertinent to the evaluation of the demonstration. E. Methodological Limitations This section provides sufficient information for discerning the strengths and weaknesses of the study de sign, data sources/collection, and analyses. F. Results - In this section, the state presents and uses the quantitative and qualitative data to show to whether and to what degree the evaluation questions and hypotheses of the demonstration were achieved. The findings should visually depict the demonstration results (tables, charts, graphs). This sect ion should include information on the statistical tests conducted. G. Conclusions - In this section, the state will present the conclusions about the evaluation results . 1) In general, did the results show that the demonstration was/was not effective in achieving the goals and objectives established at the beginning of the demonstration? 2) Based on the findings, discuss the outcomes and impacts of the demonstration and identify the opportunities for improvements. Specifically: a. If the state did not full y achieve its intended goals, why not? What could be done in the future that would better enable such an effort to more fully achieve those purposes, aims, objectives, and goals? H. Interpretations, Policy Implications and Interactions with Other State Initiatives - In this section, the state will discuss the section 1115 demonstration within an overall Medicaid context and long range planning. This should include interrelations of the demonstration with other aspects of the state's Medicaid program, interactions with other Medicaid demonstrations, and other federal awards affecting service delivery, health outcomes and the cost of care under Medicaid. This section provides the state with an opportunity to provide interpretation of the data using evaluative reasoning to make judgments about the demonstration. This section should also include a discussion of the implications of the findings at both the state and national levels. Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 89 Amended: January 18, 2019 I. Lessons Learned and Recommendations - This section of the Evaluat ion Report involves the transfer of knowledge. Specifically, the \"opportunities\" for future or revised demonstrations to inform Medicaid policymakers, advocates, and stakeholders is just as significant as identifying current successful strategies. Based on the evaluation results: 1) What lessons were learned as a result of the demonstration? 2) What would you recommend to other states which may be interested in implementing a similar approach? J. Attachment 1) Evaluation Design: Provide the CMS -approved Evaluation Design Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 90 Amended: January 18, 2019 Attachment C AHCCCS Disproportionate Share Hospital Program DSH 102 Congress established the Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) program in 1981 to provide financial support to hospitals that serve a significant number of low -income patients with special needs. This document sets forth the criteria by which Arizona defines DSH hospitals and the methodology through which DSH payments are calculated and distributed. The document is divided into the following major topics: Hospital eligibility requirements Data on a State Plan Year Basis Timing of eligibility determination Medicaid Inpatient Utilization Rate (MIUR) calculation (Overall and Group 1 and 1A eligibility) Low Income Utilization Rate (LIUR) calculation (Group 2 and 2A eligibility) Governmentally -operated hospitals (Group 4 eligibility) Obstetrician Requirements Payment Group 5 Eligibility Determination Aggregate Limits Reconciliations Certified Public Expenditures (CPEs) Grievances and appeals Other provisions Hospital Eligibility Requirements In order to be considered a DSH hospital in Arizona, a hospital must be located in the state of Arizona, must submit the information required by AHCCCS by the specified due date, must satisfy one (1) of the conditions in Column A, AND must satisfy one (1) of the conditions in Column B, AND must satisfy the condition in Column C. COLUMN A COLUMN B COLUMN C 1. The hospital has a Medicaid Inpatient Utilization Rate (MIUR) which is at least one standard deviation above the mean MIUR for all hospitals 1. The hospital has at least two (2) obstetricians who have staff privileges at the hospital and who have agreed to provide obstetric services to Medicaid The hospital has an MIUR of at least 1 percent Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 91 Amended: January 18, 2019 receiving a Medicaid payment in the state and is an IHS facility, tribally owned and/or operated facility, or an other federally owned or operated facility (\"Group 1\") 1.A. The hospital has a MIUR which is at least one standard deviation above the mean MIUR for all hospitals receiving a Medicaid payment in the state and is a privately owned or privately operated hospital licensed by the state of Arizona (\"Group 1A\") 2. The hospital has a Low Income Utilization Rate (LIUR) that exceeds 25% and is an IHS facility, tribally owned and/or operated facility, or an other federally owned or operated facility (\"Group 2\") 2.A. The hospital has a LIUR that exceeds 25% and is a privately owned or privately operated hospital licensed by the state of Arizona (\"Group 2A\") 3. The hospital is a governmentally - operated hospital and is not an IHS facility, tribally owned and/or operated facility, or an other federally owned or operated facility. (\"Group 4\") patients 2. The hospital is located in a rural area, defined in accordance with Section 1923(d)(2)(B) of the Social Security Act, and has at least two (2) physicians with staff privileges to perform non-emergency obstetric procedures 3. The patients of the hospital are predominantly under 18 years of age 4. The hospital was in existence on December 22, 1987 but did not offer non-emergency obstetric services as of that date Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 92 Amended: January 18, 2019 Medicare Certification In addition to the eligibility requirements outlined above, in order to receive payment under Medicaid, hospitals must meet the requirements for participation as a hospital in Medicare (except in the case of medical supervision of nurse -midwife services). Therefore, for purposes of DSH, the facility must be Medicare- certified during the state plan rate year for which the initial DSH payment is made. If a facility is Medicare- certified for the full state plan rate year for which the initial DSH payment is made, but subsequently loses that certification, the facility remains eligible to receive the payment (together with any payment adjustments). If a hospital is only Medicare- certified for part of the state plan rate year for which the initial DSH payment is made, the eligibility and the payment will be calculated based on the period for which the hospital was Medicare- certified. Data on a State P lan Year Basis DSH payments are made based on the State Plan Year. The State Plan Year (or State Plan Rate Year or SPY) is equivalent to the Federal Fiscal Year and runs from October 1 to September 30 of each year. The calculations to determine eligibility for, and the amount of, DSH payments, will be made on the basis of the State Plan Year. This requirement will impact the information collected and submitted by all hospitals that do not have a fiscal year and/or CMS 2552 Report year that runs from 10/1 to 9/30. In order to make the necessary calculations to determine eligibility and payments on a State Plan Year basis, hospitals that do not have a fiscal/CMS Report year that runs from 10/1 to 9/30 will have to submit cost reports and other dat a elements for each of the fiscal/CMS Report years that encompass the State Plan Year. For example, for SPY 2008 (10/1/07 to 9/30/08), for a hospital that has a CMS 2552 Report year that runs from 7/1 to 6/30, the hospital will have to submit the CMS 2552 Report and other data elements for the fiscal/CMS Report year that ends on 6/30/08 and the same information for the fiscal/CMS Report year that ends 6/30/09.1 As discussed later in this Attachment, AHCCCS will extract all Title XIX (Medicaid) claims and encounters from the PMMIS system on the basis of each hospital's CMS 2552 Report year and these data will serve as the basis for all Medicaid days, charges and payments. Similarly, AHCCCS will collect all Medicaid and Non -Title XIX payments (for the Comprehensive Medical and Dental Program, behavioral health services and payments for trauma and emergency departments) on the basis of each hospital's CMS 2552 Report year. 1 Note however that the use of the 2008 and 2009 repor ts and information referred to in this paragraph is for the determination of final DSH payments. For the initial 2008 DSH payments, reports and information for 2006 and 2007 will be submitted. For a discussion of Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 93 Amended: January 18, 2019 initial payments, final payments and data sources, see the discussions that follow. Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 94 Amended: January 18, 2019 All data compiled by the hospitals (e.g. total, uninsured and charity days; charges and payments; and state and local subsidy payment information not provided by AHCCCS) will be compiled on a CMS 2552 Report year basis. Except in the case where a hospital's fiscal year is identical to the State Plan Year - the calculations to determine eligibility for, and the amount of, DSH payments, will be performed separately for each hospital's fiscal year and these results will be prorated based on the distribution of months from each of the two years that encompass the SPY. For example, for SPY 2008 (10/1/07 to 9/30/08), for a hospital that has a CMS 2552 Report year that runs from 7/1 to 6/30, the proration of the results of the calculations will be derived by summing: 1. 9/12th of the result of the calculations performed for the fiscal/CMS Report year ending 6/30/08, and 2. 3/12th of the result of the calculations performed for the fiscal/CMS Report year ending 6/30/09. Timing of Eligibility Determination The eligibility determination calculations will be performed annually for all hospitals located in the state of Arizona that are registered as providers with AHCCCS that have submitted the information required by this document and/or as otherwise requested by AHCCCS during the application process. In order to be considered \"submitted during the application process,\" the information must be received by AHCCCS by the due date specified in a request for information communi cated to the Chief Financial Officer of the hospital. This does not preclude AHCCCS from using other information available to AHCCCS to verify or supplement the information submitted by the hospitals. The calculations will be performed with the informatio n submitted by hospitals, or available to AHCCCS on the due date specified as the deadline for the submission of information. The eligibility determination will be made in at least two steps: 1. The first step of the eligibility process will occur in the state plan year of the initial DSH payment. To determine initial eligibility, AHCCCS will: a. Extract from the PMMIS system all inpatient and outpatient hospital claims and encounters by date of service for each registered hospital for that hospital's fiscal years that encompass the state plan rate year two years prior to the state plan year of the initial DSH payment. b. Based on the extracted claims and encounters data and data provided by the hospitals, determine for each hospital whether or not that hospital has a Medicaid Inpatient Utilization Rate (MIUR) of at least 1%. For hospitals that qualify under this criteria, determine if the hospital: i. Meets the criteria for Group 1 ii. Meets the criteria for Group 1A iii. Meets the criteria for Group 2 iv. Meets the criteria for Group 2A v. Meets the criteria for Group 4 Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 95 Amended: January 18, 2019 c. Based on certifications filed by each hospital, determine if the hospital satisfies the criteria in Column B above. 2. The second step of the eligibility process will occur in the state plan rate year two years after the state plan rate year of the initial DSH payment using the same steps above except that the data will be from the actual state plan year(s) for which the DSH payment is made. 3. AHCCCS may redetermine any hospital's eligibility for any DSH payment should the agency become aware of any information that may prove that the hospital was not eligible for a DSH payment. MIUR Calculation (Overall Eligibility Criteria and Group 1 and Group 1A Eligibility) A hospital's Medicaid Inpatient Utilization Rate (MIUR) w ill determine the hospital's overall eligibility for DSH (Column C above) as well as the hospital's eligibility for Group 1 and Group 1A. A hospital's MIUR is calculated using the following equation: MIUR = Total Medicaid Inpatient Days Total Number of Inpatient Days The calculation will be performed based on the state plan year. In order to find each hospital's MIUR for the state plan year, AHCCCS will calculate a MIUR separately for each hospital fiscal/CMS Report year that encompasses the relevant State Plan Year and then prorate the results from the two hospital fiscal/CMS Report years as described in the discussion above entitled \"Data on a State Plan Year Basis\". AHCCCS will perform this calculation twice. The first calculation will be p erformed using the state plan year two years prior to the year of the initial DSH payment. The second calculation will encompass the state plan year of the initial DSH payment. The CMS 2552 form(s) to be used is/are the most recent available cost report(s) that encompass the relevant state plan year AHCCCS may apply trending factors for the initial calculation to account for changes in utilization and/or population (e.g., due to changes in Medicaid eligibility criteria). The adjustments will reflect increa ses and decreases resulting from changes in operations or circumstances that are not reflected in the information from the state plan year two years prior. If a hospital has a MIUR of at least 1%, and the obstetrical criteria of Column B above are satisfied, it will meet the overall eligibility criteria. If a hospital has a MIUR which is at least one standard deviation above the mean MIUR for all Arizona hospitals receiving a Medicaid payment in that State Plan Year, it will meet the eligibility fo r Group 1 or 1A. Note that meeting overall eligibility criteria does not ensure that a hospital will meet the eligibility criteria for any Group. In performing the calculations: 1. \"Inpatient Days\" includes: a. Fee-for-service and managed care days, and Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 96 Amended: January 18, 2019 b. Each day in which an individual (including a newborn) is an inpatient in the hospital, whether or not the individual is in a specialized ward, and whether or not the individual remains in the hospital for lack of suitable placement elsewhere. 2. AHCCCS will extrac t claims and encounter data for \"Medicaid Inpatient Days\" \" from the PMMIS system. The data extraction will be performed using dates of service as specified in the earlier section titled \"Timing of Eligibility Determination,\" found in both step 1(a) and ep 2. \"Medicaid Inpatient Days\" includes all adjudicated inpatient days for Title XIX clients, including days paid by Medicare, except for Title XIX members between 21 and 65 years of age who is in an Institution for Mental Disease (IMD). 3. For \"Total number of inpatient days\" data should be taken from hospital cost reports. The specific figures to be used are found on Worksheet S -3, Lines 1 and 8 through 13, Column 8 plus Line 16 through 18, Column 8 for hospital subprovider days. Calculation of the mean MIUR and the Standard Deviation In calculating the mean MIUR, the MIUR calculated for the state plan year for all Arizona hospitals that have received a Medicaid payment will be used. The mean MIUR - the average of the individual MIURs - will be calc ulated based on all the individual state plan year MIURs greater than zero (i.e. including the MIURs that are less than 1%). The standard deviation will be calculated based on the same list of individual hospital MIURs. LIUR Calculation (Group 2 and 2 A Eligibility) A hospital's Low Income Utilization Rate (LIUR) will determine the hospital's eligibility for Group 2. A hospital's LIUR is calculated by summing the following two equations: Total Medicaid Patient Services Charges + Total State and Local Cash Subsidies Total Charges for Patient Services LIUR = + Total Inpatient Charges Attributable to Charity Care -Cash Subsidies Portion Total Inpatient Charges The calculation will be performed based on the state plan year. In order to find each hospital's LIUR for the state plan year, AHCCCS will calculate a LIUR separately for each hospital fiscal/CMS Report year that encompasses the relevant state plan year and then prorate the results from the two hospital fiscal/CMS Report years as described in the discussion above entitled \"Data on a State Plan Year Basis\". If a hospital has a LIUR that exceeds 25% it will meet the eligibility for Group 2 or 2A. AHCCCS will perform this calculation twice. The first calculation will be performed using the state plan year two years prior to the year of the initial DSH payment. The Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 97 Amended: January 18, 2019 second calculation will encompass the state plan year of the initial DSH payment. The CMS 2552 form(s) to be used is/are the most recent available report(s) that encompass the relevant state plan year. AHCCCS may apply trending factors for the initial calculation to account for changes in utilization, population (e.g., due to changes in Medicaid eligibility criteria), supplemental payment s, and/or Medicaid payments and rates. The adjustments may increase or decrease the days, costs, charges, or payments reflected on the cost reports, Medicaid data and/or uninsured information. The adjustments will reflect increases and decreases resulting from changes in operations or circumstances that are not reflected in the information from the state plan year two years prior. In performing the calculations: 1. \"Total Medicaid Patient Services Charges\" includes Title XIX charges for inpatient and outpatient services (both fee -for-service and managed care) extracted from PMMIS. 2. \"Total Medicaid Patient Services Charges\" does not include DSH payments or payments made for GME, Critical Access Hospitals, Rural Hospital Inpatient Payments or any other Title XIX supplemental payments authorized by the Legislature as these amounts are effectively included in charges. 3. \"Total State and Local Cash Subsidies for Patient Services\" includes payments made with state -only or local -only funds. AHCCCS will account for the amounts of such payments made during the relevant fiscal years. These payments include, but are not limited to a. Payments made for: i. Non-Title XIX and Non- Title XXI enrollees in the Comprehensive Medical and Dental Program (CMDP), this information is provided to AHCCCS from CMDP ii. Non-Title XIX and Non- Title XXI enrollees in the Behavioral Health Services Program iii. The support of trauma centers and emergency departments b. Payments reported by hospitals to AHCCCS which are made by: i. An appropriation of state -only funds ii. The Arizona State Hospital iii. Local governments including (but not limited to): (1) Tax levies dedicated to support a governmentally -operated hospital (2) Tax levies from a hospital district organized pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 48- 1901 et seq. (3) Subsidies for the general support of a hospital 4. \"Total State and Local Cash Subsidies for Patient Services\" does not include payments for or by: a. Inpatient or outpatient services for employees of state or local governments Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 98 Amended: January 18, 2019 b. Governmentally -operated AHCCCS health plans or program contractors c. Tax reductions or abatements 5. \"Total Charges for Patient Services\" includes total gross patient revenue for hospital services (including hospital subprovider charges) from hospital cost report(s). The specific figures to be used are found on Worksheet C Part I, Column 8 Line 200 less Lines 44 to 46, less Lines 88 to 89, less Lines 94 to 101, less Lines 105 to 112, and less Lines 115 to 117. If charges for Rural Health Clinics or Federally Qualified Health Centers appear anywhere other than on Lines 88 to 89, these charge amounts should also be deducted from Line 200. 6. \"Total Inpatient Charges Attributable to Charity Care\" includes the amount of inpatient services - stated as charges - that is provided free to individuals who cannot afford health care due to inadequate resources as determined by the hospital's charity care policy and do not otherwise qualify for government subsidized insurance. In order to qualify as charity care, payment may neither be received nor expected. This data i s taken from the hospital claims and financial records submitted with information requested by AHCCCS during the application process. 7. \"Total Inpatient Charges Attributable to Charity Care\" does not include bad debt expense or contract allowances and discounts offered to third party payors or self pay patients that do not qualify for charity care pursuant to the hospital's charity care policy. 8. \"Cash Subsidies Portion Attributable to Inpatient\" means that portion of \"Total state and Local Cash Subsidie s for Patient Services\" that is attributable to inpatient services. Data should be taken from the hospital claims and financial records submitted with information requested by AHCCCS during the application process. If the hospital receives subsidies for the general operation of the hospital, allocation between outpatient and inpatient should be based on the percentage of total inpatient charges to total charges from patient services. 9. \"Total Inpatient Charges\" includes total inpatient and hospital subprovider charges without any deductions for contract allowances or discounts offered to third party payors or self pay patients. Data should be taken from hospital cost report(s). The specific figures to be used are found in Worksheet C, Part I, Column 6 Line 200 less Lines 44 to 46, less Lines 88 to 89, less Lines 94 to 101, less Lines 105 to 112, and less Lines 115 to 117. If charges for Rural Health Clinics or Federally Qualified Health Clinics appear anywhere other than on Lines 88 to 89, these charge amounts should also be deducted from Line 200. Governmentally- Operated Hospitals (Group 4 Eligibility) Because the state has designated all governmentally -operated hospitals (represented in Group 4) as DSH hospitals, no eligibility calculations are required other than the minimum qualifications in columns B and C. Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 99 Amended: January 18, 2019 Obstetrician Requirements In order to ensure that hospitals receiving DSH payments meet requirements related to obstetricians, all hospitals that are determined to have a MIUR of at least 1% must file a completed certification statement indicating their compliance with the requirements. Any hospital that fails to return the certification statement by the date specified by AHCCCS will not be eligible to receive DSH payments for the state plan year o f the initial DSH payment. For the determination of a hospital's compliance with the obstetrician requirement, the certification will be based on the state plan year of the initial DSH payment from the start of the state plan year to the date of certifica tion. The certification statement shall incorporate the following language: I certify that the hospital indicated below currently has and has had since the beginning of the current state plan year at least two (2) obstetricians with staff privileges who have agreed to provide obstetric services to individuals eligible for Medicaid, OR I certify that the hospital indicated below is located in a rural area and currently has and has had since the beginning of the current state plan year at least two (2) qualified physicians with staff privileges who have agreed to provide non- emergency obstetric services to individuals eligible for Medicaid, OR I certify that the hospital indicated below did not offer non -emergency obstetric services to the general population as of December 22, 1987, or that the inpatients of the hospital are predominantly individuals under 18 years of age. Payment Pools and Changing Payment Levels The DSH program in Arizona is funded through a six pool system. With the exception of Group 5, each of the pools correlates to one of the hospital eligibility Groups. The amounts of funding for the pools for the current state plan year are contained in Exhibit 3. When determining the payment amounts, hospitals in Group 1 and 2 will be calculated concurrently, and if a hospital qualifies for more than one pool, the hospital will be categorized into the pool that maximizes its DSH payment. When determining the payment amounts, hospitals in Group 1A and 2A will be calculated concurrently, and if a hospital qualifies for more than one pool, the hospital will be categorized into the pool that maximizes its DSH payment. There are five instances where the initial DSH payment to one or more non-governmental hospitals may change: 1. A hospital is found on the second eligibility determination (or any subsequent Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 100 Amended: January 18, 2019 eligibility check) to not be eligible for a DSH payment in the state plan year of the initial DSH payment. In this instance, the amount of payment to the hospital will be recouped and the recouped amount will be distributed proportionately based on the initial DSH payments to the eligible hospitals remaining in the pool in which the ineligible hospital was placed in the state plan year of the initial DSH payment, up to each hospital's OBRA limit (see discussion below). 2. A hospital is found to have exceeded its finalized OBRA limit (see discussions below). In this instance, the amount of payment to the hospital in excess of its finalized OBRA limit will be recouped, and the recouped amount will be distributed proportionately based on the initial DSH payments to the eligible hospitals remaining in the pool in which the hospital was placed in the state plan year of the initial DSH payment, up to each hospital's finalized OBRA limit. 3. In the event of a recoupment of an initial DSH payment and as a result of the process of distributing the recoupment to the pool to which the recouped payment was originally made, the distribution would result in all the hospitals in the pool receiving a total DSH paym ent in excess of their finalized OBRA limit, the amount of recoupment will be proportionately allocated among the remaining non- governmental hospital pools based on the initial DSH payments and distributed proportionately based on the initial DSH payments to the hospitals in the remaining non-governmental pools up to each hospital's finalized OBRA limit. 4. In the event that litigation (either by court order or settlement), or a CMS audit, financial review, or proposed disallowance requires AHCCCS to issue DS H payment amounts to one or more hospitals in a pool in excess of the initial DSH payment amount, AHCCCS will proportionately recoup funds based on the initial DSH payments from the remaining hospitals in the pool or pools effected to satisfy the requirement. This process will be followed to ensure that the annual federal DSH allotment is not exceeded. 5. In the event that a hospital qualifies for a DSH payment in the second (or any subsequent) eligibility determination that did not qualify in the initial eli gibility determination, that hospital will receive the minimum payment under the DSH program which is $5,000. AHCCCS may set aside monies from the initial payment to make these minimum payments. AHCCCS may use monies which were set aside for hospitals whic h did not qualify for the initial determination but qualified in subsequent determinations. In the event that monies set aside are insufficient to provide the minimum payments, AHCCCS will proportionately recoup funds based on the initial DSH payments from the remaining hospitals in the pool or pools effected to satisfy the requirement. The payment amount to each governmentally -operated hospital will be determined during the state plan year of the initial DSH payment. The payment amount will only change if the total DSH payment to a hospital in the pool would be in excess of its finalized OBRA limit (see discussion below). To the extent that the excess amount recouped from a governmentally - operated hospital can be distributed to other hospitals in the pool without exceeding the interim or finalized OBRA limits of the remaining governmentally -operated Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 101 Amended: January 18, 2019 hospitals, the excess amount will be distributed to the other governmentally -operated hospitals. Determination of Payment Amounts The amount that each non- governmental hospital receives as an initial DSH payment from the pool for which it qualifies is determined by a weighting method that considers both the amounts/points over the Group threshold and the volume of services. The volume of services is eith er measured by Title XIX days or net inpatient revenue, depending upon the group being considered. Hospitals that qualify for Group 1, 1A, 2, or 2A There are ten steps to determining the DSH payment amount for hospitals that qualify for Group 1, 1A, 2, or 2A. After determining the initial DSH payment amount through the ten step process, there is a final adjustment that may be made depending on the result of the hospital's OBRA limit. These steps will need to be performed separately: once for Groups 1 and 2 and once for Groups 1A and 2A. 1. Determine Points Exceeding Threshold. Each of the Groups 1 and 2 has thresholds established for qualification of the hospital. For Group 1 it is one standard deviation above the mean MIUR; for Group 2 it is greater than 25% LIUR. Step 1 merely determines the difference between each hospital's \"score\" for the Group measure and that Group's threshold. 2. Convert Points Exceeding Threshold into a Value. Each of the Groups 1 and 2 are measuring a value: for Group 1 the value is Medicaid days; for Group 2 it is charges. Step 2 multiplies the Points Exceeding Threshold by the value of the associated Group. 3. Determine Relative Weight of Each Hospital in Each Group. The relative weight of each hospital in each Group is determined by dividing each hospital's value for a Group determined in Step 2 by the total of all hospital values for that Group. 4. Initial Allocation of Dollars to Each Hospital in Each Group. The amount of funds available to each of the Groups 1 and 2 is determined by AHCCCS as authorized by the Legislature. The funding amount for the current state plan year is contained in Exhibit 3. The initial allocation to each hospital in each group is determined by multiplying each hospital's relative weight in a Group (determine d in Step 3) by the amount of funds available for that Group. 5. Maximize Allocation of Dollars Between Group 1 and Group 2. This step selects the greater of the allocation to each hospital between Group 1 and Group 2. 6. Recalculating the Relative Weights of Each Hospital in Group 1 and Group 2. Since Step 5 eliminated hospitals from both Group 1 and Group 2, it is necessary to redetermine the weight for each remaining hospital. This is accomplished by Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 102 Amended: January 18, 2019 dividing the value of each hospital remaining in Group 1 and Group 2 after Step 5 by the total of the remaining hospitals. 7. Second Allocation of Dollars Within Group 1 and Group 2. The second allocation to each hospital remaining in Group 1 and Group 2 is determined by multiplying each hospital's recalculated relative weight pursuant to Step 6 by the amount of funds available for that Group. 8. Identifying Minimum Payment. It is policy that the minimum payment made to any hospital qualifying for DSH is $5,000. This step identifies any amount thus far determined f or any hospital that is less than $5,000. 9. Ensuring Minimum Payment. This step replaces any amount thus far determined for any hospital that is less than $5,000 with a $5,000 amount. 10. Determining Penultimate Payment Amount. With the replacement of values w ith the $5,000 minimum amounts, it is necessary to recalculate and redistribute the values within any Group where the minimum payment amount was imposed in order to ensure that the total funding for a Group is not exceeded. Step 10 accomplishes this. After determining the penultimate initial DSH payment amount for each hospital that qualifies for Group 1, 1A, 2, or 2A a check of the determined amount is made against the hospital's initial OBRA limit. The description of that limit follows in a subsequent section. If the initial DSH payment amount exceeds the initial OBRA limit, the initial DSH amount is set to the OBRA limit and the excess amount is distributed to the remaining hospitals in the Group, with a recheck of the initial DSH amounts ag ainst the OBRA limit. This process is repeated until all amounts are distributed or all hospitals in the Group are at their OBRA limit. Hospitals that qualify for Group 4 To determine the initial DSH payment amount for each governmentally -operated hospi tal, the relative allocation percentage for each hospital is computed based on the lesser of the hospital's CPE and the amount of funding specified by the Legislature. The total funding amount for the current state plan year for Group 4 is contained in Exhibit 3. The funding amount for the IMD hospital in Group 4 is the IMD DSH limit for Arizona. The funding amount for the other governmentally -operated hospital in Group 4 is the remainder of the Group 4 pool amount, including any amount unclaimed by the IMD hospital. OBRA Limits The DSH payment ultimately received by qualifying non- governmental hospitals is the lesser of the amount calculated pursuant to the above -described methodologies or the hospital's OBRA limit. The DSH payment ultimately received by governmentally -operated hospitals is the lesser of the amount funded and specified by the Legislature or the hospital's Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 103 Amended: January 18, 2019 finalized OBRA limit. All DSH payments are subject to the federal DSH allotment. The OBRA limit is calculated using the following equat ion: Pursuant to the above equation, the OBRA limit is comprised of two components: 1. The amount of uncompensated care costs associated with providing inpatient and outpatient hospital services to Medicaid individuals (the Medicaid shortfall), and 2. The amount of uncompensated care costs associated with providing inpatient and outpatient hospital services to individuals with no source of third party coverage for the inpatient and outpatient hospital services they received (uninsured costs). The OBRA limit for the state plan year of the initial DSH payment will be computed for each hospital up to three times: 1. The OBRA limit will be calculated in the state plan year of the initial DSH payment for all eligible hospitals based on the cost report(s) and days and charges and other program data for the state plan rate year two years prior to the state plan year of the initial DSH payment 2. For governmentally -operated hospitals, the OBRA limit will be recalculated when the cost report for the state plan year of the initial DSH payment is filed 3. The final calculation of each hospital's OBRA limit will be performed when the cost report f or the state plan year of the initial DSH payment is finalized The steps to computing the OBRA limit are2: 1. The hospital shall prepare its CMS 2552 Report (cost report(s)). Each hospital must complete the cost report to determ ine cost center -specific per diems (for inpatient routine services) and ratios of cost to charges (RCC) (for ancillary services). The cost reports must be completed based on Medicare cost principles and Medicare cost allocation process as specified in the CMS 2552 instructions and the CMS Provider Reimbursement Manual, volumes 15- 1 and 15- 2, including updates. 2 Note: The following discussion applies to hospitals that do not have a per diem ancillary allocation methodology approved by Medicare. For the steps to calculate the OBRA limit Uncompensated Care Costs Incurred Serving Medicaid Recipients + Uncompensated Care Costs Incurred Servicing the Uninsur ed Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 104 Amended: January 18, 2019 for governmental hospitals that do have such approval, see Exhibit 2 to this Attachment C. Non-governmental hospitals that have such approval should contact AHCCCS for further information. Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 105 Amended: January 18, 2019 2. Medicaid shortfall will be calculated based on information available from PMMIS, other AHCCCS financial systems, and the cost report. 3. Uninsured costs will be calculated based on uninsured days and charges and other program data collected by each hospital from its claims and financial records, other systems, and the cost report. The sum of each hospital's Medicaid shortfall (whether positive or negative) and uninsured costs (whether positive or negative) is that hospital's OBRA limit. The Medicaid Shortfall The data used to calcul ate the Medicaid shortfall is extracted from the cost report(s) as well as from the AHCCCS PMMIS system and other AHCCCS financial reporting systems. The Medicaid shortfall will be calculated for each hospital for each fiscal/CMS Report year that encompass es the state plan year. The resulting Medicaid shortfall for each fiscal/CMS Report year will be prorated to derive the state plan year Medicaid shortfall according to the above discussion entitled \"Data on a State Plan Year Basis\". The information from AHCCCS will include, but not be limited to: 1. The number of Medicaid fee for service (FFS) inpatient hospital days for each inpatient routine service cost center on the cost report 2. The number of Medicaid managed care inpatient hospital days for each inpatient routine service cost center on the cost report 3. The Medicaid inpatient and outpatient hospital FFS charges for each ancillary cost center on the cost report 4. The amounts of payments made by or on behalf of patients and payments made by third partie s related to Medicaid inpatient and outpatient hospital FFS services 5. The amounts of Medicaid payments made by AHCCCS for inpatient and outpatient hospital FFS services 6. The Medicaid inpatient and outpatient hospital managed care charges for each ancillary cost center on the cost report 7. The amounts of payments made by or on behalf of patients and payments made by third parties related to Medicaid inpatient and outpatient hospital services for health plans and program contractors 8. The amounts of Medicaid payments made by managed care organizations for inpatient and outpatient hospital services 9. Other amounts of Medicaid payments for Medicaid inpatient and outpatient services furnished during the Medicaid state plan year under review (e.g. GME, CAH, etc.) 10. AHCCCS may apply trending factors for the initial payment to account for changes in utilization (e.g., due to changes in Medicaid eligibility criteria), supplemental payments, and Medicaid payments and rates. The adjustments may increase or decrease the days, costs, charges, or payments reflected on the cost reports, Medicaid and/or uninsured information. The adjustments will reflect increases and decreases resulting from changes in operations or circumstances that are not reflected in the information from th e state plan year two years prior. Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 106 Amended: January 18, 2019 For each hospital, the cost -center -specific per diems and ratios of cost to charges (RCC) from the cost report will be applied to the data extracted from PMMIS (days and charges) to determine the cost of providing inpatient and outpatient Medicaid services. Inpatient and outpatient Medicaid services will not include services reimbursed as Rural Health Clinic or Federally Qualified Health Clinic services. The per diem amounts will be calculated by dividing: The individual amounts on Worksheet B, Part I Column 24 Lines (and where applicable Subscript Lines) 30 to 35 and Lines 40 to 43 By The corresponding day totals on Line 1, Lines (and where applicable Subscript Lines) 8 through 13 and Lines 16 to 18(for inpatient hospital subproviders) from Worksheet S-3, Part I Column 8. Note: when calculating the Adults and Pediatrics (General Routine Care) per diem, the amount on Worksheet B, Part I, Column 24, Line 30 should have deducted the amounts appearing on Worksheet D -1, Part I, Lines 26 and 36 and the amount on Worksheet S -3, Part I, Column 8, Line 1 should have added the amount appearing on Line 28 (observation bed days). The ancillary RCCs will be calculated by dividing: 1. The individual Line and Subscript amounts for each of the Lines 50 to 76 and Lines 90 to 93 taken from Worksheet B, Part I Column 24 2. By 3. The individual Line and Subscript amounts for each of the Lines 50 to 76 and Lines 90 to 93 taken from Worksheet C, Part I Column 8 Costs will be offset by the payments made by or on behalf of patients and payments made by third parties related to Medicaid inpatient and outpatient hospital services as well as payments made by AHCCCS including FFS payments and payments by managed care organizations, made during the hospital's fiscal/CMS Report years that encompass the state plan year. Supplemental payments (such as GME, Rural Hospital Inpatient Payment and CAH) will be based on the state plan year. During the initial calculation, AHCCCS may use actual data if avail able as opposed to two years prior payments. Uninsured Costs Each hospital will collect uninsured days and charges and program data for the hospital's fiscal/CMS Report years that encompass the state plan year from the hospital's claims and auditable fin ancial records. Only hospital inpatient and outpatient days and charges and program data for medical services that would otherwise be eligible for Medicaid should be included in the DSH calculation. Inpatient and outpatient uninsured services will not include services that would be reimbursed as Rural Health Clinic or Federally Qualified Health Clinic services if the patient were eligible for Medicaid. The uninsured days, charges and program information provided to the state are subject to the same audit s tandards and Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 107 Amended: January 18, 2019 procedures as the data included in the cost report. When providing uninsured days, charges and program information hospitals should be guided by the following: The Uninsured are defined as: Self pay and self insured patients Individuals with no source of third party coverage for inpatient and outpatient hospital services Third party coverage does not include state and local government subsidized care (i.e. individuals covered by indigent programs without other forms of third party coverage ar e uninsured) Payments made by state or local government are not considered a source of third party payment It is permissible to include in the Uninsured individuals who do not possess health insurance which would apply to the service for which the individual sought treatment. Individuals with AHCCCS coverage (under either Title XIX or Title XXI) are not considered uninsured Individuals participating in a Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program that have no source of third party coverage for the services provide d other than the Ryan White program are considered uninsured. However, the funding provided under the program must be considered payments received from or on behalf of patients or payments received from third parties. When submitting uninsured days, charg es and program information hospitals should accompany the submission with: A listing of all payor types that are included in the uninsured data compilation, and An electronic file that contains sufficient claims or other information (e.g. ICNs) to enable an auditor to tie the amounts submitted during the application process to the financial records of the hospital The uninsured costs will be calculated for each hospital for each fiscal/CMS Report year that encompasses the state plan year. The resulting uninsured costs for each fiscal/CMS Report year will be prorated to derive the state plan year uninsured costs according to the above discussion entitled \"Data on a State Plan Year Basis\". The information to be collected will include, but not be limited to: 1. The number of uninsured inpatient hospital days (this will be accumulated for each inpatient routine service cost center on the cost report) 2. The uninsured inpatient and outpatient hospital ancillary charges (this will be accumulated for each ancillary cost center on the cost report) 3. The amounts of payments received during the hospital's fiscal/CMS Report years that encompass the state plan year made by or on behalf of patients and payments made by third parties related to uninsured inpatient and outpati ent hospital Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 108 Amended: January 18, 2019 services. The information collected shall: a. Include payments received during the hospital's fiscal/CMS Report years that encompass the state plan year under Section 1011, Federal Reimbursement of Emergency Health Services Furnished to Undocumented Aliens, of the MMA, b. Not include payments, funding and subsidies made by the state or a unit of local governments (e.g., state- only, local -only or state -local health program) 4. AHCCCS may apply trending factors for the initial payment to account for changes in utilization (e.g., due to changes in Medicaid eligibility criteria), supplemental payments, and Medicaid payments and rates. The adjustments may increase or decrease the days, costs, charges, or payments reflected on the cost reports, Medicaid and/or uninsured information. The adjustments will reflect increases and decreases resulting from changes in operations or circumstances that are not reflected in the information from the state plan year two years prior. For each hospital the cost center -specific per diems and ratios of cost to charges (RCC) from the cost report (as determined for Medicaid) will be applied to the data collected by the hospital to determine the uninsured costs. Costs will be offset by the payments received during the state plan year from or on behalf of patients and payments received during the hospital's fiscal/CMS Report years that encompass the state plan year from third parties related to all uninsured inpatient and outpatient hospital services. Payments made by state o r local government are not considered a source of third party payment. The OBRA Limit The summation of the Medicaid shortfall (whether positive or negative) and the uninsured costs (whether positive or negative) is the hospital's OBRA limit. Group 5 Eli gibility Determination Any Arizona hospital that qualifies for funding in Groups 1, 1A, 2, 2A, or 4 s eligible for funding through Group 5. Group 5 is created to enable DSH- eligible hospitals to get qualifying DSH payments matched via voluntary intergovernmental agreements (IGAs). Per State Medicaid Director Letter #10 -010, the state will require the appropriate documentation that the funding has been voluntarily provided. Group 5 DSH payments are on top of the Groups 1, 1A, 2, 2A, and 4 DSH paym ents, but no individual hospital will receive aggregate DSH payments that exceed its OBRA limit. Funding for any hospital in Group 5 must be arranged via a voluntary intergovernmental agreement with a political subdivision, tribal government or public uni versity, through certified public expenditures (for governmental c hospitals) or an intergovernmental transfer of public funds not derived from impermissible sources, such as impermissible provider -related donations or impermissible health care -related taxes, as a match to draw down DSH payments. Political subdivisions, tribal governments and public universities Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 109 Amended: January 18, 2019 will notify AHCCCS of the hospitals designated to receive funds from Pool 5 and of the amount of matching funds that are available through their IGAs or through a certification of public expenditures. For hospitals that qualify for Group 5, a \"LOM\" score will be calculated by multiplying the hospital's LIUR times the hospital's full O BRA limit, times the hospital's MIUR. Example : Hospital A OBRA = $54,734,467, MIUR = 0.3542, LIUR = 0.2946 Group 5 LOM score for Hospital A = $54,734,467 x 0.3542 x 0.2946 = $5,711,394 For the first round of distributions, allocations will be provided to hospitals located outside of the Phoenix and Tucson metropolitan statistical areas which have an agreement with a political subdivision, tribal government, or public university for intergovernmental transfer of the non- federal share funding. Each participating hospital's percentage of the total LOM score will be calculated using the hospital's LOM score as the numerator and the total of all participating hospitals' LOM scores as the denominator. The total amount of DSH available as a result of the IGAs (Group 5 DSH funds) will be multiplied by each hospital's LOM percentage of this first round. If any allocation from this round is higher than a hospital's OBRA limit (remaining after Group 1, 1A, 2, 2A, and 4 DSH distributions) or higher than the matching funds (in total computable) for that hospital, the lower of those two limits will be recorded as the allocation for round one. The second round of distributions will be open to any hospital that qualifies for funding in Groups 1, 1A, 2, 2A, or 4 which did not participate in round 1 and which has a certificate of public expenditures or an agreement with a political subdivision, tribal government, or public university for intergovernmental transfer of the non-federal share funding. The second round will use the same protocol as the distribution in round 1 with any money remaining in the pool. If any monies remain in Group 5 after monies have been distributed in rounds 1 and 2 (including monies made available after CMS finalizes the DSH allotment), AHCCCS may issue additional rounds of funding to hospitals which qualified for funding in Groups 1, 1A, 2, 2A, or 4 which have not exceeded their OBRA limit, and which has an agreement with a political subdivision, tribal government, or public university for intergovernmental transfer of the non -federal share funding or a certificate of public expenditure. Any Group 5 payment made to a hospital which qualifies for Group 4 will be accounted for as an offset in the CPE computation under Group 4. All excess IGA funds not used for Group 5 DSH distributions, due to application of the above limits, will be returned to the originating political subdivisions, tribal governments or public universities and will not be retained by AHCCCS for other uses. The Group 5 DSH distribution for any hospital will consist of that hospital's total of allocations from all rounds. Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 110 Amended: January 18, 2019 Aggregate Limits IMD Limit Federal law provides that aggregate DSH payments to Institutions for Mental Diseases (IMDs) in Arizona is confined to the lesser of $28,474,900 or the amount equal to the product of Arizon a's current year total computable DSH allotment and 23.27%. Therefore, DSH payment to IMDs will be reduced proportionately to the extent necessary to ensure that the aggregate IMD limit is not exceeded. \"Institutions for Mental Diseases\" includes hospitals that are primarily engaged in providing diagnosis, treatment, or care of persons with mental diseases, including medical attention, nursing care, and related services. Whether an institution is an IMD is determined by its overall character as that of a facility established and maintained primarily for the care and treatment of individuals with mental diseases, whether or not it is licensed as such. Overall Total Limit The federal government shares in the cost of Medicaid DSH expenditures based o n the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) for each state. However, for each fiscal year, the amount of federal funds available to states for DSH payment is fixed. As such, the total amount of DSH payments for a state plan rate year will not exceed the federal allotment divided by the FMAP. Reconciliations The initial DSH payment issued to a hospital by AHCCCS is considered \"interim\" and is subject to different reconciliation methodologies depending upon whether the hospital is non- governmental or governmentally -operated. The payments to hospitals are generally made as a single lump sum payment that is made once the calculations of the payment amounts are completed. The purpose of the interim DSH payment is to provide reimbursement that approxima tes the Medicaid and uninsured inpatient hospital and outpatient hospital uncompensated care costs eligible for Federal Financial Participation (FFP). The reasons for a change in the initial (or interim) DSH payment for both non- governmental and governmentally -operated hospitals are outlined above under \"Pools and Changing Payment Levels\". If it is determined that the total amount of payments made to non -governmental hospitals under the methodology outlined in the \"Pools and Changing Payment Levels\" excee ds the amount of all finalized non -governmental hospital OBRA limits, the amount in excess will be recouped by AHCCCS and any associated federal funding claimed will be properly credited to the federal government. If it is determined that the total amount of payments made to governmentally -operated hospitals under the methodology outlined in the \"Pools and Changing Payment Levels\" exceeds the amount of either: Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 111 Amended: January 18, 2019 1. All governmentally -operated hospital OBRA limits calculated based on the \"finalized\" cost report, or 2. The total amount of certified public expenditures of governmentally -operated hospitals, then 3. The amount in excess will be recouped by AHCCCS and any associated federal funding claimed will be properly credited to the federal government. Certified Publ ic Expenditures Expenditures by governmentally -operated hospitals shall be used by AHCCCS in claiming FFP for DSH payments to the extent that the amount of funds expended are certified by the appropriate officials at the governmentally -operated hospital. The method for determining a governmentally -operated hospital's allowable uncompensated care costs eligible for DSH reimbursement when such costs are funded through the certified public expenditure (CPE) process will be the same as the method for calculat ing and reconciling the OBRA limit for governmentally -operated hospitals set forth above. However, because governmentally -operated hospitals are certifying expenditures for the state plan year of the initial DSH payment and final expenditures may not be known at the time of initial certification of public expenditures, governmentally owned hospitals may certify an amount of expenditures for the initial DSH payment based on an estimate of the OBRA limit for the state plan year of the initial DSH payment. In certifying estimates of public expenditure for the initial DSH payment, the governmentally operated hospital will first calculate its expenditures based on the methodology for calculating the OBRA limit for the state plan year two years before the state plan year of the initial payment (as specified in the protocols in Exhibit 1 or Exhibit 2) and then provide for adjustments to such OBRA limit. The adjustments may increase or decrease the days, costs, charges or payments reflected on the cost reports, Me dicaid and/or uninsured information used to calculate the OBRA limit. The adjustments will reflect increases and decreases resulting from changes in operations or circumstances that are not reflected in the information from the state plan year two years prior to the state plan year of the initial payment, but will be reflected in the final information for the state plan year of the initial payment. All adjustments must be supported by adequate explanation/justification and is subject to review by AHCCCS and CMS. In order to use CPE, the certifying governmentally -operated hospital must follow the protocol in Exhibit 1 or Exhibit 2 and provide a certification as to the amount of allowable uncompensated care costs eligible for DSH reimbursement. If CPE is used , the amount of expenditures used to determine the FFP will not exceed the amount of the CPE. The payment of FFP to governmentally -operated hospitals is subject to legislative appropriation. Grievances and Appeals The state considers a hospital's DSH eligibility and DSH payment amount to be appealable Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 112 Amended: January 18, 2019 issues. A DSH eligibility list along with the initial DSH payment amounts that eligible hospitals have been calculated to receive will be distributed. Hospitals will be permitted thirty (30) days from dis tribution to appeal their DSH eligibility and payment amounts. Because the total amount of DSH funds is fixed, the successful appeal of one DSH hospital will reduce DSH payment amounts to all other providers. Once the final reconciliation process is compl eted, no additional DSH payment will be issued. Other Provisions Ownership DSH payment will only be issued to the entity which is currently registered with AHCCCS as a participating hospital provider. Therefore, it is expected that facilities will consider this information when negotiating ownership changes. AHCCCS Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) Payments Exceptions An exception to the use of the Medicare Cost Report (Form CMS 2552 -10) as a data source shall apply to: I. Hospitals that: Serve patients that are predominantly under 18 years of age, and Are licensed for fewer than 50 beds, and Do not file a comprehensive Form CMS 2552- 10 (Medicare Cost Report), and Receive an acceptance letter from the CMS fiscal intermediary for the portion of the CMS 2552- 10 (Medicare Cost Report) that the hospital does file with the fiscal intermediary, and Receive written permission from AHCCCS to invoke the provisions of this exception. Such hospitals may extract data from their financial records in lieu of e xtracting data from the Form CMS 2552- 10 (Medicare Cost Report) as provided in this Attachment C. The method of extracting and compiling the data from the hospital's financial records shall conform to the instructions for the Form CMS 2552- 10. All other non- Medicare Cost Report data and documentation as described in this Attachment C shall be required from such hospitals. II. Indian Health Service (IHS) Hospitals and tribally -operated 638 hospitals who do not file a full Form CMS 2552- 10 Medicare Cost Report but rather file an abbreviated Medicare cost report in accordance with Medicare Provider Reimbursement Manual, Part I, Section 2208.1.E (Method E cost report). Such IHS Hospitals and tribally -operated 638 hospitals can submit a Private Facility Information Sheet (PFIS) to AHCCCS using data from the IHS Method E report that is filed Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 113 Amended: January 18, 2019 with CMS aswell as supporting hospital financial reports, as necessary. The method of extracting and compiling the data from the hospital's financial records shall conform to the instructions for the Form CMS 2552- 10. All other non- Medicare Cost Report data and documentation as described on the PFIS cover sheet will be required by such hospitals.EXHIBIT 1 to ATTACHMENT C AHCCCS Disproportionate Share Hospital Payment Methodology Calculation of OBRA Limits for Governmentally- Operated Hospitals for the Purpose of Certified Public Expenditures Each governmentally -operated hospital certifying its expenditures for Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments shall compute and report its OBRA limit as prescribed by this Exhibit. The governmentally -operated hospital's OBRA limit is comprised of two components: 1. The amount of uncompensated care costs associated with providing inpatient and outpatient hospital services to Medic aid individuals (the Medicaid shortfall), and 2. The amount of uncompensated care costs associated with providing inpatient and outpatient hospital services to individuals with no source of third party coverage for the inpatient and outpatient hospital servic es they received (uninsured costs). The steps to computing the governmentally -operated hospital's OBRA limit are3: 1. The hospital shall prepare its CMS 2552 Report (cost report(s)). Each hospital must complete the cost report t o determine per diems (for inpatient routine services) and ratios of cost to charges (RCC) (for ancillary services). The cost reports must be completed based on Medicare cost principles and Medicare cost allocation process as specified in the CMS 2552 inst ructions and the CMS Provider Reimbursement Manual, volumes 15-1 and 15- 2, including updates. 2. Medicaid shortfall will be calculated based on information available from PMMIS, other AHCCCS financial systems, and the cost report. 3. Uninsured costs will be calculated based on uninsured days and charges and other program data collected by the hospital from its claims and financial records, other systems, and the cost report. 4. Finally, the governmentally -operated hospital will compile and summarize the calculat ions on The OBRA Limit and CPE Schedule. In compiling and summarizing the OBRA calculations, the governmentally -operated hospital may make adjustments to the calculated OBRA limit to estimate the OBRA limit for a future state plan year. The adjustments may increase or decrease the days, costs, charges or payments reflected on the cost reports, Medicaid and/or uninsured information used to calculate the OBRA limit. The adjustments will reflect increases and decreases resulting from changes in operations or c ircumstances that are not reflected in the information from the Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 114 Amended: January 18, 2019 state plan year two years prior to the state plan year of the initial payment, but will be reflected in the final information for the state plan year of the initial payment. All adjustments must be supported by adequate explanation/justification and is subject to review by AHCCCS and CMS. The Schedule will be submitted to AHCCCS during the application process, with backup documentation, for the cost reporting period(s) covered by the Medicaid state plan year(s) under review. 3 Note: The following discussion applies to hospitals that do not have a per diem ancillary allocation methodology approved by Medicare. For the steps to calculate the OBRA limit for governmental hospitals that do have such approval, see Exhibit 2 to this Attachment C. Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 115 Amended: January 18, 2019 The Medicaid Shortfall AHCCCS will provide each governmentally -operated hospital with a report from the PMMIS system and other agency financial reporting systems to assist each governmentally - operated hospital in completing required schedules. The information to be provided by AHCCCS will include, but not be limited to: 1. The number of Medicaid fee for service (FFS) inpatient hospital days for each inpatient routine service cost center on the cost report 2. The number of Medicaid managed care inpatient hospital days for each inpatient routine service cost center on the cost report 3. The Medicaid inpatient and outpatient hospital FFS charges for each ancillary cost center on the cost re port. Inpatient and outpatient Medicaid charges will not include charges reimbursed as Rural Health Clinic or Federally Qualified Health Clinic services. 4. The amounts of payments made by or on behalf of patients and payments made by third parties related to Medicaid inpatient and outpatient hospital FFS services 5. The amounts of Medicaid payments made by AHCCCS for inpatient and outpatient hospital FFS services 6. The Medicaid inpatient and outpatient hospital managed care charges for each ancillary cost center on the cost report. Inpatient and outpatient Medicaid charges will not include charges reimbursed as Rural Health Clinic or Federally Qualified Health Clinic services. 7. The amounts of payments made by or on behalf of patients and payments made by third part ies related to Medicaid inpatient and outpatient hospital services for health plans and program contractors 8. The amounts of Medicaid payments made by managed care organizations for inpatient and outpatient hospital services 9. Other amounts of Medicaid payment s for Medicaid inpatient and outpatient services furnished during the Medicaid state plan year under review (e.g. GME, CAH, etc.) Each governmentally -operated hospital will use the cost center -specific per diems and ratios of cost to charges (RCC) from the cost report and the data extracted from PMMIS (days and charges) to determine the cost of providing inpatient and outpatient Medicaid services. Inpatient and outpatient Medicaid services will not include services reimbursed as Rural Health Clinic or Federally Qualified Health Clinic services. The Medicaid shortfall will be calculated for each hospital for each fiscal/CMS Report year that encompasses the state plan year. The resulting Medicaid shortfall for each fiscal/CMS Report year will be prorated to derive the state plan year Medicaid shortfall according to the discussion entitled \"Data on a State Plan Year Basis\". The per diem amounts will be calculated by dividing: The individual amounts on Worksheet B, Part I Column 24 Lines (and where applicab le Subscript Lines) 30 to 35 and Lines 40 to 43 By The corresponding day totals on Line (and where applicable Subscript Line) 1, Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 116 Amended: January 18, 2019 Lines 8 through 13 and Lines 16 to 18 (for inpatient hospital subproviders) from Worksheet S-3, Part I, Column 8. Note: when calculating the Adults and Pediatrics (General Routine Care) per diem, the amount on Worksheet B, Part I, Column 24, Line 30 should have deducted the amounts appearing on Worksheet D -1, Part I, Lines 26 and 36 and the amount on Worksheet S -3, Part I, Colum n 8, Line 1 should have added the amount appearing on Line 28 (observation bed days). The ancillary RCCs will be calculated by dividing: 1. The individual Line and Subscript amounts for each of the Lines 50 to 76 and Lines 90 to 93 taken from Worksheet B, Part I, Column 24 2. By 3. The individual Line and Subscript amounts for each of the Lines 50 to 76and Lines 90 to 93 taken from Worksheet C, Part I, Column 8 Each governmentally -operated hospital will use the cost center -specific per diems and ratios of cost t o charges (RCC) from the cost report and the data supplied by AHCCCS to compile the Medicaid Schedule of Costs on the OBRA Limit and CPE Schedule. The Medicaid Schedule of Costs depicts: 1. The governmentally -operated hospital specific Medicaid inpatient and outpatient cost data, 2. The payments made by or on behalf of patients and payments made by third parties related to Medicaid inpatient and outpatient hospital services, 3. The Medicaid inpatient and outpatient net cost data, 4. Payments made by AHCCCS including F FS and payments by health plans and program contractors 5. The amount of supplemental Medicaid payments related to inpatient and outpatient hospital services (e.g., GME and CAH, etc.) 6. The Medicaid shortfall 7. Adjustments to the calculated Medicaid shortfall to estimate a Medicaid shortfall for a future state plan year. Uninsured Costs Each governmentally -operated hospital will collect uninsured days and charges and program data for the hospital's fiscal/CMS Report years that encompass the state plan year from the hospital's claims and auditable financial records. Only hospital inpatient and outpatient days and charges and program data for medical services that would otherwise be eligible for Medicaid should be included in the calculation. Inpatient and outpatie nt uninsured services will not include services that would be reimbursed as Rural Health Clinic or Federally Qualified Health Clinic services ifthe patient were eligible for Medicaid. The uninsured days, charges and program information provided to the stat e is subject to the same audit standards and procedures as the data included in the cost report. When providing uninsured days, charges and program information hospitals should be Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 117 Amended: January 18, 2019 guided by the following: The Uninsured are defined as: Self pay and self i nsured patients Individuals with no source of third party coverage for inpatient and outpatient hospital services Third party coverage does not include state and local government subsidized care (i.e. individuals covered by indigent programs without other forms of third party coverage are uninsured) Payments made by state or local government are not considered a source of third party payment It is permissible to include in the Uninsured individuals who do not possess health insurance which would apply to the service for which the individual sought treatment. Individuals with AHCCCS coverage (under either Title XIX or Title XXI) are not considered uninsured Individuals participating in a Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program that have no source of third party coverage for the services provided other than the Ryan White program are considered uninsured. However, the funding provided under the program must be considered payments received from or on behalf of patients or payments received from third parties. When submitting uninsured days, charges and program information hospitals should accompany the submission with: A listing of all payor types that are included in the uninsured data compilation, and An electronic file that contains sufficient claims or other in formation (e.g. ICNs) to enable an auditor to tie the amounts submitted during the application process to the financial records of the hospital The information to be collected will include, but not be limited to: 1.

The summation of the estimated Medicaid shortfall (whether positive or negative) and the estimated uninsured costs (whether positive or negative) is the hospital's OBRA limit for a future state plan year and is depicted on the Calculation of OBRA Limit and CPE on the OBRA Limit and CPE Schedule. Certification The appropriate official of the governmentally -operated hospital will sign the certification statement on the Governmentally -Operated Hospital OBRA Limit and CPE Schedule. A certification will be signed for each of the three times the OBRA limit for the state plan year of the initial DSH payment is calculated as described below under \"Reconciliation\". Reconciliation The OBRA limit for the state plan year of the initial DSH payment will be computed for each governmentally -operated hospital three times: 1. The OBRA limit will be calculated in the state plan year of the initial DSH payment based on the cost report(s) and days and charges and other program data for the state plan year two years prior to the state plan year of the initial DSH payment. This calculation may include an adjustment to the calculated OBRA limit of the state plan year two yearsprior to the state plan year of the initial DSH payment in order to estimate the OBRA limit of the state plan year of the initial DSH payment. 2. The OBRA limit will be recalculated when the cost report(s) for the state plan year of the initial DSH payment are filed. In recalculating the OBRA limit the cost data from the as- filed cost report(s) and program data (days, charges, and payments) from the actual cost reporting period(s) will be used in the calculation. This calculation may not Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 119 Amended: January 18, 2019 include any adjustment to the calculated OBRA limit of the state plan year of the initial DSH. 3. The final calculation of each governmentally -operated hospital's OBRA limit will be performed when the cost report(s) for the state plan year of the initial DSH payment are finalized. In finalizing the OBRA limit the cost data from the finalized cost report(s) and program data (days, charges, and payments) from the actual c ost reporting period(s) will be used in the calculation. Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 120 Amended: January 18, 2019 EXHIBIT 2 to ATTACHMENT C AHCCCS Disproportionate Share Hospital Payment Methodology Calculation of OBRA Limits for Arizona State Hospital A Hospital with a Per Diem Ancillary Cost Allocation Method Approved by Medicare Arizona State Hospital (ASH), a governmentally -operated hospital that is an all -inclusive rate provider under Medicare, shall compute, report and certify its OBRA limit as prescribed by this Exhibit. Because ASH only provides inpatient services, the OBRA limit will by calculated based only on inpatient information. ASH's OBRA limit is comprised of two components: 1. The amount of uncompensated care costs associated with providing inpatient hospital services to Medicaid individua ls (the Medicaid shortfall), and 2. The amount of uncompensated care costs associated with providing inpatient hospital services to individuals with no source of third party coverage for the inpatient hospital services they received (uninsured costs). The steps to computing ASH's OBRA limit are: 1. The hospital shall prepare its CMS 2552 Report (cost report(s)). The hospital must complete the cost report to determine per diems (for inpatient routine services and for ancillary services). The cost reports must be completed based on Medicare cost principles and Medicare cost allocation process as specified in the CMS 2552 instructions and the CMS Provider Reimbursement Manual, volumes 15- 1 and 15- 2, including updates. 2. Medicaid shortfall will be calculated based on information available from PMMIS, other AHCCCS financial systems, and the cost report. 3. Uninsured costs will be calculated based on uninsured days and other program data collected by the hospital from its claims and financial records, other systems, and the cost report. 4. Finally, ASH will compile and summarize the calculations on The OBRA Limit and CPE Schedule. In compiling and summarizing the OBRA calculations, ASH may make adjustments to the calculated OBRA limit to estimate the OBRA limit for a future state plan year. The adjustments may increase or decrease the days, costs, charges or payments reflected on the cost reports, Medicaid and/or uninsured information used to calculate the OBRA limit. The adjustments will reflect increases and decreases resul ting from changes in operations or circumstances that are not reflected in the information from the state plan year two years prior to the state plan year of the initial payment, but will be reflected in the final information for the state plan year of the initial payment. All adjustments must be supported by adequate explanation/justification and is subject to review by AHCCCS and CMS. The Schedule will be submitted to AHCCCS during the application process, with Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 121 Amended: January 18, 2019 backup documentation, for the cost reporting period(s) covered by the Medicaid state plan year(s) under review. The Medicaid Shortfall AHCCCS will provide ASH with a report from the PMMIS system and other agency financial reporting systems to assist ASH in completing required schedules. The information to be provided by AHCCCS will include, but not be limited to: 1. The number of Medicaid fee for service (FFS) inpatient hospital days (for the single inpatient routine service cost center on the cost report) 2. The number of Medicaid managed care inpatient hospital days (for the single inpatient routine service cost center on the cost report) 3. The amounts of payments made by or on behalf of patients and payments made by third parties related to Medicaid inpatient hospital FFS services 4. The amounts of Medicaid payments made by AHCCCS for inpatient hospital FFS services 5. The amounts of payments made by or on behalf of patients and payments made by third parties related to Medicaid inpatient hospital services for health plans and program contractors 6. The amounts of Medicaid payments made by health plans and program contractors for inpatient hospital services for health plans and program contractors 7. Other amounts of Medicaid payments for Medicaid inpatient services furnished during the Medicaid state plan ye ar under review (e.g. GME, CAH, etc.) ASH will use a single total per diem calculated from the cost report and the inpatient days extracted from PMMIS to determine the cost of providing inpatient Medicaid services. The Medicaid shortfall will be calculate d for ASH for each fiscal/CMS Report year that encompasses the state plan year. The resulting Medicaid shortfall for each fiscal/CMS Report year will be prorated to derive the state plan year Medicaid shortfall according to the discussion entitled \"Data on a State Plan Year Basis\". The single total per diem amount will be calculated by summing the inpatient per diem amount and the ancillary per diem amount. The inpatient per diem amount will be found by dividing the amounts from Worksheet B, Part I Column 24, Line 30 by the day total on Line 1 from Worksheet S -3, Part I Column 8. Note: when calculating the Adults and Pediatrics (General Routine Care) per diem, the amount on Worksheet B, Part I, Column 24, Line 30 should have deducted the amounts appearing on Worksheet D -1, Part I, Lines 26 and 36 and the amount on Worksheet S -3, Part I, Column 8, Line 1 should have added the amount appearing on Line 28 (observation bed days). The ancillary per diem amount will be calculated by: 1. Summing the Line and Subscr ipt amounts for each of the Lines 50 to 76and Lines 90 to 93 (but excluding Subscript Lines 88 to 89) taken from Worksheet Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 122 Amended: January 18, 2019 B Part 1 Column 24ividing the amount determined in step 1 above by the amount determined in step 3 below 2. Summing Line 1 and 28 from W orksheet S -3, Part I, Column 8 ASH will use the single total per diem calculated from the cost report and the data supplied by AHCCCS to compile the Medicaid Schedule of Costs on the OBRA Limit and CPE Schedule. The Medicaid Schedule of Costs depicts: 1. The governmentally -operated hospital specific Medicaid inpatient cost data (determined by multiplying the single total per diem by the number of inpatient Medicaid days), 2. The payments made by or on behalf of patients and payments made by third parties related to Medicaid inpatient hospital services, 3. The Medicaid inpatient net cost data, 4. Payments made by AHCCCS including FFS and payments by health plans and program contractors 5. The amount of supplemental Medicaid payments (e.g., GME and CAH, etc.) 6. The Med icaid shortfall 7. Adjustments to the calculated Medicaid shortfall to estimate a Medicaid shortfall for a future state plan year. Uninsured Costs ASH will collect uninsured days and program data for the hospital's fiscal/CMS Report years that encompass the state plan year from the hospital's claims and auditable financial records. Only hospital inpatient days and program data for medical services that would otherwise be eligible for Medicaid should be included in the calculation. Inpatient uninsured services will not include services that would be reimbursed as Rural Health Clinic or Federally Qualified Health Clinic services if the patient were eligible for Medicaid. The uninsured days and program information provided to the state is subject to the same aud it standards and procedures as the data included in the cost report. When collecting uninsured days and program information ASH should be guided by the following: The Uninsured are defined as: Self pay and self insured patients Individuals with no source of third party coverage for inpatient hospital services Third party coverage does not include state and local government subsidized care (i.e. individuals covered by indigent programs without other forms of third party coverage are uninsured) Payments mad e by state or local government are not considered a source of third party payment It is permissible to include in the Uninsured individuals who do not possess health insurance which would apply to the service for which the individual sought treatment. Individuals with AHCCCS coverage (under either Title XIX or Title XXI) Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 123 Amended: January 18, 2019 are not considered uninsured Individuals participating in a Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program that have no source of third party coverage for the services provided other than the Ryan White program are considered uninsured. However, the funding provided under the program must be considered payments received from or on behalf of patients or payments received from third parties. The uninsured costs will be calculated for ASH for each fiscal/CMS Report year that encompasses the state plan year. The resulting uninsured costs for each fiscal/CMS Report year will be prorated to derive the state plan year uninsured costs according to the discussion entitled \"Data on a state Plan Year Basis\". The inf ormation to be collected will include, but not be limited to: 1. The number of uninsured inpatient hospital days (for the single inpatient routine service cost center on the cost report) 2. The amounts of payments received during the hospital's fiscal/CMS Report years that encompass the state plan year made by or on behalf of patients and payments made by third parties related to uninsured inpatient hospital services. The information collected shall: a. Include payments received during the hospital's fiscal/CM S Report years that encompass the state plan year under Section 1011, Federal Reimbursement of Emergency Health Services Furnished to Undocumented Aliens, of the MMA, b. Not include payments, funding and subsidies made by the state or a unit of local governments (e.g., state -only, local -only or state -local health program) ASH will use the total inpatient per diem calculated from the cost report (as determined for Medicaid), the uninsured days, and other program data collected by ASH to compile the Uninsured Schedule of Costs on the OBRA Limit and CPE Schedule. The Uninsured Schedule of Costs depicts: 1. The ASH specific uninsured inpatient cost data (determined by multiplying the single total per diem by the number of uninsured inpatient days), 2. The payme nts made by or on behalf of patients and payments made by third parties related to uninsured inpatient hospital services, and 3. The uninsured inpatient cost. 4. Adjustments to the calculated uninsured inpatient and outpatient cost to estimate the uninsured inpa tient and outpatient cost for a future state plan year. The Governmentally -Operated Hospital OBRA Limit The summation of the Medicaid shortfall (whether positive or negative) and the uninsured costs (whether positive or negative) is the hospital's OBRA limit and is depicted on the OBRA Limit and CPE Schedule. The summation of the estimated Medicaid shortfall (whether positive or negative) and the Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 124 Amended: January 18, 2019 estimated uninsured costs (whether positive or negative) is the hospital's OBRA limit for a future state plan year and is depicted on the Calculation of OBRA Limit and CPE on the OBRA Limit and CPE Schedule. Certification The appropriate official of ASH will sign the certification statement on the OBRA Limit and CPE Schedule. A certification statement will be signed for each of the three times the OBRA limit for the state plan year of the initial DSH payment is calculated as described below under \"Reconciliation\". Reconciliation The OBRA limit for the state plan year of the initial DSH payment will be comp uted for ASH three times: 1. The OBRA limit will be calculated in the state plan year of the initial DSH payment based on the cost report(s) and days and other program data for the state plan year two years prior to the state plan year of the initial DSH payment. This calculation may include an adjustment to the calculated OBRA limit of the state plan year two years prior to the state plan year of the initial DSH payment in order to estimate the OBRA limit of the state plan year of the initial DSH payment. 2.

For State Plan Year (SPY) 2008 and 2009, funding will be allocated among six pools (pools 1, 1A, 2, 2A, 3, and 4). For SPY 2010, funding will be allocated among seven pools (pools 1, 1A, 2, 2A, 3, 4, and 5). For SPY 2011, SPY 2012, SPY 2013, SPY 2014, and SPY 2015 the funding will be allocated among six pools (pools 1, 1A, 2, 2A, 4, and 5). Pools 1, 1A, 2, 2A, and 3 - Non -governmentally -operated hospitals The funding for pools 1 and 2 will be sufficient to provide an average payment amount of $6,000 for all hospitals qualifying for both of the two pools. No hospital in pools 1 or 2 will receive less than $5,000. Therefore, the amount of funding for pools 1 and 2 will be determined by multiplying the number of hospitals qualifying for pools 1 and 2 by $6,000. The funding for pools 1A, 2A and 3 (if applicable) will be derived by subtracting the total amount allocated for pools 1 and 2 from the amount of DSH authorized by the Legislature for non- governmentally operated hospitals. Beginning SPY 2011, these remaining funds will be split with 15% for Pool 1A and 85% for Pool 2A. For SPY 2008, the funding for pools 1, 2, 1A, and 2A and 3 will be $26,147,700.

Supple mental payments shall be made based on each CAH designated hospital's percentage of total inpatient and outpatient Title XIX reimbursement paid relative to other CAH designated hospitals for the time period from July 1 through June 30 of the previous year. AHCCCS will allocate the amount available through legislative appropriation in the following manner: (1) Gather all adjudicated claims/encounters with dates of service from July 1 through June 30 of the prior year for each CAH -designated hospital. (2) Sum the AHCCCS payments for inpatient and outpatient services for the year to establish a hospital -specific hospital paid amount. (3) Total all AHCCCS payments for inpatient and outpatient services for the year to establish a total paid amount. (4) Divide the hospital paid amount by the total paid amount to establish the hospital's utilization percentage. (5) Divide the annual CAH appropriation by twelve to get the monthly CAH allocation. (6) Multiply each hospital's monthly relative utilization by the monthly CAH allocation to establish each hospital's monthly payment. Funding will be distributed based on the number of CAH -designated hospitals in each month and their Medicaid utilization. Because there may be a different number of CAH -designated hospitals each month, the hos pital- specific weightings and payments may fluctuate from month to month. The calculations will be computed monthly and the distribution of the CAH dollars to the CAH- designated hospitals will be made twice a year. Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 132 Amended: January 18, 2019 Attachment E Safety Net Care Pool Clai ming Protocol In accordance with the special terms and conditions (STC) Section VI, this Attachment E serves as the claiming protocol for Arizona's Safety Net Care Pool (SNCP) for Phoenix Children's Hospital (PCH) . The protocol provides for the computation of the uncompensated care cost limit for Phoenix Children's Hospital through December 31, 2017 . For each demonstration Year (DY), aggregate uncompensated care payments will be a distribution of the SNCP pool established in Section VI for each DY, and payments to each individual provider cannot exceed the uncompensated care cost limit as determined by this cost claiming protocol for each DY. Generally, the uncompensated care cost limit is determined based on each provider's uncompensated costs pertaining to Section 1905(a) medical services furnished to Medicaid eligible and uninsured individuals. Allowable patient care costs, consistent with Medicare and Medicaid cost principles and OMB Circular A -87, A -121, and A -122 where applicable, are ident ified using a CMS -approved cost report. Such costs are apportioned to the eligible Medicaid and uninsured services and then offset by all applicable revenues. SNCP payments made based on interim computation of the uncompensated care cost limit (using prior period cost data) must be subsequently limited to a recomputation of the uncompensated care costs using the provider's as -filed and audited cost reports for the actual service period covered by the DY. Under no circumstances will total SNCP payments to PCH (eligible to receive payment for uncompensated care costs incurred through December 31, 2017) exceed the provider's uncompensated costs, as described in paragraph 32 and in this Attachment E. Hospital Inpatient and Outpatient Uncompensated Care Costs To be eligible for f ederal financial participation (FFP), SNCP uncompensated care payments to PCH cannot exceed the uncompensated care costs as computed by the following steps: Interim Computation of Uncompensated Care Costs SNCP uncompensated care paym ents to PCH are limited to uncompensated care costs incurred on or before December 31, 2017. Each DY's SNCP will be distributed based on the provider's projected uncompensated care subject to the PCH Limit described in STC paragraph 32(c), to the extent th at sufficient local matching funds are available. This interim computation of uncompensated care costs will be used as the basis for SNCP distribution and will also serve as the uncompensated care cost limit for SNCP payments made to the provider in each demonstration year. 1. The process of determining the hospital's interim uncompensated care cost limit begins with the use of each hospital's CMS 2552(s) filed with its Medicare contractor. The most recent CMS 2552 filed with the hospital's Medicare contractor will be utilized. 2. Per diem amount for each hospital routine cost center is computed by dividing: - The individual amounts on Worksheet B, Part I, Column 25, Lines (and where applicable subscripted lines) 25 to 33 of CMS 2552- 96 or Worksheet B, P art I, Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 133 Amended: January 18, 2019 Column 24, Lines (and where applicable subscripted lines) 30- 43 of CMS 2552- 10 by- - The corresponding day totals on Lines (and where applicable subscripted lines) 5 through 11 and Line 14 (for inpatient hospital subproviders) from Worksheet S -3, Part I, Column 6 of CMS 2552- 96 or Lines 7 through 13 and Lines 16- 18 (for inpatient hospital subproviders) from Worksheet S -3, Part I, Column 8 of CMS 2552- 10 consistent with the instructions below regarding observation bed days. Note when computing the Adults and Pediatrics (General Routine Care) per diem, the amount on Worksheet B, Part I, Column 24, Line 25 of CMS 2552- 96 (Worksheet B, Part I, Column 25, Line 30 of CMS 2552- 10) should have deducted the amounts appearing on Worksheet D -1, Part I, Lines 26 and 36 (for swing bed and private room differential adjustments, respectively) of CMS 2552- 96 and CMS 2552- 10, and the amount on Worksheet S -3, Part I, Column 6, Line 5 of CMS 2552- 96 (Worksheet S -3, Part I, Column 8, Line 7 of CMS 2552- 10) should have added the amount appearing on Line 26 (observation bed days) of CMS 2552- 96 (Line 28 of CMS 2552- 10). Ancillary ratio of cost- to-charges (RCC) for each hospital ancillary cost center is computed by dividing: - The individual line and subscript amounts for each of the Lines 37 to 63, taken from Worksheet B, Part I, Column 25 of CMS 2552- 96 or the individual line and subscript amounts for each of the Lines 50 to 93, taken from Worksheet B, Part I, Column 24 of CMS 2552- 10. - by - The individual line and subscript amounts for each of the Lines 37 to 63, taken from Worksheet C, Part I, Column 8 of CMS 2552- 96 or the individual line and subscript amounts for each of the Lines 50 to 93, taken from Worksheet C, Part I, Column 8 of CMS 2552- 10. (Note that the above cos t report references are based on the CMS -2552- 96 and CMS 2552- 10. For later versions of the CMS -2552, the equivalent worksheets, columns and lines should be identified.) 3. For each hospital routine cost center, the per diem amount computed in Step #2 is applied to the number of Medicaid and uninsured hospital inpatient days for the service period as defined in Step #1. Only hospital inpatient days are to be included; all days pertaining to long term care units or any other non- hospital units must be excluded. The number of Medicaid and uninsured hospital inpatient days must be derived from auditable sources, including the state's PMMIS, managed care encounter data, and provider patient accounting records. Hospital Medicaid and uninsured days are ident ified for each hospital routine cost center. The result is the facility's Medicaid and uninsured hospital routine cost. For each hospital ancillary cost center, the RCC computed in Step #2 is applied to the Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 134 Amended: January 18, 2019 Medicaid and uninsured hospital inpatient and hospital outpatient ancillary charges for the service period as defined in Step #1. Only hospital ancillary charges are to be included; all charges pertaining to non -hospital units, including Rural Health Clinics, Federally Qualified Health Centers, and cl inics that are not recognized as hospital outpatient departments, must be excluded. The Medicaid and uninsured hospital ancillary charges must be derived from auditable sources, including the state's PMMIS, managed care encounter data, and provider patient accounting records. Hospital Medicaid and uninsured ancillary charges are identified for each hospital ancillary cost center. The result is the facility's Medicaid and uninsured hospital inpatient and hospital outpatient ancillary cost. 4. The Medicaid and uninsured costs computed in Step #3 will be offset by all revenues received by the hospital for the Medicaid and uninsured hospital inpatient and hospital outpatient services, including but not limited to Medicaid FFS and supplemental payments made by AHCC CS; Medicaid payments made by health plans and program contractors; payments made by or on behalf of patients; payments made by third parties; and any other payments received by for uninsured services that are not excluded from offset under Section 1923(g) (1)(A) of the Social Security Act as state- only or local -only indigent care program payments. 5. The computed Medicaid and uninsured uncompensated care costs based on a prior period may be inflated to the current period using CMS market basket. Furthermore, the state may apply trending factors to account for changes in utilization (e.g., due to changes in Medicaid eligibility criteria) and Medicaid payment rates to ensure that interim uncompensated care costs approximate final uncompensated care costs for th e current service period as closely as possible. Such trending factors must account for both increases and decreases affecting a provider's uncompensated care costs. 6. The hospital's Medicaid and uninsured costs must be further adjusted to remove costs related to non -emergency services furnished to unqualified aliens. For this purpose, the hospital's uncompensated care costs will be reduced by 12.88% to the extent that such unqualified alien non- emergency service costs are not fully reimbursed by DSH dollars. 7. For SNCP uncompensated care payments, the state must ensure that the payments made to hospitals are accounted for in the facility's disproportionate share hospital (DSH) OBRA 93 hospital -specific limit. There cannot be any duplication of payments for the same hospital uncompensated care costs under the SNCP and under DSH. 8. The interim computation of hospital uncompensated care cost limit as described above uses the same prior period cost report and other relevant data as that used by the state in its initial OBRA 93 hospital- specific limit computation for DSH payments for the current DSH state Plan Rate Year. Interim Reconciliation Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 135 Amended: January 18, 2019 Each hospital's uncompensated care costs must be recomputed based on the hospital's as- filed cost report for the actua l service period. The cost report is filed with the Medicare contractor five months after the close of the cost reporting period. SNCP uncompensated care payments made to the hospital for a DY cannot exceed the recomputed uncompensated care cost limit. If, at the end of the interim reconciliation process, it is determined that expenditures claimed exceeded the individual hospital's uncompensated care cost limit, the overpayment will be recouped from the hospital, and the federal share will be properly credi ted to the federal government. The interim reconciliation follows the same computation as outlined above in the Interim Computation of Uncompensated Care Costs steps, except that the per diems and RCCs, Medicaid and uninsured days and charges, and payment offset amounts used will pertain to the actual service period (rather than the prior period). Per diems and RCCs will be derived from the as- filed cost report; and Medicaid and uninsured days, charges and payments will be derived from the latest availabl e auditable data for the service period. No trending factor will be applied. The uncompensated care costs must again be adjusted to remove costs related to non-emergency services furnished to unqualified aliens. The state must ensure that there is no dupli cation of payments for the same hospital uncompensated care costs under the SNCP and under DSH; SNCP payments must be accounted for in the hospital's OBRA 93 hospital -specific limit. A hospital's uncompensated care cost limit is determined for the twelve month period in each DY. Where a hospital's cost reporting period does not coincide with the DY (or partial DY or calendar year if the limits in paragraph 32(c) are stated for a partial DY or a calendar year), the uncompensated care costs computed for a co st reporting period can be allocated to the DY (or partial DY) based on the number of cost reporting months that overlap with the DY (or partial DY). This is consistent with the methodology for the computation of the OBRA 93 hospital -specific limit for a given DSH State plan rate year. The interim reconciliation described above will be performed and completed within six months after the filing of the hospital Medicare cost report(s). Final Reconciliation Each hospital's uncompensated care costs must be recomputed based on the hospital's audited cost report for the actual service period. The cost report is audited and settled by the Medicare contractor to determine final allowable costs and reimbursement amounts as recognized by Medicare. SNCP uncompensa ted care payments made to the hospital for a DY cannot exceed the recomputed uncompensated care cost limit. If, at the end of the final reconciliation process, it is determined that expenditures claimed exceeded the individual hospital's uncompensated care cost limit, the overpayment will be recouped from the hospital, and the federal share will be properly credited to the federal government. The final reconciliation follows the same computation as outlined above in the Interim Computation of Uncompensate d Care Costs steps, except that the per diems and RCCs, Medicaid and uninsured days and charges, and payment offset amounts used will pertain to the actual service period (rather than the prior period). Per diems and RCCS will be derived from the audited c ost report, and Medicaid and uninsured days, charges and payments will be Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 136 Amended: January 18, 2019 updated with the latest available auditable data for the service period. No trending factor will be applied. The uncompensated care costs must again be adjusted to remove costs related to non-emergency services furnished to unqualified aliens. The state must ensure that there is no duplication of payments for the same hospital uncompensated care costs under the SNCP and under DSH; SNCP payments must be accounted for in the hospit al's OBRA 93 hospital - specific limit. A hospital's uncompensated care cost limit is determined for the twelve month period in each DY. Where a hospital's cost reporting period does not coincide with the DY (or partial DY or calendar year if the limits in paragraph 27(c) are stated for a partial DY or a calendar year), the uncompensated care costs computed for a cost reporting period can be allocated to the DY (or partial DY or calendar year ) based on the number of cost reporting months that overlap with the DY (or partial DY or calendar year ). This is consistent with the methodology for the computation of the OBRA 93 hospital -specific limit for a given DSH State Plan Rate Year. The final reconciliation described above will be performed and completed within six months after the audited hospital Medicare cost report(s) are made available. The final computation of hospital uncompensated care cost limit as described above uses the same final cost report and other relevant data as that used by the state in its final OBRA 93 hospital -specific limit computation for DSH payments for the given DSH State Plan Rate Year. Physician Professional Service Uncompensated Care Costs To be eligible for Federal financial participation (FFP), SNCP uncompensated care payments to each provider cannot exceed the uncompensated care costs as computed by the following steps. The eligible provider is Phoenix Children Hospital, which employ s and contract s for physician services and incur s physician professional service costs (whether the professional services are billed by the hospital or by the physicians). Interim Computation of Uncompensated Care Costs SNCP uncompensated care payments to PCH are limited to uncompensated care costs incurred on or before December 31, 2017. Each DY's SNCP will be distributed based on the provider's projected uncompensated care subject to the PCH limit as described in STC paragraph 32(c), to the extent that sufficient local matching funds are available. This interim computation of uncompensated care costs will be used as the basis for SNCP distribution and will also serve as the uncompensated care cost limit for SNCP payments made to the provider in each demonstration year. 1. Steps for PCH incurring physician professional service costs a. The professiona l component of physician costs are identified from the hospital's CMS 2552 cost report Worksheet A -8-2, Column 4. The most recent CMS 2552 filed with the hospital's Medicare contractor will be utilized. These professional costs are: Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 137 Amended: January 18, 2019 1. Limited to allowable and auditable physician compensations that have been incurred by the hospital; 2. For the professional, direct patient care furnished by the hospital's physicians; 3. Identified as professional costs on Worksheet A -8-2, Column 4 of the cost report of the hospita l claiming payment (or, for registry physicians only, Worksheet A -8, if the physician professional compensation cost is not reported by the hospital on Worksheet A - 8-2 because the registry physicians are contracted solely for direct patient care activities (i.e., no administrative, teaching, research, or any other provider component or non- patient care activities); 4. Supported by a time study, accepted by Medicare for Worksheet A -8-2 reporting purposes, that identified the professional, direct patient care ac tivities of the physicians (not applicable to registry physicians discussed above); and 5. Removed from hospital costs on Worksheet A-8. b. The professional costs on Worksheet A -8-2, Column 4 (or Worksheet A -8 for registry physicians) are subject to further adjustments and offsets, including any necessary adjustment to bring the costs in line with Medicare and Medicaid cost principles and applicable OMB Circulars. However, Medicare physician reasonable compensation equivalents are not applied for physician pr ofessional cost determination purposes. The professional costs are further subject to offsets to account for any applicable non- patient care revenues that were not previously offset or accounted for by the application of time study. The resulting costs rep resent the net allowable professional service costs incurred by the hospitals. c. Reimbursement for other professional practitioner service costs that have also been identified and removed from hospital costs on the Medicare cost report. The practitioner types to be included are: Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists Nurse Practitioners Physician Assistants Dentists Certified Nurse Midwives Clinical Social Workers Clinical Psychologists Optometrists d. To the extent these practitioners' professional compensation costs are not included in Worksheet A -8-2, Column 4, but are removed from PCH costs through an A -8 adjustment on the Medi -Cal cost report, these costs may be recognized if they meet the following criteria: the practitioners must engage in the direct provision of care in addition to being Medicaid - qualified practitioners for whom the services are billable under Medicaid separate from PCH services; for all non physician practitioners there must be an identifiable and auditable data source by practitioner type; a CMS -approved time study must be employed to allocate practitioner Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 138 Amended: January 18, 2019 compensation between clinical and non- clinical costs; and the clinical costs resulting from the CMS -approved time study are subject to further adjustments and offsets, i ncluding adjustments to bring the costs in line with Medicare cost principles and offset of applicable non -patient care revenues that were not previously offset or accounted for by the application of CMS -approved time study. The resulting net clinical non-physician practitioner compensation costs are allowable costs. The compensation costs for each non -physician practitioner type are identified separately. e. Professional costs incurred for freestanding clinics (clinics that are not recognized as hospita l outpatient departments on the 2552) are not included in this protocol. f. The hospital may additionally include physician support staff compensation, data processing, and patient accounting costs as physician -related costs to the extent that: 1. These costs are removed from hospital inpatient and outpatient costs because they have been specifically identified as costs related to physician professional services; 2. They are directly identified on ws A -8 as adjustments to hospital costs; 3. They are otherwise allowable and auditable provider costs; and 4. They are further adjusted for any non- patient -care activities such as research based on physician time studies. If these are removed as A -8 adjustments to the hospital's general service cost centers, these costs should be stepped down to the physician cost centers based on the accumulated physician professional compensation costs. Other than the physician and non- physician practitioner compensation costs and the A -8 physician -related adjustments discussed above, no other costs are allowed. g. Total billed professional charges by cost center related to physician services are identified from auditable provider records. Similarly, for each non- physician practitioner type, the total billed professional charges are ident ified from provider records. Charges must be identified for all professional services for which PCH incurred its cost (whether salaried or contracted). Where the professional services are not billed by PCH directly, PCH must obtain those professional char ges from the billing party. h. A physician cost to charge ratio for each cost center is calculated by dividing the total costs for each cost center as established in paragraphs a- f of subsection 1 by the total billed professional charges for each cost center as established in paragraph g of subsection 1. For each non -physician practitioner type, a cost to charge ratio is calculated by dividing the total costs for each practitioner type as established in paragraphs a -f of subsection 1 by the total billed profes sional charges for each practitioner type as established in paragraph g of subsection 1. i. The total professional charges for each cost center related to eligible Medicaid and uninsured physician services are identified using auditable records. PCH must map the charges to their cost centers. Each charge may only be mapped to one cost center to prevent duplicate mapping and claiming. These charges must be associated with services Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 139 Amended: January 18, 2019 furnished during the period defined by paragraph a of subsection 1. For each non- physician practitioner type, the eligible Medicaid and uninsured professional charges are identified using auditable records. The hospital must map the charges to non- physician practitioner type. Each charge may only be mapped to one practitioner type to prevent duplicate mapping and claiming. These charges must be associated with services furnished during the period covered by the latest as -filed cost report. Auditable records include the state's PMMIS, managed care encounter data, and hospital recor ds. j. The total Medicaid and uninsured costs related to physician practitioner professional services are determined for each cost center by multiplying total Medicaid and uninsured charges as established in paragraph i of subsection 1 by the respective cost to charge ratio for the cost center as established in paragraph h of subsection 1. For each non- physician practitioner type, the total Medicaid and uninsured costs related to non- physician practitioner professional services are determined by multiplying total Medicaid and uninsured charges as established in paragraph i of subsection 1 by the respective cost to charge ratios as established in paragraph h of subsection 1. k. The total Medicaid and uninsured uncompensated care costs are determined by subtracti ng all revenues received for the Medicaid and uninsured physician/practitioner services from the Medicaid and uninsured costs as established in paragraph j of subsection 1. The revenues are derived from auditable records. All revenues received for the Medi caid and uninsured professional services will be offset against the computed cost; these revenues include but are not limited to all Medicaid payments from the state or its program contractors, payments from or on behalf of patients, and payments from any other third party payer. The total professional service uncompensated care costs as computed above should be reduced by 12.88% to account for non- emergency care furnished to unqualified aliens. l. The Medicaid and uninsured physician/practitioner amount computed in paragraph k of subsection 1 above can be trended to current period to account for cost inflation based on CMS market basket update factor. Furthermore, the state may apply trending factors to account for changes in utilization (e.g., due to changes in Medicaid eligibility criteria) and Medicaid payment rates to ensure that interim uncompensated care costs approximate final uncompensated care costs for the current service period as closely as possible. Such trending factors must account for both incr eases and decreases affecting a provider's uncompensated care costs. (Note that the above cost report references are based on the CMS -2552- 96 and CMS 2552- 10. For later versions of the CMS -2552, the equivalent worksheets and columns should be identified.) Interim Reconciliation Each hospital's uncompensated care costs must be recomputed based on the as -filed cost report for the actual service period. The hospital cost report is filed with the Medicare Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 140 Amended: January 18, 2019 contractor five months after the close of the cost reporting period. SNCP uncompensated care payments made to the hospital for a DY cannot exceed the recomputed uncompensated care cost limit. If, at the end of the interim reconciliation process, it is determined that expenditures claimed exceeded the individual hospital's uncompensated care cost limit, the overpayment will be recouped, and the federal share will be properly credited to the federal government. The interim reconciliation follows the same computation as outlined above in the Interim Computation of Uncompensated Care Costs steps, except that the RCCs, Medicaid and uninsured charges, payment offset amounts and any other relevant statistics such as time study or time study proxy data used will pertain to the actual service period (rathe r than the prior period). RCCs will be derived from the as -filed cost report; and Medicaid and uninsured charges and payments will be derived from the latest available auditable data for the service period. No trending factor will be applied. The uncompens ated care costs must again be adjusted to remove costs related to non -emergency services furnished to unqualified aliens. A hospital's uncompensated care cost limit is determined for the twelve month period in each DY. Where a hospital's cost reporting pe riod does not coincide with the DY (or partial DY or calendar year if the limits in paragraph 32(c) are stated for a partial DY or a calendar year), the uncompensated care costs computed for a cost reporting period can be allocated to the DY (or partial DY or calendar year ) based on the number of cost reporting months that overlap with the DY (or partial DY or calendar year ).

Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 141 Amended: January 18, 2019 A hospital's uncompensated care cost limit is determined for the twelve month period in each DY. Where a hos pital's cost reporting period does not coincide with the DY (or partial DY or calendar year if the limits in paragraph 27(c) are stated for a partial DY or calendar year), the uncompensated care costs computed for a cost reporting period can be allocated to the DY (or partial DY or calendar year ) based on the number of cost reporting months that overlap with the DY (or partial DY or calendar year ). For hospital -incurred professional service uncompensated care costs, the final reconciliation described above will be performed and completed within six months after the audited hospital Medicare cost report(s) are made available. Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 142 Amended: January 18, 2019 Attachment F IHS and 638 Facilities Uncompensated Care Payment Methodology The methodology outlined below has been approved for structuring a payment that will be made to IHS and 638 facilities that take in to account their uncompensated costs in furnishing specified types of care furnished by IHS and tribal 638 facilities to Medicaid- eligible individuals. Participating facilities must utilize the methodology described below in determining these payments to the facilities: Historical Data Methodology This methodology is comprised of the following that will be used to calculate the total dollar amount of uncompensated care that will be paid to IHS and 638 facilities on a prospective basis. The state will calculate a per member per month (PMPM) rate, using historical data, to reflect the services that it removed from the Medicaid state plan effective October 1, 2010, that were furnished in or by IHS/tribal 638 facilities to AHCCCS -enrolled individuals, and would multiply this rate by the total number of adult AI/ANs currently enrolled in the AHCCCS program. This PMPM will be adjusted on an annual basis to mirror the medical inflation adjustment applied to the all -inclusive rate. Once this aggregate dollar amount has been computed, the state will disburse payments to the IHS and 638 facilities based on payments made to each facility for care provided to AI/AN adults from July 1, 2010 through June 30, 2011. In addition, the state will annually review whether the PMPMs calculated above were accurate within a reasonable margin of error by reviewing actual records of services furnished by one or more facilities. If the PMPM is not va lidated, the state will apply an adjustment factor for the following year. As part of this methodology, the non -Federal share for services provided to non- natives would be calculated based on the following. 1. After analyzing claims data from 2009 -10, the st ate calculated a ratio of claims paid for currently covered Arizona Medicaid state plan services that were provided at IHS and 638 facilities to non- natives to the total number of paid claims to IHS and 638 facilities. Using this ratio, the state calculated that approximately $2 million out of total claims paid to IHS facilities was for services provided to non- natives. As such, the state will pay the non -Federal share of the $2 million. The state will review the claims data on an annual basis and will adjust the non -Federal share amount accordingly. 2. The state will apply the ratio that was calculated of non -native costs to total IHS costs as described above to calculate the non -Federal portion of the service PMPM payments as described above.

To ensure DSHP expenditures do not include costs associated with providing coverage of non-emergency services to undocumented immigrants, the State will reduce actual expenditures by the proportion of the AHCCCS population enrolled in the Emergency Services Program (ESP), which is 6.3%. This adjustment is the undocumented immigrant Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 146 Amended: January 18, 2019 offset. 3. Financial Data Reporting. The Arizona Financial Information System (AFIS) is the accounting system of record for the state of Arizona. Payment voucher information is entered into AFIS by AHCCCS and ADES. All payments made by the state are processed in AFIS. AFIS expenditure data is the basis for identifying the total DSHP expenditure, prior to applying offsets. For DSHP se rvices to individuals with Serious Mental Illness, AHCCCS' total reportable DSHP expenditures start with the amounts AHCCCS paid the Regional Behavioral Health Authorities (RBHAs) as reported in AFIS. RBHAs provide quarterly financial reports to AHCCCS th at identify specific, actual expenditures. These reports are the basis for identifying and calculating offsets as discussed below to reduce the total reportable DSHP expenditures. For early intervention developmentally disabled DSHP services, ADES' total reportable DSHP expenditures tart with the amount of ADES paid to its contracted providers as reported in AFIS. ADES will identify and calculate offsets as discussed below to reduce the total reportable DSHP expenditures. 4. Designated State Health Progr ams Detail Services to Individuals with Serious Mental Illness State Agency: AHCCCS Program: Services to Individuals with Serious Mental Illness (SMI) Funding Source: Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) Funds provided by Maricopa County and Pima County. Brief Description: Two counties in Arizona provide funds to AHCCCS via Intergovernmental Agreements (IGAs) to provide services to non- Medicaid individuals with Serious Mental Illness (SMI). AHCCCS contracts with managed care organizations called Regional Behavioral Health Authorities (RBHAs), who contract with providers for case management, peer support and planning, community based supports, medication management services, and other medical services. Funding flows from the counties, to AHCCCS, to RBHAs, and then to providers. Eligible Population: The program serves individuals who request behavioral health services, are determined eligible to receive SMI services, and are determined not eligible for Medicaid/CHIP. An individual is determined eligible to receive SMI services if they have a qualifying SMI diagnosis and functional impairment caused by the diagnosis. Qualifying diagnoses include anxiety, bipolar, major depression, obsessive -compulsive, dissociative, pe rsonality, psychotic, and post -traumatic stress disorders. Functional impairment means long -term dysfunction in one of the following domains: (1) inability to live in an independent or Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 147 Amended: January 18, 2019 family setting without supervision, (2) risk of serious harm to self or others, (3) dysfunction in role performance, or (4) risk of deterioration. Individuals are evaluated for SMI eligibility by a clinician and receive an initial SMI evaluation and a final SMI eligibility determination. When an individual requests to re ceive behavioral health services they are also required to participate in a preliminary financial screening and eligibility process to identify third party payers and determine if they are eligible for Medicaid/CHIP, including submission of an application and completion of the eligibility determination process. If an individual receives an SMI determination, but does not qualify for Medicaid/CHIP, they are eligible to receive services under this program. An individual does not qualify for Medicaid/CHIP if they have household income or assets in excess of the following thresholds, do not meet residency requirements, and/or do not otherwise qualify for categorical eligibility: Eligibility Criteria: Income < Assets > Children 200% FPL - Adults 133% FPL - Pregnant Women 156% FPL - Long -Term Care 300% FBR $2,000 SSI 100% FBR $2,000 SSI - Funding: Services provided to non -Title XIX individuals with SMI may be funded by the County IGAs, Mental Health Block Grant, Substance Abuse Block Grant, or State General Fund. This DSHP reflects only the County IGAs, and so excludes other federal and state sources of funding. Two Arizona counties (Maricopa and Pima) provide approximately $60 million annually for this state -only program. Funding and associated expenditures are contained within AHCCCS. The counties provide funding to AHCCCS on a monthly basis in accordance with IGAs. These County IGA funds do not serve to meet any maintenance of effort requirement or federal matching requirement for any federal program. No copayments or fees are charged to this population and so patient payments do not offset the cost of providing services or provide revenue for the program. In some cases, individuals not eligible for Medicaid/CHIP may have third- party coverage that covers all or a portion of behavioral health services. RBHAs and behavioral health providers are required to determine third party health insurance coverage prior to providing services under this program and are responsible for cost avoiding by coordinating benefits. If third -party liability is identified after services have been provided, RBHAs and providers are responsible for post -payment recovery. All expenditures reported for this program are net of any TPL revenue that is collected. Eligible Providers: Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 148 Amended: January 18, 2019 The State makes monthly installment payments based on the annual contract amount to RBH As under existing non- Medicaid services contracts. RBHAs contract with behavioral health providers, who provide direct services. On a quarterly basis, RBHAs report back to AHCCCS on the actual services provided in the form of RBHA financial statements. AHCCCS' monthly payments to the RBHAs are reconciled to actual RBHA expenditures. Documentation and Claiming Process: Step 1 AHCCCS Division of Business and Finance (DBF) identifies actual expenditures of County IGA funds to RBHAs based on appropriation, fund, and sub- fund account codes as recorded in AFIS. This methodology excludes all federal funds and State General Fund expenditures. The identified amount is the initial, unadjusted DSHP expenditure, which reflects costs incurred by AHCCCS in making payments to the RBHAs specifically for the County IGA program. Step 2 On a quarterly basis, each RBHA submits a Statement of Activities that reports expenses by funding source, including the County IGA program. AHCCCS Division of Health Care Management (DHCM) reviews the quarterly RBHA financial statements for the period an d identifies IGA funds paid to the RBHAs that were not used to provide SMI services and/or were used to provide services that are not permissible as DSHP expenditures, per Section 2. The DSHP expenditure is reduced by these amounts. The following expenditures are excluded because they are not for SMI services: General Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services to non -SMI Adults Children's Services to Remanded Juveniles Central City Addiction Recovery Center (CCARC) Services The following expenditures are excluded because they are not DSHP eligible: Room and Board Services Services provided to residents of an Institution for Mental Diseases (IMD) Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Costs RBHA Administrative Costs Step 3 AHCCCS DBF applies the 6.3% undoc umented immigrant offset on the DSHP expenditure adjusted by Step 2. The DSHP expenditure is reduced by this amount. Step 4 AHCCCS prepares a summary schedule that identifies the initial, unadjusted DSHP expenditure in AFIS (Step 1), shows the reductions for funds paid to RBHAs that were not used to provide SMI services and/or were used to Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 149 Amended: January 18, 2019 provide services that are not permissible as DSHP expenditures (Step 2), and shows the 6.3% undocumented immigrant offset (Step 3). The final amount is the adjusted, e ligible DSHP payment. An example summary schedule is attached. Step 5 The State submits a claim to CMS for FFP based on the total computable expenditure incurred by the State in making the eligible DSHP payment. Step 6 The State attests expenditures used are correct and verifiable as DSHP allowable. Process occurs quarterly based on quarterly financial reporting. Reductions/Offsets for Non -Matchable Expenditure List: The reportable DSHP expenditures incurred by AHCCCS as reported in AFIS are evaluated for the non- matchable expenditures listed in Section 2 and in the AHCCCS STCs. Any DSHP expenditures reported from AFIS already exclude expenditures that are funded by federal grants or federal financial participation and other non- state, non -local government funding or revenue sources. Expenditures for this program are not utilized to meet the state maintenance of effort requirements for the Mental Health Block Gran t and Substance Abuse Block Grant, and so do not need to be reduced or offset for this purpose. The following DSHP ineligible expenditures are offsets/reductions that apply to this program. Room and Board Services Services provided to residents of an Ins titution for Mental Diseases (IMD) Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Costs RBHA Administrative Costs These are expenditures for services that are not Medicaid -like or for non- medical services. Finally, actual expenditures are reduced by the undocumented immigrant offset amount to exclude costs associated with non -emergency services provided to undocumented immigrants. Developmentally Disabled Services State Agency: Arizona Department of Economic Security (ADES) Program: Division of Developmental Disabilities (DDD) Funding Source: State General Fund Appropriation Brief Description: Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 150 Amended: January 18, 2019 The Arizona Department of Economic Security (ADES) Division of Developmental Disabilities (DDD) provides state -only early intervention and home and community based services to individuals who are not eligible for Medicaid. Annual funding of approximately $16.8 million is provided by a state general fund appropriation. DDD directly contracts with independent providers for early intervention services, day treatment, habilitation, residential group homes, occupational therapy, physical therapy, and speech therapy. Eligible Population: The target population is primarily children, specifically the early intervention population aged 0 to 3 with, or at risk of, developmental delays. Developmental delays are based on diagnostic criteria in the areas of physical, cognitive, language/communication, social/emotional, and adaptive self -help childhood development. Individuals must be ineligible for Medicaid in order to receive state- only services. Children are ineligible for Medicaid primarily due to household income or assets in excess of established limits. Some individuals may have other insurance, in which cases state -only funding may function as the payer of last resort. Funding: The source of non- federal revenue is an annual state general fund appropriation. DDD exchanges a file with AHCCCS to identify individuals who are Medicaid- eligible and for whom Medicaid should pay for services, and providers must bill Medic aid first. For individuals with third party coverage, providers must bill insurance first and DDD requires documentation of the denial of those claims in order to process a state -only payment. All expenditures for this program are net of costs that were avoided or revenues recovered. IDEA Part C is not a funding source for this program. However, ADES DDD reports these state-only expenditures to the Arizona Department of Education in order to demonstrate compliance with state Maintenance of Effort requirements for IDEA Part C. Eligible Providers: ADES DDD contracts with independent providers for early intervention services, day treatment, habilitation, residential group homes, occupational therapy, physical therapy, and speech therapy. Documentation and Claiming Process: Step 1 ADES submits data summary table to AHCCCS that identifies actual expenditures based on appropriation, fund, and sub- fund account codes as recorded in AFIS. This amount is the initial, unadjusted DSHP expenditure . These identified expenditures are expenditures incurred by ADES in making medical service payments to contracted providers for the DDD program. Demonstration Approval: October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2021 151 Amended: January 18, 2019 Step 2 ADES submits data summary table to AHCCCS that identifies actual expenditures based on service cate gory to AHCCCS, including identification of the amount of expenditures for Room and Board services. The DSHP expenditure is reduced by this amount. Step 3 ADES submits data summary table to AHCCCS that identifies state expenditures reported as Maintenan ce of Effort (MOE) for the IDEA Part C federal grant. The DSHP expenditure is reduced by this amount. MOE is calculated once annually and offset is applied in a single quarter. Step 4 AHCCCS applies the 6.3% undocumented immigrant offset on the DSHP expenditure as adjusted by Step 2 and Step 3. The DSHP expenditure is reduced by this amount. Step 5 AHCCCS prepares a summary schedule that identifies the initial, unadjusted DSHP expenditure in AFIS (Step 1), shows the reduction for Room and Board expend itures (Step 2), shows the reduction for IDEA Part C MOE (Step 3), and shows the 6.3% undocumented immigrant offset (Step 4). The final amount is the adjusted, eligible DSHP payment. Step 6 The State submits a claim to CMS for FFP based on the total co mputable expenditure incurred by the State in making the eligible DSHP payment. Step 7 The State attests expenditures used are correct and verifiable as DSHP allowable. Reductions/Offsets for Non -Matchable Expenditure List: Any DSHP expenditures re ported from AFIS already exclude expenditures that are funded by federal grants or federal financial participation and other non- state, non- local government funding or revenue sources. Actual expenditures are reduced by Room and Board expenditures. These are the only expenditures for services that are not Medicaid -like. The expenditures reported in AFIS do not include any payments made by ADES for non- medical services. Actual expend itures are reduced by the expenditures reported as MOE for the IDEA Part C grant program. Process occurs quarterly and IDEA Part C MOE offset is calculated annually and applied to a single quarter. Finally, actual expenditures are reduced by the undocumented immigrant offset amount to exclude costs associated with services provided to undocumented immigrants.
