We accompany Mam\u00e1 Irene on ancient spiritual ceremonies such as the Snow Star Festival, where thousands of pilgrims gather in Sinakara Valley high in the Peruvian Andes to honor the local glacier. The film depicts Mam\u00e1 Irene's secret healing practices, never before filmed. This is not only a vital document of endangered wisdom; it is also a story about Woman empowerment and how to live in harmony with Mother Earth. As the film unfolds, we learn about Mam\u00e1 Irene's personal journey. She discovered her healing gift by chance at three years old, when she intuitively healed a neighbor's migraines by rubbing her own saliva on his forehead. She became known in the village as La Doctorcita \u2014 the little doctor. She was sold by her father into slavery; beaten by her husband, who was determined to keep her in the role of a servant; gave birth to 15 children, eight of whom died; endured misogyny and rivalry from male shamans. Yet Mam\u00e1 Irene never wavered in pursuing her craft. She believed in herself and in the gifts she was born with. This is a story about a woman who overcomes tremendous trauma and obstacles - yet continues to grow and inspire at age 84. \"LOS ESP\u00cdRITUS ME HAN DICHO pie por Andes hasta una doctora de la India que busca la cura para una que de peregrinos en dones con que naci\u00f3. Esta es la historia a sus 84 a\u00f1os. **The Holistic Wellness Program attends to the needs of the total person while remaining rooted in our Latino/Mexican American cultural identities.
