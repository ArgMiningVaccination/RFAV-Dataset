The Army is incorporating the ACFT into personnel policies in a time-phased, deliberate manner to ensure all Soldiers can train and adjust to the new event and scoring scales before scores are used for personnel actions. Record scores for National Guard and Army Reserve Soldiers commence in April 2023, thereby giving Reserve Component Soldiers a full year to train for the revised test before any personnel actions are implemented. The Army is committed to providing equivalent training opportunities to all Soldiers in all components and fairness in the transition to the ACFT. ACFT equipment is not required for training and the Army has released an ACFT training guide with training plans and exercises to help Soldiers successfully prepare for the test anytime, anywhere. The ACFT YouTube page has videos of exercises to help prepare for the ACFT, many of which require no equipment. Additional resources can be found on the [Army Training Network](https://atn.army.mil/prt#acft) and [MilSuite](https://www.milsuite.mil/book/groups/h2facft). Additionally, commanders are required to administer at least one diagnostic ACFT prior to record testing to ensure Soldiers are adequately prepared. The Army equipped units with $78 million worth of ACFT equipment, with 10,829 sets of equipment going to the Active Component, compared to 15,854 sets of equipment to the National Guard, and 8,037 sets to the Army Reserve. Additionally, TRADOC ordered another 5,029 sets of equipment that were distributed to recruiting stations, ROTC detachments, and TRADOC installations. The overall ratio of equipment sets to Soldiers for the Total Army is 1:25, with more sets issued to the Reserve Components than to active duty Soldiers (1:30 active, 1:21 National Guard, and 1:23 Reserve). Leaders are strongly encouraged to use this equipment for Physical Readiness Training during their drill weekends and to help Soldiers familiarize with the test. Reserve Component Soldiers looking for ACFT equipment to test or train on should contact their readiness NCO or chain of command, or they can coordinate with their local recruiting station or ROTC program. The National Guard is also updating the list of locations with ACFT equipment by state on the [National Guard Bureau's SharePoint site (CAC required).](https://armyeitaas.sharepoint-mil.us/teams/ARNGHolisticHealthandFitnessH2F) Additionally, the Army added the 2.5 mile walk as an alternate aerobic event to accommodate for any lack of equipment to conduct the other alternate aerobic events. Regular Army, National Guard, and Army Reserve units are developing tailored solutions to training for the ACFT, using FM 7-22 as a guide, and adapting to their individual situations and resources. FM 7-22 provides recommended training schedules for all phases of unit training cycles, to include the Reserve Component and remotely located Soldiers. "}
