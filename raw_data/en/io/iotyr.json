We identified factors that either supported or hindered their development and, drawing on this information, determined key lessons for future programmes with similar objectives.Methods A longitudinal qualitative study encompassing focus group discussions and semistructured interviews conducted with the cohort of African postdoctoral fellows, programme leadership, supervisory and research support staff (N=28). Data analysis was informed by a general inductive approach.Results Numerous supportive and hindering factors were identified. Supportive factors were primarily structural or attitudinal in nature, whereas hindering factors were primarily operational or contextual. None of the supporting or hindering factors were specific to vectorborne disease research. Four key lessons for future programme implementation emerged, including: the value in exposing postdoctoral fellows to a diverse work-mix and training-mix to improve understanding of the broad skillset needed for scientific career advancement; recognising and managing the potentially competing interests of different partnership members to ensure everyone benefits from participation; ensuring equity of opportunity and rewarding engagement; and ensuring flexibility in support provision.Conclusion Our study highlights numerous factors that may be readily incorporated into early career researcher capacity strengthening initiatives based on a learn-by-doing approach. Many of these factors are supported by a growing weight of evidence and would be appropriate to research capacity strengthening programmes both within and outside of a vectorborne disease context. [Negotiating public-health intellectual property licensing agreements to increase access to health technologies: an insiders story](http://gh.bmj.com/cgi/content/short/8/9/e012964?rss=1) Public health voluntary licensing of intellectual property has successfully been applied to increase access to medicines in certain disease areas, producing health benefits and economic savings, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries. There is however limited understanding of the intricacies of the approach, the modalities by which it works in practice, its levers and the trade-offs made. Such knowledge may be critical in deciding what role licensing should have in pandemic preparedness and equitable access to health technologies more broadly. This paper examines the case for licensing, the considerations for balancing public health needs, the challenges of negotiations, and the processes for validating proposed agreements. No access mechanism is perfect, but evidence suggests that public-health licensing has an important role to play, although it remains underused. Understanding some of the realities, strengths, limitations and complexities of applying the model may help calibrate expectations and develop incentives to expand its applications. [Trends of breastfeeding indicators in Brazil from 1996 to 2019 and the gaps to achieve the WHO/UNICEF 2030 targets](http://gh.bmj.com/cgi/content/short/8/9/e012529?rss=1) The comprehension of breastfeeding patterns and trends through comparable indicators is essential to plan and implement public health policies.Objective To evaluate the trends of breastfeeding indicators in Brazil from 1996 to 2019 and estimate the gap to achieve the WHO/UNICEF 2030 targets in children under 5 years.Methods Microdata from two National Surveys on Demography and Health of Women and Children (PNDS-1996 and PNDS-2006) and the Brazilian National Survey on Child Nutrition-2019 were used. The indicators of early initiation of breastfeeding (EIBF), exclusive breastfeeding of infants 0-5 months of age (EBF<6 mo), continued breastfeeding at 1 year of age (CBF1yr) and CBF at 2 years of age (CBF2yr) were analysed using prevalence and 95% CI. The average annual variation and years to achieve the WHO/UNICEF 2030 targets were calculated for Brazil and the macroregions. Statistical analyses considered the survey's complex sample design for each database.Results EIBF increased from 36.3% (95% CI to 60.9% (95% CI 56.5% to 65.3%) in 2006 (statistically significant) 62.5% (95% CI 58.3% to 66.6%) in 2019. from 26.9% CI to 1996 to 2006 and 45.8% (95% CI 40.9% to 50.7%) in 2019 (significant increases for 1996-2019 for Brazil, Northeast and Midwest regions). CBF1yr rose from 36.6% (95% CI 30.8% to to 2006, to 2006 and 35.5% (95% CI 30.4% to 40.6%) in 2019 (significant increase for 1996-2019). The South and Southeast regions need to double the 2019 prevalence to reach the target for the CBF1yr and CBF2yr; the Northeast and North need to increase 60% the current prevalence for the indicator of EBF<6 mo.Conclusion A substantial improvement in breastfeeding indicators occurred in Brazil from 1996 to 2019, although at an insufficient rate to achieve the WHO/UNICEF 2030 targets. [Reimagining global mental health in Africa](http://gh.bmj.com/cgi/content/short/8/9/e013232?rss=1) In 2001, the WHO launched The World Health Report most specifically addressing low-income and middle-income countries (LAMICs). It highlighted the importance of mental health (MH), identifying the severe public health impacts of mental ill health and made 10 recommendations. In 2022, the WHO launched another world MH report and reaffirmed the 10 recommendations, while concluding that 'business as usual for MH will simply not do' without higher infusions of money. This paper suggests the reason for so little change over the last 20 years is due to the importation and imposition of Western MH models and frameworks of training, service development and research on the assumption they are relevant and acceptable to Africans in LAMICs. This ignores the fact that most mental and physical primary care occurs within local non-Western traditions of healthcare that are dismissed and assumed irrelevant by Western frameworks. These trusted local institutions of healthcare that operate in homes and spiritual spaces are in tune with the lives and culture of local people. We propose that Western foundations of MH knowledge are not universal nor are their assumptions of society globally applicable. Real change in the MH of LAMICs requires reimagining. Local idioms of distress and healing, and explanatory models of suffering within particular populations, are needed to guide the development of training curricula, research and services. An integration of Western frameworks into these more successful approaches are more likely to contribute to the betterment of MH for peoples in LAMICs. [Developing relevant community mental health programmes in North India: five questions we ask when co-producing knowledge with experts by experience](http://gh.bmj.com/cgi/content/short/8/8/e011671?rss=1) Knowledge co-production can improve the quality and accessibility of health, and also benefit service users, allowing them to be recognised as skilled and capable. Yet despite these clear benefits, there are inherent challenges in the power relations of co-production, particularly when experts by experience (EBE) are structurally disadvantaged in communication skills or literacy. The processes of how knowledge is co-produced and negotiated are seldom described. This paper aims to describe processes of co-production building on the experiences of EBE (people with lived experience of psychosocial or physical disability), practitioners and researchers working together with a non-profit community mental health programme in North India. We describe processes of group formation, relationship building, reflexive discussion and negotiation over a 7-year period with six diverse EBE groups. Through a process of discussion and review, we propose these five questions which may optimise co-production processes in communities: (1) Who is included in co-production? (2) How can we optimise participation by people with diverse sociodemographic identities? (3) How do we build relationships of trust within EBE groups? (4) How can we combine psychosocial support and knowledge co-production agendas in groups? and (5) How is the expertise of experts by experience acknowledged? [Does ignoring transmission dynamics lead to underestimation of the impact of interventions against mosquito-borne disease?](http://gh.bmj.com/cgi/content/short/8/8/e012169?rss=1) New vector-control technologies to fight mosquito-borne diseases are urgently needed, the adoption of which depends on efficacy estimates from large-scale cluster-randomised trials (CRTs). The release of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes is one promising strategy to curb dengue virus (DENV) transmission, and a recent CRT reported impressive reductions in dengue incidence following the release of these mosquitoes. Such trials can be affected by multiple sources of bias, however. We used mathematical models of DENV transmission during a CRT of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes to explore three such biases: human movement, mosquito movement and coupled transmission dynamics between trial arms. We show that failure to account for each of these biases would lead to underestimated efficacy, and that the majority of this underestimation is due to a heretofore unrecognised bias caused by transmission coupling. Taken together, our findings suggest that Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes could be even more promising than the recent CRT suggested. By emphasising the importance of accounting for transmission coupling between arms, which requires a mathematical model, we highlight the key role that models can play in interpreting and extrapolating the results from trials of vector control interventions. [Public health engagement: new opportunities and challenges in 60 years of Chinas health aid to Africa](http://gh.bmj.com/cgi/content/short/8/8/e012302?rss=1) Along with China's active engagement in global affairs over the past decade, China's public health engagement (CPHE) has become an essential element of China's 60th anniversary of health aid and cooperation with Africa. Through analysis, we found that CPHE in Africa reflects a new shift in the content and form of China's foreign health aid. Compared with China's medical teams which only involve bilateral cooperation, CPHE has a number of substantive characteristics, mainly including the construction of public health infrastructure, malaria control, participation in public health emergencies and the provision of global public goods. This complexity necessitates that CPHE be implemented in a different form from China's medical teams, by adopting inclusive multiparty cooperation involving African and international partners. However, CPHE in Africa still faces a number of challenges in its practices. In particular, these challenges arise from the cross-cultural practice process, the African sociocultural context, the experience of public health and its participants. While the reasons for these challenges are diverse, this study argues that the main reason is the lack of multidisciplinary engagement in the Africanisation of the Chinese experience that corresponds to cross-cultural practice. On the Chinese side, a systematic strategy is needed to critically refine these challenges. [Analyses of the return on investment of public health interventions: a scoping review and recommendations for future studies](http://gh.bmj.com/cgi/content/short/8/8/e012798?rss=1) Return on investment (ROI) analysis is increasingly being used for evaluating the value for money of public health interventions. Given its potential role for informing health policies, it is important that there is a more comprehensive understanding of ROI analysis within the global health field. To address this gap in the literature, we conducted a scoping review of recent research articles reporting an ROI metric for a health intervention within the public sector in any country setting. The database search was limited to literature published in English and studies published between 1 January 2018 and 14 June 2021. Uses and settings where the ROI metric is being applied, key methodological features of the calculations and the types of economic benefits included were extracted. 118 relevant studies were included within this scoping review. We found that ROI analyses of health interventions differed between those that only included fiscal savings (such as prevented medical expenses) and those which incorporated a wider range of benefits (such as monetised health benefits). This highlights the variation in the definition of ROI analyses and supports the finding that ROI analyses are used for a range of different research questions/purposes within the healthcare sector. We also found that the methodologies used in ROI calculations were inconsistent and often poorly reported. This review demonstrates that there is notable variation in the methodology surrounding recent ROI calculations of healthcare interventions, as well as the definition of ROI analysis. We recommend that ROI metrics should be carefully interpreted before they are used to inform policy decisions regarding the allocation of healthcare resources. To improve the consistency of future studies, we also set out recommended use cases for ROI analysis and a reporting checklist. [Alternative approaches for creating a wealth index: the case of Mozambique](http://gh.bmj.com/cgi/content/short/8/8/e012639?rss=1) The wealth index is widely used as a proxy for a household's socioeconomic position (SEP) and living standard. This work constructs a wealth index for the Mopeia district in Mozambique using data collected in year 2021 under the BOHEMIA (Broad One Health Endectocide-based Malaria Intervention in Africa) project.Methods We evaluate the performance of three alternative approaches against the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) method based wealth index: feature selection principal components analysis (PCA), sparse PCA and robust PCA. The internal coherence between four wealth indices is investigated through statistical testing. Validation and an evaluation of the stability of the wealth index are performed with additional household income data from the BOHEMIA Health Economics Survey and the 2018 Malaria Indicator Survey data in Mozambique.Results The Spearman's rank correlation between wealth index ventiles from four methods is over 0.98, indicating a high consistency in results across methods. Wealth rankings and households' income show a strong concordance with the area under the curve value of ~0.7 in the receiver operating characteristic analysis. The agreement between the alternative wealth indices and the DHS wealth index demonstrates the stability in rankings from the alternative methods.Conclusions This study creates a wealth index for Mopeia, Mozambique, and shows that DHS method based wealth index is an appropriate proxy for the SEP in low-income regions. However, this research recommends feature selection PCA over the DHS method since it uses fewer asset indicators and constructs a high-quality wealth index.

We aimed to assess the extent to which Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan programme\u2014has succeeded in raising health insurance coverage of the poorest two-fifths of the population of India.Methods We used nationally representative data from the National Family Health Survey on 633 699 and 601 509 households in 2015-2016 (pre-PM-JAY) and 2019-2021 (mostly, post PM-JAY), respectively. We stratified by urban/rural and estimated NPHI coverage nationally, and by state, district and socioeconomic categories. We decomposed coverage variance between states, districts, and households and measured socioeconomic inequality in coverage. For Uttar Pradesh, we tested whether coverage increased most in districts where PM-JAY had been implemented before the second survey and whether coverage increased most for targeted poorer households in these districts.Results We estimated that NPHI coverage increased by 11.7 percentage points (pp) (95% CI 11.0% to 12.4%) and 8.0 pp (95% CI 7.3% to 8.7%) in rural and urban India, respectively. In rural areas, coverage increased most for targeted households and pro-rich inequality decreased. Geographical inequalities in coverage narrowed. Coverage did not increase more in states that implemented PM-JAY. In Uttar Pradesh, the coverage increase was larger by 3.4 pp (95% CI 0.9% to 6.0%) and 4.2 pp (95% CI 1.2% to 7.1%) in rural and urban areas, respectively, in districts exposed to PM-JAY and the increase was 3.5 pp (95% CI 0.9% to 6.1%) larger for targeted households in these districts.Conclusion The introduction of PM-JAY coincided with increased public health insurance coverage and decreased inequality in coverage. But the gains cannot all be plausibly attributed to PM-JAY, and they are insufficient to reach the goal of universal coverage of the poor. [Strengthening regulatory systems globally: a crucial step towards pandemic preparedness and response](http://gh.bmj.com/cgi/content/short/8/8/e012883?rss=1) [Interactive SARS-CoV-2 dashboard for real-time geospatial visualisation of sewage and clinical surveillance data from Dhaka, Bangladesh: a tool for public health situational awareness](http://gh.bmj.com/cgi/content/short/8/8/e012921?rss=1) Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, many dashboards were created to visualise clinical case incidence. Other dashboards have displayed SARS-CoV-2 sewage data, largely from countries with formal sewage networks. However, very few dashboards from low-income and lower-middle-income countries integrated both clinical and sewage data sets. We created a dashboard to track in real-time both COVID-19 clinical cases and the level of SARS-CoV-2 virus in sewage in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The development of this dashboard was a collaborative iterative process with Bangladesh public health stakeholders to include specific features to address their needs. The final dashboard product provides spatiotemporal visualisations of COVID-19 cases and SARS-CoV-2 viral load at 51 sewage collection sites in 21 wards in Dhaka since 24 March 2020. Our dashboard was updated weekly for the Bangladesh COVID-19 national task force to provide supplemental data for public health stakeholders making public policy decisions on mitigation efforts. Here, we highlight the importance of working closely with public health stakeholders to create a COVID-19 dashboard for public health impact. In the future, the dashboard can be expanded to track trends of other infectious diseases as sewage surveillance is increased for other pathogens. [Mistreatment of women during childbirth and postpartum depression: secondary analysis of WHO community survey across four countries](http://gh.bmj.com/cgi/content/short/8/8/e011705?rss=1) Postpartum depression (PPD) is a leading cause of disability globally with estimated prevalence of approximately 20% in low-income and middle-income countries. This study aims to determine the prevalence and factors associated with PPD following mistreatment during facility-based childbirth.Method This secondary analysis used data from the community survey of postpartum women in Ghana, Guinea, Myanmar and Nigeria for the WHO study, 'How women are treated during facility-based childbirth'. PPD was defined using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) tool. Inferential analyses were done using the generalised ordered partial proportional odds model.Results Of the 2672 women, 39.0% (n=1041) developed PPD. 42.2% and 5.2% of mistreated women developed minimal/mild PPD and moderate/severe PPD, respectively. 43.0% and 50.6% of women who experienced verbal abuse and stigma/discrimination, respectively developed minimal/mild PPD. 46.3% of women who experienced physical abuse developed minimal/mild PPD while 7.6% of women who experienced stigma/discrimination developed moderate/severe PPD. In the adjusted model, women who were physically abused, verbally abused and stigma/discrimination compared with those who were not were more likely to experience any form of PPD ((OR: 1.57 (95% CI 1.19 to 2.06)), (OR: 1.42 (95% CI 1.18 to 1.69)) and (OR: 1.69 (95% CI 1.03 to 2.78))), respectively. Being single and having higher education were associated with reduced odds of experiencing PPD.Conclusion PPD was significantly prevalent among women who experienced mistreatment during childbirth. Women who were single, and had higher education had lower odds of PPD. Countries should implement women-centred policies and programmes to reduce mistreatment of women and improve women's postnatal experiences. "}
