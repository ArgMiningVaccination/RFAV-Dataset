Non-pharmacological interventions for preventing delirium in hospitalised non-ICU patients. Cochrane Database of Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. A B S T R A C T Background Delirium is an acute neuropsychological disorder that is common in hospitalised patients. It can be distressing to patients and carers and it is associated with serious adverse outcomes. Treatment options for established delirium are limited and so prevention of delirium is desirable. Non-pharmacological interventions are thought to be important in delirium prevention. Objectives To assess the eectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions designed to prevent delirium in hospitalised patients outside intensive care units (ICU). Search methods We searched ALOIS, the specialised register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, with additional searches conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, Web of Science Core Collection, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization Portal/ICTRP to 16 September 2020. There were no language or date restrictions applied to the electronic searches, and no methodological filters were used to restrict the search. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of single and multicomponent non-pharmacological interventions for preventing delirium in hospitalised adults cared for outside intensive care or high dependency settings. We only included non-pharmacological interventions which were designed and implemented to prevent delirium. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently examined titles and abstracts identified by the search for eligibility and extracted data from full- text articles. Any disagreements on eligibility and inclusion were resolved by consensus. We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. The primary outcomes were: incidence of delirium; inpatient and later mortality; and new diagnosis of dementia. We included secondary and adverse outcomes as pre-specified in the review protocol. We used risk ratios (RRs) as measures of treatment eect for Non-pharmacological interventions for preventing delirium in hospitalised non-ICU patients (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Collaboration.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews dichotomous outcomes and between-group mean dierences for continuous outcomes. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. A complementary exploratory analysis was undertaker using a Bayesian component network meta-analysis fixed-eect model to evaluate the comparative eectiveness of the individual components of multicomponent interventions and describe which components were most strongly associated with reducing the incidence of delirium. Main results We included 22 RCTs that recruited a total of 5718 adult participants. Fourteen trials compared a multicomponent delirium prevention intervention with usual care. Two trials compared liberal and restrictive blood transfusion thresholds. The remaining six trials each investigated a dierent non-pharmacological intervention. Incidence of delirium was reported in all studies. Using the Cochrane risk of bias tool, we identified risks of bias in all included trials. All were at high risk of performance bias as participants and personnel were not blinded to the interventions. Nine trials were at high risk of detection bias due to lack of blinding of outcome assessors and three more were at unclear risk in this domain. Pooled data showed that multi-component non-pharmacological interventions probably reduce the incidence of delirium compared to usual care (10.5% incidence in the intervention group, compared to 18.4% in the control group, risk ratio (RR) 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 39%; 14 studies; 3693 participants; moderate-certainty evidence, downgraded due to risk of bias). There may be little or no eect of multicomponent interventions on inpatient mortality compared to usual care (5.2% in the intervention group, compared to 4.5% in the control group, RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.74, I 2 = 15%; 10 studies; 2640 participants; low-certainty evidence downgraded due to inconsistency and imprecision). No studies of multicomponent interventions reported data on new diagnoses of dementia. Multicomponent interventions may result in a small reduction of around a day in the duration of a delirium episode (mean dierence (MD) -0.93, 95% CI -2.01 to 0.14 days, I 2 = 65%; 351 participants; low-certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias and imprecision). The evidence is very uncertain about the eect of multicomponent interventions on 2=64%; 147 participants; very low-certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias and serious imprecision). Multicomponent interventions may result in a reduction in hospital length of stay compared to usual care (MD -1.30 days, 95% CI -2.56 to -0.04 days, I 2=91%; 3351 participants; low-certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias and inconsistency), but little to no dierence in new care home admission at the time of hospital discharge (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.07; 536 participants; low-certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias and imprecision). Reporting of other adverse outcomes was limited. Our exploratory component network meta-analysis found that re-orientation (including use of familiar objects), cognitive stimulation and sleep hygiene were associated with reduced risk of incident delirium. Attention to nutrition and hydration, oxygenation, medication review, assessment of mood and bowel and bladder care were probably associated with a reduction in incident delirium but estimates included the possibility of no benefit or harm. Reducing sensory deprivation, identification of infection, mobilisation and pain control all had summary estimates that suggested potential increases in delirium incidence, but the uncertainty in the estimates was substantial. Evidence from two trials suggests that use of a liberal transfusion threshold over a restrictive transfusion threshold probably results in little to no dierence in incident delirium (RR 0.92, 95% CI I 2 = 9%; 294 participants; moderate-certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias). Six other interventions were examined, but evidence for each was limited to single studies and we identified no evidence of delirium prevention. Authors' conclusions There is moderate-certainty evidence regarding the benefit of multicomponent non-pharmacological interventions for the prevention of delirium in hospitalised adults, estimated to reduce incidence by 43% compared to usual care. We found no evidence of an eect on mortality. There is emerging evidence that these interventions may reduce hospital length of stay, with a trend towards reduced delirium duration, although the eect on delirium severity remains uncertain. Further research should focus on implementation and detailed analysis of the components of the interventions to support more eective, tailored practice recommendations.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Background Delirium is an important illness which is common among adults, especially older adults who are in hospital. It is sometimes referred to as an 'acute confusional state' . Typically, a person with delirium has sudden onset of confusion, which fluctuates, and o2\u00f1?ten includes impaired concentration, memory and thinking skills; reduced awareness of surroundings; drowsiness or agitation and restlessness; and hallucinations, which are usually visual (seeing things which are not really there). It can be distressing for the individual with delirium and their family. It is also associated with increased risks of complications, such as dying in hospital, having a longer hospital stay, and requiring more care a2\u00f1?ter discharge. Increasingly, there is evidence that delirium is associated with an increased risk of permanent worsening of memory and thinking skills, including development or worsening of dementia. Non-pharmacological approaches are approaches which do not use medications, but which focus on other aspects of care. They are already recognised as important in reducing the risk of delirium, particularly multicomponent interventions which target several of the common risk factors for delirium. It is not known which components of these complex interventions are most important in preventing delirium and this was something we wanted to find out. Study characteristics We searched up to 16 September 2020 for reports of studies in which people in hospital were randomly allocated to a non-pharmacological intervention intended to prevent delirium or to usual hospital care. We found 22 studies with 5718 participants. Fourteen of the studies were of multicomponent approaches; two studies looked at dierent cut-os for giving a blood transfusion a2\u00f1?ter an orthopaedic operation; the remaining six studies all considered dierent approaches. Key findings Multicomponent approaches probably reduce occurrence of delirium by 43% compared to usual hospital care. This means that two in five cases of delirium in adults in hospital wards (other than ICU) can be prevented by multicomponent, non-pharmacological approaches. These interventions may also reduce the length of time people stay in hospital and, if delirium does occur, they may reduce the duration of the delirium episode by about a day. However, these approaches may have little or no eect on the risk of dying in hospital. The studies did not investigate the eect of multicomponent interventions on the development or worsening of dementia. There was little information about whether the interventions had any harmful eects. Using a new statistical technique, we found that the following components within each intervention were most important for preventing delirium: (a) trying to keep people well-oriented to their surroundings and making their surroundings more familiar, (b) providing stimulation to memory and thinking skills, and (c) trying to improve sleep (through sleep hygiene measures). We could not be so certain about the eect of other components, largely because not enough evidence was available. More research is needed comparing the specific components included in multicomponent interventions to help determine the most eective and eicient ways to prevent delirium. The evidence for other, single-component, non-pharmacological interventions was very limited. Certainty of the evidence There were some limitations in the studies which may aect the results. In many included studies the people in the study and sometimes researchers were aware of who was and was not receiving the intervention. There was very little information about people living with dementia, who are at greater risk of experiencing delirium.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews B A C K G R O U N D Description of the condition Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness and cognition, which usually has a rapid onset and a fluctuating course. The core features of delirium are defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, FiOf_th Edition , and include \"disturbance in attention, awareness and cognition, which develops over a short period of time and tends to fluctuate in severity during the course of a day. It represents an acute change from baseline and is not better explained by a pre-existing, established or evolving neurocognitive disorder or a severely reduced level of arousal such as coma. There should be evidence from history, physical examination or laboratory findings that the disturbance is a direct physiological consequence of another medical condition, substance intoxication or withdrawal, or exposure to a toxin, or is due to multiple etiologies\" ( American Psychiatric Association 2013 ). The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision (ICD-10) definition of delirium is similar, but also includes disturbance of the sleep-wake cycle and does not specify that there is a definitive underlying aetiology ( World Health Organization 2016 ). Delirium is highly prevalent across all inpatient hospital settings, with an estimated occurrence of 23% ( Gibb 2020 ). The highest prevalence rates were found in patients who had experienced cardiac surgery, neurosurgery, trauma, radiotherapy and neurology (36% to 41%) ( ). However, delirium was also common in geriatric medicine, internal medicine, general surgery, reconstructive plastic surgery and cranio-maxillo-facial surgery (22% to 29%) ( Schubert 2018 ). A point prevalence study conducted in Ireland found that 20% of adult hospital inpatients had delirium on a single day and that age was associated with higher prevalence (5% in those under 50 years of age, versus 35% in those aged over 80) ( Ryan 2013 ). Pooled prevalence of delirium from meta-analysis of 25 studies was 15% with cumulative incidence of new delirium of 9% over two weeks ( Gibb 2020 ). This ranges from 11% to 14% general medicine, 20% to 29% in geriatric medicine, 10% to 27% in stroke units, 47% in palliative care settings and 12% to 51% in orthopaedic units ( Inouye 2014 ). Delirium is associated with a range of serious adverse health outcomes. Factors associated with poorer outcomes a2\u00f1?ter an episode of delirium include: longer duration and severity; hypoactive delirium subtype; and of depression ( Jackson 2016a ). A meta-analysis of observational study data from older adults found those with delirium were at an increased risk of death (hazard ratio (HR) 1.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.51 to 2.52), a2\u00f1?ter adjusting for age, sex, comorbidity illness or illness severity and baseline dementia (Witlox 2010 ). Evidence indicates increased hospital length of stay is both a risk factor for developing delirium and an outcome associated with experiencing delirium ( Ahmed 2014 ; Aitken 2017 ; Pendlebury Delirium can have irreversible eects on an individual's function. A UK cohort of hospital admissions with mental health problems found only 25% of those experiencing delirium had a clinically important recovery in their activities of daily living six months a2\u00f1?ter the episode ( Whittamore 2013 ). Delirium is also associated with an increased risk in overall dependency (odds ratio (OR) 2.56, 95% CI 1.37 to 4.76) ( Pendlebury 2015 ). This can lead to an increased riskof requiring formal institutional care ( Witlox 2010 ), particularly for those with delirium superimposed on an existing dementia ( Burton 2018 ). Undiagnosed cognitive impairment and dementia are common in older adults presenting with delirium ( Jackson 2016b ). In adults with Alzheimer's disease, an episode of delirium was found to accelerate cognitive decline, compared to those who did not experience delirium ( Fong 2009 ). Combined neuropathological and clinical cohort study data have confirmed that delirium both accelerates existing cognitive decline and is a risk factor for developing dementia ( Davis 2012 ). Delirium symptoms experienced in early older age (60 to 69 years) are associated with poorer cognitive function a2\u00f1?ter adjustment for other dementia risk factors ( Tsui 2018 ). An important consideration in evaluating the impact of an episode of delirium is both the duration of the episode and the severity, and validated measures are available to quantitatively assess both parameters ( Vasunilashorn 2016 ). Persistent delirium (lasting beyond hospital discharge) is common, estimated to aect \"25.6% (95% CI 7.9% to 43.3%)\" of older at three months follow-up ( Cole 2009 ). Dementia, malignancy, multi morbidity, increased delirium severity, hypoactive subtype and hypoxic illness have been independently associated with persistent delirium ( Cole 2015 ; Dasgupta 2010 ). Significantly, delirium is distressing, particularly to family members who witness episodes ( Finucane 2017 ), and also may have lasting eects on the individual patient if they recall their in-hospital experiences ( Grover 2015 ; Partridge 2013 ). It can also cause distress to sta caring for these patients ( Agar 2012 ; Partridge 2013 ; Waterfield 2018 ). Delirium has considerable economic impact on healthcare systems and society ( Leslie 2011 ). Estimates suggest the costs for those with delirium are two and a half times greater per day than for those without delirium ( Leslie 2008 ). The cost-eectiveness of multicomponent delirium-prevention interventions has been demonstrated using data from a non-randomised study ( Akunne 2012 ), however there is a lack of data on cost-eectiveness from randomised trials ( Siddiqi 2016 ). Description of the intervention This review assesses the eectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions for preventing delirium in hospitalised patients outside the intensive care unit (ICU) and high dependency unit (HDU) setting. Non-pharmacological interventions can be broadly divided into single component interventions, which o2\u00f1?ten target a specific risk factor, and multicomponent interventions, which target multiple risk factors for delirium. Multicomponent interventions are o2\u00f1?ten based around care delivered according to specific protocols, and target risk factors such as sleep deprivation, immobility, dehydration and sensory impairment ( Inouye 1999a ). The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommend assessing for the presence of delirium risk factors in adults aged 65 years and older; those with cognitive impairment; those with a hip fracture; and those with severe illness at the time of hospital presentation ( NICE 2010 ). Therea2\u00f1?ter, it recommends a multicomponent intervention tailored to needs and care setting, delivered by a multidisciplinary team ( NICE 2010 ). Non-pharmacological interventions for non-ICU patients (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.7Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews How the intervention might work A number of risk factors for delirium have been identified ( Ahmed 2014 ; Pendlebury 2015 ; Wilson 2020 ). While some of these are non-modifiable factors such as age and comorbidity, there are others which are potentially modifiable, including dehydration, sensory impairment and urinary catheterisation ( Ahmed 2014 ). Predictors of incident delirium during a hospital admission include dementia, dependence in activities of daily living, and increased illness severity ( O'Regan 2018 ). Delirium has been described as the interaction between an individual's baseline vulnerability (based on predisposing factors such as age and cognitive function) and precipitating factors or insults occurring during the hospital admission ( Inouye 1996 ). These precipitating factors can be further divided into those which are related to the presenting illness an individual is experiencing and those occurring a2\u00f1?ter admission, which include environmental factors, pain management interventions, and sleep deprivation ( Wilson 2020 ). Furthermore, it has been suggested that a combination of risk factors for delirium may interact to increase vulnerability and that susceptibility can be scored at the time of admission ( Pendlebury 2017 ). It is thought that non-pharmacological interventions can be used to address these risk factors, targeting those vulnerable to developing delirium, as an eective prevention strategy. Why it is important to do this review Delirium is common across all inpatient settings and, in view of the serious complications, costs and consequences arising, it is a priority for healthcare practitioners and providers. Establishing the degree to which delirium can be prevented, and identifying evidence-based strategies for prevention, will help inform evidence-based care pathways. Multicomponent interventions have been shown in randomised controlled trials to reduce the incidence of delirium ( Martinez 2015 ; Siddiqi 2016 ). However, the reductions seen in delirium incidence have not been associated with statistically significant reductions in length of stay or in longer-term sequelae, including mortality or the need for admission to long-term care ( Hshieh 2015 ; Martinez 2015 ). There is uncertainty about the precision and certainty of these findings and the extent to which frailty influences outcomes (Teale 2015 ). Delirium and frailty (defined as '\"a diminished ability to compensate for stressors\") are conditions associated with poor outcomes in older people and they have been postulated to be dierent manifestations of \"shared vulnerability to stress\" ( Quinlan 2011 ). This relationship is complex and poorly understood; recent evidence suggests that mortality risk in delirium is greatest in those with lower levels of frailty ( Dani 2018 ), although the role of illness severity in mediating this association is not known. It would, however, be helpful to identify if those with frailty are dierentially aected by delirium-prevention interventions. Some of the risk factors for delirium \u2014 including malnutrition, dehydration, restraint use, and iatrogenic events (condition caused by medical or surgical interventions) \u2014 can be seen as measures of the quality of hospital care. The occurrence of delirium has been linked to the quality of care delivered to inpatients, which can highlight areas for improvement ( Inouye 1999b ). Clinical adverse events which have been associated with delirium, such as falls and pressure ulcers, are also priorities for reduction within inpatient settings. The associations between delirium and dementia meanthat interventions to prevent delirium are of interest to the wider public health agenda of dementia prevention ( Fong 2015 ). Over the past decade there has been a rapid increase in the number of randomised trials of delirium-prevention interventions. In 2007, a Cochrane Review identified six trials evaluating six interventions to prevent delirium, only one of which was a non-pharmacological intervention ( Siddiqi 2007 ). The 2016 update identified 39 trials of 22 interventions, including seven trials of multicomponent interventions and two other non-pharmacological interventions ( Siddiqi 2016 ). There was heterogeneity among the multicomponent interventions studied, with the number of components ranging from two to 13. In this review, we focused on non-pharmacological interventions only to allow a more detailed synthesis of the current evidence in this area. We also add a component network meta-analysis to try to develop understanding of which components are necessary and most eective. This should allow more robust recommendations for practice and future research to be made. O B J E C T I V E S To assess the eectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions designed to prevent delirium in hospitalised non-intensive care unit (ICU) patients. M E T H O D S Criteria for considering studies for this review Types of studies We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cluster- RCTs. Types of participants We included studies of adult participants (aged 18 years and over) who were admitted to general hospital settings. This included acute and rehabilitation hospitals and sub-acute care provided in hospital. We excluded studies conducted in community settings, such as long-term care or nursing homes; these are considered in a separate Cochrane Review ( Woodhouse 2019 ). If settings were mixed, we only included the study if data could be extracted specifically for the hospitalised patients. We excluded studies conducted in intensive care unit (ICU) and high dependency unit (HDU) settings, due to the dierent populations and interventions likely to be found in such environments. ICU settings, also known as Level 3 settings, are those where patients require either respiratory support alone, or support of a minimum of two organs ( Intensive Care Society 2009 ). HDU settings, also known as Level 2 settings, are those where patients either receive single-organ support or are stepping down from Level 3 care; need preoperative optimisation using invasive monitoring; or need extended postoperative care ( Intensive Care Society 2009 ). The evidence for delirium prevention in ICU settings is evaluated in a separate Cochrane Review ( Herling 2018 ). We excluded studies of delirium associated with psychoactive substance misuse or withdrawal, as these presentations are clinically distinct. We considered studies of delirium prevention in patients receiving only in-hospital specialist palliative care and evaluated them using Non-pharmacological interventions for preventing delirium in hospitalised non-ICU patients (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.8Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews a sensitivity analysis within this review. Delirium prevalence in specialist palliative care settings can be very high (approximately 42% of admissions to specialist palliative care units) and the goals of care may be dierent in this context ( Bush 2017 ). Types of interventions We only included non-pharmacological interventions which were designed and implemented to prevent delirium. We did not include studies targeting those with \"geriatric syndromes\" , rather than delirium specifically. Eligible interventions were multicomponent interventions or single-component interventions targeting a specific risk factor for delirium (e.g. sleep disturbance, dehydration, disorientation). Interventions could be implemented at the level of the ward or department providing care, or at the individual level. We excluded studies of pharmacological interventions to prevent delirium. Specifically, this included tablets, infusions, injectable medications, inhaled medications, or anaesthetic gases, given to all participants in active treatment arms with the intention of preventing delirium. Studies that included correction of abnormal physiology using a pharmacological intervention as part of a multicomponent intervention, e.g. administration of oxygen in presence of low oxygen saturations, were eligible for inclusion. Comparators could be usual care or an active control intervention. Types of outcome measures We included all studies which fulfilled our other eligibility criteria and which measured any of the primary or secondary outcomes. We prespecified clinically important secondary outcomes and adverse outcomes which are relevant to patients, families and healthcare providers. Primary outcomes 1. Incidence of delirium during hospital admission, using a validated diagnostic method. (Studies using only a positive screening test in the absence of a formal diagnosis were excluded.) 2. Mortality as an inpatient, between one and three months, six and 12 months, and beyond 12 months from randomisation. 3. New diagnosis of dementia, made between one and three months, six and 12 months, and beyond 12 months from randomisation. Secondary outcomes 1. Duration of delirium episode, measured in days. 2. Severity of delirium, measured using validated instruments including the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS) (Breitbart 1997 ), ( Scale Revised 1998 (DRS-R-98) ( Trzepacz 2001 ). 3. Length of hospital admission, measured in days. 4. Use of new psychotropic medication during hospital admission. 5. Activities of daily living, measured using a validated instrument including the Barthel Index ( Mahoney 1965 ) and Katz Index ( Katz 1963 ), between one and three months, six and 12 months, and beyond 12 months from randomisation.6. Quality of life, measured using a validated patient reported measure, between one and three months, six and 12 months, and beyond 12 months from randomisation. 7. Carer's quality of life, using a validated carer-reported measure, between one and three months, six and 12 months, and beyond 12 months from randomisation. 8. Withdrawal from protocol by participants. Adverse outcomes 1. Readmission to hospital within 30 days of discharge. 2. Progression of existing dementia, measured using a validated instrument, between one and three months, six and 12 months, and beyond 12 months from randomisation. 3. New care-home admission at discharge and between one and three months, six and 12 months, and beyond 12 months from randomisation. 4. Falls. 5. Pressure ulcers. Search methods for identification of studies Electronic searches We searched ALOIS (www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois), the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialised Register, up to the 16th September 2020. ALOIS is maintained by the Information Specialists of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group and contains studies in the areas of dementia (prevention and treatment), mild cognitive impairment and cognitive improvement. The studies are identified from: 1. monthly searches of a number of major healthcare databases: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO and LILACS; 2. monthly searches of the trial registers: the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (which covers ClinicalTrials.gov, ISRCTN, the Chinese Clinical Trials Register, the German Clinical Trials Register, the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials, and the Netherlands National Trials Register, plus others) and ClinicalTrials.gov; 3. quarterly search of the Cochrane Library's Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); 4. six-monthly searches of a number of grey literature sources from ISI Web of Science Core Collection. Details of the search strategies used for the retrieval of reports of trials from the healthcare databases, CENTRAL and conference proceedings can be viewed in the 'Methods used in reviews' section within the editorial information about the Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group. We performed additional searches in many of the sources listed above, to cover the timeframe from the last searches performed for ALOIS to ensure that the search for the review was as up-to-date and as comprehensive as possible. The search strategies used are described in Appendix 1 . The most recent search was carried out on the 16 September 2020. Searching other resources We examined reference lists from identified articles and relevant systematic reviews to identify any additional potential trials to review for eligibility. We searched the ClinicalTrials.gov database, Non-pharmacological interventions for preventing delirium in hospitalised non-ICU patients (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.9Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews to identify any relevant ongoing trials. We compared the trials that meet our review inclusion criteria with the trials register to identify any trials where results have been unpublished. We contacted the lead author of any unpublished trials, to ask if they are prepared to share their results (we examined these against the published protocols to ensure they have been consistently analysed). Data collection and analysis Selection of studies We directly imported the results of the literature searches into Covidence so2\u00f1?tware ( Covidence 2017 ). This automatically removed direct duplicate records. Therea2\u00f1?ter, two review authors, with experience in conducting systematic reviews, independentlyscreened the titles and abstracts of all identified articles and removed irrelevant results. We resolved any disagreements by discussion, involving a third review author if necessary. Two review authors then independently examined the full-text articles of potentially relevant articles against the review eligibility criteria. We resolved any disagreements by consensus with a third review author. If we were unable to determine eligibility based on the available information, for example if only an abstract was identified, we contacted the study authors for clarification and additional data as necessary. We listed all articles excluded a2\u00f1?ter full-text assessment in the Characteristics of included studies table, with reasons for exclusion. We present a PRISMA diagram to summarise the study selection process ( Figure 1 ).

(Continued) Data extraction and management We created a data extraction tool, adapted from the version used in the previous version of this review ( Siddiqi 2016 ). Two review authors extracted data using this tool, discussing any disagreements and involving a third author if necessary. To allow use of more of the reported data for syntheses, where medians and Interquartile ranges (IQR) or ranges were presented rather than means and standard deviations, we converted values as follows. We assumed the median value was equivalent to the mean. We estimated the standard deviation as 'IQR/1.35' or 'range/4' (small studies, n < 70) or 'range/6' (larger studies, n > 70). For delirium incidence and severity, where results were presented for multiple time points and no summary data were available, we used the highest recorded number or peak values for the intervention and control arm. This was because we were interested in interventions that reduced the overall burden of delirium. For example, if delirium severity was ascertained on days one, three, and five of the hospital stay, then we included only the highest of the three scores (most severe) in our analysis of delirium severity. For severity and duration of delirium, data were included only from patients with delirium. We used RevMan Web to produce tables documenting the characteristics of included, excluded and ongoing trials ( RevMan Web 2021 ). We created a summary of findings table using GRADE Pro So2\u00f1?tware ( GRADEpro 2014 ). Component network meta-analysis The previous version of this review ( Siddiqi 2016 ), included a descriptive table of multicomponent intervention components, with 20 components described from the seven included studies (Abizanda 2011 ; Bonaventura 2007 ; Hempenius 2013 ; Jes 2013 ; Lundstrom 2007 ; Marcantonio 2001 ; Martinez 2012 'components' depression/anxiety); bowel/bladder care and postoperative complications. To undertake our exploratory component network meta-analysis we extracted text from each of the included studies about their specific multicomponent intervention and the components included in each study ( Appendix 2 ). We mapped the 14 includedstudies to the originally described 20 components and then reviewed these. Due to the small number of identified studies relative to the number of potential components, components had to be grouped to enable analysis to be undertaken. This was done by clinical review authors and experts in network meta-analysis to ensure clinical and methodological integrity in the approach. We recognised that some of these components described how the intervention was delivered (e.g. individualised care (o2\u00f1?ten described as tailoring), or use of checklists/protocols) as distinct from components of the intervention itself. Thus we considered tailored/individualised care, use of protocol/checklist, sta education and multidisciplinary care as modes of delivery, rather than components. We also considered comprehensive geriatric assessment for inclusion in the network as it was reported in three trials ( Hempenius 2013 ; Lundstrom 2007 ; Partridge 2017 ), but clinically this entity encapsulated several of the components already specified ( Welsh 2014 ) and thus we classified it as a mode of delivery, rather than an individual component. Similarly, family involvement, reported in three studies, covered both the delivery of the intervention ( Hosie 2020 ; Martinez 2012 ; Wang 2020 ) and a component of the intervention itself ( Hosie 2020 ) so we did not include it as a component in the analysis. Inclusion of family involvement resulted in the model failing to achieve convergence. Management of postoperative complications was identified in a single study ( Marcantonio 2001 ) and we did not consider it to be analogous to other components, so excluded it. Fluid and electrolyte balance was also only considered in a single study (Marcantonio 2001 ). Considering the clinical context, we combined this with the nutrition/hydration component and included it in the analysis in this format. Finally, use of familiar objects was reported in two studies ( Bonaventura 2007 ; Martinez 2012 ). These were only delivered in studies which included a reorientation component and we considered it clinically appropriate to combine these components as reorientation (including use of familiar objects). Assessment of risk of bias in included studies Two review authors independently performed a risk of bias assessment. We evaluated each study using the criteria described in the original Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias ( Higgins 2011 ). We assessed trials for the domains of: random sequence generation; allocation concealment; blinding of participants and personnel; blinding of outcome assessment; incomplete outcome data; selective reporting and other bias. Cluster-RCTs are subject to additional biases: recruitment bias (recruitment of individual study participants a2\u00f1?ter randomisation of clusters), chance between-cluster baseline imbalances due to a Non-pharmacological interventions for preventing delirium in hospitalised non-ICU patients (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.12Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews small number of clusters, loss of clusters (e.g. withdrawal of a study site), not accounting for clustering during the analysis (incorrect unit of analysis issues), or bias introduced through combining data from cluster-randomised and individually-randomised trials in meta analyses (risk of underestimation of treatment eects). We considered those which extended beyond the traditional risk of bias domains under the heading of 'other bias' . We judged each study as being at either high, low or unclear risk of bias in each domain. We resolved any disagreements by discussion between the two review authors, involving a third author if necessary. We produced summary tables and figures of the risk of bias assessment, with justification, in RevMan Web (RevMan Web 2021 ). When using GRADE methods to assess the certainty of the evidence from pooled analyses, we downgraded certainty for risk of bias, or study limitations, where the majority or all of included studies had limitations likely to be relevant to the outcome of interest (e.g. we downgraded for high risk of performance and detection bias for outcomes such as delirium incidence; whereas ascertainment of mortality would probably not be aected by lack of blinding but could be subject to important selection or attrition bias). Measures of treatment eect For continuous outcomes, we calculated between-group (intervention versus control) mean dierences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). If studies used dierent instruments to measure the same continuous outcome, we calculated the standardised mean dierence (SMD). SMD was interpreted in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs. Unit of analysis issues Where cluster-randomised studies had analysed data using statistical methods that account for clustering, we extracted the adjusted eect measures (RRs) and their 95% CIs. If an included study reported only unadjusted analyses, then we approximated corrected analyses by extracting data on the number of clusters, mean size of each cluster, primary outcome data and estimates of intra-cluster correlation coeicient (ICC). If approximately corrected analyses were not possible, then we extracted the primary data and calculated RRs with 95% CIs. Dealing with missing data We contacted study authors to try to obtain data not reported in the publication. We reported missing data for each included study, including reporting the number of participants included in the final analysis as a proportion of all participants in the study. We performed available-case analysis, including data on those participants whose outcomes were known. We reported incomplete outcome assessment in the risk of bias table for each study, including an assessment of the potential impact of missing data on the results. Assessment of heterogeneity We described clinical heterogeneity. If we considered the data to be appropriate for quantitative synthesis, we calculated statistical heterogeneity and described it using the I 2 statistic ( Higgins 2002 ). Interpretation of the I 2 statistic was in accordance with guidance in the Cochrane Handbook ( Deeks 2019 ). Assessmentof heterogeneity was based on visual analysis of the forest plot, directions of eect at individual study level and the I 2 statistic, with I 2 of 75% to 100% indicating considerable heterogeneity (Guyatt 2011 ). Assessment of reporting biases We compared the studies included in our review with clinical trial registries, to identify trials with unpublished results. We compared the published studies included in the review against their protocols to check adherence to planned methods. We used funnel plots to assess for possible publication bias for our two primary outcomes with pooled data (incidence of delirium and in-hospital mortality) for multicomponent interventions and used these to inform our GRADE assessments. Data synthesis Where it was appropriate, we performed meta-analysis of extracted data using RevMan Web ( RevMan Web 2021 ). We used a random-eects model. We calculated pooled RRs with 95% CIs for dichotomous outcomes (intervention versus control), and pooled MDs with 95% CIs for continuous outcomes. If studies used dierent instruments to measure the same continuous outcome, we calculated the SMD. We synthesised outcomes from appropriately adjusted cluster-RCTs. We performed data synthesis only where it was considered that the identified studies were clinically homogenous, such that pooling of data was appropriate and valid comparisons could be made. If the clinical heterogeneity was significant, we reported a narrative evidence synthesis. Component network meta-analysis We used a Bayesian component network meta-analysis fixed-eect model to evaluate the comparative eectiveness of the individual components of interventions and to draw conclusions about which components were most strongly associated with reducing the incidence of delirium. A fixed-eect model was used because there were not enough data to estimate between-study heterogeneity. Models were constructed as described by Welton 2009 , using code from Freeman 2018 adapted to include a binomial likelihood with logit link for binary outcomes. We fitted an additive eects model which assumes the eects of components add together directly when combined. If data allowed we planned to fit a model relaxing the assumption of additivity through the inclusion of pairwise interactions between components which would allow combinations of components to have synergistic or antagonistic eects. However, due to the small number of trials relative to the number of component parameters in the model we were unable to fit this model. Bayesian analyses were run using WinBUGS version 1.4.3 and R version 4.0.1 through the R2WinBUGS package ( Sturtz 2005 ). Models were run with a burn in of at least 20,000 iterations and a sample of 30,000 iterations. Convergence was assessed through history and density plots. We used vague prior distributions for trial-specific baselines (e.g. the log-odds of the outcome in the control group) and component eects. Results are reported as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% credibility intervals with component eects reported relative to treatment-as-usual.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity From our main meta-analysis results we performed subgroup analyses for participants in trials conducted in medical versus surgical inpatient settings; and for those with and without a diagnosis of dementia (measured using a validated diagnostic instrument). We were unable to undertake the planned analysis of those who were considered to have frailty versus those who were not (measured using a validated instrument) due to lack of available data in the included studies. Sensitivity analysis Sensitivity analysis to remove studies in which participants were receiving palliative care only versus those receiving other medical or surgical treatment was undertaken as planned. We did not undertake our planned sensitivity analysis around risk of methodological bias, as all studies were considered at high risk of bias in at least one domain. In the protocol, we planned sensitivity analyses to address two possible scenarios: uncertainty about the optimal way to define components, and an intervention component being delivered to only a fraction of a trial arm. However, we did not encounter either of these scenarios. Summary of findings and assessment of the certainty of the evidence We used GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool so2\u00f1?tware (GRADEpro 2014 ) to determine the overall certainty of the evidence and to generate a summary of findings table for the outcomes: incidence of delirium, inpatient mortality, new diagnosis of dementia (at any time point a2\u00f1?ter randomisation), duration of delirium, peak delirium severity, length of hospital admission, and discharge to new long-term care placement. We created a summary of findings table only for the multicomponent intervention analysis as the other interventions had too few included studies to draw conclusions. R E S U L T S Description of studies See Characteristics of included studies ; Characteristics of excluded studies ; Characteristics of studies awaiting classification ; Characteristics of ongoing studies Results of the search The search results are summarised in a PRISMA diagram ( Figure 1 ). Of the 227 full-text articles retrieved, 26 were considered eligible for inclusion; 182 were excluded (see Excluded studies ); and 19 are ongoing (see Characteristics of ongoing studies ). Of the 26 studies considered eligible for inclusion, four had no published results available including searching for publications based on author names and study titles from within trial registry entries. We were unsuccessful in attempts to contact the named study contacts identified in the Trial Registry entries by email. These four studies have been listed as 'Studies awaiting classification' and are described in Characteristics of studies awaiting classification . Twenty-two studies are included in the review.Included studies The 22 studies included a total study population of 5718 randomised participants. The trials assessed multicomponent and seven dierent single-component non-pharmacological interventions. Study design All 22 studies were randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Four of them were cluster-randomised in design ( Chen 2017 ; Hosie 2020 ; Wang 2020 ; Young 2020 ). Eighteen studies evaluated a delirium prevention intervention against usual care ( Abizanda 2011 ; Avendano-Cespedes 2016 ; Bonaventura 2007 ; Boustani 2012 ; Cetinkaya 2019 ; Chen 2017 ; Dong 2020 ; Hempenius 2013 ; Hosie 2020 ; Jes 2013 ; Lundstrom 2007 ; Marcantonio 2001 ; Martinez 2012 ; Martinez-Velilla 2019 ; Nadler 2017 ; Partridge 2017 ; Wang 2020 ; Young 2020 ). Two studies compared use of dierent thresholds for physiological correction (Fan 2014 ; Gruber-Baldini 2013 ). One study compared a delirium prevention intervention to a placebo ( Gao 2018 ). One study compared two dierent interventions ( Watne 2014 ). Sample size The sample size of included studies ranged from 50 to 713 randomised participants. Five studies randomised fewer than 100 participants ( Avendano-Cespedes 2016 ; Bonaventura 2007 ; Cetinkaya 2019 ; Gao 2018 ; Hosie 2020 ). Setting Thirteen studies were conducted in patients under the care of surgical teams for elective or emergency surgical or procedural interventions and care. Orthopaedic settings were the commonest, in eight of the included studies ( Cetinkaya 2019 ; Fan 2014 ; Gao 2018 ; Gruber-Baldini 2013 ; Lundstrom 2007 ; Marcantonio 2001 ; Nadler 2017 ; Watne 2014 ). In one study, participants were undergoing elective surgery for known cancer ( Hempenius 2013 ). Four studies were conducted in other surgical settings ( Chen 2017 ; Dong 2020 ; Partridge 2017 ; Wang 2020 ). Seven studies were conducted in a general medical or specialist geriatric medical hospital environment ( Abizanda 2011 ; Avendano-Cespedes 2016 ; Bonaventura 2007 ; Boustani 2012 ; Jes 2013 ; Martinez 2012 ; Martinez-Velilla 2019 ). One study was conducted in inpatient palliative care settings for individuals with a diagnosis of cancer (Hosie 2020 ). One study was conducted in both specialist wards for older adults and orthopaedic trauma wards ( Young 2020 ). Participants Age In 12 studies the mean age of included participants was between 70 to 79 years in one or both arms. Seven studies had a mean age in both allocation arms of more than 80 years ( Abizanda 2011 ; Avendano-Cespedes 2016 ; Gruber-Baldini 2013 ; Lundstrom 2007 ; Martinez-Velilla 2019 ; Watne 2014 ; Young 2020 ). Two studies had a mean age of less than 70 years in both allocation arms ( Cetinkaya 2019 ; Nadler 2017 ). One study did not report data on the mean age of included participants ( Bonaventura 2007 ).

One study ( Boustani 2012 ) reported higher Charlson Index scores in the usual care group. One study used the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale ( Martinez-Velilla 2019 ), and another the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score ( Gao 2018 ) to quantify the co-morbidity of participants. Four studies reported a count of conditions experienced by participants ( Abizanda 2011 ; Bonaventura 2007 ; Cetinkaya 2019 ; Hempenius 2013 ). Three studies considered specific co-morbidities and described the distribution of these among recruited participants at baseline (Fan 2014 ; Gruber-Baldini 2013 ; Lundstrom 2007 ). Lundstrom 2007 reported a higher rate of depression among those allocated to the control arm of their study. Four studies did not report co- morbidities at baseline ( Dong 2020 ; Hosie 2020 ; Nadler 2017 ; Watne 2014 ). Dementia Three studies excluded all participants with dementia (Bonaventura 2007 ; Dong 2020 ; Gao 2018 ), and three excluded those assessed as having severe dementia ( Avendano-Cespedes 2016 ; Martinez-Velilla 2019 ; Wang 2020 ). Six studies reported an imbalance in the proportion of those with dementia between their intervention and control arms, with higher rates in the control arms in Gruber-Baldini 2013 ; Lundstrom 2007 ; Marcantonio 2001 ; Nadler 2017 ; Partridge 2017 and higher rates in the intervention arm in Young 2020 . Three studies did not report specifically on dementia ( Boustani 2012 ; Cetinkaya 2019 ; Hosie 2020 ). Frailty Only one study included a baseline assessment of the frailty of recruited participants ( Wang 2020 ). This used the Chinese adaptation of the FRAIL scale score ( Dong 2018 ) - with a higher proportion of the intervention group classed as healthy and a higher proportion of the control group considered as frail ( Wang 2020 ). Interventions Multicomponent interventions versus usual care Fourteen studies evaluate multicomponent interventions for delirium prevention, compared to usual hospital care. We identified characteristics associated with the delivery of the intervention, with the use of tailored interventions mentioned in nine trials ( Abizanda 2011 ; Avendano-Cespedes 2016 ; Dong 2020 ; Hempenius 2013 ; Jes 2013 ; Lundstrom 2007 ; Marcantonio 2001 ; Partridge 2017 ; Wang 2020 ); protocols/checklists used in 10 trials ( Chen 2017 ; Dong 2020 ; Hempenius 2013 ; Hosie 2020 ; Jes 2013 ; Lundstrom 2007 ; Martinez 2012 ; Partridge 2017 ; Wang 2020 ; Young 2020 ). Ten trials had a specific education component as part of the intervention ( Abizanda 2011 ; Avendano-Cespedes 2016 ; Bonaventura 2007 ; Chen 2017 ; Hempenius 2013 ; Hosie 2020 ; Lundstrom 2007 ; Martinez 2012 ; Wang 2020 ; Young 2020 ) and five specified multidisciplinary involvement ( Hosie 2020 ; Lundstrom 2007 ; Martinez 2012 ; Partridge 2017 ; Wang 2020 ) with three trials specifying family involvement as a key characteristic (Hosie 2020 ; Martinez 2012 ; Wang 2020 ). Many of the delirium risk factors targeted with multi-component interventions relate to good fundamental care, supporting sta within the care team to deliver these aspects consistently.We identified 12 distinct components of the interventions that could be entered in the network meta-analysis: re- orientation (including use of familiar objects); reducing sensory deprivation (for example hearing aids, spectacles); cognitive stimulation; nutrition and hydration pain control; medication review; bladder and bowel care and assessment of mood. Individual studies included between two and 10 components with a mean and median of six components included in each study. The distribution of these components across the included studies is summarised in Table 1 and Appendix 2 summarises how components were selected. Liberal versus restrictive blood transfusion thresholds Intraoperative blood transfusion has been implicated as a risk factor for postoperative delirium ( Carson 2011 ). Subset analysis from RCT identified that anaemia was associated with delirium and blood transfusion was associated with reduced risk of delirium ( van der Zanden 2016 ). Gruber-Baldini 2013 and Fan 2014 tested the use of liberal versus restrictive blood transfusion thresholds on risk of incident delirium. Fan 2014 classified liberal transfusion strategy as transfusing to maintain haemoglobin 10g/ dL and restrictive strategy as only transfusing when haemoglobin < 8 g/dL or when symptoms of anaemia developed. Gruber-Baldini 2013 gave their liberal transfusion group one unit of packed red blood cells and as much as needed to maintain haemoglobin 10 g/ dL; their restrictive group was treated in the same way as described by Fan 2014 . Care in geriatric medicine unit versus in orthopaedic unit following hip fracture Individuals admitted following a fracture are typically placed under the care of an orthopaedic surgeon, pending operative intervention. However, the complex nature of the predominantly older adult population who experience a hip fracture has led to the emergence of orthogeriatric medicine services, where input is also received from physicians specialist in the care of older adults. Comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is an evidence- based \"multidimensional interdisciplinary diagnostic process used to determine the medical, psychological and functional capabilities of a frail older person to develop a coordinated and integrated plan for treatment and long-term follow-up\" associated with improved outcomes, particularly when delivered in a dedicated ward ( Ellis 2017 ). Watne 2014 designed their trial around their local service reconfiguration where older adults were admitted to their specialist geriatric medicine unit and received CGA comparing this to the care received in the orthopaedic unit. Exercise therapy versus usual care Observational data support a link between physical activity and incidence of delirium in hospitalised adults ( Yang 2008 ), with those unable to undertake such activity at increased risk ( Marcantonio 1998 ). Ability to undertake physical activity while in hospital is likely to be complex, with associations with illness severity important to consider. Emerging evidence from intensive care unit settings supports mobilisation strategies to reduce delirium ( Banerjee 2011 ). Martinez-Velilla 2019 undertook a multicomponent exercise intervention targeted towards hospitalised older adults and prevention of delirium was one of their secondary end-points of interest.

Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.15Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Computerised clinical decision support system versus usual care Computerised clinical decision support so2\u00f1?tware (CCDS) has been reported as an eective tool in prompting healthcare practitioners to comply with established protocols and preventive measures (Dexter 2001 ). One study in our review ( Boustani 2012 ), investigated the use of CCDS in medical inpatients with alerts to identify cognitive impairment or individuals who would benefit from specialist assessment and prompts around urinary catheters, physical restraints and anticholinergic medications. Listening to music versus usual care Cetinkaya 2019 evaluated listening to classical Turkish music as a postoperative intervention to reduce delirium. Music has been proposed as a potential intervention for delirium research in intensive care unit settings, with limited empirical data ( Guerra 2019 ) ). Transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation versus placebo Complementary medicine approaches, including techniques such as acupoint stimulation, have been postulated as helpful in the management of agitation and delirium, although evidence of their eectiveness has been lacking ( Levy 2017 ). Gao 2018 examined the use of transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation among older adults with evidence of silent lacunar infarction on imaging as a modality to prevent postoperative delirium. Continuous positive airway pressure versus usual care (CPAP) Nadler 2017 evaluated the use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for those identified as at risk of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) as a potential intervention to prevent postoperative delirium. CPAP is an evidence-based treatment for OSA, known to reduce sleepiness symptoms and improve quality of life ( Giles 2006 ). An association between postoperative delirium and OSA has been identified in elective surgical patients ( Flink 2012 ). Outcomes Primary outcomes Incidence of delirium was measured using a range of validated diagnostic methods. The commonest approach was use of the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) ( Inouye 1990 ), used in 15 of the included studies ( Abizanda 2011 ; Avendano-Cespedes 2016 ; Boustani 2012 ; Chen 2017 ; Dong 2020 ; Gruber-Baldini 2013 ; Jes 2013 ; Marcantonio 2001 ; Martinez 2012 ; Martinez-Velilla 2019 ; Nadler 2017 ; Partridge 2017 ; Wang 2020 ; Watne 2014 ; Young 2020 ). The CAM-ICU ( Ely 2001 ) was used in two studies ( Fan 2014 ; Gao 2018 ). Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV) criteria were used in Lundstrom 2007 . Hempenius 2013 used theDelirium. Observation Screening) Scale (DOSS) which, if positive, resulted in an assessment using DSM-IV criteria and the Delirium Rating Scale Revised 1998 (DRS-R-98). Bonaventura 2007 used the CAM and DRS-R-98 ( Trzepacz ). Cetinkaya 2019 used the scale ( Nelson 1996 ), assessed on postoperative days one, two and three, comparing scores between intervention and control groups. They categorise the score as 0 to 19 indicating moderate to severe confusion, 20 to 24 moderate or early confusion, 25 to 26 as high risk for confusion and 27 to 30 as normal function (Cetinkaya 2019 ). Hosie 2020 used the Nursing Delirium (NuDESC) 2005 ) and the DSM-V criteria and DRS- R-98.Only 13 studies reported data on mortality, either in-hospital or at follow-up of one and three, six and 12 months ( Abizanda 2011 ; Avendano-Cespedes 2016 ; Boustani 2012 ; Chen 2017 ; Dong 2020 ; Hempenius 2013 ; Hosie 2020 ; Lundstrom 2007 ; Martinez-Velilla 2019 ; Partridge 2017 ; Wang 2020 ; Watne 2014 ; Young 2020 ). No study evaluated mortality beyond 12 months from randomisation. One study evaluated new diagnosis of dementia at 12 months (Watne 2014 ). Secondary outcomes Seven studies reported on the duration of delirium (in days) experienced by participants ( Avendano-Cespedes 2016 ; Jes 2013 ; Lundstrom 2007 ; Marcantonio 2001 ; Martinez 2012 ; Watne 2014 ; Young 2020 ). Eight studies reported on severity of delirium episodes ( Avendano- Cespedes 2016 ; Dong 2020 ; Hempenius 2013 ; Hosie 2020 ; Jes 2013 ; Wang 2020 ; Watne 2014 ; Young 2020 ) using the CAM, CAM- S, DRS-R-98 and Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS). Only one study ( Hempenius 2013 ) reported the peak severity of delirium, with others reporting mean or median over the duration of the study. Avendano-Cespedes 2016 reported mean severity data at multiple time points, but the denominator for analysis was not clear and thus these figures were not included in the quantitative synthesis. Wang 2020 reported severe delirium (defined as MDAS 18) as a dichotomous outcome only. Length of hospital admission was reported by 16 studies ( Abizanda 2011 ; Boustani 2012 ; Chen 2017 ; Dong 2020 ; Fan 2014 ; Gruber- Baldini 2013 ; Hempenius 2013 ; Jes 2013 ; Lundstrom 2007 ; Marcantonio 2001 ; Martinez 2012 ; Martinez-Velilla 2019 ; Partridge 2017 ; Wang 2020 ; Watne 2014 ; Young 2020 ). Partridge 2017 reported only the mean length of stay, without standard deviation, so this could not be included in quantitative synthesis. Avendano- Cespedes 2016 reported data on length of stay for their whole sample and then for those who did or did not experience delirium, rather than those in the intervention and control groups, again these data could not be pooled. None of the included studies evaluated use of new psychotropic medications during admission. Activities of daily living were reported in six studies ( Abizanda 2011 ; Dong 2020 ; Martinez-Velilla 2019 Wang 2020 ; Watne 2014 ; Young 2020 ). Quality of life was reported by only two studies ( Hempenius 2013 ; Martinez-Velilla 2019 ). None of the included studies evaluated carer's quality of life. Seven studies included data on individuals withdrawal from protocol ( Chen 2017 ; Fan 2014 ; Hosie 2020 ; Marcantonio 2001 ; Partridge 2017 ; Wang 2020 ; Young 2020 ). Adverse outcomes Only two studies examined hospital readmission ( Hempenius 2013 ; Partridge 2017 ). None of the included studies evaluated progression of existing dementia. Non-pharmacological interventions for preventing delirium in hospitalised non-ICU patients (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.16Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Two studies reported on new care home admission, one at the time of hospital discharge ( Young 2020 ) and one at follow-up of four and 12 months ( Watne 2014 ). Nine of the included studies looked at the incidence of in-hospital falls ( Boustani 2012 ; Hempenius 2013 ; Hosie 2020 ; Lundstrom 2007 ; Martinez 2012 ; Martinez-Velilla 2019 ; Partridge 2017 ; Watne 2014 ; Young 2020 ), and four evaluated the incidence of in-hospital pressure ulcers ( Boustani 2012 ; Hempenius 2013 ; Lundstrom 2007 ; Watne 2014 ). Exclusion of prevalent delirium at baseline Failure to exclude delirium at enrolment to the study was a common problem. Only seven studies clearly excluded or accounted for prevalent cases of delirium at baseline ( Abizanda 2011 ; Fan 2014 ; Gao 2018 ; Jes 2013 ; Martinez 2012 ; Wang 2020 ; Young 2020 ). Avendano-Cespedes 2016 reported multiple measures of delirium, including exclusion of delirium present on the first day of admission, but there was uncertainty around the denominators for each group, making it diicult to use in pooled comparisons. Funding sources and declarations of interest The majority of included studies (18 of 22) were funded through academic or governmental research institutions or grant funding schemes. In three studies, the source of funding was not reported (Boustani 2012 ; Cetinkaya 2019 ; Martinez 2012 ), and one studyreceived no specific funding, but was loaned equipment from a health technology company ( Nadler 2017 ). Four studies reported potential interest to declare related to their study ( Boustani 2012 ; Gruber-Baldini 2013 ; Hosie 2020 ; Wang 2020 ). Three studies did not provide a declaration of interest statement in their publication ( Bonaventura 2007 ; Lundstrom 2007 ; Marcantonio 2001 ). Excluded studies We excluded 182 records. Thirty-two duplicate records (either duplicate publications or publications reporting the same underlying data) were excluded. Studies were excluded for the following reasons: n=71 wrong study design; study terminated previous version of review ( Figure 1 ). Excluded studies for which a full text was available are listed in Characteristics of excluded studies . Details of 19 studies identified as ongoing are given in Characteristics of ongoing studies . Risk of bias in included studies Risk of bias assessments are presented for each study in the Characteristics of included studies table and are summarised in the text below and graphically in Figure 2 . We assessed no study to be at low risk of bias across all domains.

(Continued) Young 2020 ++--+++ Allocation We considered 12 of the included studies to be at low risk of selection bias with appropriate random methods for sequence generation and allocation concealment reported ( Abizanda 2011 ; Avendano-Cespedes 2016 ; Boustani 2012 ; Cetinkaya 2019 ; Chen 2017 ; Gruber-Baldini 2013 ; Hempenius 2013 ; Hosie 2020 ; Marcantonio 2001 ; Martinez 2012 ; Partridge 2017 ; Watne 2014 ; Young 2020 ). Bonaventura 2007 was at high risk of selection bias due to use of day of admission in allocation to intervention or control. Wang 2020 was at unclear risk of selection bias due to the method of allocating individuals to groups and concealment of the allocation. Two studies were at unclear risk in terms of their random sequence generation ( Jes 2013 ; Lundstrom 2007 ). Six studies were at unclear risk in their allocation concealment ( Cetinkaya 2019 ; Dong 2020 ; Fan 2014 ; Gao 2018 ; Martinez-Velilla 2019 ; Nadler 2017 ). Blinding All studies were at high risk of performance bias as none were able to blind participants and study personnel. Ten studies were at low risk of detection bias due to blinding of outcome assessors ( Abizanda 2011 ; Avendano-Cespedes 2016 ; Chen 2017 ; Gao 2018 ; Hempenius 2013 ; Jes 2013 ; Marcantonio 2001 ; Martinez-Velilla 2019 ; Nadler 2017 ; Wang 2020 ). Three studies were at unclear risk of detection bias ( Bonaventura 2007 ; Boustani 2012 ; Cetinkaya 2019 ). The remaining nine studies were at high risk of detection bias ( Dong 2020 ; Fan 2014 ; Gruber-Baldini 2013 ; Hosie 2020 ; Lundstrom 2007 ; Martinez 2012 ; Partridge 2017 ; Watne 2014 ; Young 2020 ). Incomplete outcome data Seventeen studies were at low risk of attrition bias ( Abizanda 2011 ; Avendano-Cespedes 2016 ; Bonaventura 2007 ; Boustani 2012 ; Cetinkaya 2019 ; Chen 2017 ; Fan 2014 ; Gao 2018 ; Gruber-Baldini 2013 ; Hosie 2020 ; Jes 2013 ; Lundstrom 2007 ; Marcantonio 2001 ; Martinez 2012 ; Wang 2020 ; Watne 2014 ; Young 2020 ). Two studies were at unclear risk of attrition bias ( Dong 2020 ; Hempenius 2013 ) and the remaining three studies were considered to be at high risk of attrition bias ( Martinez-Velilla 2019 ; Nadler 2017 ; Partridge 2017 ). Selective reporting Eleven studies were at low risk of reporting bias having published protocols and reporting as per their protocol ( Abizanda 2011 ; Avendano-Cespedes 2016 ; Gruber-Baldini 2013 ; Hempenius 2013 ; Hosie 2020 ; Jes 2013 ; Martinez-Velilla 2019 ; Nadler 2017 ; Partridge 2017 ; Watne 2014 ; Young 2020 ). Eight studies were at unclear risk of reporting bias as a result of an absence of a published protocol (Bonaventura 2007 ; Boustani 2012 ; Cetinkaya 2019 ; Fan 2014 ; Gao 2018 ; Lundstrom 2007 ; Marcantonio 2001 ; Martinez 2012 ). Three studies were at high risk of reporting bias due to inconsistency in reporting between protocol and paper or between methods and results ( Chen 2017 ; Dong 2020 ; Wang 2020 ).Other potential sources of bias The other bias domain was used to assess the four cluster- randomised trials ( Chen 2017 ; Hosie 2020 ; Wang 2020 ; Young 2020 ). These were assessed for recruitment bias, baseline imbalance, loss of clusters and incorrect analysis, with full details provided in the study-level risk of bias tables. Three of the cluster-randomised trials were considered at low risk of bias ( Chen 2017 ; Wang 2020 ; Young 2020 ), and one study ( Hosie 2020 ) was considered at high risk, as no specific analytical consideration was made to account for the cluster design. To investigate the fi2\u00f1?th parameter of assessing risk of bias in cluster-randomised trials, comparability with individually randomised trials, a sensitivity analysis was undertaken of the primary outcome (incidence of delirium), removing the cluster- randomised trials. Removing the cluster-randomised trials results in a change to the eect estimate (risk ratio (RR) 0.65 compared to 0.57) and associated uncertainty (95%CI 0.55 to 0.77, compared to 0.46 to 0.71 for all studies), but the direction and nature of the eect was the same. This analysis does not suggest an important bias from inclusion of the cluster-randomised trials in the summary estimate. Visual inspection of funnel plots for incidence of delirium and inpatient mortality for multicomponent interventions did not suggest publication bias. The four studies in which trials are completed but the results are not publicly available are summarised in Studies awaiting classification . They include four interventions (family intervention (n = 79 participants), care bundle (n = 80 participants), preventative care protocol (n = 80 participants) and passive cycling (n = 230 participants) with a total planned sample size of 469 participants. From the information available in the trial registry entries it is diicult to categorise these studies and estimate how they would influence the published results. Eects of interventions See: Summary of findings 1 Non-pharmacological multicomponent interventions for preventing delirium in hospitalised non-ICU patients 1. Multicomponent interventions versus usual care Fourteen trials investigated the eectiveness of multicomponent interventions for the prevention of delirium ( Abizanda 2011 ; Avendano-Cespedes 2016 ; Bonaventura 2007 ; Chen 2017 ; Dong 2020 ; Hempenius 2013 ; Hosie 2020 ; Jes 2013 ; Lundstrom 2007 ; Marcantonio 2001 ; Martinez 2012 ; Partridge 2017 ; Wang 2020 ; Young 2020 ). A summary of findings table for the seven key outcomes is presented in Summary of findings 1 . a.

Multicomponent interventions likely result in little to no dierence in mortality at one to three months compared to usual care (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.75, I 2=0%; 1200 participants; moderate-certainty evidence downgraded due to imprecision) (Analysis 1.3 ). Only one study ( Lundstrom 2007 ) reported mortality data between six and 12 months. There may be little or no eect of multicomponent interventions on mortality at 12 months compared to usual care (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.56; 199 participants; low-certainty evidence downgraded due to imprecision and risk of bias within the study) ( Analysis 1.4 ). None of the included studies reported mortality data beyond 12 months from randomisation. None of the included studies of multicomponent interventions reported data on new diagnosis of dementia at any point following randomisation. b. Secondary outcomes Six studies reported data on the duration of delirium episodes. Multicomponent interventions may result in a small reduction ofaround a day in the duration of a delirium episode (mean dierence (MD) -0.93, 95% CI -2.01 to 0.14 days, I 2 = 65%; 351 participants; low- certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias and imprecision) (Analysis 1.5 ). Five studies compared delirium severity between intervention and usual care groups. The evidence is very uncertain about the eect of multicomponent interventions on 2 = 64%; 147 participants; very low-certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias and serious imprecision) ( Analysis 1.6 ). A standardised mean severity of 0.49 standard deviations represents a moderate eect. The 95% confidence interval encompasses a very large eect and little or no eect, indicating serious imprecision. Pooled analysis of 10 studies showed multicomponent interventions may result in a reduction in hospital length of stay compared to usual care (MD -1.30 days, 95% CI -2.56 to -0.04 days, I2=91%; 3351 participants; low-certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias and inconsistency) ( Analysis 1.7 ; Figure 5 ).

Activities of daily living, measured using a validated instrument were evaluated in four trials ( Abizanda 2011 ; Dong 2020 Wang 2020 ; Young 2020 ). However, these were reported using dierent measures as post-intervention values and change scores or as a dichotomous variable determining improvement/not ( Abizanda 2011 ) and it was not considered appropriate to pool these data. Quality of life, measured using a validated patient reported measure was reported in two trials ( Hempenius 2013 ; Martinez- Velilla 2019 ). However, these data were not considered suitable to pool as Hempenius 2013 dichotomised results based on presence/ absence of change and Martinez-Velilla 2019 derived results from a linear mixed-eects model. None of the included studies evaluated carer's quality of life. Withdrawal from protocol by participants was reported in six studies. The evidence suggests that multicomponent interventions result in little to no dierence in withdrawal from protocol compared to usual care (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.75, I 2=0%; 1751 participants; low-certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias and imprecision) ( Analysis 1.8 ). c. Adverse outcomes Only two studies reported on readmission to hospital ( Hempenius 2013 ; Partridge 2017 ). The evidence is very uncertain about the eect of multicomponent interventions on hospital readmission (RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.07, I 2=0%; 401 participants; very low- certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias and serious imprecision) ( Analysis 1.9 ). None of the included studies evaluated progression of existing dementia.New care home admission at the time of hospital discharge was only reported in a single study ( Young 2020 ). The evidence suggests that multicomponent interventions result in little to no dierence in new care home admission at the time of hospital discharge compared to usual care (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.07; 536 participants; low-certainty due to risk of bias and imprecision) ( Analysis 1.10 ). Rates of falls were reported in six studies, the evidence is very uncertain about the eect of multicomponent interventions on the rate of falls (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.88, I 2=55%; 1680 participants; very low-certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias, imprecision and inconsistency) ( Analysis 1.11 ). Rates of pressure ulcers were only reported in two studies (Hempenius 2013 ; Lundstrom 2007 ). The evidence suggests multicomponent interventions result in a reduced risk of pressure ulcer formation compared to usual care (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.89, I 2 = 0%; 457 participants; low-certainty evidence downgraded, due to risk of bias and imprecision) ( Analysis 1.12 ). Subgroup analysis by setting Pre-planned subgroup analysis was conducted to evaluate the eectiveness of delirium prevention interventions based on clinical setting. The 14 trials were divided into the six conducted in medical settings ( Abizanda 2011 ; Avendano-Cespedes 2016 ; Bonaventura 2007 ; Hosie 2020 ; Jes 2013 ; Martinez 2012 ), seven conducted in surgical settings including orthopaedics ( Chen 2017 ; Dong 2020 ; Hempenius 2013 ; Lundstrom 2007 ; Marcantonio 2001 ; Partridge 2017 ; Wang 2020 ) and one conducted in both medical and surgical settings ( Young 2020 ). There were similar eect sizes in medical (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.83; I 2= CI 0.34 to 0.72; I 2 = 65%; 1520 participants) settings in favour of multicomponent interventions in reducing incidence delirium (moderate certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias.

Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.22Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Subgroup analysis by dementia diagnosis Only one trial ( Marcantonio 2001 ) reported incident delirium in patients with pre-existing dementia. Delirium incidence estimates appeared dierent between individuals with dementia (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.36; 50 participants; low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to risk of bias and imprecision) and those without dementia (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.13; 76 participants; low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to risk of bias and imprecision). However, the results are too imprecise to allow a conclusion to be drawn. Subgroup analysis by frailty status It was not possible to evaluate the impact of frailty as no studies reported numerical delirium data stratified by frailty status. Sensitivity analysis removing specialist palliative care Pre-planned sensitivity analysis to remove the trial conducted in specialist palliative care ( Hosie 2020 ) did not make any significant dierence to the observed estimate of the eectiveness of multicomponent delirium prevention interventions (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.71; 3648 participants; moderate-certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias). Component network meta-analysis We created a component network using data from the 14 trials (n = 3693 participants) of multicomponent interventions included in the main review.The forest plot of component eects is given in Figure 6 . Based on our data, re-orientation (odds ratio (OR) 0.32, 95% Credible Intervals (CrI) 0.11 to 0.89), cognitive stimulation (OR 0.45, 95% CrI 0.21 to 0.93) and sleep hygiene (OR 0.25, 95% CrI 0.08 to 0.71) were associated with reduced risk of incident delirium. Attention to nutrition and hydration (OR 0.48, 95% CrI 0.18 to 1.26), oxygenation (OR 0.35, 95% CrI 0.10 to 1.20), and bowel and bladder care (OR 0.55, 95% CrI 0.23 to 1.31) suggested probable reduction in incident delirium, but estimates included the possibility of no eect or harm. For most other components the 95% credible intervals were too wide to comment on potential eects. This is likely a result of lack of data, both a low number of trials and low heterogeneity in the composition of components included in the trials. Medication review and assessment of mood both had imprecise summary estimates, favouring the interventions, although harms could not be excluded. On the other hand, reducing sensory deprivation, identification of infection, mobilisation, pain control and assessment of mood all had summary estimates that suggested potential increase in delirium, but the uncertainty in these estimates was very substantial, including potential benefits as well as harms. We compared estimates based on the network against data from the original trials and found that most of the component network meta-analysis estimates were similar to the individual trial estimates, providing some evidence of validity to the component network analysis. Figure 6. Forest plot summarising component network meta-analysis results 2. Liberal versus restrictive blood transfusion thresholds Two trials ( Fan 2014 ; Gruber-Baldini 2013 ) evaluated blood transfusion thresholds. Fan 2014 included 192 participants undergoing elective hip replacement and Gruber-Baldini 2013 included 139 participants undergoing surgical repair of hipfracture. Both compared liberal versus restrictive blood transfusion thresholds. There was significant overlap in the volume of blood received by participants in both studies and in other products administered.

Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.23Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews a. Primary outcomes The evidence suggests that use of a liberal transfusion threshold over a restrictive transfusion threshold results in little to no dierence in incident delirium (RR 0.92, 95% CI I 2 = 9%; 294 participants; moderate-certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias) ( Analysis 2.1 ). Neither study reported on mortality or new diagnosis of dementia. b. Secondary outcomes The evidence suggests that liberal transfusion thresholds does not aect the severity of delirium (MD - 0.10, 95% CI -2.99 to 2.79; 38 participants; low-certainty evidence downgraded due to imprecision and risk of bias) ( Analysis 2.2 ). The evidence suggests that liberal transfusion thresholds do not aect the length of hospital stay (MD 0.28, 95% CI -0.49 to 1.04 days; I2 = 0%; 324 participants; low-certainty evidence downgraded due to imprecision and risk of bias) ( Analysis 2.3 ). The evidence is very uncertain about the eect of liberal transfusion thresholds on the risk of withdrawal from the study (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.38 to 10.66; 192 participants; very low-certainty evidence downgraded due to serious imprecision and risk of bias) (Analysis 2.4 ). The studies did not report on duration of delirium, use of new psychotropic medications, activities of daily living, quality of life or carer's quality of life. c. Adverse outcomes Neither study reported on hospital readmission, progression of existing dementia, new care home admission at discharge, falls or pressure ulcers. 3. Geriatric unit care versus orthopaedic unit care One trial of 329 older adults following hip fracture compared care in a specialist geriatric unit to care in their orthopaedic unit ( Watne 2014 ). a. Primary outcomes The evidence suggests that care in the geriatric unit does not aect the incidence of delirium compared to care in the orthopaedic unit (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.22; 329 participants; low-certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias and imprecision) ( Analysis 3.1). Care in the geriatric unit likely results in little to no dierence in the rate of in-hospital mortality (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.47; 329 participants; moderate-certainty evidence downgraded due to imprecision) compared to the orthopaedic unit. ( Analysis 3.2 ). Care in the geriatric unit appeared to increase the rate of incident dementia at 12 months (RR 2.26, 95% CI 0.60 to 8.49; 193 participants). However, the evidence was deemed to be of low certainty and was downgraded two levels due to serious imprecision. ( Analysis 3.3 ). b. Secondary outcomes The evidence suggests that care in the geriatric unit results in little to no dierence in the duration of delirium (MD -1.00 days, 95%CI -2.03 to 0.03 days; 166 participants) ( Analysis 3.4 ), or severity of delirium episodes (MD 1.50 points, 95% CI -0.97 to 3.97 points; 166 participants) ( Analysis 3.5 ) compared to the orthopaedic unit, low- certainty evidence for both outcomes, downgraded due to risk of bias and imprecision. Care in the geriatric unit probably increases length of hospital admission by a mean of three days (RR 3.00, 95% CI 1.94 to 4.06 days; 329 participants; moderate-certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias) compared to the orthopaedic unit ( Analysis 3.6 ). The study did not report on use of new psychotropic medications, quality of life, carer's quality of life or withdrawal from protocol by participants. c. Adverse outcomes The evidence suggests that care in the geriatric unit does not aect the rate of falls (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.61 to 2.77; 329 participants; low- certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias and imprecision) (Analysis 3.7 ), or pressure ulcer formation (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.41; 329 participants; low-certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias and imprecision) ( Analysis 3.8 ). Care in the geriatric unit probably does not aect the risk of new care home admission at 12 months (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.59; 193 participants; due to imprecision) ( Analysis 3.9 ). The study did not report on hospital readmission or progression of existing dementia. 4. Exercise therapy versus usual care One trial Martinez-Velilla 2019 evaluated the eect of an exercise intervention on 370 older adults hospitalised in an acute elderly care unit. a. Primary outcomes The evidence suggests that an exercise intervention does not aect the incidence of delirium compared to usual care (RR 1.80, 95% CI 0.99 to 3.27; 370 participants; lo- certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias and imprecision) ( Analysis 4.1 ). Exercise intervention likely results in little to no dierence on mortality at one to three months (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.20; 370 participants; moderate-certainty evidence downgraded due to imprecision). ( Analysis 4.2 ) The study did not report on new diagnosis of dementia. b. Secondary outcomes Exercise intervention results in little to no dierence on length of hospital admission compared to usual care (MD 0.00 days, 95%CI -0.60 to 0.60; 370 participants; high-certainty evidence). ( Analysis 4.3) Activities of daily living data were reported, as a change in Barthel Index score from two weeks prior to hospital admission to hospital discharge. These data were derived from linear mixed-eects modelling and reported as time coeicient and 95% CI, thus they could not be entered into RevMan Web.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews The study did not report on duration or severity of delirium, use of new psychotropic medications, quality of life, carer's quality of life or withdrawal from protocol by participants. c. Adverse outcomes The evidence suggests that an exercise intervention does not aect the likelihood of new care home admission at hospital discharge (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.37 to 10.79; 370 participants; low-certainty evidence downgraded due to serious imprecision). (Analysis 4.4 ) The evidence suggests that an exercise intervention does not aect the rate of falls experienced by participants (RR 8.57, 95% CI 0.47 to 157.75; 285 participants; low-certainty due to serious imprecision). ( Analysis 4.5 ) The study did not report on hospital readmission, progression of existing dementia or pressure ulcers. 5. Computerised clinical decision support system versus usual care One trial Boustani 2012 assessed the use of a computerised clinical decision support system (CCDSS) on the management of 427 older adults with cognitive impairment, compared to usual care. a. Primary outcomes Use of CCDSS probably results in little to no dierence in delirium incidence (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.43; 424 participants; moderate- certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias) ( Analysis 5.1 ). The evidence suggests that use of CCDSS does not aect the rate of mortality within one to three months (30 days of discharge) (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.23; 424 participants; low-certainty evidence downgraded due to serious imprecision) ( Analysis 5.2 ). The study did not report on new diagnosis of dementia. b. Secondary outcomes The evidence suggests that CCDSS does not aect the length of admission (MD 0.90 days, 95% CI -0.35 to 2.15 days; 424 participants; low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to serious imprecision ( Analysis 5.3 ). The study did not report on duration of delirium, severity of delirium, use of new psychotropic medications, activities of daily living, quality of life, carer's quality of life or withdrawal from protocol by participants. c. Adverse outcomes Use of CCDSS probably does not aect rates of falls (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.39 to 2.19; 424 participants; moderate-certainty evidence downgraded due to imprecision) or pressure ulcers (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.84; 424 participants; moderate-certainty evidence downgraded due to imprecision) ( Analysis 5.4 ; Analysis 5.5 ). The study did not report on hospital readmission, progression of existing dementia or new care home admission at discharge. 6. Listening to music versus usual care One trial Cetinkaya 2019 included 60 individuals undergoing hip or knee surgery and evaluated listening to classical Turkish music in the postoperative period, compared to usual care.a. Primary outcomes Using the postoperative day one (peak in severity) NEECHAM scores, the evidence is very uncertain about the eect of music listening on the incidence of delirium (MD 1.47, 95% CI 0.16 to 2.78; 60 participants; very low-certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias, imprecision and indirectness due to type of music) (Analysis 6.1 ). The study did not report on mortality or new diagnosis of dementia. b. Secondary outcomes The study did not report on duration of delirium, severity of delirium, length of hospital admission, use of new psychotropic medications, activities of daily living, quality of life, carer's quality of life or withdrawal from protocol by participants. c. Adverse outcomes The study did not report on hospital readmission, progression of existing dementia, new care home admission at discharge, falls or pressure ulcers. 7. Transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation versus placebo One trial Gao 2018 evaluated the use of transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation during surgery in a sample of 64 adults who had experienced silent lacunar infarction and were undergoing spinal surgery, compared to placebo. a. Primary outcomes The evidence is very uncertain about the eect of transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation on incident delirium (RR 95% CI 0.06 to 1.09; 64 participants; very low-certainty evidence downgraded due to risk of bias, indirectness and imprecision) (Analysis 7.1 ). The study did not report on mortality or new diagnosis of dementia. b. Secondary outcomes The study did not report on duration of delirium, severity of delirium, length of hospital admission, use of new psychotropic medications, activities of daily living, quality of life, carer's quality of life or withdrawal from protocol by participants. c. Adverse outcomes The study did not report on hospital readmission, progression of existing dementia, new care home admission at discharge, falls or pressure ulcers. 8. Continuous positive airway pressure versus usual care One trial Nadler 2017 evaluated the use of peri-operative continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for 135 adults considered at risk of obstructive sleep apnoea, undergoing elective hip or knee arthroplasty, compared to usual care. CPAP was given during sleep before surgery and on postoperative days zero, one1 and tw0. a. Primary outcomes The evidence is very uncertain about the eect of peri-operative CPAP on incident delirium (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.59 to 2.82; 114 Non-pharmacological interventions for preventing delirium in hospitalised non-ICU patients (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Collaboration.

D I S C U S S I O N Summary of main results We identified 22 randomised trials of eight non-pharmacological interventions for the prevention of delirium in hospitalised adults, not in intensive care unit (ICU) or high dependency unit (HDU) settings. Most of these evaluated multicomponent interventions, with two trials evaluating the use of blood transfusion thresholds and the others evaluating interventions in a single study. We found moderate-certainty evidence from 14 randomised controlled trials that multicomponent interventions probably reduce delirium incidence in hospitalised adults by 40% compared with usual care. This evidence holds across dierent settings and populations within the hospital, broadly categorised as medical versus surgical (including orthopaedics). We found low-certainty evidence that these interventions may result in a reduction in hospital length of stay. Delirium duration may be reduced by around a day, although evidence was of low certainty. The evidence is very uncertain around the eect on delirium severity. There may be little or no eect of multicomponent interventions on inpatient mortality. The need for care home placement at discharge was only evaluated in a single multicomponent intervention study. Our component network meta-analysis identified 12 distinct components of the interventions; studies included between two and 10 components with a mean of six components in each study. Re-orientation, cognitive stimulation and sleep hygiene were associated with reduced risk of incident delirium. Attention to nutrition and hydration, oxygenation, medication review, assessment of mood and bowel and bladder care suggested probable reduction in incident delirium, but estimates included the possibility of no benefit or harm. For most other components the 95% credible intervals were too wide to comment on potential eect. We found no evidence for any single component intervention aecting delirium incidence. Overall completeness and applicability of evidence The majority of the evidence in this review is about the use of multicomponent delirium prevention interventions (14 of the 22 included trials). This reflects a significant increase in research evidence in this area, with the previous iteration of this review published five years ago identifying only seven trials ( Siddiqi2016 ). The other eight interventions identified in this review were investigated in only one or two small studies each, precluding meaningful synthesis of these results. Multicomponent interventions have previously been shown to be eective in reducing the incidence of delirium, however, this is the first review that has attempted to define the components which should be considered for inclusion. This question is relevant for clinical practice in terms of operationalising the implementation of delirium prevention interventions as part of hospital care. This exploratory analysis sought to describe if there are some components which are necessary and if any are harmful or non- contributory to the eectiveness of prevention. Our analysis was novel, but limited by the total number of included studies and the range of components included. Aspects of intervention delivery were not considered as components in the model, but these are clearly worthy of further systematic exploration. Interventions in future trials could include re-orientation, cognitive stimulation and sleep hygiene. However, it would be helpful to have future trials directly comparing dierent combinations of components, rather than one combination compared with usual care, as having trials directly comparing interventions would increase the benefit of the component network meta-analysis approach over pairwise meta- analyses. Implementation of evidence-based delirium prevention interventions in healthcare settings globally is recognised to be complex, but critical to improve outcomes for individuals ( Wilson 2020 ). One of the included studies ( Young 2020 ) had a parallel implementation study using Normalization Process Theory to articulate how the intervention was implemented and delivered within clinical hospital settings, identifying key contextual factors for successful implementation ( Godfrey 2019 ). Implementation science approaches such as this are likely to be required to understand how to apply evidence from randomised trials in clinical care settings, ensuring the fundamental aspects of care are delivered consistently for all. Only one study specifically reported on the impact of their intervention on adults living with dementia, an important subgroup to study in delirium prevention. Four studies actively excluded those with dementia and a further three excluded those with severe dementia.The eectiveness of delirium interventions might be expected to dier given the higher prevalence of delirium and poorer outcomes in dementia. Only one study reported progression of existing dementia and no studies evaluated new diagnosis of dementia. This is an important limitation in light of the growing epidemiological evidence associating delirium with the development of dementia ( Richardson 2020 ), and recurrent delirium with worsening cognitive decline ( Richardson 2021 ). Only one study included a measure of the frailty of recruited participants and results were not presented stratified by frailty. This may be an important variable to consider within the population targeted by delirium prevention interventions. There were limited data on quality of life of patients and no data on quality of life of carers/ families. Data on new care home admission were limited with one study reporting need for care at time of hospital discharge and another at later follow-up. These outcomes are important for individuals, their families and healthcare services and would benefit from further research. A core outcomes set for studies evaluating interventions to prevent delirium among adults requiring an acute care hospital admission Non-pharmacological interventions for preventing delirium in hospitalised non-ICU patients (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.26Cochrane LibraryTrusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews has recently been published, incorporating the perspectives of multiple stakeholders ( Rose 2021 ). This includes cognition, emotional distress and health-related quality of life. It is hoped that this will inform future data collection in delirium prevention research, with researchers focusing on measuring outcomes which matter and in a less heterogeneous way to support evidence synthesis. We note there are 19 ongoing studies whose findings may be eligible for inclusion in future updates of this review. Future trials and reviews should consider the health economic implications of multicomponent interventions. Quality of the evidence We undertook risk of bias assessment for each included trial and used GRADEpro so2\u00f1?tware ( GRADEpro 2014 ) to inform the generation of evidence certainty statements. None of the included trials were considered to be at low risk of bias across all domains. All of the included interventions were conducted without blinding of participants and personnel and fewer than half of the studies attempted to reduce detection bias through use of blinded outcome assessors. Multi-component delirium prevention interventions are complex and thus arguably a double-blind design is not realistic. However, independent outcome assessment may be feasible. Evidence is typically of moderate or low certainty, downgraded as a result of the risk of bias in the included studies, imprecision or inconsistency of results. Delirium incidence was the only outcome used in all of the included studies and reporting on other delirium variables, such as duration and severity were more limited. Delirium incidence was measured at any time point during hospital admission. It is therefore possible that where interventions were eective in reducing length of hospital stay, delirium may not be detected. Hospital readmission with delirium would be a way to identify if this was occurring, however this outcome was not commonly reported in the included studies. Heterogeneity in the measurement of outcomes limited the pooling of results. We note that there were four studies identified which cannot be classified for inclusion or exclusion ( Characteristics of studies awaiting classification ). These studies appear to have been completed based on information in trial registry entries. However, results remain unpublished and no further information was identified from correspondence using contact details recorded in the trial registries. Failure to exclude prevalent delirium at enrolment was a common limitation in the majority of studies (16/22). This has the potential to reduce precision in the results as interventions cannot prevent cases of delirium already present in recruited participants. However, ruling out prevalent delirium in busy, clinical settings is diicult and it is perhaps more representative of real-world delirium care that those with and without delirium are included at the baseline of intervention studies. This likely increases external validity of the evidence. Potential biases in the review process This review was conducted in accordance with Cochrane procedures and there were only a small number of amendments to the review process, which are outlined in Dierences between protocol and review . Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews Our findings are consistent with the previous version of this review which included all interventions to prevent delirium, pharmacological and non-pharmacological ( Siddiqi 2016 trials ( RCTs) of multicomponent interventions; the additional seven trials now included provide consistent and stronger results than the earlier estimate of a reduction of a third in the rate of incident delirium (Siddiqi 2016 ). These data from RCTs are consistent with the evidence seen in non- randomised studies, most notably studies of the Hospital Elder Life Program (HELP) ( Inouye 1999 ). The programme targets six delirium risk factors (cognitive impairment, sleep deprivation, immobility, dehydration, vision or hearing impairment) and provides targeted interventions to address these factors involving specialist nurses and clinicians and volunteers ( Inouye 2000a ). The HELP approach has been studied extensively, with 44 articles informing a review of eectiveness and implementation ( Hshieh 2018 ). The data from these clinical studies are consistent with reduced costs and reduced rate of falls as well as reduced delirium incidence ( Hshieh 2018 ). Our review did not find evidence for a reduction in falls. Heim 2017 reported on the experience of undertaking a planned, stepped-wedge design, randomised trial of the HELP intervention within Dutch hospitals. Diiculty accessing electronic records to ascertain outcomes and missing data from these care records were identified as particular challenges which contributed to the termination of their study. The authors note the challenges of trying to evaluate a complex intervention using a pragmatic study design, highlighting selection bias due to recruitment procedures as another contributing factor ( Heim 2017 ). This is an important contribution to the delirium prevention research landscape in terms of generating evidence in clinical practice. One study included in the previous version of the review was excluded as it reported a mixed pharmacological and non-pharmacological intervention ( Jia 2014 ). The 'fast-track surgery' intervention described shared components with those studies which described themselves as multicomponent delirium prevention studies, including focus on bowels/bladder care, nutrition and hydration, and early mobilisation ( Jia 2014 ). However, the intervention also included a dierent mode of anaesthesia and type of analgesia regimen from the control group, rendering it ineligible for inclusion in this non-pharmacological review. This multicomponent, mixed pharmacological and non- pharmacological intervention was also reported to be associated with reductions in the incidence of delirium and the length of hospital stay. Other systematic reviews have found similar results to those reported here. Most recently these include Le\u00f3n-Salas 2020 pooling data in older adults (aged 65 years) across medical, surgical and ICU populations and identifying 10 randomised trials, Non-pharmacological interventions for preventing delirium in hospitalised non-ICU patients (Review) Copyright \u00a9 2021 The Collaboration.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Ludolph 2020 who included studies of adults in all hospital settings, and similarly found no evidence of an eect of interventions intended to prevent delirium on either duration of delirium or mortality. Martinez 2015 identified that multi- component interventions were eective in reducing incident delirium and accidental falls among hospitalised older adults (aged > 60 years), compared to usual care. Evidence for delirium prevention in other settings does not allow such consistent conclusions. The Cochrane review of delirium prevention in long-term care settings identified only three trials for inclusion, each considering dierent non-pharmacological interventions, with considerable uncertainty about the results (Woodhouse 2019 ). In ICU settings, most studies have been conducted on the eects of pharmacological interventions. A Cochrane Review in the ICU setting, included four non- pharmacological intervention studies, but there was heterogeneity in the interventions and outcomes and no clear conclusions could be drawn from the available evidence ( Herling 2018 ). A U T H O R S ' C O N C L U S I O N S Implications for practice Non-pharmacological delirium prevention interventions are probably eective across all (non-intensive care unit (ICU)) hospital settings in reducing the incidence of delirium by around 43%. These interventions may include reorientation and use of familiar objects, cognitive stimulation and sleep hygiene, with consideration for support for nutrition, hydration and electrolyte balance, oxygenation and bowel and bladder care. Implications for research Given the strength of evidence to support non-pharmacological multicomponent interventions, there is a need for researchto understand how these can be implemented in practice. The randomised-trial evidence to support single-component interventions for delirium prevention in non-ICU settings remains limited and this may reflect the nature of the condition, necessitating complex intervention approaches. Future evidence synthesis may benefit from focusing on multicomponent approaches alone, taking time and attention on the specific included components in greater detail, both their content and delivery. There is a need to evaluate cost-eectiveness to make the case for investment to implement interventions. There is a lack of evidence involving people with delirium superimposed on dementia, who are o2\u00f1?ten excluded from trials and for whom specific subgroup reporting would be beneficial. These individuals must be included in delirium prevention research. Routine assessment of frailty status and reporting stratified by this variable would also be helpful in future research studies to test hypotheses about the role of frailty in delirium. Outcome assessment focused on variables which matter to individuals, particularly around cognitive outcomes including progression of dementia and the development of dementia would be informative as part of the wider dementia prevention agenda.

Dementia: patients with 'severe' cognitive impairment were excluded - Reisberg's Global Deterioration scale = 7 (end-stage dementia). Other stages of dementia are included. Frailty: not reported Interventions Intervention:the intervention was carried out exclusively by the \"intervention nurses\", and was com- posed of two main parts, being the first one a risk factor analysis, and the second one the a daily multi- component non-pharmacologic intervention (orientation, sensorial deficit, sleep, mobilisation, hydra- tion, nutrition, drug chart review, elimination, oxygenation, pain), on the risk factors detected. The in- tervention nurses identified the principal caregiver in the first 24 hours from admission, and provided an informative booklet about strategies and recommendations to prevent delirium incidence, includ- ing ambient strategies, orientation abilities, and identification of alert signs. Participants received the initial intervention in the first 24 hours from admission, and thereafter daily until hospital discharge.

The intervention consisted of 3 protocols administered daily: orienting communication, oral and nutritional assistance, and early mobilisation. Intervention group participants received all 3 mHELP protocols with a median start time of postoperative day 1 (IQR 1-3), in addition to usual care, as soon as they arrived in the inpatient ward and until hospital discharge. Control: usual care consisted of standard hospital care provided by surgeons, residents, nurses, and physical therapists (as needed) in the general surgery wards. All participants were encouraged to am- bulate and did so as tolerated. The mHELP nurses did not provide services to participants assigned to the control group. However, the same attending physicians provided care to participants in the mHELP and control groups.

Team members were asked to enlist family and volunteers and tailor the intervention to patients' needs and wishes. A two-month site engagement and training period, guided by customised information manuals , preceded control and intervention conditions. Sites formed working groups of interested team members to plan implementation in line with their resources and systems. University-based re- searchers attended working group meetings to ensure intervention fidelity, trial integrity, and timely progress. Sites shared meeting records whenever researchers could not attend in person. Training was provided through four discrete 30- to 40-minute sessions using Biggs' educational model, delivered multiple times for broadest reach. Control: control sites received information about delirium prevention strategies when they transi- tioned to the intervention phase, along with a summary of learnings from intervention sites about opti- mising trial processes. A key message was that the checklist was not the intervention per se, but essen- tial to measuring the primary outcome of adherence.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Interventions Intervention: participants randomised to the intervention arm received a graded physical activity and orientation programme twice daily, which was delivered in addition to usual care. A certified Allied Health Assistant, trained in administering exercise programmes, delivered the intervention after ini- tial assessment of the participant by a physiotherapist. The programme started on the same day as the participant was randomised. Commensurate with ability, participants were prescribed one of four exer- cise programmes: bed, seated, standing or rails. All programmes were customised to the participant's ability and were reviewed daily. Exercise programmes were modified to ensure suitable progression for those participants who made significant gains. The orientation programme comprised formal and informal elements. The formal element of the pro- gramme comprised a series of seven questions aimed at assessing and improving orientation (day, month, year, date, ward, bed number and name of primary nurse). The participant was asked the ques- tions in sequence and prompted with the correct answer if they were not able to give a correct re- sponse. The informal element of the programme related to engaging in the exercise programme and in the social interaction with the Allied Health Assistant and/or Physiotherapist. Control: Usual care included 24-hour nursing care, daily medical assessment and allied health refer- ral by medical, nursing or other sta. Allied health input was provided on referral only, but daily ward meetings were held to review patient progress and facilitate referrals. Patients with significant func- tional, cognitive or social issues could be referred to the Aged Care medical consultation service that performed a daily round and could offer advice regarding the recognition, investigation and manage- ment of geriatric syndromes including delirium.

Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment was the basis for treatment planning. Assessment by geriatrician, nurse, physiotherapist and occupational therapists was expected during their first day on the ward and this team had daily meetings to plan discharge. Checklists and clinical routines based on published literature and previous experience. These included medication reviews, optimal pain control, correction sugar etc), early and intensive mobilisation, opti- mising pre- and postoperative nutrition and early discharge planning. Outpatient orthopaedic clinic at 4 months. Control: usual care in orthopaedic ward setting. Staing levels were similar but there was no multidisci- plinary meetings and no geriatric assessments. Early mobilisation was emphasised and patients were seen by a physiotherapist soon after surgery.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews For each domain there are 4-12 strategies provid- ed and their implementation is described We asked team members to enlist family and vol- unteers and tailor the intervention to patients' needs and wishes. Jes 2013 Participants received a graded physical activity and orientation programme twice daily, which was delivered in addition to usual care. A certified Allied Health Assistant, trained in ad- ministering exercise programmes, delivered the intervention after initial assessment of the partici- pant by a physiotherapist. Commensurate with ability, participants were prescribed one of four exercise programmes: bed, seated, standing or rails. All programmes were customised to the participant's ability and were reviewed daily. Exercise programmes were modi- fied to ensure suitable progression for those par- ticipants who made significant gains. The orientation programme comprised formal and informal elements. The formal element of the programme comprised a series of seven questions aimed at assessing and improving orientation (day, month, year, date, ward, bed number and name of primary nurse). The participant was asked the questions in sequence and prompted with the correct an- swer if they were not able to give a correct re- sponse. The informal element of the programme related to engaging in the exercise programme and in the social interaction with the Allied Health Assistant and/or Physiotherapist.

POD comprises actions centred on ten risk fac- tors associated with the development of delirium among those who are vulnerable on of the basis of predisposing risk ( NICE 2010 ). These interven- tions directly affect the patient experience of care and include optimising hydration and nutrition, reducing environmental triggers (excessive noise, multiple moves), increasing orientation to time and place, improving communicative practices (personally meaningful interaction and cognitive stimulation), supporting and/or encouraging mo- bility and better management of pain and infec- tion.

D I F F E R E N C E S B E T W E E N P R O T O C O L A N D R E V I E W The review protocol ( Burton 2019 ) specified the primary outcome was 'Incidence of delirium, using a validated diagnostic method' . Following a peer review comment, we added text to clarify that this outcome is measured during hospital admission. The review protocol specified 'peak severity of delirium' as a defined secondary outcome. It was not possible to evaluate this outcome due to the heterogeneity of methods to report delirium severity. Thus, the review includes delirium severity and comments on how this has been measured. The review protocol referenced using the Risk of Bias-2 (RoB-2) ( Higgins 2018 ) and listed the domains for RoB-2 utilisation. The review has used the original risk of bias tool ( Higgins 2011 ) - the references and domains have been updated to reflect this change. The review protocol referenced use of Review Manager 5 ( Review Manager 2014 ), however the review has been dra2\u00f1?ted and submitted using RevMan Web ( RevMan Web 2021 ). The review protocol described subgroup analysis to remove studies in which individuals were receiving palliative care only versus those receiving other medical or surgical treatment. This should have been described as a sensitivity analysis and is reported here correctly as a sensitivity analysis. An additional sensitivity analysis was undertaken removing studies which used a cluster-randomised design from the analysis of delirium incidence; this was not planned in the protocol, but done to address reviewer comments.
