I believed in vaccination. I believed in vivisection. But I changed my views as the result of hard thinking.\" - Dr Hadwen \"Measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis B, and the whole panoply of childhood diseases are a far less serious threat than having a large fraction (say 10%) of a generation afflicted with learning disability and/or uncontrollable aggressive behavior because of an impassioned crusade for universal vaccination... Public policy regarding vaccines is fundamentally flawed. It is permeated by conflicts of interest. It is based on poor scientific methodology (including studies that are too small, too short, and too limited in populations represented), which is, moreover, insulated from independent criticism. The evidence is far too poor to warrant overriding the independent judgments of patients, parents, and attending physicians, even if this were ethically or legally acceptable.\" - Association of American Physicians & Surgeons \"If you want the truth on vaccination you must go to those who are not making anything out of it. If doctors shot at the moon every time it was full as a preventive of measles and got a shilling for it, they would bring statistics to prove it was a most efficient practice, and that the population would be decimated if it were stopped.\" - Dr Allinson \"To pass our examinations and get qualified, we must accept what our teachers tell us. In other words, we must cultivate what Josh Billings called \"A well-balanced mind \u2014 one that will balance in any direction required.\" - Major R. Austin M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P \"The greatest threat of childhood diseases lies in the dangerous and ineffectual efforts made to prevent them through mass immunization... There is no convincing scientific evidence that mass inoculations can be credited with eliminating any childhood disease.\" - Dr Robert Mendelsohn, M.D. \"I think that no person would permit anybody to get close to them with an inoculation if they would really know how they are made, what they carry, what has been lied to them about and what the real percent of danger is of contracting such a disease which is minimal.\" - Dr Eva Snead \"There are significant risks associated with every immunization and numerous contraindications that may make it dangerous for the shots to be given to your child... There is growing suspicion that immunization against relatively harmless childhood diseases may be responsible for the dramatic increase in autoimmune diseases since mass inoculations were introduced. These are fearful diseases such as cancer, leukemia, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Lou Gehrig's disease, lupus erthematosus, Guillain-Barre syndrome.\" - Dr Mendelsohn, M.D. \"Probably 20% of American children, one youngster in five \u2014 suffers from \"development disability\". This is a stupefying figure! We have inflicted it on ourselves; \"development disabilities\" are nearly always generated by encephalitis. And the primary cause of encephalitis in the USA and other industrialized countries is the childhood vaccination program. To be specific, a large proportion of the millions of US children and adults suffering from autism, seizures, mental retardation, hyperactivity, dyslexia, and other shoots or branches of the hydraheaded entity called \"development disabilities\", owe their disorders to one or another of the vaccines against childhood diseases.\" - Harris Coulter \"It is pathetic and ludicrous to say we ever vanquished smallpox with vaccines, when only 10% of the population was ever vaccinated.\" - Dr Glen Dettman \"There is no evidence that any influenza vaccine thus far developed is effective in preventing or mitigating any attack of influenza. The producers of these vaccines know that they are worthless, but they go on selling them, anyway.\" - Dr. J. Anthony Morris (formerly Chief Vaccine Control Officer at the FDA) \"There is a great deal of evidence to prove that immunization of children does more harm than good.\" - Dr Anthony Morris \"There is insufficient evidence to support routine vaccination of healthy persons of any age.\" - Paul Frame, M.D., Journal of Family Practice \"Official data shows that large scale vaccination has failed to obtain any significant improvement of the diseases against which they were supposed to provide protection\" - Dr Sabin, developer of Polio vaccine. \"All vaccination has the effect of directing the three values of the blood into or toward the zone characteristics of cancer and leukaemia... Vaccines do predispose to cancer and leukaemia.\" - Professor L. Vincent - founder of Bioelectronics \"Many here voice a silent view that the Salk and Sabin Polio Vaccines, being made from monkey kidney tissue, has been directly responsible for the major increase in leukaemia in this country.\" - Dr F. Klenner, M.D. \"Even to this day, the government, the FDA is refusing to use the sophisticated biotechnology to evaluate the contaminants in the vaccines such as the polio vaccines that they are administering. I think (people) would be appalled that some of the vaccines that are being currently being used are still laced with viruses,\" - Leonard Horowitz., D.M.D., M.A., M.P.H. \"Provocation polio. That is the truth about those outbreaks of polio. And I offer a well considered personal opinion that polio is a man made disease.\" -Viera Scheibner Ph.D. \"As well consult a butcher on the value of vegetarianism as a doctor on the worth of vaccination.\" - Bernard Shaw \"For a pediatrician to attack what has become the \"bread and butter\" of pediatric practice is equivalent to a priest denying the infallibility of the pope. - Dr Robert Mendelsohn, M.D. \"The vaccinations are not working, and they are dangerous.. We should be working with nature.\" - Lendon H.Smith, M.D. \"The decline in infectious diseases in developed countries had nothing to do with vaccinations, but with the decline in poverty and hunger.\" - Dr Buchwald, M.D. \"I was working in one of the oldest lung illness treatment centres in Germany, and just by chance, I looked at the files of those people who had fallen ill during the first German epidemic of smallpox, in 1947... We had always been told that the smallpox vaccination would protect against smallpox. And now I could verify, thanks to the files and papers, that all of those who had fallen ill had been vaccinated. This was very upsetting for me.\" - Dr Buchwald, M.D. \"It forced me to look into the question of vaccination further, and the further I looked the more shocked I became. I found that the whole vaccine business was indeed a gigantic hoax. Most doctors are convinced that they are useful, but if you look at the proper statistics and study the instances of these diseases you will realize that this is not so... My final conclusion after forty years or more in this business [medicine] is that the unofficial policy of the World Health Organization and the unofficial policy of the 'Save the Children's Fund' and... [other vaccine promoting] organizations is one of murder and genocide. I cannot see any other possible explanation. You cannot immunize sick children, malnourished children, and expect to get away with it. You'll kill far more children than would have died from natural infection.\" - Dr Kalokerinos \"It was similar with the measles vaccination. They went through Africa, South America and elsewhere, and vaccinated sick and starving children... They thought they were wiping out measles, but most of those susceptible to measles died from some other disease that they developed as a result of being vaccinated. The vaccination reduced their immune levels and acted like an infection. Many got septicaemia, gastro-enteritis, etcetera, or made their nutritional status worse and they died from malnutrition. So there were very few susceptible infants left alive to get measles. It's one way to get good statistics, kill all those that are susceptible, which is what they literally did.\" - Dr Kalokerinos, M.D. From The Poisoned Needle by Eleanor McBean: Inoculate the Doctors Inoculate for small-pox Inoculate typhoid For colds and nervous slumps; Inoculate with cow pus And germs of every brand Inoculate with monkey glands To make us young again. But one fine day the laity Will move in self-defense To inoculate the doctors With a little Common Sense - by a medical student, Winnipeg, Canada "}
