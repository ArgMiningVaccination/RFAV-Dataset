We evaluated the association between Pb/Cd exposures and innate immune cells in children from an electronic waste (e-waste) recycling area. A total number of 294 preschool children were recruited, including 153 children from Guiyu (e-waste exposed group), and 141 from Haojiang (reference group). Pb and Cd levels in peripheral blood were measured by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectro-photometer, NK cell percentages were detected by flow cytometer, and other innate immune cells including monocytes, eosinophils, neutrophils and basophils were immediately measured by automated hematologyanalyzer. Results showed children in Guiyu had signi cantly higher Pb and Cd levels than in reference group. Absolute counts of monocytes, eosinophils, neutrophils and basophils, as well as percentages of and neutrophils were signi cantly higher in the Guiyu group. In contrast, NK cell percentages were signi cantly lower in Guiyu group. Pb elicited signi cant escalation in counts of monocytes, eosinophils and basophils, as well as percentages of monocytes, but decline in percentages of neutrophils in di erent quintiles with respect to therst quintile of Pb concentrations. Cd induced signi cant increase in counts and percentages of neutrophils in the highest quintile compared with the rst quintile of Cd concentrations. We concluded alteration of the number and percentage of innate immune cells are linked to higher levels of Pb and Cd, which indicates Pb and Cd exposures might a ect the innate and adaptive immune response in Guiyu children. 1. Introduction Informal and uncontrolled electronic waste (e-waste) recycling often results in human exposure to harmful chemical contaminants (Heacock et al., 2016 ). Guiyu, a typical e-waste destination and re- cycling area in southern China, with nearly a 30-year history of un-regulated e-waste disposal, has been reported massive amounts of en- vironmental toxicants, including heavy metals and organic pollutants, in environmental and human samples ( Huo et al., 2007; Wu et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2015b; Lu et al., 2016, 2017; Zhang et al., 2016 ). Our previous studies showed that higher lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) levels are present in placenta, umbilical cord blood, peripheral blood and urine in the Guiyu population ( Zheng et al., 2008; Guo et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2016; Zeng et al., 2016, 2017).Heavy metal Pb and Cd are widespread environmental con- taminants, which cause extensive concern for their adverse e ects on health ( Jorissen et al., 2013; Dudka et al., 2014). Pb is toxic to the central nervous, hematopoietic, renal, and immune systems ( Garcia- Leston et al., Cabral et al., 2015; Salamat et al., 2017 ). Previous studies found that Pb exposure a ects the humoral and innate immune responses, lymphocyte function and cytokine production ( Dyatlov and Lawrence, 2002; Lawrence and McCabe, 2002 ). Cd is a highly ha- zardous metal which causes nephrotoxicity, teratogenicity, neurotoxi- city, immunotoxicity Du, Rani et al., 2014; Priyadarshani et al., 2015 ). Cd ex- posure has also been associated with risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer ( Maret and Moulis, 2013; Vilahur et al., 2015). In recent years, Pb and Cd immunotoxicity on humoral and cell-mediated immunity http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2017.07.059 Received 14 March 2017; Received in revised form 26 July 2017; Accepted 26 July 2017Correspondence to: Laboratory of Environmental Medicine and Developmental Toxicology, School of Environment, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China. 1These authors contributed equally to this work.E-mail address: (X.

MARKhave been well documented, as mentioned above, but few reports have characterized their impact on innate immunity. Innate immune cells, including macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, natural killer (NK) cells and NKT cells, provide the rst line of defense against pathogens and viral infections through recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns, via alimited number of germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors, and secretion of a series of cytokines and chemokines to eliminate patho- gens and facilitate the adaptive response ( Martin, 2014; Ward and Rosenthal, 2014; Iwasaki and Medzhitov, 2015 ). A handful of studies demonstrate that Pb exposure decreases host resistance to pathogens and viral infections ( Nain and Smits, 2011 ). Cd exposure suppresses specic Sovenyi and Szakolczai, 1993 ;Demenesku, 2016 ). With regard to the mechanisms of Pb and Cd toxicity on innate immunity, current evidence suggests that Pb and Cd interact with DNA repair mechanisms, generate reactive oxygen species and induce apoptosis, as well as alter cytokine secretion 2011; Breton et al., 2013; Thevenod and Lee, 2013). The immune system of preschool children is in the process of ma- turing, making it particularly sensitive to environmental toxicants ( Huo et al., 2007; Xu et al., 2015a; Dai et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2017 ). To date, there have been no studies reporting the alteration of the innate im-mune homeostasis a ected by heavy metal exposure in Guiyu children. This study aimed to determine the blood Pb and Cd levels of childrenwho reside in Guiyu area, and evaluate toxic e ects on innate immune cells, in order to get a deeper understanding of Pb and Cd im-munotoxicity on susceptible populations, thereby making an early as- sessment of the risk for diseases. 2. Materials and methods2.1. Study population A total of 294 preschool children, 3- 7 years of age, were recruited from Guiyu (n = 153) and Haojiang (n = 141) in December 2011. We selected Haojiang as the reference group, which has similarities with Guiyu in population, cultural background and socioeconomic status, but lacks electronic waste pollution. Questionnaires, including general characteristics of both parents and children, child behavior habits, diet and health physiological parameters, dwelling environments, parent education and jobs, were delivered to the participants and their parents who gave written informed consent prior to enrollment. The study protocol was approved by the Human Ethics Committee of Shantou University Medical College, China. 2.2. Sample collection Whole blood samples were obtained from volunteers, collected in Pb-free tubes by trained nurses, and transported to the laboratory. Blood sample tubes containing EDTA were used for blood routine ex- amination and heavy metal measurement. 2.3. Blood cell examination Blood cell counts were immediately measured by an automated hematology analyzer (Sysmex XT-1800i, Japan) in a hospital not far from the laboratory. NK cells (CD3 -CD56+CD16+) were detected by labeled antibodies: MultiTEST (BD Bioscience,America), and data Aria II flow cytometer (BD Bioscience, America) and analyzed with DVIA software (version 6.1, BDBioscience). 2.4. Pb and Cd measurement Blood Pb and Cd levels were measured by graphite furnace atomicabsorption spectrophotometer (Jena Zeenit 650, Germany), using de- tection methods according to our previously described publication (Yang et al., 2013 ). For Pb determination, the main parameters were: a wavelength of 283.3 nm, a lamp current of 4.0 mA, a slit width of0.8 nm, drying at 90 \u00b0C, 105 \u00b0C, and 120 ashing at atomization at 1500 \u00b0C. The 0.5% nitric acid solution was used as blank, and the limit of detection (LOD) of this method was 0.51 g/L (0.051 g/dL). The accuracy of the method was controlled by re- coveries between 95% and 107% from the spiked blood samples. For Cd determination, the main parameters were: a wavelength of 228.8 nm, a lamp current of 4.0 mA, a slit width of 1.2 nm, drying at 90 \u00b0C, 105 \u00b0C, and 120 1300 \u00b0C. The 2.0% nitric acid solution was used as blank, and the LOD of this method was 0.05 g/L. The accuracy of detection method was controlled by re- coveries between 100% and 103% from the spiked blood samples.Repeated analyses of standard solutions con rmed the method's preci- sion. 2.5. Statistical analysis Summary statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS 19.0 software. Mean \u00b1 SD were used to depict blood Pb and Cd concentra- tions, absolute counts and percentages of NK cells. Chi-square t-tests were used to detect di erences between the exposed and reference groups for categorical variables and continuous variables,respectively. We adopted a univariate linear regression analysis to analyze the impact of possible relevant factors on Pb and Cd exposure. Separate regression models were used to estimate the association be- tween innate immune cell levels and Pb and Cd exposure, with each exposure categorized by quintiles. All linear models for group di er- ences, in the changes of Pb and Cd concentrations and several innate immune cell levels, controlled for potential confounding variables, such as child gender, age and body mass index (BMI). A p< 0.05 in a two- tailed test was determined to be statistically signi cant. 3. Results 3.1. Characteristics of the study population Descriptive statistics for the sample characteristics are presented in Table 1. The mean child age in the exposed group was 5.1 years, higher than the 4.4 years in the reference group ( p< 0.01). In addition, the mean child BMI was signi cantly lower in the exposed group than that in the reference group (14.73 kg/m 2versus 16.06 kg/m2,p< 0.01). No signicant di erences between two groups were found for gender. Dierences between the two groups for categorical variables, such as the duration of the child outdoor play, habit of biting pencils anderasers, consumption of dairy and bean products, child e-waste contact, frequency of colds, the duration of residence of both child and parents in the local area, the distance of residence from the road, e-waste contamination within 50 m of the residence, and use of the residence as an e-waste recycling workplace, were all signi cant di erent (all p< 0.05). 3.2. Candidate factors associated with Pb and Cd levels Pb and Cd both showed higher mean concentrations in the exposed group (10.34 \u00b1 4.75 g/dL and 2.39 \u00b1 1.16 g/L, respectively) than the reference group (8.30 g/dL and 1.79 \u00b1 0.45 g/L, respec- tively) ( Fig. 1). A subsequent univariate linear regression model was used to determine the relationship between possible factors and two heavy metal exposures ( Table 2). We took into account the child's age, BMI and gender as potential covariates in the change of Pb and Cdconcentrations. Therefore, these variables were being controlled. We found child blood Pb levels were positively associated with theY. Zhang et al. Ecotoxicology and Environmenta l Safety 145 (2017) 615-622 616residence duration of child in the unadjusted = 0.845, 95% CI: 0.076, 1.615), the residence duration of father local area (unadjusted = 1.087, 95% CI: 0.383, 1.791), the residence duration of mother area ( unadjusted = 1.070, 95% CI: 0.544, 1.595), the residence unadjusted = 1.346, 95% CI: 0.332, 2.361), 2.636, 95% CI: 1.492, 3.780). However, in the adjusted linear regression model, child blood Pb levels had no correlation with the residence duration of child in the local area ( adjusted = 0.622, 95% CI: 0.160, 1.404). In addition, some factors negatively correlated with Pb levels,such as dairy product consumption frequency ( adjusted =0.621, 95% CI:1.201,0.041) and distance of road ( adjusted =0.521, 95% CI: 0.942,0.100). In terms of factors associated with blood Cd levels, we found posi- tive correlations between blood Cd levels and certain variables, such as use of residence as an e-waste recycling workplace ( adjusted = 0.248, 95% CI: 0.023, 0.474), and the residence duration ( adjusted = 0.183, 95% CI: 0.016, 0.350) and the residence duration of mother in the local area ( adjusted = 0.136, 95% CI: 0.019, 0.253). Other variables, such as the duration of the child outdoor play( adjusted =0.140, 95% CI: 0.245,0.036) and distance =0.141, 95% CI: 0.231,0.052) ex- hibited negative association with blood Cd levels. 3.3. Distribution of innate immune cells A general description of several innate immune cell levels is pre- sented in Fig. 2 (A - I). Monocytes, eosinophils, neutrophils, basophils and NK cells were estimated in our study, and expressed as percentage and absolute value. There were higher mean absolute values of monocytes, eosinophils, neutrophils and were higher eosinophil and neutrophil percentages in white bloodTable 1 Descriptive statistics for the study population.

Associations between distribution of innate immune cells and heavy metal exposure To estimate associations between distribution of di erent innate immune cells and exposures, we categorized Pb and Cd exposures intoquintiles for statistical analysis, and adjusted separate regression models by the child's age ( Table 3 ). For blood (12.04 average higher in the third quintile of Pb concentration, and eosinophil counts ( CI: 0.004, 0.152) in fourth compared with those in the lowest quintile (all p< 0.05). For percentages of monocytes, results showed increments in quintiles that neutrophil percentages were on averagelower in Pb concentrations in the second quintile compared eosinophils, basophils andNK cells had signi cant associations with Pb exposure. For blood Cd, the lowest (0.47 -1.45 g/L) quintile had an average Cd of 1.25, 1.56, 1.87, 2.36 and 3.51 g/L, respectively.

Discussion 4.1. Higher blood Pb and Cd concentrations in Guiyu children are associated with the candidate factors Primitive and unregulated e-waste recycling and disposal, such as open incineration and acidic leaching, lead to the emission of heavymetals and persistent organic pollutants, and the accumulation of heavy metals in dust, soil, water, vegetables and paddy rice ( Huo et al., 2007; Leung et al., 2008; Xu et al., 2013 ). Our results are consistent with prior studies demonstrating that soaring Pb and Cd concentrations in Guiyu children are mainly due to the severe pollution of the local environ- ment, as well as the child's habits, diets, contaminant exposure sources and duration of exposure ( Zheng et al., 2008; Guo et al., 2010, 2014; Xu et al., 2017 ). Among all candidate factors investigated, contact of the child with e-waste, parents 'dwelling time in the local area and use of residence as an e-waste recycling workplace contribute to the elevatedPb and Cd levels in children. Our previous investigation con rmed that nearly 60- 80% of families in Guiyu are engaged in e-waste recycling operations, and most of the recycling workplaces are often residences. These family-run e-waste dismantling activities increase the risk of exposure of children to Pb. Indeed, studies show that the Pb con- centration in dust, collected from the workshops, is hundreds of times higher than indoor dust in other areas ( Zheng et al., 2008; Srivastava et al., 2011; Guo et al., 2014 ). We also observed that Pb levels are positively associated with the residence duration of father in the localarea, which suggests that fathers with a high risk of Pb exposure can expose children when in close contact. Another possibility is that, be- cause smoking or passive smoking is a source of non-occupational Pb exposure for humans ( Liu et al., 2012; Lutz et al., 2012; Behera et al., 2014 ) and most fathers smoke, smoking could lead to passive smoking by children. Unfortunately, we did not take into account parental smoking as a candidate factor in the study. However, our previous studies have reported parental smoking may promote an increase in child blood Pb and Cd levels ( Zheng et al., 2008 ). We found factors that can hinder the accumulation of Pb levels, such as the intake of dairy products, which may be protective factors for Pb levels. Other dietary factors, such as bean products and supplements of calcium, iron, zinc and vitamin C, also can be a part of nutritional in- tervention to reduce Pb absorption ( Zheng et al., 2008); however, we are very confused we do not draw such a conclusion. In terms of Cdexposure, our results show that outdoor play time actually negatively correlates with blood Cd levels for children, which is opposite to the earlyndings ( Zheng et al., 2008; Wu et al., 2010 ). We speculate that indoor exposure to heavy metals may be more serious than outdoorpollution in Guiyu because of the greater density of heavy metal ac- cumulation in dust particles ( Argyraki, 2014; Lau et al., 2014). 4.2. Association between Pb and Cd exposures and distribution of innate immune cells in children We also found blood Pb and Cd levels are associated with altered distribution of innate immune cells in children. Prior studies conductedon immunotoxicity of heavy metals on human leukocytes in vitro sug-gest that Pb and Cd exposures can interfere with the viability and function of lymphocytes and monocytes ( Steensen et al., 1994; Valentino et 2007; Fortier et al., 2008). Our results show thatmonocyte percentages positively correlate with Pb levels, contrasts a prior study of Pb exposure in male mice ( Sharma et al., 2010 ). Pb and Cd promote in flammation as a consequence of ractive oxygen speciesTable 3 Regression coe cients and 95% CIs from linear regression models for innate immune cell levels (109/L, %) in children by quintiles of blood Pb ( g/dL) and Cd ( g/L) n count count -6.31 59 5.10 \u00b1 1.05 Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference 6.31 1.25 \u00b1 0.16 Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference 1.45 -1.69 59 age.

Therefore, it is understandable that Pb exposure might induce increasedlevels of monocytes. Strangely, the quintile with blood Pb levels from 6.31 g/dL to 7.69 g/dL exhibited a decrease of neutrophil percentages, in contrast to that in the group with Pb levels lower than 6.31 g/dL. Di Lorenzo et al. has reported the mean absolute neutrophil count is signi cantly higher in Pb-exposed workers (geometric mean Pb levels: 20.5 g/dL) with respect to a control group (geometric mean: 3.5 g/dL) ( Di Lorenzo et al., 2006 ). The di erent exposure pathways, duration and levels may be reasons for di erent results. We also observed an upward trend of eosinophil and basophile counts resulting from Pb exposure ( = 0.078 and = 0.013, respectively) ( p< 0.05). Few prior studies among highly exposed populations have noted positive as well as ne-gative correlations between Pb and eosinophils. In addition to di erent study populations, the variation in results may also be due to theanalyses of divergent adjustment on covariates ( Karmaus et al., 2005; Ukaejiofo et al., 2009; Wells et al., 2014 ). Our analyses indicate Cd exposure in the highest quintile (2.59 -7.90 g/L) will increase the percentage of neutrophils re- spect to the rst quintile (0.47 -1.45 g/L), which is similar to a study in rats by Mladenovi and colleagues ( Mladenovic et al., 2014). However, another study in workers has suggested that individuals with blood Cd levels higher than 1.2 g/L exhibit a decrease in neutrophil percentages with respect to individuals with Cd levels lower than 1.1 g/L, is in- consistent with our nding ( Ciarrocca et al., 2015). One possible reason for the di erence in nding is that our subjects, preschool children, had higher blood Cd levels and lived in the typical e-waste dismantling area. As mentioned above, Cd may elevate monocyte and neutrophil levels via ROS generation, inducing cell apoptosis and increasing endogenous substances. Thus, it is plausible that higher Cd exposure can show apositive association with neutrophil counts and percentages ( = 0.665 and = 3.919, respectively). From our results, we found decreased percentages of NK cells in Guiyu children. NK cells play critical roles in innate and adaptive im-mune responses, including cytokine secretion, contact-dependent cell -cell signaling and direct killing of other immune cells, and are involved in combating tumors, viral infections, parasites and bacteria(Van Loo et al., 2010; Holgate, 2012; Deckers et al., 2013; Stringaris et al., 2014). Therefore, lower percentages of NK cells might impair innate immune response, as well as adaptive immune response in Guiyu children. Unfortunately, we can not conclude the e ects of Pb and Cd on NK cells, which is similar to previously reported population studies(Yucesoy et al., 1997; Sarasua et al., 2000 ). However, Sata et al. found a negative correlation between CD16 +NK cells and blood Pb in Pb-ex- posed workers ( Sata et al., 1997). Studies in vitro also have shown that Pb and Cd can inhibit NK cell number and activity ( Cifone et al., 1991; Skoczynska et al., 2002). 4.3. Limitations This study is the rst investigation to explore the toxic e ect of heavy metals on the innate immune system of preschool children in the e-waste dismantling area, Guiyu. However, there are several limitations of our study. First, we did not analyze some parameters like oxidative stress or innate immunity cytokines to su ciently conclude that the immunotoxicity of Pb and Cd on innate immune cells. Second, wecannot eliminate the synergistic or antagonistic impact of other en-vironmental pollutants, such as arsenic, spread in Guiyu ( Guo et al., 2009; Xing et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2011; Ni et al., 2014 ) and can a ect the innate immune response ( Miller and Peden, 2014; Thompson et al., 2015 ). It will be of importance to consider these interactions in our further research. Third,children in the reference group unexpectedly had a mean blood Pb level of 8.30 g/dL, which exceeds the maximum safe level (< = 5 \u00b5g/dL) established by the U.S. CDC ( Betts, 2012 ). Thus we analyzed the asso- ciation between Pb and innate immune cells by quintiles of Pb con- centrations in order to understand the e ects of di erent exposure le- vels. Other information is required in our questionnaire, including thechild's passive smoking and dietary sources, which can enhance the risk of exposure to Pb and Cd ( Liu et al., 2012; Lutz et al., 2012; Behera et al., 2014; Guo et al., 2014). 5. Conclusion Alteration of the numbers and percentages of several innate immune cells is linked to higher levels of Pb and Cd, indicating that Pb and Cd exposures might a ect the innate immune response, as well as adaptive immune response in Guiyu children.
