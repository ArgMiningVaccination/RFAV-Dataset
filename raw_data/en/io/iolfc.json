Understanding what gemstone you need How do you use healing crystals? 29 Gemstone meanings and uses Does crystal healing work? You may have heard that crystals and gemstones are powerful healing tools, or that they can create radical changes in your life. You may have also heard that there is zero scientific evidence of this. Both of those statements are true. But how is that possible? Just because we don't know how an ancient healing modality works, doesn't mean it won't work at all. In fact, there are lots of healing remedies that were once considered woo-woo that are now used in modern medicine, such as fasting. This is because Medicine works on evidence. The thought process goes something like this: \"Ok, once we understand exactly how it works, if it's safe, and can measure its effectiveness precisely, we can give it to patients.\" This is a great line of thinking! Modern medicine is incredible in so many ways \u2014 it has saved humanity from many diseases and greatly increased our quality of life. But it only knows what it knows. After all, science can't necessarily measure the effectiveness of something that claims to work on an energetic healing pathway. Such is the case with crystals. According to many spiritual traditions, crystal healing works on the chakras, meridians, and astral body. This is clearly beyond our ability to measure or understand at this time. As of right now, their effectiveness is purely subjective \u2014 that is, based on the testimony of those receiving the healing. Although there isn't necessarily any evidence of crystals working for healing, they do form the bedrock of modern technological breakthroughs. They're in every computer in the world! Our entire way of life is dependent on them. Because of this and their inclusion into so many other aspects of gadgetry, you could almost say we're moving into the age of crystals. Our knowledge of using them is really just beginning. So how do crystals heal? While no one's exactly sure how they work, the widely accepted view is this: Crystals (and many gemstones) are formed over millions of years under lots of pressure and heat. They usually come from cooling magma or evaporating water in enclosed rock formations (such as geodes). The energy it takes to create even one crystal is very intense and creates a purer element (diamonds are pure carbon). These pure elements, having been intensified naturally, influence us by interacting with the subtle energetic-body and refracts our energy back to us in a different way \u2014 just as a crystal breaks down light into rainbow colors. Each crystal has its own unique 'blueprint' for energy absorption/reflection. In turn, we re-absorb that energy, which can help us. So in effect, crystals help us to access what we already have. They act as energy purifiers and amplifiers. Especially in India, ancient sages realized these elements had a positive effect on us and could even help with specific ailments. This is why in nearly every culture in world history, there is a pattern of using precious stones or crystals as healing instruments. MANY people throughout history \u2014 I daresay millions \u2014 claim to have been healed in some way through the use of crystals. I don't think they are all wrong. And I hope that as time goes by, we figure out the underlying reason why so many benefit from their use. Understanding what gemstone you need Our own energetic needs are determined not so much by external circumstances, but our internal life. For instance, you may find that a certain circumstance has caused you to feel hurt, and therefore less likely to trust others. Or maybe you're having trouble expressing yourself at work and you need to work on your confidence. All these things can cause a bit of turmoil in life. And while you should meet the issue head-on (using introspection), sometimes an extra boost is needed. Gemstones can greatly help with that. But first, you have to get really honest with yourself: Where do you feel like you need to do some work? What's within you that's preventing you from leading the life you've always wanted? How do you use healing crystals? Once you determine what you need to work on in your personal life, you can begin to do some research into which gemstones you need. But see if you can identify the specific emotion first, and start from there. Then you can begin to do research based upon whatserves you, and not just what crystal looks 'cool'. It might not be easy to do that, but you have to look at it from the perspective of healing yourself and using gemstones as a tool rather than just something nice to look at. When you get a crystal, you need to do a few things first before using it: Cleanse your crystal -Place your gemstone in the sun or under a full moon's light for 4 hours to cleanse the previous energy off of it. Meditate - Clear your mind with meditation. You might also take a shower, which has a strong psychological effect of clearing the mind. Set your intention - Remember that you have your crystal for a purpose. It can be used to radically transform your life! Holding your gemstone in your hands, close your eyes and connect with that mindset. Imagine that strong mental energy flowing into the gemstone. Concentrate so deeply that every time you look at it, you're reminded of its purpose. Use your crystal - Many of the powerful healing crystals are also the most popular and have been made into jewelry. Wearing your gemstone has the benefit of allowing you to absorb the energy constantly, which makes it much easier when compared to a raw stone. Bracelets, necklaces, rings, and even earrings all great ways to use crystals all day every day. You can also use larger raw gemstones in your home or office.
