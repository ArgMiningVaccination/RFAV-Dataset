As a Naturopathic doctor (ND) I am trained as a primary care physician who can diagnose, treat and manage patients with acute and chronic conditions as would any other general care doc. However I also strive to address disease and dysfunction at the level of body, mind, and emotions. Taking the whole person into account. As part of the health care team, I commonly work with other physicians and providers in the area. I am dedicated to using evidence-based diagnosis and treatment in combination with diet and lifestyle counseling, therapeutic nutrition, botanical medicine, acupuncture, and cranial-sacral therapy.

I bet that is the same for you. Though sometimes easier said than done, when you want help its good to know that no other doctor gets as much training in therapeutic nutrition and diet counseling as I do. And don't worry if it feels like there is just too much information and too many choices when it comes to your diet and nutritional supplements, that's where, together, we can sort it all out for you. I can help you understand your specific and individual nutrition and dietary needs. I can gather information through laboratory, diet review, or clinical analysis, so that we can know what you are eating and supplementing is what is best for you. Botanical Medicine Did you know that over 120 of the most common prescription drugs are derived from plants? I use herbs and botanical medicine all the time and I love to combine centuries old knowledge and current scientific research. This allows me to use the least toxic and most powerful medicines available. I have extensive training in both American and Chinese herb therapy. Cranio-Sacral Therapy I was fortunate to have studied with Dr. John Upledger, the pioneer of CranioSacral therapy in America. I have used that training and his wisdom to treat thousands of patients over the years. In my therapeutic approach, I often combine CranioSacral with my acupuncture treatments. CranioSacral is a gentle, non-invasive manipulative technique that involves releasing restrictions or tension that inhibit free and healthy movement of the muscles, bones and connective tissues. I have used it successfully to help relieve trauma, injury or stress that can cause pain and dysfunction in the body. I find it very useful for chronic pain, headaches, TMJ, and neck pain.
