C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 11 ICF Code of Ethics Overview Who We Are: The International Coach Federation's (ICF) core pur pose is to lead the global advancement of the coach ing profession. ICF is a not-for-profit individual memb ership organisation, formed by professionals worldw ide who practice, teach or research coaching. Our vision is that ICF is an integral part of a thriving society and every ICF Member represents the highest quality of profession al coaching. ICF has taken the lead in developing a definition a nd philosophy of coaching, as well as establishing ethical standards among its members worldwide. Through its own Code of Ethics, Ethical Conduct Review Process, and Independent Review Board (IRB), ICF sets profession al coaching standards while also giving consumers a venue to file ethics complaints about ICF Members or ICF Credentialed coaches. ICF also maintains an Ethics Assist Line which can be utilised by sending an email to ethics @coachfederation.org or calling +1.859.219.3580 and indicating that you have an ethical inquiry. ICF Core Values: ICF coaches are committed to reliability, openness, acceptance and congruence and consider all parts o f the entire ICF community mutually accountable to uphold the following values: Integrity: We uphold the highest standards both for the coach ing profession and our organisation. Excellence : We set and demonstrate standards of excellence fo r professional coaching quality, qualification and competence. Collaboration : We value the social connection and community buil ding that occurs through collaborative partnership and co-created achievement. Respect : We are inclusive and value the diversity and rich ness of our global stakeholders. We put people first, without compromising standards, policies and quality. Ethics : Ethics are guided moral principles underlying how coaches behave congruent with the above ICF values. What we expect of ICF Members when abiding by the C ode of Ethics: To elicit the best in each and every ICF coach, ICF Members and coaches are committed to: \u0001 Ethical behaviour as the foundation of the coaching profession. \u0001 Continued learning in the field of coaching as requ ired. \u0001 Search for continued self-awareness, self-monitorin g and self-improvement. \u0001 Acting and being an ethical individual in all profe ssional interactions. \u0001 Full accountability for the responsibility undertak en as an ICF Member and coach. \u0001 Complete engagement with and commitment to the coac hing profession, setting an example both to the C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 12 profession overall and to the community. \u0001 Uphold the highest standards in a manner that refle cts positively on the coaching profession. \u0001 Be fully present in each and every interaction in w hich we engage. \u0001 Recognise and abide by the applicable laws and regu lations of each country, municipality and local governing body. \u0001 Provide a safe space for trainers, service provider s, coaches and coaches-in-training to learn, excel ethically and strive to become professional coaches of the hi ghest caliber. \u0001 Embrace diversity and inclusion, and value the rich ness of our global stakeholders. ICF is committed to maintaining and promoting excel lence in coaching. Therefore, ICF expects all membe rs and credentialed coaches (coaches, coach mentors, coach ing supervisors, coach trainers or students), to ad here to the elements and principles of ethical conduct: to be competent and integrate ICF Core Competencies ef fectively in their work. In line with the ICF core values and ICF definition of coaching, the Code of Ethics is designed to pro vide appropriate guidelines, accountability and enforcea ble standards of conduct for all ICF Members and IC F Credential-holders, who commit to abiding by the fo llowing ICF Code of Ethics: Part One: Definitions Coaching: Coaching is partnering with clients in a thought-p rovoking and creative process that inspires them to maximise their personal and professional po tential. ICF Coach: An ICF coach agrees to practice the ICF Core Compe tencies and pledges accountability to the ICF Code of Ethics. Professional Coaching Relationship : A professional coaching relationship exists when coaching includes an agreement (including contracts) that defines the responsibilities of each party. Roles in the Coaching Relationship: In order to clarify roles in the coaching relation ship it is often necessary to distinguish between the client and the sponsor. In most cases, the client and sponsor are the same person and are therefore jointly referred to a s the client. For purposes of identification, howev er, the ICF defines these roles as follows: Client : The \"Client/Coachee is the person(s) being coache d. Sponsor : The \"sponsor\" is the entity (including its repres entatives) paying for and/or arranging for coaching services to be provided. In all cases, coa ching engagement agreements should clearly establis h the rights, roles and responsibilities for both the client and sponsor if the client and sponsor are d ifferent C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 13 people. Student : The \"student\" is someone enrolled in a coach trai ning program or working with a coaching supervisor or coach mentor in order to learn the co aching process or enhance and develop their coachin g skills. Conflict of Interest : A situation in which a coach has a private or per sonal interest sufficient to appear to influence the objective of his or her official duti es as a coach and a professional.

We need to consider very carefully the consequenc es of achieving that outcome. Ecology is the study of co nsequences; of considering how any change you make impacts on the wider system of which you are a part . Ecology is having an awareness of the overall sy stem and an Ecology Check is tracking the consequences of th e change made in all aspects of that system. An Ecology check on any outcome that we set assists us to recognise the impact of that change in all s ystems of which we are a part, ranging from people very close to us all the way to society and the planet genera lly. It is important to ensure before any change takes p lace that there are no negative consequences of tha t change to you, the people close to you, the people around you, the organisation you work in and the general b igger picture.

Right from the earliest days the older or more skilled taught the young how to hunt, cook, paint pictures on cave walls and just how to be useful and effective members of their tribes or communitie s in general. This type of practical, skill-related coaching stil l exists in most societies to this day. However, a more sophisticated form of coaching, aimed at inspiring greater understanding or awareness can be seen emer ging in the earliest philosophies and religions, ranging fr om the lessons incorporated in Aesop's Fables to the lessons incorporated in the Parables. As the idea of coaching developed, organisations st arted employing psychologists to understand employe e motivation and development needs, as well as for re cruitment, selection and assessment. Sport also had a strong influence on the rise of coaching. Tim Gallwey's boo k \"The Inner Game of Tennis\" in 1974 related to a m ore psychological approach to peak performance. He stat ed that the opponent in one's head was greater than the one on the other side of the net. In 1992, Sir John Whitmore, a motor racing champion , published \"Coaching for Performance\" where he developed the most influential model of coaching - the GROW model (goal, reality, options, will). For more on this model, go to the end of the article. Gurus suc h as Stephen Covey and Antony Robbins also fuelled the appetite for personal development and awareness. In the 1990's the US went into recession and corpora te downsizing became the rage. It may have seemed g ood in theory, but did not take account of human needs. Th is left managers and leaders in highly stressed env ironments without support, which in turn added to the need fo r individuals and organisations to continuously dev elop. This need for performance maximisation has also contribu ted to the upsurge in coaching. Coaching requires a definite skillset and it takes time to develop into an effec tive coach. Many large private, public and voluntary sector org anisations (as well as small and medium sized busin esses) use executive coaching as a stand alone development sol ution or dovetail coaching with other organisationa l development programmes.

This works well in many situations, part icularly those involving machines and other man-made artefacts. For example, we may notice that our car seems rather sluggish which prompts us to inspect the wheels. We discover that one of the tyres is flat a nd so replace it ? problem solved! But when we are working with people , diagnosing the problem often gives us little indication of the sol ution and indeed may even make the situation worse! Fortunately there is another way. we can focus on solutions instead. At heart this solution- focused approach involves: finding out what works and doing more of it stop do ing what doesn't work and doing something else. It doesn't mean that we refuse to discuss the probl em but it does mean that we use any problem discuss ion to discover what the person wants to do, to learn abou t their commitment and passion, and to unearth evid ence of skills and resources they are already using. OSKAR is a framework for solution focused coaching: 1. OUTCOME : What is the objective of this coaching? What do you want to achieve today? 2. SCALING: On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 representing the wors t it has ever been and 10 the preferred future, whe re would you put the situation today? You are at n now; what did you do to get this far? How would you know you had got to n+1? 3. KNOW-HOW & RESOURCES: What helps you perform at n on the scale, rather th an 0? When does the outcome already happen for you - even a little bit? What did you did to make that happen? How did you d o that? C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 24 4. AFFIRM AND ACTION: What's already going well? What is the next small step? You are at n now, what would it take to get you to n+1? 5. REVIEW: What's better? What did you do that made the change happen? What effects have the changes had? What do you think will change next? C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 25 Dr Munro C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 27 What is Executive Coaching? Executive Coaching is a specialist form of manageme nt development and education. It is particularly suited to senior executives who have r isen above the scope of formal management development programmes and require highly focused d evelopment and support tailored to the particular challenges facing them in their business . It can and often does include Mentoring. Executive Coaching stimulates and manages the indiv idual growth necessary to deliver business performance beyond present levels and beliefs of wh at is possible by helping executives: build a solid personal foundation and demonstrate strong confidence in self and others develop their personal vision and uncover their va lue priorities think strategically and inspire shared vision, mis sion and values determine appropriate goals, strategies, tactics a nd action plans enhance their management and leadership skills identify their personal winning strategies uncover self sabotage, recognise repeating pattern s and introduce change to interrupt habitual responses elicit high commitment to personal change and deve lopment. Take on new perspectives, tips and techniques for implementing action plans Being coached can therefore be a challenging and st retching experience, inviting executives to draw on and develop hidden personal resources and q ualities. And it can be an exciting, stimulating journey of self discovery and developme nt which opens up new opportunities for personal fulfilment and achievement. Organisational Coaching Organisational Coaching is delivered through indivi dual programmes of development work with senior executives. The programme promotes major org anisational change by developing the personal vision, confidence and competence of the e xecutives concerned. At the outset, clear personal goals for the programme are agreed which a re aligned with the objectives and vision of the business so that the executive's personal devel opment directly impacts on the organisation's performance. Organisational Coaching Programmes are designed to: improve business performance by creating personal stretch goals in line with corporate objectives support and accelerate personal and organisational change make change work by sustaining commitment to the c orporate vision in a critical mass of senior managers help manage the downside risk of change and mainta in performance during periods of rapid change remove obstacles to successful change by predictin g and managing personal and organisational regression promote balance and provide a stable base during p eriods of major organisational and career change C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 28 Psychosynthesis by Dr Mike Munroe Fifteen years ago I was becoming increasingly curio us about both my personal development and my spiritual growth. To find a way forward, I read widely, went to a variety of workshops and classes, and spo ke to a lot of people - but without finding what I was looking for. Then one da y I read the first chapter of the book Psychosynthesis first published in 1965 by Roberto Assagioli and had an epiphany - here was a path that could help me di scover my true spiritual nature and increase my ability to live this in the world. Since then, the philosophy and models of Psychosynt hesis have strongly influenced my life and my work as a coach and mento r, none more so than Psychosynthesis's central model - \"The Egg of Being\" (see diagram). This is a map of who we are. At the heart of the diagram is t he personal self, our individual \"I\" or self that experiences itself as h aving thoughts, emotions and sensations. Becoming more aware of this centre of o ur being is a primary goal of Psychosynthesis for this is the place from which we can manage and direct our personality - rather than be directed by it - and take responsibility for our pr ocess of bcoming. Becoming more fully integrated human beings (which Warren Bennis asserts is also the route to becoming a great leader) involves enabling the self's attention to more freely range across the whole of who we ar e (represented as the interior of the egg). The middl e unconscious represents our present and contains t hose aspects of ourselves that can easily be brought int o our field of awareness. Our field of awareness is constantly changing in shape as what we attend to changes. The lower unconscious stands for our past and includes repressed complexes, long forgotten memories, insti ncts and physical functions over which we ordinaril y have no conscious control. The higher unconscious repres ents our evolutionary future and is that part of ou r psychological space from which we receive inspirati on and illumination and is where our intuition and potential lie. We are immersed in the collective unconscious in which all beings play a part. When we incarnate, our self is clothed in a physica l body and a personality, both of which develop as we grow enabling us to be and act in the world. But both ca n also limit us. Our personality with its particula r configurations of thoughts, beliefs and emotions ma y come to bind us too tightly. As we learn to disid entify from the contents of our consciousness and expand our fi eld of awareness, so we come to know our essential self and to express the fullness of ourselves in the world. Assagioli expresses it very eloquently; \"Psychosynt hesis is a method of psychological development and Self realis ation for those who refuse to remain the slaves of their own inner phantasms or of external influences,who refu se to submit passively to the play of psychological forces which is going on within them, and who are determin ed to become the masters of their own lives.\" C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 29 Coaching/counselling In ' Personal and Executive Coaching ', Fairley and Stout suggest that, in counselling, 'the person is seen as broken, bruised and in need of healing' whereas in coaching , people are seen as 'creative, resourceful and who le'. The following model illustrates the relationship betwee n counselling and coaching: The relationship between Counselling and Coaching Debate ; What are the similarities and differences between c oaching, mentoring, counselling and consulting and what if any dilemmas does this cause?

It takes a persona l and social systems perspective. It supports the coa ch to build and develop expertise in several levels of knowledge that will greatly enhance their effectiveness The TPS team is delighted to be working with this m odel as it provides a valuable framework within whi ch to focus on the various players in the coaching proces s, and the social systems in which they operate. It combines attention to the minutiae of the work; to the belie fs, feelings and energetic experience of the coach; and to the interactions in the coaching process, as well as in the supervisory relationship itself. The key benef it to coaches is that the wider and deeper the knowledge gained, the more the work will flow. Whichever ' eye' we look through we will see a different facet of t he whole. The seven 'eyes' are as follows: 1. The Coach system. The focus is on the situation, the problem the coac h wants help with, and how issues are presented, an d keeps the attention upon the immediate agenda of the coac hing work. 2. The Coach interventions. The focus is on what kinds of intervention have bee n made, the rationale for them, and what else could they have done. This focus may be especially valuable fo r novices who are consolidating their basic skills . 3. The relationship between the Coach and their client. The focus is on the dynamic between them, or on wha t is going on at both a conscious and an unconsciou s level, it can offer a mine of information that can assist in understanding the deeper, underlying processes w hich affect the outcome of the work. By paying attention to thi s part of the system, the coach can stay true to th e contract, and learn to tune in accurately to the underlying p sychological climate of the work. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 31 4. The Coach's own experience. Here there is an opportunity to become more self aw are, and so deepen the learning about how to use th eir full potential, and about what may be getting in the way of that happening. 5. The Parallel Process. This is a valuable perspective as the dynamics that are present in the coach and client relationship c an be played out within the supervisory relationship. When this happens, the coach and supervisor learn together wh at it is like for the client to be in the relationship. It i s as if the client is present. With an energy persp ective, we learn here that their energy is present, and has arrived alongside the coach. The data gathered in this way, adds another dimension to the supervisee's learning, and effectiveness 6. The Supervisor's own self-reflections. Such reflections give an added dimension to the gat hering of data within the supervision meeting, and may open up new avenues of understanding the coach's relatio nship with the client. 7. The Wider Context. The supervision meeting is also a time to reflect o n the ethical, organisational, contractual, social and cultural aspects of the work. There will be different concer ns at different stages in the work. With this 'eye' , the wider world is held in view, lest the coach shuts out the systemic implications of the wider field. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 32 Understanding Communication \u00a9Dr Sally Vanson Knowing ourselves and the way we react to the world around us ensures that we can be the most effectiv e coach possible. This journey starts with ensuring we are safe to coach others and able to keep ourselves saf e in the process. We cannot not communicate, so developing e motional intelligence is key to becoming a good coa ch. Emotional Intelligence - EQ - is a relatively recen t behavioural model, rising to prominence with Dani el Goleman's 1995 Book called 'Emotional Intelligence'. Emotional Intelligence embraces and draws from nume rous other branches of behavioural, emotional and communications theories, such as NLP (Neuro-Linguis tic Programming), Transactional Analysis, and empathy.All work for a coach must start with Self, form this one must develop an understanding of mana ging self and of understanding others. This leads to soc ial skills which positively impact on others. Devel oping self- awareness can come from numerous tools - 360degree feedback, performance profiling, such as DISC (behaviours), MBTI (abilities), IWAM (attitude and motivation), performance reviews, self analysis, co aching and coach supervision. Daniel Goldman's (2006) book Social Intelligence s tates how we are literally 'hard-wired' to communic ate, to get in synch with each other through rapport and sharin g physiological states through interaction with ano ther person, know as empathy. As a coach the higher your ability to have social intelligence the more effec tive for someone else you can become. All change starts with SELF. Feedback The purpose of feedback is to gain Awareness. Unde rstanding where there is or is not awareness in an individual is important to their professional development. Fee dback as a function is often seen as a negative - ' what I did wrong'. This perception does little to empower anyo ne, creates fixed mindsets, can lead to defensive b ehaviours and cause stress. Feedback is NOT about failure! No one person has all the answers, this is why ment oring is a profound and benevolent process. Togethe r mentor and mentee can build a relationship based on trust enabling both to grow, learn, develop and support e ach other in their learning. It is not a one-way process. Feedback is a process for gaining awareness and tha t may come from inside or outside the person. Knowi ng ourselves (as mentor or mentee) and the way react t o the world around us ensures that we can be as eff ective as possible. We cannot not communicate, so developing emotional intelligence and awareness is essential f or growth. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 33 Johari Window The Johari Window model was devised by American psy chologists Joseph Luft and Harry Ingham in 1955, wh ile researching group dynamics at the University of Cal ifornia Los Angeles. It is an effective model to un derstand awareness and development of SELF. The Johari Window model is a simple tool for illust rating and improving self-awareness, and mutual understanding between individuals within a group an d to improve a group's relationship with other group s. This version \u00a9 alan chapman 2003. This diagram is based on the Ingham and Luft Johari Window, developed and adapted by Alan Chapman (Business Balls) 1 - Johari region 1 is also known as the 'area of free activity'. This i s the information about the person - behaviour, attitude, feelings, emotion, knowledge, experience, skills, views, etc - known by the person ('the sel f') and known by the group ('others'). Established team members logically tend to have lar ger open areas than new team members. New team members start with relatively small open areas beca use relatively little knowledge about the new team member is shared. A mentor operates from this place. 2 - Johari region 2 is what is known about a person by others in the g roup, but is unknown by the person him/herself. By seeking or soliciting feedback from others, the aim should be to reduce this area and thereby to increase the open area. This blind area is not an effective or productive s pace for individuals or groups. This blind area cou ld also be referred to as ignorance about oneself, or issues i n which one is deluded. A blind area could also inc lude issues that others are deliberately withholding from a per son. This version \u00a9 Alan C hapman 2003. This diagram is based on the Ingham and Luft Johari Window, developed and adapted by Alan Chapman (Business Balls) C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 34 3. Johari region 3 is what is known to ourselves but kept hidden from , and therefore unknown, to others. This hidden or avoided self represents information, feel ings, etc, anything that a person knows about him/s elf, but which is not revealed or is kept hidden from others . Most people fear judgement or vulnerability and the refore hold back hidden information and feelings, e tc, that if moved into the open area, i.e. known by the group a s well, would enhance mutual understanding, and the reby improve group awareness, enabling better individual performance and group effectiveness. 4 - Johari region 4 is what is known to ourselves but kept hidden from , and therefore unknown, to others. This hidden or avoided self represents information, feel ings, etc, anything that a person knows about him/s elf, but which is not revealed or is kept hidden from others . This is an area where coaching may help the perso n discover and unlock talents Uncovering 'hidden talents' - that is unknown aptitud es and skills, not to be confused with developing t he Johari 'hidden area' - is another aspect of developing the u nknown area, and is not so sensitive as unknown fee lings. Providing people with the opportunity to try new th ings, with no great pressure to succeed, is often a useful way to discover unknown abilities, and thereby reduce t he unknown area. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 35 BASIC SET UP FOR COACHING In order to ensure that the coachee is clear on the ir responsibility in the relationship its is useful to describe the concepts of Cause and Effect, The NLP Communication Model and the Basic Framework for Coaching; BE PROACTIVE Understanding the Cause Effect equation is the star ting point of taking control of things that before have seemed impossible and out of reach. If you sit on t he Effect side of the equation you are forever in t he victim mentality whereby the world and everything in it is doing things to you that you have no control over. Once you realise and accept that the results that you are ge tting are directly attributable to your behaviours and actions then you can take back control of what is happening in your life. \"We who lived in concentration camps can remember t he men who walked throughout the huts comforting ot hers, giving away their last piece of bread. They may hav e been few in number, but they offer sufficient pro of that everything can be taken away from a man but one thi ng: the last of the human freedoms - to choose one' s own attitude in any given circumstances, to choose one' s own way.

Basic programming occurs between ag es 2 and 4 and by the age of 4 most major programming has occurred. Many phobias develop betw een the ages of 3 and 7. The child is unconsciously picking up the behaviours of the pare nt 8 - 13 According to the sociologist Morris Massey this is the Modelling period. The child consciously and unconsciously models the behaviours around him/her, S/he becomes separate from his/her parents, notices behaviours of family and friends and begins to adopt the behaviours of people seen as heroes. At this point values are based on what is happening in the world. 14-21 This is the Socialisation Period. The young person picks up values which will inform the rest of his/h er life. By age 21 values formation is just about comp lete and will not change unless there is a significant emotional experience.

Stabili ty equals money, a job is a job not a life, problem and committee orientated, materialistic. Harmonisers Age 30 -40, programmed by traditionalists, worry ab out 'missing out'. Like self-help books and goal is to 'find themselves'. Rejectionists Age 25 to 35, reject traditional ways of being, do not like groups or teams or rules and regulations, do not accept authority for the sake of it, ask 'why', sensual, h ave fun, informal, get bored, work is not important , may not be fully accountable, 'throw away' society, hate over time. Synthesisers Mid teens - 25, confused and worried about future, worried about the world, global warming. Not knowin g etc and worry produces more traditional behaviour C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 39 EMOTIONALLY INTELLIGENT COACHING (The Performance Solution with Performance Consulta nts 2003) Being an effective coach means cleaning up our own act to ensure we are 'safe' to coach others and tha t we can keep ourselves 'safe' and in the process irrespecti ve of what the content may be. Even organisational coaching will cross the border into highly complex personal issues at times. Knowing ourselves and how we react to the world around us will ensure we are as professional and effective as possible Self Awareness The ability to recognise and understand your moods, emotions and drives, as well as the effect on othe rs. Self Management The ability to manage or redirect disruptive impuls es and moods and to suspend judgement and to think before acting. Awareness of Others The ability to recognise and understand the emotion s and drives in others along with the effects that these have on inter-personal relationships Social Skills Proficiency in managing and building networks with an ability to find common ground and build rapport. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 40 Emotional Intelligence: the facts 1 \"In an analysis of 181 different positions in 121 o rganisations world-wide, 67% of the abilities deeme d essential for effective performance were emotional competencies\" (Rosier, 1994) 2 In data from 40 different corporations, to differen tiate star performers from average ones \"emotional competencies were found to be twice as important in contributing to excellence as pure intellect and expertise\". (G oleman, 1989) 3 Analysing hundreds of executive and leadership posi tions in 15 global businesses, 90% of the differenc e between average and best performers was emotional competenc ies. (Goleman, 1997) 4 Among over 2000 managers from 12 large organisation s, 81% of the competencies that distinguished outst anding managers were related to emotional intelligence. ( Boyatzis, 1982). 5 When we have an experience, we feel and think at th e same time. Usually, we start feeling before we s tart thinking. It is literally impossible for us to make even the simple st decision without feelings.

They will also sup port you in calibrating the level of alignment between the coac h-specific training expected and the training you h ave experienced. Finally, these competencies were used as the foundation for the ICF Credentialing process examination. The core competencies are grouped into four clusters according to those that fit together logically based on common ways of looking at the competencies in each group. The groupings and individual competencies are not weighted - they do not represe nt any kind of priority in that they are all core o r critical for any competent coach to demonstrate. A.

Variously described as click , chemistry , getting along , a natural relationship , it's the state where you easily get along with, communicate, be understood, understand, like and be liked by someone else. Rapport is natural and anyone can build rapport wit h anyone else, but with some people, it seems easie r than with others.The purpose of rapport is to establish a feeling of comfort and commonality between people , in order to be better able to influence them. We are f ar more likely to build rapport with someone from t he same culture, the same background, wearing the same sort s of clothes, speaking the same language and holdin g the same values and beliefs, than someone from a world away, who speaks another language, dresses differen tly, has a different sense of humour and values. Why? Because it's easy. It's safe. People like peop le like them and are less likely to understand or l ike someone who is very different quickly. For most people diff erent is either scary or hard work and people don't want either. Being in Rapport also helps people to see each othe r's point of view, to be on each other's same wavel ength, and to appreciate each other's feelings. The aim is to be able to establish rapport with any person(s), at any moment in time. When people are like each other, they like each other. Rapport is a process of creating trus t, not necessarily \"liking\" people. The following conveys the meaning of a message - Th e Meta Message is the 93% beyond the words, and it forms the bulk of communication and people's response to it. Taken from M.Argyle et al., British Journal of Soci al and Clinical Psychology, v 5, 1970, pp222-231) WORDS (7%) \u0001 Predicates \u0001 Key Words \u0001 Common Experiences & Associations \u0001 Content Chunks \u0001 Speed of Processing TONALITY (38%) (speed, pace or rhythm) \u0001 Tone (pitch or frequency) \u0001 Timbre (quality - clear or raspy) PHYSIOLOGY (55%) \u0001 Posture (including tilt of head & spine) \u0001 Gestures (when it's YOUR turn to speak!) \u0001 Facial expression & blinking \u0001 Breathing - This is the single most important compo nent of physiology to work with because it influences tonality, words, thinking and emotion. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 60 Process of building Rapport People like people who are like them. Rapport is created by pacing someone in their model of the world. You can use a person's physiology, voice qualities or w ords to achieve this. Rapport is the process of responsiveness, at the unconscio us level, established by matching and mirroring. T his is replicating or reflecting aspects of the client' s non-verbal behaviour back to them. This enables t he unconscious mind to accept and begin processing sug gestions. Pacing and Leading When the quality of rapport is good it is possible to encourage an individual to follow the movements, and potentially the thinking, which you are using. Pac ing and Leading involves matching someone for a whi le (pacing) until you have gained a level of rapport s ufficient that when you slowly start to change what you are doing, the individual will follow you (leading). I n this way you can lead your partner into different (more comfortable) body postures, and also to be able to bring them more into line with your thinking. Pacing and leading depends on the quality or level of rapport that you build up. If your partner foll ows your lead unconsciously you have a good level of rapport. If the partner does not follow your lead go back to m atching again, observing more attentively (pacing) before l eading again. As a rule of thumb: PACE........ PACE....... PACE.........LEAD The applications of this technique are many and var ied. This can be used when people are upset, angry or defensive, or when you want to change someone's opi nion at a meeting. Building rapport puts you in a position to influence them towards win-win situations. TRUST / RAPPORT MODEL C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 61 Listening Skills Sensory Acuity Sensory Acuity is the ability to gain awareness of how other people automatically (often non-verbally) respond. Along with Rapport it is the foundation stone to be ing PRESENT with the client. Although we are rarely trained to perceive another person's automatic (and in some cases, unconscious) responses, almost everyone is able to do it quite easily with people who they know. We can normally tell if a close friend or family me mber has had a bad day, just by a simple glance at them or listening to the way they say 'Hello'. Becoming mor e sensory aware means being able to notice more abo ut how other people respond. Developing greater sensory a cuity or awareness allows you to: \u0001 Create and maintain rapport with others \u0001 Notice when you are succeeding and when you need to change what you are doing \u0001 Notice when your client has achieved their outcome By observing people who we don't know quite so well through our visual, auditory and kinaesthetic sens es, we can notice responses that indicate a tremendous amo unt of new information and help us accelerate the p rocess we do naturally with people we know well. Why is this useful? \u0001 To enable you to communicate even more effectively. \u0001 To determine the client's response to a process tha t affects and changes behaviour. \u0001 Once you know your outcome, you can determine throu gh your senses whether you are on track or off track with your client. \u0001 Once you are more sensory aware, you are able to no tice when something is not working and you are able to change your direction and reach your outcom e. \u0001 Sensory acuity is one of the principles of success. \u0001 Having excellent sensory acuity will enable you to notice whether the client's conscious and unconscio us messages are congruent. \u0001 Using sensory-based information can often prevent u s 'mind-reading' or jumping to conclusions about someone. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 62 Calibration using BLESS That sensory acuity then extends deeper and using a ll your senses to take meaning from what you are se eing, hearing and feeling, becomes listening to understan d, because you must now hear every word spoken, bec ause people choose the words they use consciously and ca refully. Repetition : Listen for repeated words or phrases. People repe at things because they want you to hear them! They are important for some reason. Use the same ph rases back to them. This will help build rapport an d show them that you are listening and hearing what they a re saying Emphasis : Listen for emphasis. People will put a tonal or o ther audible emphasis on words or phrases. They do this because they want you to understand that it's important. Notice it, repeat the emphasised word or phrase, flag it in some manner, because again you want them to know you picked up on the emphasis. Congruence : Often the words will say one thing, but the tone of their voice tells you something else entirely. T he tone will often be supported by the body language y ou are seeing, and both of those are indicators to the state the person is in. If they are down, unhappy, nervou s, preoccupied, frightened, bored or in some negati ve state it will be very obvious to you - ask them what's wrong , how you can help, empathise, maybe suggest having the conversation you want at another time. But you can initiate a state change. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 63 State change : Sometimes you will notice a change of state as yo u talk, or you can do this deliberately. Change the conversation to another topic and if it's one t hey like or relate with they can be excited, funny, relaxed, fully engaged. Often you can change someone's state simpl y by changing their environment or their posture. S uggest going out for coffee, or walk down to the coffee ma chine. Stand up look out of the window. Look for internal dialogue : Internal dialogue is when people are thinking, an d thinking in the form of words, sentences, or even a full debate. This is common to everyone and after a question shows they are actua lly running a cognitive process, deliberating on their answer. Don't interrupt at this point. Let them thi nk. What you will get back is a considered answer. Door knob statements : Often people will hold back the real issue till t he very end, and let the bombshell drop as you are at the door. They may have been waiting to see if they feel they can trust you, they may have just thought 'what the hell, just say it' but always lis ten to those last words. They may be cryptic to an extent, but you can always gently ask for an explanation Exclusion : Listen for what they haven't said! Do a congruenc e ecology check against the physiology, against the facts, against what you already know. What have the y left out, left unsaid? Empathy Levels of Listening When other people speak we listen at five different levels of engagement. The first four levels keep t he listener engaged firstly in their own personal motives and t hen the clients. A person who listens at the fifth level can put their own personal motives to one side and listen, trying to discover what the other persons perspecti ve is, including meaning and feeling. So when we say \"you are not listening to me\" we may be looking for level 4 or above and getting level 3 and below!! Ignoring Makes no effort to listen or engage in what is bein g said Pretending to Listen Making believe or giving the appearance of listenin g Selective listening Hearing only parts of the conversatio n that interest you, or to show listening whilst engaged in your own thought. Attentive listening Paying attention and focussing on what the speaker is saying, then comparing it to your own experience Emphatic listening Paying attention and focussing on what the speaker is saying. Listening and responding with an understanding mind and an open h eart to the speakers feelings, words, intentions, actions. Being curious about another persons inner world. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 64 Emphatic Listening Empathic listening skills in part give others psych ological air (open space in which a person may expl ore feelings, vent emotions and feel understood without being jud ged). These skills include capturing feeling from n on verbal cues, listening attentively and phrasing empathic r esponses clearly, supportively and sincerely. But w hile all of these skills are important attitude is even more im portant for allowing others psychological air. To w ork effectively, skills must be built on a caring atti tude and a sincere desire to understand. The basic skill of emphatic listening is to help th e speaker feel heard and understood. we can do that by using 6 responses 1. Repeat their exact words (used in clean language sk ills) 2. Rephrase the content 3. Reflect back feelings 4. Rephrase content and feelings 5. Reflect body language and gestures 6. Discern what is being said \"The one who listens does the most work not the one who speaks\" Stephen Covey \"A wise old owl sat in an oak, the more he heard, the less he spoke, the less he spoke, the more he heard, wasn't that owl a wise old bird?\" Anon.

Outcomes and Goals The term 'outcome' is often used to denote our desi red goal or objective. It is a fundamental aspect of coaching, since it is about having more of what we want and l ess of what we don't want. Being able to set 'well -formed' goals or outcomes is essential our own ability to a chieve. By setting an outcome, we become aware of the difference between what we have currently and what we want instead. By filtering one's thinking toward what w e want to achieve, we pay attention to the opportun ities which will assist us in achieving our desired outcome. Why Set Well-formed Goals/Outcomes? 1. In setting outcomes and having an Outcome Orientati on, we create a direction and purpose in life by which we can \"programme\" ourselves to consistently achieve what we want. 2. By achieving our outcomes and continually reviewing and setting new outcomes, short and long term, we create the success we desire and deserve in all aspects of our life. 3. To create purpose and so make your outcome even mor e compelling, if we know what we want, we are more likely to be able to achieve it! 4. To assess your progress and to establish when you h ave achieved the outcome 5. If we know what we want, we can assess whether we a re on track, and take necessary action if we are not. This is the way The Principles for Success' op erate. 6. By setting well-formed goals/outcomes, we will be m ore likely to achieve them. 7. Successful people tend to set well-formed goals. 8. Compare where you are now with where you want to be so you can create the most beneficial opportunities 9. Take responsibility for the problem and empower you rself to move toward a solution C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 67 Nowhere is goal setting more embraced than in sport . The field of sport psychology offers some useful distinctions around goals setting. There are three main types of goals in sport psychology. \u0001 Outcome goals: These are the big picture goals such as 'winning th e county 400m hurdles', or in the workplace 'getting my company to become a FTSE 100 company'. \u0001 Performance goals: These are the performance we would need to achieve to give us the best chance of achieving the outcome goal, for example 'running 40 0m hurdles in less than one minute', or 'generating pre-tax profits of \u00a3200 million'. It is useful to s et performance goals because sometimes there are fa ctors outside our control, such as the performance of oth er runners or other companies, which can impact on the achievement of the outcome goal \u0001 Process goals: These are the specific tasks that would need to be done to achieve the performance goals. Examples could be 'running 400 metres in les s than one minute, ten times per week', or 'winning three new customers a month and creating one new pr oduct each quarter'. Depending on the goal, the distinctions between per formance and process goals can be blurred. Generall y outcome goals are more compelling than performance and process goals, which can be seen as milestones along the way. When setting goals, and helping others to do the same, it is useful to be aware of what type of goal is being set. These are a series of questions to ask when setting goals, to help formulate the goal. Sometimes just asking these questions can help clarify the goal, and incr ease motivation or lead you to re-assess the goal. 1. Stated in positive terms. 2. Initiated and maintained by client. 3. Specific, sensory-based description of the outcome/ goal including the date/time (and possibly the step s necessary to get there). 4. Ecological 5. More than one way to get the outcome or achieve the goal. 6. First step to be taken is specified and achievable. 7. Does the outcome/goal increase choice? 8. Keeps the positive by-products of the present situa tion 9. Achievable & realistic Using Questions.... The purpose of questions is to invoke enquiry in a clients mind, to discover new ideas, resources, way s of thinking. To become aware of greater possibility, g enerate from a sense of own motivation, internalize new processes and take ownership. The word 'accountable ' can have negative conotations, implying an action done to others, but true accountablility is self-generat ion, self-motivation and self-reflection. Question s enable a person to do this. In general 'Why' questions are weak because they elicit details and justification s. Questions starting with 'what' and 'how' create a focus on fi nding the answers. Here are some examples.... \u0001 Powerful question examples: \u0001 What do you want? do for you? C.O.A.C.H 68 \u0001 What are you unwilling to change? \u0001 How do you appear to other people? \u0001 How far have you progressed? \u0001 What have you tried? \u0001 What have you not tried? \u0001 What is the number one problem right now? \u0001 What are you doing right? \u0001 What needs attention right now? \u0001 What does x give you? \u0001 What does x not give you? \u0001 Who are you becoming? \u0001 Where are you not fulfilled yet? \u0001 What other choices do you have? \u0001 What are the questions you have not asked about thi s situation? \u0001 What are you committed to? \u0001 What are you not committed to? \u0001 What's the best that could happen? \u0001 What's the worst that could happen? \u0001 What habits are holding you back? \u0001 What beliefs are holding you back? \u0001 What limiting decisions are holding you back? \u0001 What's blocking you from taking action? \u0001 What does this situation mean about you? \u0001 What is the positive intention of thinking like thi s? Task: 1. Person A shares something they would like coachin g on 2. Each member of the group formulates a question to ask 3. Each member, one at a time asks the person A the question 4. Person A rates the questions on a scale of 0-10 a ccording to the effectiveness of that questions to create thinking 5. Person A shares their score but does not answer t he question 6.

Howard Gardner's Multiple Intelligence Theory was first published in Howard Gardner's book, Frames Of Mind (1983), and quickly became established as a classical model by which to understand and teach many aspects of human intelligence, learning style, pers onality and behaviour - in education and industry.

Honey and Mumford say of their system: \"Our description of the stages in the learning cycl e originated from the work of David Kolb. Kolb uses different words to describe the stages of the learning cycle and fo ur learning styles...\" In summary there are brief descriptions of the four Honey and Mumford key styles.. 'Having an Experience' (stage 1), and Activists (style 1): 'here and now', gregarious, seek challeng bored imple mentation. Reflectors 'stand back', gather data, ponder and ana lyse, delay reaching conclusions, listen before speaking, thoughtful. 'Concluding from the Experience' (stage 3) and Theorists (style 3): think things through in logical steps, assimilate disparate facts into coherent theories, rationally objective, reject subjectivity and flipp ancy. 'Planning the next steps' (stage 4) and Pragmatists (style 4): seek and try out new ideas, practical, down-to- earth, enjoy problem solving and decision-making qu ickly, bored with long discussions.

We are inundate d with information through our five senses, and we code, order and give meaning to our experien ce in words, sounds, pictures, feelings, tastes and smells (our reality). To describe the rich sensory experiences, past and present, we use language to attempt to convey it in words. Our language becomes a \"map\" of the \"territory\" of our constructed reality. In order to reduce the overwhelming amount of infor mation we receive and to be sane, we reduce and cha nge the input of experience in three ways: Deletion - we leave out much of the input. Distortion - we change the input to make it fit our model of the world through the filters of our perception. Generalisation - we cluster single examples, by chunking. To communicate verbally, we repeat the process of d eletion, distortion and generalisation by: Deleting or selecting information to put into words, or Distorting by giving a simplified version which generally dis torts the meaning, or Generalising by minimising all the exceptions that would make c onversation very lengthy. The Words we use are not the item they represent. Language is a label. Language is not reality. Language limits. The art of re-languaging The key to linguistic change is the ordering and se quencing of the internal representations that take place inside your client. Tad James We have natural language abilities built into our n eurology. Noam Chomsky C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 78 Presuppositions are what is assumed in a sentence. The power of li nguistic change presupposes that the unconscious mind has to accept the presuppositions inherent in the sentence in order for the unconscio us mind to make sense of the sentence. Hypnotic Language Patterns are the language of ambiguity, using the Milton Model. By being artfully vague in our languaging we can induce trance states enabling individuals to overcome their problems and discove r new resources. Hierarchy of Ideas is the order of thinking. By being flexible in ou r language, we can pace a client's model of the world and influence them to higher or lower levels of abstraction or specificity. Language of Specificity is the use of the Meta Model. The Meta Model was developed to recover information about how the client has created their Model of Rea lity. By gaining more specificity, new choices bec ome actualised. Metaphors are stories with many levels of meaning. The powe r of metaphor is to distract the conscious mind and to mobilise the resources of the unconscious mi nd through suggestion and symbology. Linguistic Presuppositions Presuppositions are the linguistic equivalent of assumptions and are useful for both recognising what is assumed by the client's speech (their model of the world) and assisting in creating new internal repre sentations for the client. Presuppositions are assumptions ma de in advance. They have implied meaning within se ntences. They imply that a condition is already existing to be true or make sense. Every sentence that we say has a presupposition in it. Most of the time we presuppose what we do not want rather than what we do want. We can make the great est alterations in our lives by presupposing what w e want and avoiding presupposing what we don't want. You m ay suggest to yourself and to the client that chang es can be made easily, effortlessly, and quickly or that c hanges will be slow and painful. Which will the cl ient pick as their solution? Which would be more fun? In Executive Coaching it is important to begin noti cing the inherent qualities and concepts in the spe ech of the client and what is assumed in their model of the wo rld. What's the purpose of noticing someone else's presuppositions within their speech? The purpose is two-fold. First, you can notice the way that some one structures their communication. Secondly, you can begin to use presuppositions to re-structure their internal thought processes through their internal representa tions. Knowing someone else's presuppositions enabl es you to structure their internal processing toward chang e. The most important thing to remember about presuppo sitions is that you can assist the client in struct uring the order and sequence of their internal representation s. Presuppositions work because the client must ac cept certain things in the concept of the sentence in or der for the sentence to work. This displaces resis tance by the conscious mind. The unconscious mind can then acce pt the presupposition while the conscious mind is distracted. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 79 Types of Presuppositions 1. Existence - Whether positive or negative, the effect of the pre supposition is still the same. This is usually a noun, a person, place or thing, in a person's language based on their memories, dec isions or values. Sue knew there was a sailboat on the ocean . Sue didn't know there was a sailboat on the ocean . John realised that there was a mountain behind the house. 2. Modal Operators - The energy we use to organise our life. Possibility - Whether or not the client believes something is pos sible. Cue words like can, could, will, would, possible which are known as Modal Operators. Sue realised that she could be sailing on that boat. John decided it was possible to climb the mountain behind the house. Necessity - Cue words like should, must, got to, have to, that suggest the client is motivated by necessity. Sue realised that she had to be sailing on that boat. John finally knew that he must climb the mountain behind the house. 3. Cause - Effect (C>E) - Something that causes a specific effect; an implied connection. Cue words like because, in order to, makes, as you . . . colours of the sail caught Sue's attent ion and caused her to realise there was a sailboat on the ocean. It was a brilliant flash of lightning that caused John to realise that there was a mountain behind t he house. 4. Complex Equivalent (A=B ) - Occurs when you attach meaning to something spec ific. Cue words like derivatives of the verb to be, means, like that ascribe meaning to something. Sue's inquisitive nature meant that she would want to know how to sail that boat. John knew there was a mountain behind the house, wh ich meant he had to climb it. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 80 5. Awareness - Verbs that imply perception of some sort. Cue word s such as know, realise, aware of, and any of the senses. Sue regretted that she hadn't known about the sailboat. John was aware of the mountain behind the house. John saw the mountain and realised he would climb it. 6. Time - Verbs and verb tenses that move the client through time, -ing implies ongoing; -ed implies in the past. Cue words like, stop, now, yet, before. Can you see yourself sailing on a boat now? John felt like he was climbing the mountain behind the house. 7. Adverb/Adjective - Verb/Noun (Modifiers) where the modification is acc epted as a presupposition. Sue didn't realise how easily she would sail that boat. John realised how hard it would be to climb such a high mountain. 8. Inclusive / Exclusive OR (the basis of Double Binds) Sue hadn't decided whether to sail today or tomorrow (exclusive). John hadn't determined whether the mountain was lar ge or small (inclusive). 9. Ordinal - Signifies numeric order or a list, and can use a wo rd like Firstly, Secondly, Lastly. The first thing Sue realised was that she remembered how to s ail. Firstly John realised that he would have to get fit to cli mb the mountain. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 81 Mind Reading Linguistic presuppositions are the linguistic equiv alent of assumptions and are useful for both recogn ising what is assumed by the client's speech (their model of the world) and assisting in creating new internal repre sentations for the client. It is important to distinguish between 'Presupposit ions' and 'Mind Reads'. Mind reads are where we as sume things which aren't necessarily there, for example that someone is feeling a particular way without th e person saying it. Linguistic Presuppositions are what has been said/mentioned in a sentence. Exercise In the following sentences, please distinguish betw een a presupposition and a mind read. Put a 'P' or an 'MR' next to each one: 1. \"I'm not sure whether I should stop talking abou t my car to my wife.\" ____ A. He has a car. ____ B. He loves his car. ____ C. He currently talks about his car. ____ D. His wife should divorce him for being so bo ring! 2. \"I don't see why I can't do it. All my colleagu es are given the chance to!\" ____ A. He feels that he is treated unfairly. ____ B. He wants to be treated like his colleagues. ____ C. This person's colleagues are given the ch ance to do something that he isn't. ____ D. All his colleagues are forging ahead with t heir career! 3. \"If I don't learn how to appreciate my partner, she'll leave me.\" ____ A. His partner feels that she is treated unfai rly. ____ B. He doesn't know how to appreciate his partn er. ____ C. He wants to learn new behaviours. ____ D. His relationship with his partner is conn ected to his ability to show appreciation. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 82 4. \"I have always set unrealistic standards.\" ____ A. She can't stop setting unrealistic standard s. ____ B. She believes she is trapped. ____ C. She sets standards. ____ D. She's a loser who is bound to be unhappy. 5. \"I'm more successful now! I can see how some o f the things I was doing just held me back.\" ____ A. He was a failure. ____ B. He is a success. ____ C. Something has changed in his life now. ____ D. He fixed himself so he should be congratula ted Linguistic Tips \u0001 Small words with Big Meanings: \u0001 But, although, however. Probably better to use 'An d'. \u0001 'Try'. This implies difficulty and/or high possib ility of non-success. \u0001 'Or'. This can limit our thinking to 1 or 2 option s. \u0001 'Don't....'. 'Don't think of a blue tree now'. \u0001 'Yet' - implies possibility in time \u0001 'Can' - a positive affirmation of belief creates pos sibility C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 83 The Milton Model (Tad James) In 1974 Milton Erickson was widely regarded as the foremost practitioner o f hypnotherapy. He was the founding president of the American Society for Clinical Hypn osis and travelled extensively giving seminars and lectures as well as working in private practice. He had a worl dwide reputation as a sensitive and successful ther apist and was famous for his acute observation of non-verbal behaviour. Erickson used language in artfully vague ways so th at his clients could take the meaning that was most appropriate for them. He induced and utilised tran ce states, enabling individuals to overcome problem s and discover their resources. After studying the techn iques of Milton Erickson, John Grinder and Richard Bandler (founders of NLP) wrote up the Milton Model in The Patterns of the Hypnotic Techniques of Milton H . Erickson, I & II . Erickson's work was based on a number of ideas shar ed by many successful therapists. He respected the client's unconscious mind. He assumed there was a positive intention behind even the most bizarre behaviour, a nd that individuals make the best choices available to them at the time. He worked to give them more choices. He also assumed that at some level, individuals already hav e all the resources they need to make changes. Milton Erickson was masterful at gaining rapport. H e respected and accepted his client's reality. He assumed that resistance was due to lack of rapport. To him , all responses were valid and could be used. To E rickson, there were no resistant clients, only inflexible therapis ts. So the Milton Model is a way of constructing senten ces which are artfully vague and deliberately ambig uous. The client must fill in the details and actively se arch for the meaning of what they hear from their o wn experience. In other words, the practitioner provi des the context with as little content as possible. You give them the frame and leave them to choose the picture to put in it. When the client provides the conten t, this ensures they make the most relevant and immediate m eaning from what you say. MILTON MODEL HYPNOTIC LANGUAGE PATTERNS THAT DISTR ACT THE CONSCIOUS MIND 1. MIND READ Claiming to know the thoughts or feelings of anothe r without specifying the process by which you came to know the information. I know that you are wondering . . . I can understand that . knew you were curious . . . With a forced mind read, you \"start a sentence and not quite . . .\" Your client will gladly fill it in for you. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 84 2. LOST PERFORMATIVE Value judgements where the performer of the value j udgement is left out. Learning is easy . . . And it's a good thing to wonder . . . And it's a good . That's right . . . 3. CAUSE & EFFECT Where it is implied that one thing causes another. Implied Causatives include: a. C>E . . . You can use this to pace a current experience in yo ur client to an Embedded Command. Because . . . If you study, you will learn. Because you're listening, you are gaining understan ding. 4. COMPLEX EQUIVALENCE Where two things are equated; their meanings become equivalent. The more you study, the more you learn. Gaining more understanding means gaining more learn ing. 5. PRESUPPOSITION The linguistic equivalent of assumptions. Almost e verything presupposes something else. You are learning many things . . . And you are absorbing all the learnings. Have you noticed how easily you learn language patt erns? C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 85 6. UNIVERSAL QUANTIFIER A set of words having: a. universal generalisations b. no referential index c. all, every, never, always, nobody And all the things . . . Absolutely know it to be true. And all beings are part of a greater knowledge. 7. MODAL OPERATOR Words which implies possibility or necessity, and w hich form our rules in life such as will, can, may, must, should, need. That you can learn . . . One should begin the process. It is possible for you to absorb all of the learnin gs now. 8. NOMINALIZATION Process words (verbs) which have been frozen in tim e by making them into nouns that delete a great dea l of information. Provide you with new insights, and new understandin gs. Accessing your own inner knowledge will give you un limited wisdom and understanding. 9. UNSPECIFIED VERB (UNSPECIFIED PREDICATE) The listener is forced to supply the meaning of the sentence. And you can . . . I want you to become . . . C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 86 10. TAG QUESTION A question added after a statement designed to disp lace resistance. Can can, can't you? SIMPLE DELETIONS Recovering awareness of experiences or sensory inpu t. You may understand . . . As you wonder . . . 12. LACK OF REFERENTIAL INDEX Phrase in which the subject of the sentence is unsp ecified. One can, you know, learn language patterns easily. Some people know Others may begin to feel . . . You know the feeling. 13. COMPARATIVE DELETION (Unspecified Comparison) Where the comparison is made and it is not specifie d as to what or to whom it was made. Right and Wrong; Now and Then; Sooner or Later; At One Time or Another; More & More. And it's more or less the right thing. Sometimes it's better to feel now and then . . . 14. PACE CURRENT EXPERIENCE Where client's experience (verifiable, external) is described in a way which is undeniable. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 87 You are sitting here, listening to me, looking at m e, (etc.) . . . When you understand this. You are sitting here, listening to my voice, writin g your notes in your own words or mine, . . . 15a. EMBEDDED COMMANDS Directives that are embedded within the sentence wh ich direct a person to do something. This is a dou ble message and sends one message to the conscious mind and another message to the unconscious mind. You will absorb the learnings . . . I don't know if you'll remember this now or later . . . 15b. EMBEDDED QUESTIONS A sentence with a question included to which an ove rt response is not expected. I wonder whether you know which hand will rise firs t. If you were to know when . . . are you going into t rance . . . 16. DOUBLE BIND A paradox which on the surface creates choice for t he client but where either choice is acceptable. You can change as quickly or a slowly as you want t o now. Will you take your bath before or after your goodni ght story? And that means your unconscious mind is paying atte ntion or you are already relaxed completely. 17. CONVERSATIONAL POSTULATE The communication has the form of a question, a que stion to which the response is either a yes or a no . If I want you to do something, what else must be present so t hat you will do it, and out of your awareness? It allows you to choose to respond or not and avoids authoritaria nism. Do you feel this is something you understand? Will you feel more comfortable with your arms unfol ded? C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 88 18. EXTENDED QUOTE Distracting the conscious mind by the use of many r eferential indices. Last week I was with Richard who told me about his training in 1999 at Denver when he talked to someon e who said . . .\" 19. SELECTIONAL RESTRICTION VIOLATION A sentence that is not well formed in that only hum ans and animals can have feelings. A chair can have feelings . . . The car knew how to get there. The walls are listening; they have ears. As you write your notes, you note that your pen see s these learnings too. 20. AMBIGUITY a. Phonological: Hear and Here . To and Too and Two . No and Know .

C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 91 META MODEL Abstract to Specific One of the first patterns developed by John Grinder and Richard Bandler in NLP the Meta Model uses language to clarify language, to re-connect language with ex perience. The Meta Model is a set of language patterns and questions that reconnects the deletions, distortion s and generalisations with the experience that gene rated them. Meta means above or beyond. The meta model is a model of language used on language itself to clarify language. Deep Structure is our pure experience, and exists at an unconscio us level. We transform that deep structure or pure experience into a form that we can communicate , our verbal and non-verbal behaviours, our Surface Structure . The Meta Model language patterns were modelled by R ichard and John from the questioning style of two prominent psychotherapists, Fritz Perls and Virginia Satir , who used these patterns to gain information. The Meta Model is used to: \u0001 Gain more specificity, \u0001 To recover information from the speaker's Model of the World, and \u0001 To bring someone out of trance. When we ask clients to become more specific, we are assisting them to recover from their deep structur e, the deletions, distortions and generalisations that hav e created the perception of the problem as a proble m. In short, we use the Meta Model to assist individuals to come out of a problem state with the intention o f increasing choice.

Mind Reading: Claiming to know someone's internal state. Ex: \"You don't like me.\" \"How do you know I don't like you?\" Re covers Source of the Info. 2. Lost Performative: Value judgements where the person doing the judging is left out. Ex. \"It's bad to be inconsistent.\" \"Who says it's bad?\" \"According to whom?\" \"How do you know it's bad.\" Gathers evidence. Recovers sourc e of the belief, the Performative, strategy for the belief. 3. Cause Effect: Where cause is wrongly put outside the self. Ex: \"You make me sad.\" \"How does what I'm doing cause you to choose to feel sad?\" (Also, Counter Ex., or \"How Specifically?\" Recover s the choice. 4. Complex Equivalence: Where two experiences are interpreted as being synonymous. Ex: \"She's always yelling at me, she doesn't like me.\" \"How does her yelling mean that she..?\" \"Have you ever yelled at someone you liked?\" Recovers Complex Equivalence. Counter Example. 5. Presuppositions: Ex: \"If my husband knew how much I suffered, he wouldn't do that.\" There are 3 Presuppositions in this sentence: (1) I suffer, (2) My husband acts in some way, and (3) My husband doesn' t know I suffer. (1) \"How do you choose to suffer?\" (2) \"How is he (re)acting? (3) \"How do you know he doesn't know?\" Specify the choice & the verb, & what he does.

Additional reading is required to understand the breadth and depth of the field of coaching. Additional resources may be found at The Hero's Journey Managing the process of life change can be likened to what Joseph Campbell called the \"Hero's Journey\" ( The Power of Myth , 1988). Campbell searched for the connections in the myths and stories of change that cross cultural boundaries. He discovere d that certain themes are repeated in many cultures and appear to be deeper threads connecting all of humanity, reflecting the overall path that we take form birth to death regardless of our individu al circumstances. Just as we are born the same and die the same, ther e are other deep patterns held in the collective me mory of our species. Campbell described the commonalities of our overall life path in terms of the steps of the \"Hero's Jou rney\" - the sequence of events that seem to be shared in the ep ic myths of every culture. According to Campbell, these steps include: 1. Hearing a calling that relates to our identity, life purpose or miss ion. We can choose to either accept or ignore the calling. 2. Accepting the calling leads us to confront a boundary or threshold in ou r existing abilities or map of the world. 3. Crossing a threshold propels us into some new life \"territory\" outside of our current comfort zone; a territory that forces us to grow and evolve, and re quires us to find support and guidance. 4. Finding a guardian or mentor is something that often comes naturally from having the courage to cross a threshold. (As it has been said, \"When the student is ready, the teacher appears.\") 5. Facing a challenge (or \"demon\") is also a natural result of crossing a threshold. \"Demons\" are not necessarily evil or bad; they are simply a type of \"energy\" or \"power\" that we need to learn to conten d with or accept. Often, they are simply a reflectio n of one of our own inner fears and shadows. 6. Transforming the \"demon \" into a resource or advisor is typically accomplish ed by either: a) Developing a special skill. b) Discovering a special resource or tool. 7. Completing the task for which one has been called, and finding the way to fulfil the calling is ultimately achieved by creating a new map of the world that in corporates the growth and discoveries brought about by the journey. 8. Finding the way home as a transformed person, and sharing with others t he knowledge and experience gained as a result of the journey. While the hero's journey is clearly a metaphor, it captures a good deal of the reality facing leaders and managers as they seek to build a path to a successful future and contend with the uncertainties of change. The notion of a C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 100 \"calling,\" for instance, clearly symbolizes the vis ion and mission that the leader and his or her team or company is pursuing. The \"threshold\" represents the unknown and uncertai n elements that we must confront in order to bring the vision into action. The symbol of the \"demon\" reflects the challenges o f upheaval, competition, internal politics and othe r obstacles and crises, which emerge from circumstances beyond our control. Our resources are the values, behaviou ral skills and business practices we are able to put into acti on in order to deal with complexity, uncertainty an d resistance. This is the area where the leader himself or hersel f must grow in order develop the flexibility and in creased requisite variety necessary to successfully navigat e the new territory and overcome the obstacles whic h arise along the way. \"Guardians\" are the sponsors and relationships we d evelop that support us to build skills, believe in ourselves and stay focused on our objectives. Mapping the Hero's Journey While Campbell's description of the journey begins with hearing and accepting a \"calling,\" our real li fe experiences often call us to the hero's journey by presenting us with the challenge first. The many h eroes who emerged as a result of the September 11 terrorist a ttacks, for instance, were thrown into their journe y by a direct confrontation with the \"demon.\" They had to face t heir threshold and recognize their calling within t he crisis they were facing. This is also frequently the case with business leaders. It is a crisis, which prese nts the calling. In fact, the very act of exerting leadership is truly a type of hero's journey in and of itself. To expl ore and prepare yourself for some the key aspects of your own hero' s journey, pick a project or initiative that you ar e currently involved in or planning and consider the following questions: C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 101 1. What is the 'demon' (challenge) you (and your team) must face? 2. What is your 'threshold'? What is the unknown terri tory outside of your comfort zone into which you must step? 3. What are you being 'called' to do or become? 4. What resources do you have and which do you need to develop more fully in order to face the challenge, cross your threshold and accomplish your calling? 5. Who are (will be) your guardians for those resource s? C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 102 Contracting Dual relationships - 1:1 contracting \u0001 Student with coach as teacher \u0001 Coach with Coach Supervisor as the manager \u0001 Additional social/sexual relationship in existence Reflecting on a one -to -one contract - For each coachee, use the following c hecklist to review your overall contract, as it was initially established - identif y any gaps and plan to check back on these with you r client. Has your contract addressed the following elements Procedural \u0001 How long is the relationship likely to last? \u0001 What frequency of meetings? \u0001 Where will we meet? (Will this vary?) \u0001 What notes will be kept? By whom? Where will they be kept? Are they accessible to others? \u0001 What is the procedure if one of us needs to cancel a session? How will we re-arrange? \u0001 Do either of us have 'gate keepers' who take messag es or manage our diaries? If so, what will they be told about our relationship? Professional \u0001 What is the nature of the coaching (traditional, de velopmental, educational, organisational, life, etc .)? \u0001 Are we both fully in agreement with that? \u0001 Have we checked we both have the same understanding of what we mean? \u0001 What are the boundaries to our relationship? \u0001 What issues should the client take elsewhere? \u0001 How will we know when issues are outside our agreed boundaries? \u0001 What referral options are we aware of (e.g. therapi st, counsellor, head teacher, etc.)? \u0001 What are the expected outcomes from working togethe r? \u0001 Are we satisfied that the professional level of the contract is within our competence? \u0001 Have we specified what is outside the contract, such as coach acting on behalf of th e client, or discussing client's performance with a line manager? Psychological \u0001 What aspects have we brought into awareness that mi ght otherwise have influenced under the surface? \u0001 Have we both been open about any anxieties or conce rns we have? \u0001 Have we considered how either of us might unwitting ly sabotage our relationship? \u0001 Have we planned how to recover trust if something d oes go wrong? \u0001 Have we addressed the potential dependency issues? The possibility that the client may feel overwhelmed? Or rebellious? \u0001 What ground rules have we agreed to ensure that eit her one of us will feel comfortable enough to raise any issues with our relationship? \u0001 If we were to play psychological games, what might the dynamics be? How can we avoid games? C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 103 Three Cornered Contracting Contracting and the School We can add another dimension to the prompts in abov e diagram. What procedural arrangements does the school expect? \u0001 Has the school specified an overall time period for the relationship, the frequency of meetings, the length of sessions? \u0001 Does the school expect to have sight of any documen tation? Are reports required, including coachee feedback about the coach? What professional expectations does the organization have? \u0001 What type of coaching is intended? \u0001 What are the boundaries set by the school (related to current job only, personal circumstances, career advancement, changing employer, etc.)? \u0001 What referral options are provided by the school (e .g. counselling scheme, employee assistance programme)? \u0001 What other support is available (e.g. educational s ponsorship, training courses, shadowing options)? What psychological undercurrents might there be? \u0001 Unspoken expectations that the coach is there to 'm ould' the coachee to suit the needs of the organisation? \u0001 Coachee fears about the coach reporting on them to the school? \u0001 School using coaching as a last resort or so they c an justify sacking the coachee? \u0001 Unrealistic expectations of what coaching can achie ve? School Client Coach C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 104 Grow and Score Models History of the GROW Model Developed in the commercial coaching world by Graha m Alexander and taken forward by Sir John Whitmore, David Hemery and David Whitaker. All of whom were t op flight sportsmen and later sports coaches. After studying effective coaching the GROW model was foun d to be the most useful as a framework for what the y had observed. A non-directive coaching technique which utilises q uestioning in order to raise awareness and generate understanding. Can also be used as a self review an d learning tool and can be reflective or future-pac ed. The coach need not be an expert in the subject being di scussed. Further detail for each section of the mod el follows: Description of the Model GOAL : When defining the goal it is important to identif y and eliminate any negative outcome statements and elicit positive alternatives. Statements without ow nership should also be challenged in order to elici t alternatives that are within the person's control. Missing senso ry based evidence and consequences should also be p robed and an ecology check made on final goals. High leve l / Long- term goals should be supported by Low lev el / Short- term manageable steps and care must be taken to elicit the true objective. All goals should be SMART. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 105 REALITY: This should be explored fully in terms of actions a lready taken, past results, previous experience, factual information and sensory and emotional infor mation. Probe what is not said. OPTIONS: Possible options are elicited from the coachee via questioning. The coach should resist the temptation to provide the coachee with their ideas, and should only do this as a last resort having ob tained the coachee's permission. If the coachee finds option g eneration particularly difficult, a question along the lines of \"If you did know, what would you do\", may help, the use of silence is also powerful. Options should be dis cussed in particular in relation to achievement of the goal a nd their positive and negative impacts. They should then be prioritised and a selection made by the coachee. WILL: This is the area most often missed within coaching . It is where commitment is obtained from the coach ee to carry out the actions they have identified. Norm al action planning questions along the lines of tim e frames, venue etc. should be asked. Potential barriers, peo ple who need to be involved in the process, and sup port required should also be probed. It helps to get the coachee to describe how they will know when they h ave achieved their goal and to summarise the coaching s ession. Sometimes numerical ratings are used to asc ertain the level of commitment to a given action. Follow u p meetings should be arranged. If relevant an element of skill practice can be ins erted between OPTIONS and WILL. The model is particularly effective for use in Pers onal development, Performance appraisal and improve ment, action planning and change situations. The COACHING Process - G.R.O.W. G Goal : What do you want? \u0003 R Reality : What is happening now? \u0003 O Options : What could you do from here? \u0003 W Will : What will you do now?

How will you k now you are being successful? What will success look like? REALITY You can summarise and reflect, accurately, the real ity of the performer, including \u0001 What's worked \u0001 What's not worked \u0001 What the obstacles are The traps \u0001 Encouraging explanation rather than exploring. If they start saying \"because\", beware! \u0001 Long stories of explanation. As coach, you don't n eed the full story, simply to know that they're awa re of it and understand it \u0001 Imposing your reality as coach onto the performer. Instead, use their language, respect their positio n. Some useful questions for the REALITY phase \u0001 What is the present situation in more detail? \u0001 What and how much is your concern about it? C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 107 \u0001 Who is affected by this issue, other than you? How could they see it? \u0001 What have you done so far? \u0001 What results did that produce? \u0001 What obstacles have you overcome on the way? \u0001 What has stopped you doing more? \u0001 What are you assuming that stops you solving this?

It is essential to stay silent after you ask quest ions. \u0001 Allowing them to concentrate on the obvious, immedi ate solution Some useful questions for the OPTIONS phase \u0001 What are all the different ways you can approach th is issue? \u0001 What else could you do? And what else? \u0001 Ask questions such as \"What if ...\" o you had unlimited time? o you had unlimited money? o you were the boss? o you could start again with a clean sheet? o you asked your wise old friend, what would they say ? o you were world class at this, what would you do? \u0001 what would you hate to do? \u0001 Write everything down \u0001 Reserve judgement \u0001 Ask \"Would you like another suggestion?\", only after they've exhausted all options.

Your role is to flush out the excuses up front, rather than hear t hem in a week's time \u0001 Jumping in and rescuing the performer - doing for t hem what they're capable of doing for themselves. They can only grow if they do it for themselves \u0001 Not following up Some useful questions for the WILL phase \u0001 Which option(s) do you choose? \u0001 Will this address your goal? Does it solve the issu e? To what extent? \u0001 What are your criteria for measuring success? \u0001 When precisely are you going to start and finish ea ch action step? \u0001 What obstacles do you need to overcome to achieve y our result? What will be your excuse if you don't achieve it? \u0001 What personal resistance do you have in taking this action? \u0001 Who else needs to know about your plans? \u0001 What support do you need, from whom and when? \u0001 How will you get that support? \u0001 What commitment on a 1-10 scale do you have to taki ng the agreed action? \u0001 What prevents this from being a 10? \u0001 What could you do to raise your commitment to a 9 o r a 10? \u0001 Have you got what you needed from this session? C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 109 THE PURPOSE OF THE EFFECTIVE QUESTIONS IN G.R.O.W. Goal - To generate goal clarity through the explora tion of: \u0001 What success might look like. \u0001 The parts over which they have the greatest persona l control. \u0001 Qualities that might be relevant to this goal (e.g. Specific, Measurable, Agreed, Realistic, Time scal es, Exciting etc). \u0001 Creating a goal that is both challenging and achiev able. \u0001 The personal gains of aspiring towards the goal. \u0001 Success measures. Reality - To establish as accurately as possible th e situation as it is now. This may necessitate detailed exploration of: \u0001 Description of situation (what, when, where, who, h ow much, how often?) \u0001 The impact of the situation on people, performance, activities etc. \u0001 The facts and the emotions. \u0001 More than one perspective. \u0001 What is and is not in the situation. \u0001 What has been done so far to change things. \u0001 The blockages to future movement. Options - To identify possible solutions and to eva luate them. This is facilitated by: \u0001 Encouraging ideas to flow. \u0001 Valuing and keeping a note of all ideas. \u0001 Challenging people to think of ...'what else might you do?' \u0001 Finding questions that evoke creativity. \u0001 Separating the creativity from the evaluation. \u0001 Bringing in the coach's ideas wisely. \u0001 Exploring the benefits of each idea. \u0001 Identifying the ideas that most interest the person . Will - To establish commitment to the chosen way fo rward. The following are powerful questions to achieve thi s: \u0001 Which option or options do you choose? \u0001 To what extent does this meet all your objectives? \u0001 What are your criteria and measurements for success ? \u0001 When precisely are you going to start and finish ea ch action step? \u0001 What could arise to hinder you in taking these step s? \u0001 What personal resistance do you have, if any, to ta king these steps? \u0001 What will you do to eliminate these external and in ternal factors? \u0001 Who needs to know what your plans are? \u0001 What support do you need and from whom?

Model enriches the GROW structure by adding a few more simple distinctions. The letters stand for Symptoms, Causes, Outcomes, Resources and Effec ts. These elements represent the minimum amount of information that needs to be addressed by any proce ss of change. 1. Symptoms are typically the most noticeable and conscious as pects of a presenting problem or problem state. 2. Causes are the underlying elements responsible for creati ng and maintaining the symptoms. They are usually less obvious than the symptoms they produce. 3. Outcomes are the particular goals or desired states that wo uld take the place of the symptoms. 4. Resources are the underlying elements responsible for removi ng the causes of the symptoms and for manifesting and maintaining the desired outcomes. 5. Effects are the longer term results of achieving a particu lar outcome. Specific outcomes are generally stepping stones to get to a longer term effect. Positive effects are often the reason or motivation for establishing a particular outcome to begin wit h. Negative effects can create resistance or ecologica l problems. EXERCISE; In triads, debate and agree the questions and inten ts behind the questions that you would ask at each stage of SCORE. Then run one round of coaching to trial your findings. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 112 Clean Language INTRODUCTION TO CLEAN LANGUAGE Adapted from Penny Tompkins and James Lawley by Dr Sall y Vanson Clean Language is a set of questions developed by t herapist David Grove in the 1980s. Clean Language is 'clean' because it keeps the facilitator from unwittingly introducing their metaphors, assumptions or sugges tions into a conversation (no matter how well meaning these may be). Clean questions encourage metaphors, ideas, se lf- reflections and ah-ha's into being. When personal c hange is the goal, Clean Language invites a client's perceptions to evolve and change organically \u2014 one question at a time. The linguistic base of the art and science of coaching consists of the Meta Model and Milton M odel. Students of NLP may be forgiven for thinking these two wonderfully useful tools are all that is needed for the \"study of the structure of subjective expe rience.\" In their two-year modelling project of David Grove Jam es Lawley and Penny Tomkins have discovered there i s another way of representing our internal and extern al worlds. We call this The Metaphor Model, and its 'modus operandi' is Clean Language. Clean Language is to Da vid Grove what the Milton Model is to Erickson -- o nly David came up with his own model and was far too mo dest to name it after himself! 'Clean' does not mean 'no influence'. All languag e influences and Clean Language wouldn't be much us e if it didn't have an effect. Because of its ability to re spectfully invite clients to attend to particular a spects of their inner world, Clean Language influences the directio n of a client's mind-body-spirit process (without contaminating the content of their experience). Oth er processes may do this too, but none do it so cleanl y or in quite the way that Clean Language does, and none are so tailored to work with metaphor. Although Clean Language was originally designed to work therapeutically with clients' metaphors and symbols, these days it is used more conversationall y in Clean Language facilitates the client's process, ensuring that the client's meaning and resonance remain wholly intact, uncontaminated by the therapist's words. It opens t he door to change.\" David Grove Language is so much more than words, and so there is Clean Language Without Words which asks clean questions of movements of the body, sounds and other nonverbal behaviour. There can be a lot of information stored in a gesture, a glance, or ev en a sigh. Clean Language is great for encouraging what's behind those expressions to reveal itself. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 113 hundreds of ways \u2014 by researchers, teachers, the po lice, managers, consultants, health practitioners, recruiters, interviewers and many others. Celebrated Therapists In the early 1980's David Grove studied transcripts of celebrated therapists like Virginia Satir and Ca rl Rogers and noticed they continually shifted their client's fram es of reference. He realised they were introducing their own model of the world by subtly rewording what the cli ent was saying. David wondered what it would be like to fully prese rve and honour a client's experience with minimal interference by the coach. He achieved this by iden tifying a number of very simple questions with a pa rticular syntax and a unique delivery method. These question s contained a minimum of presupposition and were therefore called 'Clean Language.' What he discovered was the more he used Clean Language, the more clients naturally used metaphor to describe their symptoms. When Clean Language questions were then directed to the metaphors and symbols, unexpected information became available to the clie nt, often with profound results. He found that the less he attempted to change the client's model of the wo rld, the more they experienced their own core patterns, and organic, lasting changes nat urally emerged from 'the system'. Less is More The 'less is more' philosophy of Clean Language is a different approach to the traditional philosophy of NLP. The Meta Model and Milton Model patterns of language ar e designed to have maximum influence, often through the covert use of suggestion. And very effective they a re too. However, they are not the only way to facil itate clients through the change process. By interfering with a client's description of their symptoms, David Grove asserts that well-meaning coa ches can rob clients of the very experience needed to resolv e their unwanted behaviours. In parallel to Grove, Ernest Rossi, co -author of many of Milton Erickson's books, has been developing an approach t o hypnotherapy which could be called 'minimalist'. He describes it as a: \"naturalistic approach [which] can be used to help patients enhance their sensitivity and awareness of their personal p atterns of mind- body coding and signaling to access and resolve the ir problems.\" (page 313) The title of Rossi's book, \"The Symptom Path to Enl ightenment\" points to where this type of approach could lead! C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 114 Symbolic Meaning NLP has made great to our understandi not content\" could be an NLP slogan. Perhaps because o f this, NLP has mostly ignored the symbolic meaning of the content of subjective experience. Working with symbol and metaphor is David Grove's forte. Clean Language both validates the client's experienc e and facilitates the 'bringing into form' or 'giving life to' symbolic information normally out of everyday aware ness. By doing so it catalyses the processes of sel f- managed change. Information-Centred Coaching The aim of Grovian Metaphor Coaching is for the client to gather information about their own subjective experience, not necessarily for the coach to unders tand it. Attempting to understand the client's exper ience is replaced with tracking the inherent symbolic proces s and structure within their 'Metaphoric Psychescape ' or symbolic model or map.. The coach asks questions on behalf of the information sources, staying strictly withi n the metaphor. Thus this process is not client-centred, it is information-ce ntred. Common by-products of being asked Clean Language qu estions are: a state of self-absorption (often an e yes- open trance develops); a sense of connecting with s ome deep, rarely explored aspects of ourselves; and a sense of wonder, curiosity and awe at the marvellous inge nuity of our unconscious. Clean Language questions enable the client to exper ience their own patterns in 'real time.' As a result, naturalistic, organic transformations occur. Processing Language Psychology research has clearly shown we process ev erything that is said to us. We seem to be biologic ally programmed to attempt to make sense of whatever ano ther person communicates. For example, when we are asked a question we have to \"mentally do\" whatever is asked before we can answer. To do this we have t o presuppose or infer much more information than is g iven in the 'surface structure' of the question. We have discovered that when a coach makes even min ute changes to a client's words the implications can be significant. Clients often have to go through additional translation processes and mental gymnastics to reorientate to the coach's presuppositions. Thus th e coaching subtly goes in a direction determined by the coach's map of the world. In Clean Language, the coach aims to ask the questi on the client's information wants to be asked. Each response is the n utilized by the coach in the next question. Thus the coach follows the na tural direction of the process rather than leads it. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 115 Unclean Language To illustrate how easy it is to unwittingly interfe re in a client's process, let's explore an example. A coach could respond in a number of ways to the following statem ent: Client: I'm stuck with no way out. Coach 1: Have you got the determination to walk away? This intervention uses very unclean language as it: \u0001 implies the solution for the client is to be away f rom their current condition \u0001 imposes determination as the resource required \u0001 assumes the client will 'walk away' (rather than le aping, soaring, melting, evaporating, etc.) Also the client might well presuppose they have ins ufficient of the determination required, because if they had enough, they would have already applied it, wouldn' t they?! Coach 2: What would happen if you could find a way out? This is cleaner language as it mostly uses the clie nt's words. However, you may have noticed the embedd ed command, 'find a way out'. The coach has assumed the solution of 'finding' on behalf of the client. While this may produce a useful outcome, does the coach recognise they have just imposed their model of the world on the client? You may also notice in both of the above examples the client's perception has been subtly ignored. The client has said there is no way out of stuck. Our experience i ndicates it is highly therapeutic to begin by fully validating the client's 'current reality' through the use of Clean La nguage (See example below). Perhaps the deepest presupposition in both of the a bove interventions is that being \"away\" or \"out\" is good for the client, and many coach's outcome would be to facilitate this. David Grove assumes that if a client is 'stuck,' then there is valuable information in the stuckness. If 'stuck' is not honoured and explored, the client may well need to return to 'stuck' at a future date. This may explain why some apparently successful therapeutic interventions can have a short-lived effect. Benefits of Using Clean Language The results of using Clean Language can be quite as tounding. Clients often report that we seem to unde rstand their predicament at a very deep level, and that th is in itself is valuable. (Actually this is only tr ue at the symbolic level -- at an everyday content/cognitive level we know much less about their issue than most traditio nal counsellors.) Perhaps the most noticeable benefit of this type of coaching is that the client gets to increase their awareness of their own process. They become observers of their o wn repeating patterns. They make connections betwee n the symbolic pattern and their everyday life. This sepa rates them from their 'stuff' and allows new perspect ives and insights. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 116 At a certain stage the process \"takes over\" and bot h you and the client are led by the information. Wh en this occurs profound shifts take place. The client is ta ken by surprise at the turn of perceptual events as long-standing patterns transform themselves into more useful ways of being and doing. From the coach's point of view this can verge on th e miraculous. When the most unwanted and fearful sy mbols transform organically into resources and the client experiences deep physiological changes. Clean Language has three components: 1. Voice Qualities David Grove deliberately 'marks out' his use of Clea n Language through changes to his normal way of spe aking: \u0001 The speed of his delivery is slower than half norma l pace \u0001 He uses a slightly deeper tonality than normal spea king \u0001 He often uses a distinctive sing-song rhythm \u0001 There is an implied sense of curiosity and wonder i n his voice \u0001 The client's idiosyncratic pronunciation, emphasis, sighs etc. are matched 2. Syntax The syntax of Clean Language is peculiar and would sound very strange if used in normal conversation! It uses Pacing and Leading in a particular way. For example , all the questions begin with \"and\" and are orient ated to the clients 'perceptual present'. The generalised syntax , in its full form, 4 components: \"And [pacing clients words] + And experience]\" example: C: I've gone blank. T: And you've gone blank. And when you've gone blank, what kind of blank is that blank? or C I'm getting confused. T: And you're getting confused. And as you're getting confused is there anything else about getting confused like that ? 3. Clean language questions The aim of Clean Language early in the process is t o allow information to emerge into the client's awar eness by exploring their coding of their metaphor. Let's visit an example, using Clean Language questio ns: Client: I'm stuck with no way out. CLQ: And what kind of stuck with no way out is that stuck with no way out? Client A: My whole body feels as if its sinking into the grou nd. Client B: I can't see the way forward. It's all foggy. Client C: Every door that was opened to me is closed. This gives the client maximum opportunity to descri be the experience of 'stuck,' and therefore to gather more information about their representation of the Prese nt State. Another Clean Language question you could ask would be: CLQ: And when you are stuck with no way out, where are stuck? Client D: It's as if my feet are frozen to the ground. Client E: I'm in a long tunnel and there's no light at either end. Client F: I see myself wrapped up like a mummy. This question works with the client's metaphor of st uck, and only assumes that for something to be stuc k it has to be stuck somewhere. When the coach is in rapport with the metaphoric in formation, questions like the above make perfect se nse, and client's responses have a quality of deep introspect ion and self-discovery. New awareness of their own process 'updates the system' and the original neural coding w ill automatically begin to transform; albeit in min ute ways at first. Clean Language questions are then asked of each sub sequent response and each symbolic representation i s explored. Thus the client is continually expanding their awareness of their Metaphoric Psychescape. Th e process C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 118 ultimately accesses conflicts, paradoxes, double-bi nds and other 'holding patterns' which have kept the symptoms repeating over and over. As the process moves beyond this point, symbolic re sources naturally emerge which resolve, at a symbol ic level, that which the client has been unable to resolve at an everyday level. When the metaphor evolves, behaviour changes in the client's 'real world'. There is a correlation between the two. 9 clean language questions are asked 80% of the tim e (There are another 25 questions only asked when app ropriate to the client www.cleanlanguage.co.uk ) 1. And is there anything else about.....? 2. And what kind of............is that......? 3. And where is..........? 4. And whereabouts? 5. And what happens next? 6. And then what happens? 7. And what happens just before......? 8. And where does/ could ...... come from? 9. And that's......like what? DEVELOPING (THE CURRENT PERCEPTION) ATTRIBUTES And is there anything else about ... ? And what kind of ... ? LOCATION And where/whereabouts is ... ? RELAT IONSHIP And is there a relationship between ... and ... ? And when ..., what happens to ... ? METAPHOR And that's ... like what? MOVING TIME BEFORE And what happens just before ... ? C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 119 AFTER And then what happens/what happens next? SOURCE And where does/could ... come from? INTENTION DESIRED OUTCOME And what would ... like to have happen? NECESSARY CONDITIONS And what needs to happen for ... ? And can ... ? From Compass to Molecule We moved from using a compass diagram to a molecule to depict the client's experience for two reasons. First we want to emphasise interconnectedness rather than direction. Second, the molecule represents the client's perception, both foreground (inside the centre sphe re) and background (outside the centre sphere). As modellers we want the client's perceptions to be central to ev erything the facilitator says and does. By placing the questions around the outside we are emphasising tha t first the facilitator decides which sphere of perception they would like the client to attend to, and then they ask a question that invites them to attend to that part of their experience. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 120 C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 121 Our Thinking Changes and we are now on Version 3 Developing questions hold time still and maintain the client's attention on some aspect of their current perception. Version 3 includes two extra developing questions which invite the client to attend to the relationship between two aspects ('X' and 'Y') of their Metaphor Lan dscape: And is there a relationship between 'X' and 'Y' ? And when 'X', what happens to 'Y' ? We consider these two questions basic because human perception is a gestalt; it is inter connected and therefore symbols in a Metaphor Landscape are always in relation to each other. In fact every sentence contains wor ds which indicate relationships; verbs and preposition s for instance. The second major change is the inclusion of a new c ategory of intention questions. The distinction between the first nine basic questions and the '+3' intention que stions is vital. The first nine are used to model 'w hat is'. The three intention questions invite the client to self -model their desired outcome and the conditions under which that outcome can happen. The intention questions, c oupled with the client's desire to change, turn Symb olic Modelling from a 'pure' modelling process into a mode lling-based change process. This is why \"And what w ould you like to have happen?\" is used to initiate most Symbolic Modelling therapy or coaching sessions. Other minor revisions to the model involved decidin g that 'Where?' and 'Whereabouts?' invite the client to attend to the same kind of experience (i.e. the loc ation of an item in their perceptual space) and cou ld therefore be regarded as variations of the same question. You may have noticed that this reverts to the formulat ion in version 1 of the model! We also decided that both 'Then what happens?' and 'Wh at happens next?' invite a client to attend to an ev ent after the one currently in their perception. In common p arlance, 'forward in time'. Therefore we now classify these two questions as one. The final change in version 3 is the separation of \"And where could/does ... come from?\" into its own category called Source . We did this to make it clear that this question i nvites the client to attend to a different kind of information (the origin of 'X', cause of 'X' or from w hence 'X' came) than simply 'Moving Time Back' to the previous event. Example Using Figure 3 as a guide we take a client's statem ent and show how each of the 9+3 questions invites them to attend to a different sphere of their experience . Facilitator: And what would you like to have happen ? Client: I would like to feel strong and stand up to others. At this point, as a facilitator you have numerous o ptions depending on where you wish to direct the cl ient's attention. Below we list these options in two broa d categories: Within the client's current perception (inside the centre sphere of Figure 3). Outside the current perception (to one of the surro unding spheres). C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 122 The left-hand column indicates the sphere of experi ence you want the client to attend to, the right-ha nd column the clean question that will likely direct the clie nt's attention there. WITHIN THE CURRENT PERCEPTION ATTRIBUTES And is there anything else about stand up to others? And what kind of strong is that strong? LOCATION And where/whereabouts do you feel strong? RELATIONSHIP And is there a relationship between feel strong and stand up to others ? And when you feel strong, what happens to others ? METAPHOR And that's strong like what ? OUTSIDE THE CURRENT PERCEPTION EVENT BEFORE And what happens just before you feel strong? EVENT AFTER And then what happens/what happens next? SOURCE And where does/could that feel strong com e from ? DESIRED OUTCOME And when you'd like to feel strong and stand up to others, what would you like to have happen now ? NECESSARY CONDITIONS And what needs to happen for you to feel strong? And can you feel strong? Working Systemically C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 123 Within Symbolic Modelling, Clean Language is applie d systemically. That is with an awareness of workin g with the non-linear and emergent properties of a human s ystem. Clean Language can be used in this way becau se: The simplicity of the questions enable a system's co mplexity to emerge 'uncontaminated' by the metaphors, assumptions and presuppositions of the facilitator. It works with a system's natural tendency to display an idiosyncratic directionality, i.e. to follow a unique developmental path. It can work at multiple levels of organisation: com ponent, relationship, pattern, and pattern of organ isation. By enabling an individual or group to map a network of relationships they discover the wisdom in their own system that is not contained in any of the parts, but is embodied in the configuration of the whole. When using Symbolic Modelling in a therapy or coach ing context, the facilitator's role is to use Clean Language to invite the client to attend to various aspects o f their perception so that they self-model . The client's role is to find out how their perceptions work together as a s ystem -- and for that to operate as feedback so tha t they continually learn from their own experience. And because we keep learning from our colleagues, s tudents and clients, we can be sure that in the yea rs to come our model of Clean Language with evolve still further. \u00a9 2004, James Lawley and Penny Tompkins C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 124 Coaching with Metaphor Metaphor Have you ever been speaking to a student and they s ay, \"You know, it's like ...\"? Inevitably you have, because we all use metaphors to describe our experience. Whate ver they put in the \"...\", will be a metaphor, and will have significant meaning for them. [Note 1] Some teachers disregard student's metaphors and cons ider them 'throwaway' comments. But many teachers with exquisite rapport skills have learned to liste n very carefully to their student's metaphors so tha t they can converse within the logic or 'frame' of the metaphor. These teachers intuitively know that metaphor is no t an occasional foray into the world of figurative language, but the fundamental basis for everyday cognition. G eorge Lakoff and Mark Johnson state: In all aspects of life, ... we define our reality i n terms of metaphors and then proceed to act on the basis of the metaphors. We draw inferences, set goals, make comm itments, and execute plans, all on the basis of how we in part structure our experience, consciously and unco nsciously, by means of metaphor. [Note 2] Special questions are needed to explore a student's metaphors without introducing your own. These questions are called Clean Language, and are designed to respect and acknowledge the student's experience by using th eir exact words. Recently I was working with a student who was havin g great difficulty trying to describe why making de cisions was such a problem for her (perhaps she couldn't de cide on the right words!). \"And, making decisions is like what?\" I enquired. She thought for a moment and replied, \"You know, it's like going to the dentist. I'm in the waiting room and I'm dreading going in.\" To this very rich description of her experience I s imply replied, \"And when you're in the dentist's waiting room, is th ere anything else about dreading going in?\" (being careful to use her exact words). I could tell she was deep inside her metaphor by th e amount of time she took to answer and in the way she finally said, \"I really need courage.\" \"And what kind of courage is that courage?\" was my next question. \"A courage that will help me go though it rather th an delay any longer.\" [Note 3] \"And when courage will help you go through it, wher e is that courage?\" C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 125 She touched her chest with her right hand and said \"Inside me.\" \"And whereabouts inside you is that courage?\" \"In my heart\" I continued asking Clean Language questions of her metaphor so that she could further develop her reso urce of courage. At the end of our time together she said, \"If you had told me when we started that a comment like \"going to the dentist\" could link so directly with my decision making, I wouldn't have believed it. In fact, you couldn't have told me, I had to experience it for my self.\" In the above example, I used five of the nine basic Clean Language questions [Note 4]: \"And ... is like what?\" anything else about ...?\" \"And what kind of ... is that ...?\" ... where is that ...?\" \"And whereabouts ...?\" Conversing within a student's metaphor is the symbol ic equivalent of physical matching and mirroring -- except it acknowledges the student at a higher level [Note 5]. Rather than honouring how they move in the world, y ou are honouring how they give meaning to their experience . Try it, and see for yourself! Walking in your landscape - EXERCISE with c lean cards (Sylvie de Clerk and Jenifer le Gandt) Client; Centre and go inside yourself, finding a neutral s pace from where you can suspend judgement and take risks. Coach; Put aside all your favourite theories of how to coa ch someone or what they should do and just be present. Suspend your world, and enter the world of your client. Be curious and open. Use only the words on the cards and the client's own words. Time; 20 - 45 minutes 1. Lay out the nature cards face up for the client to see them, and the Clean Words cards face down. 2. Ask the client; what would you like to have more of in your life or work right now? 3. Client answers question 4. Coach; and keeping this question in mind, choose of one the cards that you are attracted to... and now pick at random one of the clean words cards 5. Coach ask question; and what kind of (client's word ) is that (client's word)? Client answers. 6. Coach asks; and is there anything else about that ( client's word) a. These questions should be repeated 4 times as they provide a way for the client to get to know his/her symbols and metaphors before doing anything else. 7. The client then chooses at random from the ten clea n questions another question without looking at it, the coach asks the question and the client responds . These questions enable the client to discover his /her C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 126 inner landscape 8. Repeat, working through as many of the questions as you feel sufficient. You don't have to use all of them. You may need to link some or work with cluste rs of questions to move the client on. You may use them more than once. Just before the time is up ask the client; \"and wh en all of this ............................ what would you like to take with you as you go now?\" Notes: \u0001 A simile is just a metaphor that is labelled a meta phor -- by 'like' for example. \u0001 Lakoff and Johnson, Metaphors We Live By , p.158. \u0001 Notice the subtle shift in the f rom \"going to\" to \"going through\". \u0001 For the remaining four basic questions, see the oth er articles on www.cleanlanguage.co.uk about Symbolic Modelling and David Grove's Clean Language . Using Metaphors with Coaching Angela Dunbar DipM MCIM Why Metaphors? I first came across the powerful effect of metaphor s in coaching, when I was being coached. At the tim e I was an NLP Practitioner, working towards Master level with my own relationship issues. I thought it would be beneficial to get coached by someone with an NLP background. I went into the first session with my normal, logic al thinking patterns, and came out with a completel y different awareness of life, the universe and myself. I felt like Alice, having fallen down the rabbit hole and finding herself in Wonderland. I was in total awe of my own interna l metaphoric representations, and amazed at how dee ply I was affected by them. Since then, I have been on a journey; a treasure hu nt; a quest for more knowledge and understanding; a thirst for learning how other people use metaphors, and a love that fills my heart and radiates out a belief in t he magic inside us all. How metaphoric is that? Metaphors ar e a wonderful, descriptive tool for communication t hat can inspire others, but they are also much more. A metaphor can be viewed as simply one person's desc ription of something as 'like' something else. In Geo rge Lakoff and Mark Johnson's mind-expanding book, Metaphors We Live By , they say: \"The essence of metaphor is understanding and experiencing one kind of thing in terms of another.\" (page 5) When one acknowledges that most of our thought proc esses go beyond our conscious understanding, metaphors give a unique perspective into how someon e thinks, feels and experiences their world. Consid er this - the tangible world around us is made up of billions and billions of constantly moving atoms and lots o f empty C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 127 space in between. What we see is our own internal p erception -- colours, shapes, patterns. Isn't it all just a metaphor for the real thing? Perhaps metaphors are the closest we ever get to the 'true' experience of r eality! Carl Jung explains the importance of the unconsciou s mind in his book, Man and his Symbols, Chapter One . At some point of perception, we reach the edge of cert ainty beyond which conscious knowledge cannot pass. The unconscious, however, has taken note of all events and experiences, and will store this information in forms and symbols that may be somewhat obscure. Jung was conv inced that by analysing those symbols that appear through connecting with our unconscious, we have ac cess to a much wider and more comprehensive understanding of ourselves, our relationships and t he wider world around us. Our use of metaphors in everyday language is one su ch 'key' to deciphering our unconscious wisdom. Metaphors give the Coach Insight As a tool for coaching, the client's metaphors give you an insight into their unique perception of thei r situation and their goals. When the client tells you that the y can 'see light at the end of the tunnel', that is w hat they are experiencing. There is light for them, and they are in a tunnel. They will unconsciously 'know' much mor e about their situation from this metaphoric viewpoint. The y are very likely to know in which direction the li ght is, how far away it is, and where the light comes from. The y will know about the structure of the tunnel, how it feels and looks, how narrow the passage, and whereabouts they are in relation to the tunnel. And more -- this is where the power of metaphor com es in. The Client will know, on some level, what ne eds to happen for them to move towards the light and get o ut of the tunnel. The answer can come in pure metap hor, the person's 'real' perception of their tangible situa tion will shift as their perception of the metaphor evolves and alters. It is estimated that the average person uses a meta phor in everyday language once every twenty-five se conds. If you start to really listen to the language a person is using, metaphors begin to jump out at you. See what I mean, a jumping metaphor! I wonder how it jumps, and what kind of metaphor is one that can jump? Right now, I can picture tiddlywinks; bright, shiny tiddlywinks of d ifferent colours and sizes. And each tiddlywink, wh en you look closely, contains a miniature world ... and there I go, with my own metaphoric description again! Developing Metaphors Using Questions When you 'spot' a metaphor used by a client, what can you do to help them pay attention to it and unders tand it's importance? The language you use is 'clean' because you say nothi ng to contaminate the client's own perception. You m erely direct their attention towards the metaphor, and th e shapes and symbols that evolve from it. Penny Tompkins and James Lawley took David Grove's p rocess and developed it into a model for coaching, and other therapeutic uses. They call it \"Symbolic Mode lling\". It is a modelling process because, through the use of specific questions, you are attempting to 'replicate ' the client's experience in your own mind. The basic principles are congruent with any good co aching practice: Ask questions to find out what the client wants. Ask questions to find out what needs to happen for them to get there. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 128 If problems, barriers or blocks are identified, ask questions to find out what needs to happen to over come them. Sounds simple enough, and indeed it is, although th e questions themselves may sound a little unusual a nd unfamiliar to begin with. The questions need to be phrased in a very specific manner. There are just 12 basic questions to use, and that may sound limiting, but believe me you can easily g o to other worlds with them! Example Client Conversation With practice, the flow of questions can come very naturally. As an example, for the client who sees l ight at the end of the tunnel, you might ask: \"And when you see light at the end of the tunnel, w hat would you like to have happen?\" It might sound obvious to ask this, but we are all unique and some people may be afraid of the light, be happy to stay in the tunnel, or want to turn around and go t he other way. Never assume you know what the client may want. The client could answer with: \"I want to get out of the tunnel and be in the ligh t\" OK, it's a clear goal. Stay with it and find out mor e about the outcome. Let the client get a real sens e of how it would be to achieve their outcome. \"And when you get out of the tunnel, and you can be in the light, is there anything else about that li ght?\" They may tell you it's warm, or bright or whatever. They are developing their sense of what it would be like. \"And when you can be in the light, what kind of 'yo u' is that 'you'?\" The descriptions they give may highlight other meta phors or feelings, which you can continue to explor e. \"I feel relieved, like a great weight has been lift ed from my shoulders\" \"What kind of lifted is that lifted?\" or \"When you feel relieved, whereabouts do you feel re lieved?\" (all feelings have a location somewhere, within or for some, even just outside their bodies) or \"What kind of weight is that weight?\" C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 129 Once the outcome has been really explored, generall y you will be able to see/sense/notice that the cli ent is 'connected' to a different reality. Many clients will go into a light trance. It usually feels quite goo d to be 'wallowing' in one's own outcomes. You could then take it a step forward. \"And when you are relieved, and in the light, what happens next?\" If all is well, they may go to another level of goa l setting. It may be that their perception has alre ady shifted by simply exploring the outcome. For some, this could be where the problem (particularly if this is a 'hab it') re- surfaces. Another tunnel comes along, or something similar Then you might ask: \"What needs to happen for you to get out of the tun nel, and be in the light?\" And \"What else needs to happen?\" People tend to stick within the logic of their meta phors. They could walk or run out of the tunnel, bu t presumably something is stopping them, else they wouldn't still be in it. It would be 'unclean' to ask what stops th em, as you are assuming that there is a 'what' and a 'stop'. Let t hem tell you: \"And can you get out of the tunnel?\" \"No, because my feet are stuck to the ground.\" Ok, now you can explore the problem \"What kind of 'stuck' is that 'stuck'?\" \"Is there anything else about feet that are stuck?\" \"What kind of ground?\" \"Is there anything else about the tunnel when your feet are stuck?\" \"When your feet are stuck to the ground, and you ar e in the tunnel, then what happens?\" Like an explorer, you seek to learn all you can abo ut the terrain. The solution, will, inevitably be w ithin the problem somewhere. The Client is exploring the terr ain with you and will gradually perceive more and m ore as you continue asking questions. All the elements of the metaphor could potentially be resources, something to 'unlock' or 'shift' or 'move' the problem environment. Maybe the ground is wet and th e feet can loosen. Maybe they are stuck with glue, and the glue is so cold that is has become brittle. Maybe t here is something else in the tunnel that could cha nge the situation. Often, the 'scariest' part of the metaphor can turn into something benign and useful. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 130 Once a client 'shifts' their awareness, you can see t he release in the way they suddenly relax, or laugh , or cry. After the session, the Client may understand perfec tly what all the shapes and symbols and elements 'me ant' in the real world, but many won't have a clue on a cons cious level. The great thing is, it really doesn't m atter if they don't. The shift has happened subconsciously, the ch ange has already happened. One remarkable, but sometimes frustrating thing is that the Client simp ly 'forgets' they ever had a problem once it's gone -- you might not get any recognition for helping!

C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 131 Coaching Practically Introduction to Sandplay \u00a9Dr Sally Vanson Sandplay works through the use of active imaginatio n and creative symbolic play and is a practical, ex periential tool that creates a bridge from the conscious to th e unconscious, from the mental and spiritual to the physical and from the nonverbal to the verbal. The coach provides a safe and accepting environment in which the client can allow his/her inner voice to speak. Sandplay allows the client to access his/her innerm ost feelings and represent images as to what is hap pening in his/her outer world. By making concrete what the in ner voice is expressing, the client brings into ext ernal reality his/her own relationship with him/her self and allo ws unconscious material to be revealed. Sandplay takes many forms. The connection with the sand helps the client to ground and centre him/hers elf and often takes a person back to a childhood memory. So me clients use no objects at all; they touch the sa nd, make formations in the sand, and even write in the sand. Some use very few objects and some use many, some use the sand dry and some wet it with water. Some build the ir world very quickly, others reflect, some create a static world, others an ongoing and moving story. Some rep ort the experience as centring and tranquil, others experience deep emotions and reconnect with past pa in. There is no right way or outcome and the Coach must trust that each client will do what s/he needs to d o at that moment in time. The Coach must be aware as possible of his/her bias es, values, preferences and unresolved issues so as to be present with the client in his/her pace. Sandplay is an addition to other coaching tools and techniques. It works well with Clean Language, vis ualisation and imagery, body work and movement, art therapy an d hypnosis, outcome thinking, timelines etc. Further reading Sandplay - Silent Workshop of the Psyche, Kay Bradw ay and Barbara McCoard Sandplay - a psychotherapeutic approach to psyche, D.M. Kalff C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 132 Walking and Coaching - A Personal Introduction from Duncan Stoddart \u00a9Dr Sally Vanson I have often asked myself how I could bring togethe r the different facets of my life: outdoor personal development, coaching and facilitation, and creativ ity. Questions arose in my mind. What would it be like t o walk with a skilled listener in wild country? Wou ld walking through a landscape facilitate a creative and produ ctive thought process? What would the effect be of then spending time in solitude, perhaps by a lake, refle cting on what had emerged? I began to see the potential, recalling what someon e said to me several years ago: \"When I was on top of a mountain, or sitting before a great, sweeping panorama, I often gained a sense of perspective on my life which I struggled to achieve in other situations. Things became clearer. Being outdoors gave me the freedom and energy to really think abou t where I was in my life, who I was, and where I was going. It was a great way to reach important insights and dec isions\". This observation, from a senior manager wh o took part in an outdoor development event, expresses the essence of a new one-to-one programme in the outdo ors. This special course, set in Snowdonia National Park , is a two or three day event, usually taking place over a weekend. It combines one-to-one coaching and person al development using the outdoors. One-to-One Outdoors \u0001 Seeing far horizons, being in a vast, open space or watching a river run through a forest affects a pe rson's mood, feelings and thoughts. Their physical situati on, far removed from their daily routine, puts thei r mind in a different position from which to view the ir life, work or problems. Hence the ability to see the familiar in perspective is enhanced. \u0001 Walking, for many people, somehow frees up the mind , allowing a stream of thoughts, ideas and feelings to flow naturally. \u0001 Walking through a natural landscape can relax and e nergise us simultaneously. This, and the unfolding landscape, may stimulate a person to talk expansive ly and to cover new ground, as if they are 'travell ing in their mind'. \u0001 This coaching environment creates an informal, enjo yable and invigorating way to focus on one's development. For whom is this intervention intended? It is ideally suited for people who need to 'get awa y from it all' - away from work, home and family - to take stock, understand what they want, and where they're going. For some, it can work as a kind of annual or six-mo nthly work-life review. For others, it offers, through pr oblem solving, the chance to tackle major obstacles standing in their way. It can also address issues such as creat ivity, relationships, career, and motivation. Participants are strongly encouraged to design the event with the coach, choosing from a range of opti ons: C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 133 A Talk & Walk: using the time to talk and walk for several hours, or even most of each day (of a two day event). This allows the participant to work with issues in some depth. It also allows the discussion to run wi thout interruption. B Walk & Solo: as an appropriate contrast to one-to-one talking a nd walking, there is the opportunity to be entirely alone in the outdoors, either solo-walking , or staying within a chosen area for a few hours, or a half-day. The solo experience can act as powerful catalyst or period of reflection, given the rare occasions we are truly alone with ourselves. There is a further option of spending a night alone in a tent in the hills, with or without the coach- instructor nearby. C Walk, Solo & Personal Challenge: in addition to options A & B, there is the opportu nity to rock-climb, abseil, climb a mountain, or paddle in a Canadian canoe alo ng the stunning Mawddach Estuary. For some people the personal challenge can act as a constructive break from the one-on-one sessions. I t provides an opportunity to focus the mind on something new a nd different, to step out of our comfort-zone and l earn something more about ourselves. It can serve to rem ind us of what we are capable of. The event is extremely flexible and tailored accord ing the needs and requirements of the participant. Underlying Philosophy At core, I believe that people change and develop t hrough increased self-awareness. The coaching proce ss is, in my view, one way in which a person may gain a great er insight into themselves, their situation and wha t they want from their life. Horse Whispering and Innovation by Tudor Rickards , (Professor of Creativity, Manch ester Business School) Over the past few months, as I have discussed a non -traditional approach to leadership development wit h friends, colleagues, and other business professiona ls, I have been reminded of a long tradition of sus picion of educational theories. The ideas have received the inevitable reactions of enthusiasm, support, and ho stility that greet any innovation. By way of a little background, a few of us had beco me interested in an approach to dealing with horses known as 'join-up'. The Horse Whisperer is a Hollywood version of the story of Monty Rober ts, a real-life innovator in the practice of dealing with horses. The film brought Monty international attention for his approach, whi ch has since become a recognized - and in many cases, preferred - alternative to earlier approaches to working with horses. In complete contrast to the traditional ap proach of 'breaking' the horse into a condition of c ompliance, Monty's approach is founded on the recognition of a foal's instinctive desire to be part of the herd. From a study of such behaviours over a period of ma ny years, Monty Roberts developed a method that per mits him to win the trust of a horse within half an hour , so that even a previously unridden animal accepts saddling, and then a rider. Demonstrations have convinced tho usands of knowledgeable spectators that this new C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 134 approach works. After one such demonstration, the Queen herself endorsed the method, and has been encouraging its use for some years. TV appearances, books, and hundreds of personal dem onstrations have helped communicate the method. After meeting and talking with Monty - and especial ly after witnessing the work of his UK prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Kel ly Marks, we were struck by the idea that her development of the principles seem transferable to a trust-based l eadership style. We also met other business academics and co nsultants who are considering how such methods migh t be applied in organisational contexts. One in particu lar, Ian Lawson, saw a connection with recent resea rch conducted by The Industrial Society. Ian and his g roup found that the most powerful differentiator be tween successful and unsuccessful leaders was a trust-bas ed style. For some people, the dangers of drawing simple anal ogies between horse management and human leadership are all too clear. The obvious differences can bec ome a communication barrier. We are tired of being asked if we are teaching leaders to control people by breathing into their nostrils. We have also reassured train ees that we are not working on ways of 'breaking the spirit' of workers, or of belittling humans by comparing them with animals. Indeed, the work has sensitized me to the inappropriateness of a great deal of animal behavi ours as models for improved human action. Such methods are particularly dangerous and morally repugnant if translated to a handbook for human leadership. At Manchester Business School we have become harden ed to adverse reactions to novel ideas. The School is an institution with a long reputation for pioneering n ew and controversial ideas in management. In the 1 960s the newly founded school developed 'The Manchester Meth od', a way of learning through studying businesses a nd their challenges as living cases. So we were not d eterred by the thought that other Schools might hav e already rejected the whole idea of join-up as irrelevant an d academically trivial. More important was to sati sfy ourselves that we had a legitimate and promising approach to support executive education and development. The case against using the 'intelligent horsemanshi p' metaphor is that we risk reinforcing inappropriat e leadership metaphors of dominance and dehumanisatio n. A second line of attack is that the method is a version of the so-called theory-Y, or be-nice-to-the-worker s approach, which has its own problems in competiti ve business environments. The third objection is that the methods are not accepted yet by many in the ho rse breeding and managing establishment. We do not wish to make excessive claims for what we are doing, but the experiences of first trials hav e gone some way towards justifying our initial intuitions. Our view is that experiential learning leads to u nexpected discoveries. Learning cannot just be asserted in a classroom. And as they observe the way horses reac t to certain behaviours, participants think about how they thems elves or other employees react to different managem ent styles. The discussion afterwards often leads to on e about experiences of bullying and abusive behavio urs, a discussion that might not otherwise surface in a le adership course. We've found this helps the partici pants draw fine distinctions between being tough, being assert ive, being supportive and being soft. At a more immediate level, we see the need for care ful research studies into the behaviours of our exe cutives. The discussions and demonstrations suggested that t here were connections between the approach, and an on- going project on creative leadership at Manchester Business School. Could there be a link between the two bodies of work? If that turned out to be the case, then it would lead to an exciting new means of stu dying, and even teaching, good leadership practices. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 135 Working with a colleague experienced in creative le adership, we decided to carry out a piece of detect ive work, 'fingerprinting' the essential features of the two a pproaches of creative leadership and of 'join-up'. Strictly speaking, we were not here conducting a search for a shared identity between two samples of fingerprin ts, or in its more recent counterpart, between two sequences of amino acids. Rather, we are exploring to see wh ether the sense we make of horse whispering has adequate connections to the sense we make of creative leader ship. We took as our fingerprints the basic principles be hind the practices of creative leadership that we h ad been studying, and the principles behind the methods of join-up. This gave us a list of 22 attributes. We r ated each attribute as a clear match, or a possible match, af ter a period of discussion. We were also prepared to record mismatches. We found no mismatches. Nine of the att ributes give clear matches. Five additional attrib utes were considered promising or possible matches. We found no mismatches. The absolute number of matches is perhaps misleading, as the items on the list are no t independent. We subsequently asked two groups of executives (one from the UK, and the other from a set of visiting Future Leaders of Africa, including two MPs) to help in ou r fingerprinting. They extended the list of attribu tes, once again confirming the general matching. They even s uggested carrying out the 'negative matching' - to s how that traditional horse-breaking did not match with creative leadership. The results were even more straightforward. Traditional horse-breaking (at le ast as we understood it) is almost completely unmat ched with creative leadership. The next steps will be to explore more deeply the p rinciples of join-up to find out how they can apply to creative leadership. For example, 'join-up' applies as the s implest kind of 'leader-follower' transaction, the ' one-to- one'. High-flying corporate executives are more int erested in advice whereby they can develop skills i n 'one-to- many' relationships in teams or even across entire o rganisations. So this particular detective story i s far from over. Tudor Rickards has been associated with the Manchester Business School since 1972 and has published widely on innovation and creativity. Professor Rickards works closely with various international organisations i n the development of innovative skills. He has won intern ational awards for his teaching and educational wor k in his specialist areas, and was Alex Osborn visiting prof essor at the State University of New York, Buffalo from 1987-1988. In 1999 twelfth book Creativity and the Management of Change was published by Gower Press. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 136 Archetypes of change; \u00a9 Dr Sally Vanson Archetypes provide the deep structure for human mot ivation and meaning. When we encounter them in art, literature, sacred texts, advertising\u2014or in individ uals or groups\u2014they evoke deep feeling within us. T hese imprints, which are hardwired in our psyches, were projected outward by the ancients onto images of gods and god desses. Plato disconnected these from religion, seeing them in philosophical terms as \"elemental forms.\" Twent ieth- century psychiatrist C.G. An archetype (pronounced / rk ta p/) is an original model of a person, ideal example , or a prototype upon which others are copied, patterned, or emulated; a symbol universally recognized by all. In psychology , an archetype is a model of a person, personality, or b ehaviour. In philosophy, archetypes since Plato at least, ref er to ideal forms of the perceived or sensible thin gs or types. In the analysis of personality, the term archetype is often broadly used to refer to \u0001 a stereotype\u2014personality type observed multiple tim es, especially an oversimplification of such a type ; or \u0001 an epitome\u2014personality type exemplified, especially the \"greatest\" such example. \u0001 a literary term to express details. Archetype refers to a generic version of a personal ity. In this sense \"mother figure\" may be considere d an archetype and may be identified in various characte rs with otherwise distinct (non-generic) personalit ies. Archetypes are likewise supposed to have been prese nt in folklore and literature for thousands of year s, including prehistoric artwork. The use of archetype s to illuminate personality and literature was adva nced by Carl Jung early in the 20th century, who suggested the existence of universal contentless forms that c hannel experiences and emotions, resulting in recognizable and typical patterns of behaviour with certain pro bable outcomes. Archetypes are cited as important to both ancient mythology and modern narratives, as argued by Joseph Campbell in works such as The Hero With a Thousand Faces. Building upon Jung's work, Carol S. Pearson has crea ted a system of 12 archetypes that put a human face on the meaning structures that are correlated with suc cess and fulfilment today. Studying Pearson's archet ypes can help you: Increase communication between your conscious and u nconscious minds Trigger a greater sense of meaning and fulfilment i n your life Inspire and motivate others Cope more effectively with difficult people Have greater flexibility to respond to the challeng es of life C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 137 Be more effective within your family, workplace, an d community context. They can also help schools, businesses and organiza tions: Create a healthy and balanced organizational cultur e Create a \"brand\" identity aligned with the actual v alues and strengths of the organization and its pro ducts Inspire customer and employee loyalty Make a positive contribution to the world. The 12 Pearson archetypes are grouped in two differ ent ways--the first system emphasizing the journey of development for individuals, groups, and organizati ons; the second focusing on achieving balance withi n fundamental motivational categories (stability, bel onging, achievement, and learning/self-actualizatio n). In different books, the names used to describe the arc hetypes vary somewhat, to highlight the aspect of t he archetype most relevant to the subject at hand. The following table integrates the two ways of groupin g the archetypes. Brief descriptions of the 12 archetypes follow in \" the journey\" order. Many thanks to Dorothy Hewerdine for sharing her playful renderings of the archetypes. Preparation: Archetypes of the Family The archetypes of preparation can be seen as connecting with the inner child (Innocent and Orphan) and the inner parent (Caregiver as nurturing pare nt; Warrior as protecting parent). These four archetypes tend to be active in young peop le and/or organizations that are new or that employ or serve people who are at the prepa ration level of development. Together, these archetypes provide an inner \"family\" that makes the individual less dependent upon the health of the family of origin. When all four ar e awakened in an individual or organization, he/she/it generally is able to move on to The Journey. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 138 THE INNOCENT Every era has myths of a golden age or of a promise d land where life has been or will be perfect. The promise of the Innocent is that life need not b e hard. Within each of us, the Innocent is the spontaneous, trusting child that, while a bit depen dent, has the optimism to take the journey. THE REGULAR GUY/GAL - THE ORPHAN The Regular Guy/Gal/Orphan understands that everyon e matters, just as they are. Down-home and unpretentious, it reveals a deep structure infl uenced by the wounded or orphaned child that expects very little from life, but that teaches us with empathy, realism, and street smarts. THE WARRIOR/HERO When everything seems lost, the Warrior/Hero rides over the hill and saves the day. Tough and courageous, this archetype helps us set and achieve goals, overcome obstacles, and persist in difficult times, although it also tends to see othe rs as enemies and to think in either/or terms. THE CAREGIVER/ALTRUIST The Caregiver is an altruist, moved by compassion, generosity, and selflessness to help others. Although prone to martyrdom and enabling behaviours , the inner Caregiver/Altruist helps us raise our children, aid those in need, and build st ructures to sustain life and health. The Journey: Archetypes of Transformation and Chang e These archetypes of metamorphosis personify the pro cess of seeking out new options; tearing down what no longer serves; committing to peopl e, values, and activities; and creating new forms. They are expressed most often in i ndividuals (adolescence, midlife, retirement, etc.) and organizations in times of transitio n, and all of them want to maximize personal freedom and fulfilment. When all four are awak ened within individuals or organizations, they become ready for The Return. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 139 THE EXPLORER/SEEKER/WANDERER The Explorer/Seeker/Wanderer leaves the known to di scover and explore the unknown. This inner rugged individual braves loneliness and isola tion to seek out new paths. Often oppositional, this iconoclastic archetype helps us discover our uniqueness, our perspectives, and our callings. THE OUTLAW/DESTROYER The Outlaw/Destroyer embodies repressed rage about structures that no longer serve life even when these structures still are supported by societ y or by our conscious choices. Although this archetype can be ruthless, it weeds the garden in w ays that allow for new growth. THE LOVER The Lover archetype governs all kinds of love\u2014from parental love, to friendship, to spiritual love\u2014but we know it best in romance. Although it ca n bring all sorts of heartache and drama, it helps us experience pleasure, achieve intimacy, mak e commitments, and follow our bliss. THE CREATOR The Creator archetype fosters all imaginative endea vours, from the highest art to the smallest innovation in lifestyle or work. Adverse to stasis, it can cause us to overload our lives with constant new projects; yet, properly channelled, it helps us express ourselves in beautiful ways. The Return: Archetypes of the Royal Court When the archetypes of the return are activated, peop le and organizations know who they are at a deeper level than they once did. Now they ar e motivated to seek out ways to use their gifts and perspectives to make a difference in the world. They no longer yearn to be taken care of, and they do not blame others or find exc uses. Rather, they live and work in ways that express their values, commitments, and tale nts in a socially responsible manner. These archetypes generally are awakened and in balance w ithin psychologically mature individuals and organizations able not only to benefit fro m the rights of living in a free C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 140 socie ty, but also to undertake the responsibilities of act ive, engaged citizenship. THE RULER The Ruler archetype inspires us to take responsibil ity for our own lives, in our fields of endeavour, and in the society at large. If he/she o vercomes the temptation to dominate others, the developed Ruler creates environments that invit e in the gifts and perspectives of all concerned. THE MAGICIAN The Magician archetype searches out the fundamental laws of science and/or metaphysics to understand how to transform situations, influence p eople, and make visions into realities. If the Magician can overcome the temptation to use power m anipulatively, it galvanizes energies for good. THE SAGE The Sage archetype seeks the truths that will set u s free. Especially if the Sage overcomes the temptation of dogma, it can help us become wise, to see the world and ourselves objectively, and to course-correct based on objective analyses o f the results of our actions and choices. THE JESTER The Jester archetype urges us to enjoy the process of our lives. Although the Jester can be prone to laziness and dissipation, the positive Jester in vites us all out to play--showing us how to turn our work, our interactions with others, and even th e most mundane tasks into FUN. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 141 Archetypes Exercise 1. Working in pairs of two, one person coaches the oth er through the archetypes. 2. Allow the coachee to lay the archetypes out on the floor however they like with the dragon at the cent re, a safe resting space and to choose an issue to be c oached on. 3. The Dragon represents this issue or problem and the coachee will start by standing on this card. 4. The coachee will then move through each of the arch etypes as they like and the coach will talk them through the sights they are seeing, thoughts they are thinking and the ways they are feeling when standing on each archetype. The coachee is welcome to step out of the archetypes at any point and to return to the resting place to reassess. 5. It is important that the coachee returns to the res ting place before moving to the next archetype. 6. The last archetype the coachee should visit is the sorcerer from where they can see all the behaviours of the different archetypes and the impacts of these o n their dragon. 7. Once the coachee has collected all the learning and insights from the archetypes s/he should return to the dragon and apply them to to initial topic/ goal . C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 142 Refective Learning Diary Learning to be a coach is not a finite state of pro fessional development. Coaching is an ever-evolving learning experience, where reflection and supervision on you r practice are essential. This course provides you with the foundations of coaching; it takes years of experien ce and further development to become expert in it. Keeping a reflective diary is essential for your development in any profession. Evaluating your work and taking those evaluations in to supervision will ensure that as a coach you remain true to the ICF, EMCC and AC code of ethics, ensures you retain professional standards and enabl es more transformational work with your clients.

Materials You may print the module and create your own working file. This will allow you to make notes accordingly. Other Resources Additional reading lists are given along with each module. Additional reading is required to understand the breadth and depth of the field of coaching. Additional resources may be found is Management? There are a variety of views about this term. Tradi tionally, the term \"management\" refers to four key activities. 1) Planning, including identifying goals, objectives, methods, r esources needed to carry out methods, responsibilit ies and dates for completion of tasks. 2) Organising resources to achieve the goals in an optimum fashion. 3) Leading, including, to set direction for the organisation, g roups and individuals and also influence people to follow that direction. 4) Controlling, or coordinating, the organisation's systems, processes and structure s to effectively and efficiently reach goals and ob jectives. This includes ongoing collection of feedback, and monito ring and adjustment of systems, processes and struc tures accordingly. What is Coaching? ICF defines coaching as partnering with clients in a thought-provoking and creative process that inspires them to maximize their personal and profes sional potential, which is particularly important i n today's uncertain and complex environment. The Association for Coaching add categories; Personal/Life Coaching \"A collaborative solution-focused, results-orientat ed and systematic process in which the coach facili tates the enhancement of work performance, life experience, s elf-directed learning and personal growth of the co achee.\" Executive Coaching \"As for personal coaching, but it is specifically f ocused at senior management level where there is an expectation for the coach to feel as comfortable exploring busi ness related topics, as personal development topics with the client in order to improve their personal performan ce.\" Corporate/Business Coaching \"As for personal coaching, but the specific remit o f a corporate coach is to focus on supporting an em ployee, C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 164 either as an individual, as part of a team and/or o rganization to achieve improved business performanc e and operational effectiveness\" Speciality/Niche Coaching \"As for personal coaching, but the coach is expert in addressing one particular aspect of a person's l ife e.g. stress, career, or the coach is focused on enhancing a part icular section of the population e.g. doctors, yout hs.\" Group Coaching \"As for personal coaching, but the coach is working with a number or individuals either to achieve a c ommon goal within the group, or create an environment where in dividuals can co-coach each other.\" What is Therapy? \"Psychotherapy is the provision by qualified practi tioners of a formal and professional relationship w ithin which patients/clients can profitably explore difficult a nd often painful emotions and experiences. These m ay include feelings of anxiety, depression, trauma or perhaps the loss of meaning of one's life. It is a process which seeks to help the person gain an increased capacity for choi ce through which the individual becomes more autono mous and self determined.\" (UKCP) \"(Counselling) are services designed to help people who wish to make changes in their lives by offerin g 'talking treatment'. However, specific advice is not given\" BACP) \"Family therapists help family members find constru ctive ways to help each other. They work in ways t hat acknowledge the contexts of people's families and o ther relationships, sharing and respecting individu als' different perspectives, beliefs, views and states, and explor ing possible ways forward'. (Association for Family Therapy) What is Mentoring? The practice of mentoring seems to have far off ori gins: in ancient Greece young males usually lived w ith more mature men at their side: in this way they could le arn values. Usually the older men were friends or r elatives of the young man's father (Di Giusti, Taranto, 2000). The same principles as those used in modern mentori ng, as Murray states (2001), can be traced to the corporat ions of arts and professions dating back to medieva l times: in such associations, which in those days dominated th e commercial world, it was the custom to take on yo ung apprentices who lived and worked with their master, the owner of the workshop. They learned skills and abilities thus becoming mastercraftsmen themselves capable of taking over the business. Through this system, ski lls were handed down from one generation to another without the risk of them deserting to rival associations. W ith the industrial revolution which brought about the stand ardization of work, production and training, this t ype of relationship fell into disuse but the basic ethics survived: in this period an informal type of relati onship between supervisors and gifted workers can be traced in fac tories: this enabled them to reach a better positio n (Rawlings, 2002). Since the 1970s mentoring has spread in the United States of America mainly in training contexts C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 165 (Parsloe, 2000). In the same years, it began to spr ead in an organizational sense as well. Odiorne (19 85) described it as \"an innovation in American management\". In 19 80s, mentoring, with the initiative of Matilda Raff a Cuomo, wife of the former Governor of the State of New Yor k, Mario Cuomo , started to be used in a social environment to combat school drop outs, and then developing in the fight against social privations. Since the 1980 s mentoring has begun to extend in the United Kingdom where it is widely used in the working and trainin g environment: in the latter, the strategy has many applications in t raining students for teaching roles (Furlong, Mayna rd, 1995). It is present in countries such as France , Spain , Greece and Italy since the 1990s (Felice, Tagliavini, 2003). In France, mentoring is called \"Parrainage\"; exampl es of its use can be found in the environment of th e integration of disadvantaged persons in the profess ions and in activities regarding students of school s of all levels. In Spain, mentoring is employed to facilitate the e ntry into the job market of those who have difficul ty in finding jobs and as an instrument for the promotion of equa l opportunities for men and women. In Greece, examp les of mentoring activities can be found for the preventio n of hardships which are experienced mostly by chil dren. In Italy, the first kind of mentoring rose up in th e business sector with the introduction of law n\u00b0 4 4/86: the practice has wide applications today as a support s trategy for young and female enterprise. The use of mentoring in social and scholastic environments in Italy is o wed to Associazione Mentoring USA/Italia Onlus whic h, since 1997, has spread the strategy as a means to fight s chool dispersion. \"Mentoring is to support and encourage people to ma nage their own learning in order that they may maxi mise their potential, develop their skills, improve thei r performance and become the person they want to be .\" Eric Parsloe, the Oxford School of Coaching & Mentoring Mentoring is a powerful personal development and em powerment tool. It is an effective way of helping people to progress in their careers and is becoming increasin g popular as its potential is realised. It is a par tnership between two people (mentor and mentee) normally working in a similar field or sharing similar experiences. It is a helpful relationship based upon mutual trust and respect. Mentoring has been defined in many different ways b ut it's basically a system of semi-structured guida nce whereby one person shares their knowledge, skills a nd experience to assist others to progress in their own lives and careers. Mentors need to be readily accessible and prepared to offer help as the need arises \u2014 wit hin agreed boundaries. Mentoring is a powerful form of learning alliance b etween people outside the reporting line. The mento r helps the mentee with the quality of thinking about their sel f-development and career management; and in doing s o, learns him/herself. While the mentor is usually more senio r than the mentee, this is not always the case: pee r mentoring and reverse mentoring, where the more junior person brings experience the more senior does not have, a re increasingly common. The mentor may take many roles : being a sounding board, helping build networks, sometimes simply being there to listen. Most mentor ing around the world is relatively non-directive an d learner centred; however, some forms, particularly in North America may be more hands-on and place more emphas is on the mentor using their authority on behalf of the m entee (usually called a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in these circumstan ces). Effective developmental mentoring has remarkable po sitive effects on employee retention and talent management. The core theme for both coaching and me ntoring is learning dialogue - this helps individua ls, teams and organisations become more effective through lea rning conversations . (Clutterbuck) C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 166 Great uses for mentoring Mentoring systems can be designed to suit a number of different purposes. The detailed design of the system will be dependent on the purpose to be achie ved. The following are possible purposes for mentoring systems. Problem based to help individuals or teams solve organizational p roblems. Qualification based as part of the process of helping individuals to ga in professional or vocational qualifications. Induction based to help a new or newly-promoted member of staff to more quickly achieve effective performer standards. Project based in which individuals or groups are required to tack le work-based projects Promotion based whereby selected staff are mentored as part of the grooming for promotion process. Self-development based for people who are pursuing a programme of self-de velopment which, without a mentor, could be very lonely and worrying . Training based where, as part of the follow-up to formal training, participants are matched with a mentor to help them apply the new knowledge or skil ls. Development based systems aim to secure long-term development of staf f by using long-term and multi-purpose mentoring. Diversity mentoring to help people in minority groups to have the conf idence to grow their careers rather than feeling intimidated or sidelined. Leadership mentoring is often used where technical experts take over le adership or management roles with responsibility for leading teams Peer mentoring where groups of people develop and challenge each other as well as sharing a broad range of experiences C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 167 What is the role of the mentor? \u0001 The mentor's role is multi-faceted and requires good levels of skill and self-awareness . \u0001 The mentor needs to be able to adapt his or her style and behaviour to suit eac h mentee and each situation. \u0001 The mentor's role is to guide the mentee to look at a wide variety of options and consider alternative courses of action in order to solve problems for themselves, rath er than t o give them answers or provide solutions. \u0001 For most mentoring relationships, the main objective is for the mentee to gain new personal skills, experiences and knowledge that will lead to new insights, a gre ater vision and new att itudes and behaviour. These, in turn, lead to better personal and organisation p erform ance. \u0001 The role of the mentor is to release and develop the mentee's own resourcefulness . \u0001 It is not the place of a mentor to tell the mentee wha t they should do. Only the mentee can decide what goals or actions they will implement - after a ll, the mentee is the one who will live with the results. This does not mean the mentor should not offer useful i nformation, but that it is up to the mentee to decide whether to use it. So mentoring do es not mean giving advice. Giving advice implies the mentor knows best, and it also leads to dependency - the opp osite of what the mentor is trying to achieve. Mentoring in summ ary Mentoring is: a one-to-one relationship over a period of time between a less experienced person (mentee ) and an established organisation person (mentor), which provides consistent support, guidance and practical help a process by which an experienced organisation person shares their personal skills, knowledge and experience with another person a means of enabling a less experienced person to gain the necessary skills, k nowledge and confidence to be able to perform at a higher level an opportunity for a less experienced person to gain access to impartial, non judgmental guidance and supp ort a process of working together to achieve predetermined goals and objectives a two-way process through which both parties deriv e satisfaction from the progress, and success is attained through working together. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 168 6 Interventios of Mentoring Cathartic Letting off steam, release tension, abreaction, fru strations, what do you really want to say to your c lient? We are only human, having a space for catharsis is importa nt for your emotional health. Supportive Receiving feedback that is approving, validating an d confirming about your coaching practice. It is im portant to know where things are positive and going well. Catalytic Using a coaching style of feedback to promote refle ctive thinking, problem solving and self-directed l earning to enable the mentee to take responsibility for their coaching and the business elements of their work Prescriptive Here the mentor is more directive, giving advice an d tasking the mentee to develop certain skills, mod es of practice, reflective models and behaviours. Here th e supervisor brings greater experience to the discu ssion and can guide the coach in a positive direction. Informative Receiving information from your mentor can help you save time in learning new skills, updating your kn owledge of current practice and trends. The mentor may dire ct, inform and instruct the coach towards reading m aterial, videos, training, blogs etc that may be useful Confrontative The mentor is more direct and challenging. This is positive and may include noticing blind spots such as unhelpful parallel process, transactional ego state issues, n egative transference issues, un-balanced work/life of the mentee, repetitive use of certain interventions etc C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 169 Mentors Training Needs Asking your partner to discuss a specific teacher, organisation or context, use the grid below to carr y out an initial assessment of your partner as a Mentor, mark on the grid where you think their level of ability would lie. You may need to ask some prompting questions. Use the following ind icators. Mentor Training 1: Not yet OK (or do not know) 2: Needs some work or development 3: OK Attitudes desire to help others enthusiastic, positive, flexible accessible, approachable volunteer open, self critical Othr attitude Skills Giving feedback Listening Questioning Coaching Counselling Monitoring Prioritising Other skills?

Campbell searched for the connections in the myt hs and stories of change that cross cultural boundaries. He discovered that certain the mes are repeated in many cultures and appear to be deeper threads connecting all of humanity, reflecting the overall path that we take form birth to death regar dless of our individual circumstances. Just as we are born the s ame and die the same, there are other deep patterns held in the collective memory of our species. https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=i&r ct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved =0ahUKEwjwpfujlv7RAhUGQBoKHa6wCH4QjRwIBw&url=ht the commonalities of our overall life path in terms of the steps of the \"Hero's Jou rney\" - the sequence of events that seem to be shared in the ep ic myths of every culture. According to Campbell, these steps include: Ordinary World - Life is as it is. Hearing a calling that relates to our identity, life purpose or miss ion. We can choose to either accept or ignore the calling. Refusing the calling leads us to confront a boundary or threshold in ou r existing abilities or map of the world. Finding a Mentor or guardian is something that often comes naturall y from having the courage to cross a threshold. (As it has been said, \"When the student is ready, the teacher appears.\") Crossing a threshold propels us into some new life \"territory\" outside of our current comfort zone; a territory that forces us to grow and evolve, and requires us to find support and guidance. Facing a challenge (or \"demon\") is also a natural result of crossing a threshold. \"Demons\" are not necessarily evil or bad; they are simply a type of \"energy\" or \"powe r\" that we need to learn to contend with or accept. Often, they are simply a reflection of one of our own inne r fears and shadows. Our tests, enemies and allies. Approach the innermost cave - inward reflection and bridges to cross in our in ner worlds Transforming the \"demon \" into a resource or advisor is typically accomplish ed by either: a) Developing a special skill . b) Discovering a special resource or tool . Completing the task (the ordeal and reward) for which one has been ca lled, and finding the way to fulfil the calling is ultimately achieved by creating a new map of the world that incorporates the growth and discoveries brought about by the journey. Finding the way home as a transformed person, and sharing with others t he knowledge and experience gained as a result of the journey. The road back home - the start of the journey back home having comple ted the task The resurrection - acknlwledgement of how you aare transfermed and what new knowledge or resources you are taking home The return with the Elixer - the new information that leaves you for ever tr ansformed. While the hero's journey is clearly a metaphor, it captures a good deal of the reality facing leaders and managers as they seek to build a path to a successful future and contend with the uncertainties of change. The notion of a \"calling,\" for instance, clearly symbolizes the vis ion and mission that the leader and his or her team or company is pursuing. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 172 The \"threshold\" represents the unknown and uncertai n elements that we must confront in order to bring the vision into action. The symbol of the \"demon\" reflects the challenges o f upheaval, competition, internal politics and othe r obstacles and crises, which emerge from circumstances beyond our control. Our resources are the values, behaviou ral skills and business practices we are able to put into acti on in order to deal with complexity, uncertainty an d resistance. This is the area where the leader himself or hersel f must grow in order develop the flexibility and in creased requisite variety necessary to successfully navigat e the new territory and overcome the obstacles whic h arise along the way. \"Guardians\" are the sponsors and relationships we d evelop that support us to build skills, believe in ourselves and stay focused on our objectives. Mapping the Hero's Journey While Campbell's description of the journey begins with hearing and accepting a \"calling,\" our real li fe experiences often call us to the hero's journey by presenting us with the challenge first. The many h eroes who emerged as a result of the September 11 terrorist a ttacks, for instance, were thrown into their journe y by a direct confrontation with the \"Demon'.\" They had to face their threshold and recognize their calling within the crisis they were facing. This is also frequently the case with business leaders. It is a crisis, which prese nts the calling. In fact, the very act of exerting leadership is truly a type of hero's journey in and of itself. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 173 To explore and prepare yourself for some the key as pects of your own hero's journey, pick a project or initiative that you are currently involved in or planning and consider the following questions: 1. What is the 'Demon' (challenge) you (and your te am) must face? 2. What is your 'threshold'? What is the unknown te rritory outside of your comfort zone into which you must step? 3. What are you being 'called' to do or become? 4. What resources do you have and which do you need to develop more fully in order to face the challen ge, cross your threshold and accomplish your calling? 5. Who are (will be) your guardians for those resou rces?

It is generally said to include three skills: 1. Emotional awareness, including the ability to id entify your own emotions and those of others; 2. The ability to harness emotions and apply them t o tasks like thinking and problems solving; 3. The ability to manage emotions, including the ab ility to regulate your own emotions, and the abilit y to cheer up or calm down another person.

Founded by the eminent psychologist Eric Berne it i s based on sound and well researched understanding of what makes us tick. Why use this particular model? It is a simple (not simplistic) intuitive model, th at can be quickly understood It focuses on behaviours It gives tools for changing some of our less useful behaviours and understanding our impact on others It gives us a useful tool in the coaching context Its beauty is its simplicity and it does cover some deep ground. Philosophy of Transactional Analysis (T.A.) T.A. practice is founded on a set of philosophical views about people and the goals of change and can be summed up as; 1. People are OK. 2. Everyone has the the capacity to think. 3. People decide their own destiny and these decisions can be changed. People are OK Everyone has worth, value and dignity. There is a s tatement of essence rather than behaviour. At times we may value what people do but we accept and value what p eople are. In the coaching relationship this implie s that you and your client are on equal footing and this assum ption comes from the work of Carl Rogers on 'uncond itional positive regard' and person-centred counselling. Wh at is sometimes forgotten is to have unconditional positive regard for ourselves! Everyone has the capacity to think Everyone except the severely brain damaged has the capacity to think. Therefore each person has the ca pacity to decide what s/he wants from life and to carry the u ltimate responsibility of living with the consequen ces of those decisions. Decisional Model C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 179 Each person decides their own behaviour, thoughts, feelings and ultimately their own destiny. No one c an be made to act, think or feel in particular ways by ot her people or by the environment except by physical coercion. This model is at the root of T.A.s emphasis on pers onal responsibility for feeling, thought and behavi our and for the psychopathology in T.A. A young child is viewed as deciding his/her responses to environmental pre ssures, which then has implications for the process of pers onal change in adult life. Dysfunctional patterns w ere originally decided upon rather than being forced by the indivi dual and so they can be changed by making new decis ions. The belief here is that people can change and that change can be lasting and genuine. Change is about gaining insight into old patterns of behaviour and anyone c an actively decide to replace these patterns (habit s) with new ways of thinking, behaving, feeling and being that are appropriate to being an adult. Communication T.A. stresses the need to work in a forward moving direction, working with the client in partnership u sing professional skills to achieve the client's goal. I t is important to stay aware of the 'process' as we ll as the 'content'. Eric Berne urged his practitioners to ' think Martian'. Picture a little green man who has never been conditioned to accept what human communication should mean. He simple observes the communication and the behaviours which follow and then deduces what the c ommunication does mean. The coach needs to become the Martian and work with the content of the conversati on without attaching preconceptions. Children do th is naturally and as we grow up we lose this skill. We also need to remember that when people communica te they often convey more than one message at a tim e and so we have the social level of communication and the psychological level . Social-level and psychological-level messages (Ref; Transactional analysis in action, Ian Stewart , Sage Publications) \u0001 The social level message is the meaning of the comm unication as it is conventionally understood in the social circle of the people concerned. \u0001 The psychological message is the communication's re al meaning and is picked up by intuitive judgement and followed up by asking the speaker if this is ac curate. \u0001 Often the social message is conveyed in the literal meaning of the words and the psychological message by the non-verbals. \u0001 If the social and psychological messages are the sa me the client is said to be congruent. \u0001 If the two are different the client is said to be i ncongruent and the psychological message is said to be ulterior . \u0001 The behavioural outcome of any message is determine d at the psychological level and not the social lev el. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 180 The ego-state model The ego-state model focuses on three ways that peop le have of expressing personality and each is defin ed by a distinct and observable set of behaviours, which ar e accompanied by sets of thoughts and feelings that typify the ego-state. The thoughts and feelings are not obser vable but can be checked through questioning. An eg o-state is \"a consistent pattern of feelings and experience di rectly related to a corresponding consistent patter n of behaviour\" (Berne,1966) We use the terms Parent, Adult and Child to designa te the three distinct sets of behaviours, thoughts and feelings. \u0001 In Parent , a person is using ways of thinking, feeling and b ehaving that s/he has uncritically copied from their parents and parent figures in the past. This is a borrowed ego-state. \u0001 In Adult, the person is thinking, feeling and reacting in wa ys which are direct responses to the present - dealing objectively with both content and process. \u0001 In Child , the person is replaying thoughts, feelings and be haviours from childhood (past) and Berne suggested this was an archaic ego-state serving lit tle purpose in the present time. It is useful to understand these so as to know how to work with your clients and their responses, to u nderstand your own response to your client, and to enable bot h you and your client to choose which responses you find it valuable to make.

(Berne,1972; St einer, 1974; Stewart & Joines, 1987). This is constructed in the form of a drama with a beginning, middle and end w ith closing of the script known as the script payoff. Adults wi ll play out parts of their infant life plan and are said to be in script when doing this. In simple terms these scripts inform our responses to given situations (often called strategies) and w e become expert at choosing and running these responses over time. We do this to get our needs met and to get p ositive or negative strokes depending on whether we have a 'towards' or 'away f rom' preference filter. Having achieved the strokes we seek, we consider ou r responses and then anchor our strategies for achi evement so that when in similar situations we can run the s ame script to achieve similar responses (patterning ). The Racket System Richard Erskine and Marilyn Zalcman (1979) develope d The Racket System to show how life scripts are maintained, This illustrates the way that a person enters a closed, self-perpetuating world of beliefs , actions and perceptions and they use the word 'racket' to indic ate this repetitive pattern. The Racket System (R.Erskine) Script Beliefs Script Displays Reinforcing Experiences 1. Beliefs about Self 1. Observable behaviours 1. Current 2. Beliefs about Others 2. Reported internal Experiences 2. Old Memories 3. Beliefs about Quality of life 3. Fantasies Provide evidence and justification Needs and Feelings repressed at the time of Script Conclusions, which lead to the formulation of beliefs about self , others and the world. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 189 Thinking about how people 'get stuck'. How do people get stuck? Human beings are natural q uantitative and longitudinal researchers. In the left hand column above we see that we all de velop beliefs about ourselves, other people and the world. Often these beliefs are not based on here and now r eality. They can be based on childhood or earlier e xperiences, where emotional, psychological and physical needs d id not get met. Once these beliefs are set; our abi lity to be flexible in our problem solving and our ability to relate to others is going to be inhibited. Once of course we have these beliefs, we will conso lidate those beliefs, by collecting evidence that w ill support these beliefs. This can be in the form of reinforci ng events and memories (right hand column) or they can be in the form or internal experiences, fantasies and mem ories or behaviours (middle column) that mean that the expected outcomes are more likely to happen. Thus, circumstances can lead people to reach conclu sions that become beliefs. They will then use event s, experiences and fantasies to reinforce those belief s. Experience has shown that working in any part of th is system will help to create change for people. Th us the power of coaching can be that we help them to co-cr eate a helpful relationship that challenges long he ld beliefs, or help them to design actions that challenge these beliefs. In fact coaching can enter any part of th is system as long as the client stays in the here and now and ca n be accessed through the adult ego state. In my ex perience this can be done mainly by helping clients to creat e actions, create the best relationship possible, a nd have a structured discussion about the beliefs. In therapy we can go from anywhere in the system th at we can access through any ego state. There are s everal areas that characterize the difference between Coac hing and Therapy. Working with the here and now and the future. Whils t therapy will often do this, coaching is designed to deal with the present and future. Working with or through the adult ego state. Coachi ng is more suited to working at this level. The designing of a useful alliance and of goals and actions is central to coaching. These elements are also important in therapy, but other factors and theorie s are also at play. These include a recognition and understanding or the past hurts and strategies, dif ferent developmental stages, and an ability to work with these different developmental ages. Any behaviour or thought process that seems unrelat ed to the here and now reality, whether it be over emotional, understated, or a drastic change in beha viour, can be used as a prompt to consider referrin g to another professional. Racket or Script Beliefs / Imposter Syndrome I mustn't exist I mustn't be me I mustn't be a chil d I mustn't grow up I mustn't make it I mustn't do an ything I mustn't be important I mustn't belong I mustn't b e close I mustn't be well/ sane I mustn't think I mustn't f eel C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 190 Robert and Mary Golding developed these in 1976,197 9 as themes that children receive from parental beh aviour and carry into adulthood. Pauline Clance (1978. 198 5) developed this theme calling it 'Imposter Syndro me' and researched into how it manifested in the workplace. \"The Impostor Syndrome\" , sometimes called Impostor Phenomenon or Fraud Syndrome , is a syndrome where sufferers are unable to internalize their accomplis hments. It is not an officially recognized psychological disorder but has been the subject of numerous books and art icles by psychologists and educators. Regardless of what level of success they may have a chieved in their chosen field of work or study or w hat external proof they may have of their competence, those with the syndrome remain convinced internally they do n ot deserve the success they have achieved and are actu ally frauds. Proof of success is dismissed as luck, timing, or as a result of deceiving others into thinking they wer e more intelligent and competent than they believe themselves to be. _\"I'm not good enough, I was lucky to be pro moted, I was in the right place at the right time, I'll get found out....\" This syndrome was thought to be particularly common among women who are successful in their given careers , but has since been shown to occur for an equal numb er of men and up to 75% of professionals in the Wes tern world. Coaches may find that client's expresses a 'racket' feeling in the hope that the coach will 'stroke' i t for them. If the stroke is forthcoming the racketeer continues to ex press future feelings in the hope of future strokes . This means the coach will start colluding with the client. The role of the coach is to provide a pattern interrup t here. In pairs each think of a person who runs life scrip ts and discuss; When do you join them in racketeering? From which ego-state do they invite you to join the m? At each invitation do you accept or confront? When you confront how does the person respond? If you accept, from which ego-state does this come and what do you and the other person do next? Stroke yourself for what you do effectively Note what you will do differently next time C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 191 Transactional Analysis Descriptive Model (further developed by Mountain Associates) is interesting from a development perspective and i t remains valid for explanation and interpretation of the concept. \u00a9 Diagram - Mountain Associates 2009 - adapted from Susannah Temple's 1999 model. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 192 The model shows how we function or behave with othe rs. The model used here is divided into nine parts and again we have used Susannah Temple's (1999) term 'm ode' as it differentiates it from the structural eg o state model mentioned previously. We have adapted the Susannah Temple 1999 model, dia gram, and some terms, Effective communication comes from the areas within the circle and ineffective co mmunication come from the modes in larger font in t he squares. When we come (communicate) from the ineffective mod es we invite a negative response, and a positive re sponse from the effective modes. Transactional analysis - diagnosis It is helpful to be able to assess or diagnose whic h ego state in the structural model, or which mode in the descriptive model, somebody is in. In this way we c an respond appropriately as well as ensure which mo de we are addressing. However, when we work with other staff or are relat ing with young people, we are responding on the beh avioural level. It is not always possible, or appropriate, t o be undertaking more in-depth types of diagnosis. We have outlined them here though so that an understanding of the complexity of the process can be achieved. Behavioural diagnosis Words, tone, tempo of speech, expressions, postures , gestures, breathing, and muscle tone provide clue s for diagnosing ego states. Parent mode words typically contain value judgments , Adult words are clear and definable, and Free Chi ld mode words are direct and spontaneous. For example, a pe rson in Adapted Child mode may cry silently, wherea s when in Free Child mode we are likely to make a lots of noise. \"You\" or \"one\" usually come from Parent. Thi s can switch even mid-sentence. If we are leaning forward it is likely we are in the posture of the Parent mode, wh ereas if we are in Adult mode we tend to be erect. These are indicators not guarantees. Assessment nee ds to be supported by other methods of diagnosis. Social diagnosis Observation of the kinds of transactions a person i s having with others. For example, if eliciting a r esponse from someone's caretaking Parent it is likely that the s timulus is coming from Child, though not necessaril y the Adapted Child mode. Our own responses to someone will often be a way of assessing which ego state or mode they are coming from. Historical diagnosis The person's past also provides important informati on. If, as a child we had feelings similar to those we are experiencing now, it is likely we are in Child ego state. If our mother or father behaved or talked in the same way that we are behaving or talking now then we are pro bably in a Parent ego state. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 193 Phenomenological diagnosis This occurs when we re-experience the past instead of just remembering it. This means that diagnosis i s undertaken by self-examination. This is sometimes a ccurate and sometimes very inaccurate as the Child ego state may be afraid to allow our Adult to know what is go ing on. Transactional analysis - strokes In Transactional Analysis we call compliments and g eneral ways of giving recognition strokes. This nam e came from research which indicated that babies require t ouching in order to survive and grow. It apparently makes no difference whether the touching induces pain or ple asure - it is still important. On the whole we pref er to receive negative strokes than no strokes at all, at least t hat way we know we exist and others know we exist. We all have particular strokes we will accept and t hose we will reject. For example, if we have always been told we are clever, and our brother is creative, then we are likely to accept strokes for being clever, but not for being creative. From this frame of reference only one per son in the family can be the creative one and so on . Stroking can be physical, verbal or nonverbal. It i s likely that the great variety of stroke needs and styles present in the world results from differences in wealth, cultu ral mores, and methods of parenting. The Stroke Economy Claude Steiner suggests that, as children, we are a ll indoctrinated by our parents with five restricti ve rules about stroking. \u0001 don't give strokes when we have them to give \u0001 don't ask for strokes when we need them \u0001 don't accept strokes if we want them \u0001 don't reject strokes when we don't want them \u0001 don't give ourselves strokes \u0001 Together these five rules are the basis of what Ste iner calls the stroke economy. By training children to obey these rules, says Steiner, parents ensure that \".. a situation in which strokes could be availabl e in a limitless supply is transformed into a situation in which the supply is low and the price parents can extract for them is high.\" \u0001 We therefore need to change the restrictive rules t o unrestrictive ones: \u0001 give strokes when we have them to give \u0001 ask for strokes when we want them \u0001 accept strokes if we want them \u0001 reject manipulative strokes \u0001 give ourselves positive strokes C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 194 Strokes can be positive or negative: A) \"I like you\" B) \"I don't like you\" Strokes can be unconditional or conditional. An unc onditional stroke is a stroke for being whereas a c onditional stroke is a stroke for doing. For instance: \"I like you\" - unconditional \"I like you when you smile\" - conditional As negative strokes these might be: \"I don't like you\" - negative unconditional \"I don't like you when you're sarcastic\" - negative conditional People often have a stroke filter. They only let in strokes which they think they are allowed to let i n. For instance they allow themselves to receive strokes for being clever and keep out strokes for being good looking. One way to think about this to consider being out in the rain. The rain is the strokes that are available to us, both positive and negative. There is a hole in the umbrella and some of the strokes go through and we save them in a buc ket to enjoy in lean times. Conversely we might use them n egatively to reinforce the negative strokes we give to ourselves. Of course, some just bounce off the umbr ella and we might not accept the good strokes that are coming our way. Some might come in but fall straigh t onto the floor. Transactional analysis - life positions Life positions are basic beliefs about self and oth ers, which are used to justify decisions and behavi our. When we are conceived we are hopefully at peace, wa iting to emerge into the world once we have grown sufficiently to be able to survive outside of the w omb. If nothing untoward happens we will emerge con tented and relaxed. In this case we are likely to perceive the world from the perspective of I am OK and You are OK. However, perhaps our mother had some traumatic expe riences, or the birth was difficult or even life th reatening. This experience is likely to have an effect on the way we experience the world, even at the somatic le vel. In which case we might emerge sensing that life is scary and might, for example, go into \"I am not OK and You a re not OK either\". Let's take it that the pregnancy went fine, and the birth was easy enough. What then? Well life experi ences might reinforce our initial somatic level life position, or contradict it. If we were treated punitively, ta lked down to, and not held, we may begin to believe \"I am not OK and You are OK\". This might be the only sense we can ma ke of our experiences. Let's take another situation. Perhaps we were picke d on and bullied as a child. We learnt that the way to get by was to bully others and that way we felt stronger a nd in control. Our behaviour then comes into the I am OK and You are not OK quadrant. Of course this may cover u p our belief that we are really not OK, but nobody sees that. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 195 They just see our behaviour, and in fact we may hav e forgotten all about our negative feelings about o urselves as we have tried so hard to deny the pain of believing we are not OK. These life positions are perceptions of the world. The reality is I just am and you just are, therefor e how I view myself and others are just that \"views\" not fact. H owever, we tend to act as if they are a fact. Just like when somebody says \"I can't do this, I'm useless\". Rathe r than \"I don't know how to do this. Will you show me?\" The latter is staying with the fact that they do not ye t know how to do it, whilst the former links being useless with not being able to do something. There are a number of ways of diagramming the life positions. Franklin Ernstdrew the life positions in quadrants, which he called the OK Corral (1971). We have put t hese into red and green to show the effective and i neffective quadrants for communication and healthy relationshi ps. By shading in the quadrants according to the am ount of time we think we spend in each we can get an idea o f the amount of time we spend in each. Ernst used t he term 'Corralogram' for this method of self-assessment us ing the OK Corral matrix. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 196 The Ok Corral (Franklin Ernst, 1971) Berne talked about the life positions as existentia l positions, one of which we are more likely to go to under stress. This is significantly different to the conc ept Ernst uses, i.e. that we move around them all d uring the day. Whilst there is some truth in this we could agree w ith Berne that there will be one major position we go into under stress, with perhaps another position underne ath this one. These positions can change as we deve lop and grow. The difference between Berne and Ernst is imp ortant. Chris Davidson (1999) writes about the three dimens ional model of Okayness. All of the previous diagra ms talk as if there were only one other person in the equation , when in reality there are often more. For example , the behaviour of young people in gangs may say that the y believe they are okay and perhaps other gangs in their neighbourhood are okay, but an individual or gang f rom another neighbourhood is not okay. We often do this at work as well. We find other people who we like and then we gossip and put other people down. We are th erefore saying that we believe we are okay but those others are awful (underneath this there may be a belief t hat we are not okay either but we feel better by putting someo ne else down). In this way the two dimensional mode l of okayness i.e. that there are only two people involv ed, becomes three dimensional model where there can be three or more involved. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 197 There is also the way in which we view life itself. If we consider that there is something wrong with us, and that others are not to be trusted and are not OK either, then the world would be a scary place and we are l ikely to experience life as tough and believe we will only b e all right if we keep alert and on the lookout for danger and difficulties. Blame Model The Transactional Analysis 'Okay Corral' can be lin ked to 'blame', for which Jim Davis developed this simple and helpful model. Commonly when emotions are triggered people adopt one of three attitudes relating to bl ame, which each correlate to a position on the Okay Corr al: I'm to blame (You are okay and I'm not okay - 'help less') You are to blame (I'm okay and you are not okay - ' angry') We are both to blame (I'm not okay and you are not okay - 'hopeless') None of these is a healthy position. Instead the healthy position is, and the mindset sh ould be: \"It's no-one's fault, blame isn't the issu e - what matters is how we go forward and sort things out.\" (I'm okay and you are okay - 'happy') (With acknowledgements to Jim Davis of TSTA) Transactional Analysis - the script The script is a life plan, made when we are growing up. It is like having the script of a play in fron t of us - we read the lines and decide what will happen in each act a nd how the play will end. The script is developed f rom our early decisions based upon our life experience. We may not realise that we have set ourselves a plan b ut we can often find this out if we ask ourselves what our fa vourite childhood story was, who was our favourite character in the story and who do we identify with. Then conside r the beginning, middle and end of the story. How i s this story reflected in our life today? Another way of getting to what script is may be to think about what we believe will happen when we are in old age. Do we believe we will be alive at 80 or 90 yea rs old, be healthy, happy, and contented? What do w e think will be on the headstone for our grave? What would we li ke to be on it? Transactional Analysis - Driver Behaviour (working styles) These are ways in which we defend against the injun ctions. These are very helpful to us and when we un derstand them we can work to their strengths through choice, rather than because subconsciously we believe we h ave to do things this way to be okay. The names of five wo rking styles have been developed, these are: \u0001 be perfect \u0001 be strong \u0001 try hard \u0001 please others \u0001 hurry up C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 198 The importance of recognising these in ourselves an d others is that we can then work to the best of th em rather than be driven by them. The working style Be Perfect means that we will be really good at doing accurate detailed reports, we will be neat in our appearance and our homes will be clean and t idy. If we have this style and are under stress it is likely that we would beat up on ourselves for not being good en ough, for making a mistake, for something being out of place. Of course, we created the rule about what pe rfection is, and then we don't meet up to it we hav e a go at ourselves. This may also mean that we expect others to be perfect too which can be hard on the colleag ues we work with. If we have a Be Strong working style we will be gre at in a crisis. We can take control of situations a nd people will often feel safe around us. The difficulty is we may come across as aloof as we don't express feelings very often. For us there is a tendency to say \"it is\" rather th an \"I am\". The former phrase distances us from our feelings, enabling us to safe. We may stand apart from playfu l activities fearing we may look stupid. Instead of saying this however, it is likely that we condemn the activity as stupid and put down the person who suggested it. If we have the Try Hard style we are great pioneers . We love new projects and new things to do. We pro bably have a great wealth of information as we like to ga ther different ideas together. We are best working under pressure. When stressed we may start too many thing s. We are more likely to start things but not finis h them so celebrating achievements may not happen very often. We get sidetracked by starting to experiment with different ideas or ways to do things. We are likely to use phrases such as: \"I'll try and do what we a greed\" or \"What I am trying to tell you is\". If we have the Please Others style we will be a gre at team member. We like to please people without ev en asking them how we can do this as we prefer to guess. We c an see both sides of an argument and attempt to cal m things down. We will be keen to do things for others, ofte n to the point of Rescuing them. Decision making is not our strong point and we may frustrate people by not exp ressing our own opinion. We prefer other people to determine priorities, not us. We worry about changi ng our behaviour in case others won't like us. Those of us with the Hurry Up working style will ge t a great deal done in a short amount of time. If r eports are wanted in on time we are the person to do them. How ever, we tend to overload our time table and take o n too much. This may mean that important aspects are over looked. We are likely to be impatient with others a nd often finish their sentences for them. We make only super ficial changes as we are so quick to get on with th ings and not take an in-depth perspective. We might select prior ities so quickly that a significant area is overloo ked. The way we structure our time is also influenced by our script. Transactional Analysis - time structuring The way in which we structure time is likely to ref lect the different hungers. We all structure time i n a variety of ways: \u0001 Withdrawal \u0001 Games \u0001 Obtaining balance means ensuring that we have suffi cient time for play and intimacy and if this does n ot occur then it would be beneficial to explore what we migh t be avoiding. Games I am sure that every one of us must have been in th e situation where we have said, \"Why does this alwa ys keep happening to me\" or \"I always keep meeting people w ho hurt me and then go off and leave me\". Sometimes it may be that we like to help people and then it goes wrong as the person we were trying to help says th at we didn't do it well enough and that we got it wrong. We might think \"Well, I was only trying to help\" an d feel got at. When similar situations keep happening over and ove r again then the term Transactional Analysis uses f or this is a game. A game is a familiar pattern of behaviour wit h a predictable outcome. Games are played outside A dult awareness and they are our best attempt to get our needs met - although of course we don't. Games are learned patterns of behaviour, and most p eople play a small number of favourite games with a range of different people and in varying intensities. First Degree games are played in social circles generally lead to mild upsets not major traumas. Second Degree games occur when the stakes may be higher. This us ually occurs in more intimate circles, and ends up with an even greater negative payoff. Third Degree games involve tissue damage and may end up in the jail, hospital or morgue. Chris Davidson (2002) has argued that world politic s can involve fourth degree games - where the outco mes involve whole communities, countries or even the wo rld. Games vary in the length of time that passes while they are being played. Some can take seconds or min utes while others take weeks months or even years. Peopl e play games for these reasons: \u0001 to structure time \u0001 to acquire strokes \u0001 to maintain the substitute feeling and the system o f thinking, beliefs and actions that go with it \u0001 to confirm parental injunctions and further the lif e script \u0001 to maintain the person's life position by \"proving\" that self/others are not OK \u0001 to provide a high level of stroke exchange while bl ocking intimacy and maintaining distance \u0001 to make people predictable. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 200 Ways to deal with games There are various ways to stop a game, including th e use of different options than the one automatical ly used. We can: cross the transaction by responding from a differen t ego state than the one the stimulus is designed t o hook. pick up the ulterior rather than the social message e.g. when a person says \"I can't do this, I'm usel ess\". Rather than saying, \"Let me do this for you,\" instead say, \"It sounds like you have a problem. What do you wa nt me to do about it?\" (said from the Adult ego state) the opening message to the game always entails a di scount. There are further discounts at each stage o f the game. By detecting discounts we can identify game i nvitations and defuse them with options. (A discoun t is when we minimise, maximise or ignore some aspect of a pr oblem which would assist us in resolving it. Such a s saying in a whiny voice \"This is too difficult for me to do\", so we automatically help them). replace the game strokes. Loss of strokes to the Ch ild ego state means a threat to survival. We get a great many strokes from games, even if they are negative. Howe ver, if we don't obtain sufficient positive strokes , or give ourselves positive strokes, we will go for quantity rather than quality of strokes and play games to g et them. This loss of strokes is also a loss of excitement that t he game has generated. Another way to think about this is to consider the game role we or the other person is likely to take. One way to discover this is to ask the following questions: 1. What keeps happening over and over again 2. How does it start? 3. What happens next? 4. And then what happens? 5. How does it end? 6. How do feel after it ends? (John James, 1973) We can then consider the reason we might have taken up a particular role, where we might switch to, an d then consider how to do things differently. We need to c onsider what our own responsibility is in this - if the situation is too violent for us to get involved what options to we have? We could call for help, get others to c ome with us to intervene and so on. We need to choose the appropri ate assistance and take the action required. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 201 The Karpman Drama Triangle \"Do you want to be honest, or do you want to win? You could have it all if you could gracefully give in Like when a martyr knows he's a martyr And looking in the mirror makes you cry harder 'bout your glittering ball and chain In love, In love with your Beautiful pain Excuses and old theories repeat themselves and die But when they don't hold water You try to keep them safe and dry\" - lyrics from the song Beautiful Pain by Rosanne Cash Staying mentally healthy is about growth, taking re sponsibility for how you affect others, recognizing choices, and being willing to risk mistakes. The Karpman Drama T riangle is a game played all too often in relations hips. If this game defines a pattern of your relationships with o thers, then you have serious work to do. Original Source \u00a9 1968 by the Transactional Analysi s Bulletin. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 202 The Purpose of The Victim, Rescuer, Persecutor Game 1. Keeps responsibility out there. 2. There is a lack of internal conflict within the individual. It's all created in others. 3. Players lack empathy, are very self absorbed in their own role of the moment. 4. Patterns of the game prevent problem solving \u2014 the drama rules . 5. Maintains bad boundaries. 6. The game provides identity and fills emptiness, because two people can jump around in all three rol es to fuel the drama. Good guy/Bad guy split thinking leads to drama. Dra ma obscures the real issues. People are seduced by the false excitement the drama offers \u2014 all style, no substan ce. Manipulation is the core of the game. It create s confusion and upset, not solutions. Playing Victim, Rescuer has become a powerful cultu ral pastime. It is at the core of all the repetitio us plots of soap operas. This game could be used to describe Th e Clintons; Bill, Hillary, Monica, and Ken. Here's how it works: Let's suppose Bill was emotion ally dependent on Hillary to feel good about himsel f. Perhaps Hillary was persecuting him through emotional dista nce because she lost the national health care bill and was licking her wounds after the Arkansas State Trooper s reported Bill's philandering. Monica enters the White House, ripe for the role of Rescuer to Victim Bill. The beauty of the game is that roles can be switched to enhance the drama. For example, Bill could rescue Monica by finding he r attractive, while Monica feels like a victim beca use she's a chubby girl no one would ever love. Enter Ken Starr to play Persecutor in his own over-the-top style. Another example could be O.J. Simpson. He was accus ed of being the Persecutor and Nicole was the Victi m. One way to look at what O.J.'s attorneys did is that th ey flipped him from the Persecutor role to the Vict im role. Then the Jury stepped in to play the rescuer. This game is what operates in many relationships. I t is all style and no substance. It has become a li festyle for too many people. The game provides people with their id entity as Victim, Rescuer, or Persecutor. People ge nerally favour one or two roles. Most of us in the helping professions (teachers, co aches, HR) all begin with favouring the Rescuer rol e. (So be sure to choose a coach who's been a client and seriously worked on issues about their own stuff. This means they'll more clearly see who you really are instead of proj ecting their own issues onto you.) Rescuers get cau ght up in enabling. They see themselves as good and have to l earn to back up. Doing too much for someone else is rationalized because \"I care so much.\" Rescuers are often unaware that pity and disrespect are the fue l for this C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 203 role. \"I know what's best for you.\" is illustrated in the mother's role. The reality is that backing u p from the rescuer role means learning that indifference can b e a useful tool. Wait and see if the person you're trying to rescue steps forward for themselves or how they do it differently. Victims can be manipulative, particularly if they a re operating on a \"love me no matter what\" basis. B eing loved no matter what is not something two honest adults s hould expect from each other. After the age of 18, love me no matter what should be hard to come by. Victims a re trying to remain blameless. Remember an unhappy relationship is always created by two people. Blame may be distributed 60/40 or 70/30, however it alwa ys takes two. The more blaming and finger pointing someone d oes, the more fragile the point of view. Noise simp ly creates smoke and mirrors, and it is less likely th at an honest reality is being addressed. Elegant tr uth is generally never \"I am good/You are bad,\" it is usually a more complicated frame of reference. \"I did this part a nd you did this part\" etc. Finding the bravery to look at your own part in creating problems can change and trans form your life. If you've been loving the victim role over ma ny years it is time to face the truth - it is a boring way of life . One key to interrupting this pattern would be to reloca te your imagination, to find other ways of conducti ng your life. Persecutors love the power of moving people around on the chess board of life. Everything is win or lo se, with very little ability to be a part of a team. There i s a desperate need to be right at all costs and you can end up doubting yourself even about the facts of what happ ens. Playing in this drama triangle ultimately leads to a very boring life. Over and over again the game is repeated, and there are never any solutions. Nobody grows as all the players are very stuck in the cycle of repeatin g their tired lines, all for drama.

At one level, there is the environment in which the organization and its members act and interact\u2014i.e., when and where the operations and relationships within an organiz ation take place. Environmental factors determine the context and con straints under which people operate. An organizatio n's environment is made up of such things as the geogra phical locations of its operations, the buildings a nd facilities which define the \"work place,\" office and factory d esign, etc. In addition to the influence these envi ronmental factors may have on people within the organization, one can also examine the influence and impact that people within an organization have upon their environment, and what products or creations they bring to the environment. At another level, we can examine the specific behaviours and actions of an organization or individual\u2014i.e., what the person or organization does within the environm ent. What are the particular patterns of work, int eraction or communication? On an organizational level, behaviou rs may be defined in terms of general procedures. O n the individual level, behaviours take the form of speci fic work routines, working habits or job related ac tivities. Another level of process involves the strategies, s kills and capabilities by which the organization or individual selects and directs actions within their environmen t\u2014i.e., how they generate and guide their behaviours within a particular context. For an individual, capabilitie s include cognitive strategies and skills such as l earning, memory, decision making and creativity, which facilitate th e performance of a particular behaviour or task. On an organizational level, capabilities relate to the in frastructures available to support communication, i nnovation, planning and decision making between members of the organization. These other levels of process are shaped by values and beliefs, which provide the motivation and guidelines behind the strategies and capabilities used to acco mplish behavioural outcomes in the environment\u2014i.e. , why people do things the way they do them in a particul ar time and place. Our values and beliefs provide t he reinforcement ( motivation and permission ) that supports or inhibits particular capabilities and behaviours. Values and beliefs determine how events are given meaning, and are at the core of judgment and culture. Values and beliefs support the individual's or orga nization's sense of identity \u2014i.e., the who behind the why, how, what, where and when. Identity level processes invo lve people's sense of role and mission with respect to their vision and the larger systems of which they are a m ember. Identity Beliefs/Values Capabilities Vision C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 209 Levels of Processes Within Individuals and Organiza tions Typically, a particular identity or role is express ed in terms of several key values and beliefs. Thes e, in turn, are supported by a larger range of skills and capabilit ies, which are required to manifest particular valu es and beliefs. Effective capabilities produce an even wider set of specific behaviours and actions, which express and adapt values with respect to many particular environmenta l contexts and conditions. Creating an Aligned State One of the most important aspects of effective and ecological communication and change is the congruen ce between the 'message' and the 'messenger'. On a pe rsonal level, a healthy and effective person is one whose own actions are aligned with his or her capabilitie s, beliefs, values and sense of identity or mission . A person's sense of role and identity is a dynamic process rel ated to several different factors: 1) One's sense of mission or purpose (which evolves with one's cycle of development in life). 2) One's view or vision of the larger system of whi ch one is a part (a 'spiritual' perspective). 3) One's role in relation to the organizational and family systems of which one is a member. The concept of different 'levels' of change provide s us with a powerful road map for bringing the vari ous dimensions of ourselves into alignment in order to realize our goals and visions. Each of these differ ent levels is embodied through successively deeper and broader or ganizations of 'neural circuitry'. As one moves fr om the simple perception of the environment, for instance, to the activation of behaviour within that environ ment, more commitment of one's mind and body must be mobilized . Capabilities call into play longer term plans and m aps, and require the involvement of even deeper lev els of the nervous system. Beliefs and values are represented and manifested through the mobilization of neurolo gy that calls into play structures as deep as the autonomic nervous system (such as the heart and 'guts'). Ide ntity involves the total commitment of our nervous systems. 'Spiri tual' experiences involve the resonance between our own mind and nervous system with the larger systems of which we are a part. To be effective in a particular system, an individu al must understand the relationship between the var ious levels of change, and align his or her activities to fit t hose dynamics. That is, goals and actions on an ind ividual level should support the functional objectives and strate gy related to role, which in turn should be congrue nt with culture and identity, and mission with respect to t he larger environment. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 210 Logical Level Alignment Process The 'Neuro-Logical Level Alignment' process provide s a way to systematically access and connect experi ences and neural processes associated with each of these diff erent levels. By combining mental and physical pro cesses with the different levels of change, a person can bring all these levels into alignment in the service of t heir vision and mission. The process uses what is called 'spatial anchoring' to activate and integrate these different levels o f experience. Many people have found this to be a very powerful e xperience and a tool to put themselves into an effe ctive 'aligned' state. EXERCISE; 1.

He attended City College of New York (undergraduate), University of Pittsburgh (Graduate ) and was Professor of Management at Case Western R eserve University, where he established the Department of Industrial Mental Health. In 1972 he moved to the U niversity of Utah's College of Business, where he was also Pr ofessor of Management. He died January 18, 2000. His first established his theories about motivation in the workplace; 'The Motivation to Work', was wr itten Mausner and Barbara Blo ch Snyderman in 1959; he scrutinized and compared t he results and methodologies of all 155 previous resea rch studies into 'job attitudes' carried out betwee n 1920 and 1954. In his subsequent books: Work and the Nature of Man (1966); The Managerial Choice (1982); and Herzberg on Motivation (1983), Herzberg expanded his motivation -hygiene theory. Herzberg's central theory is very relevant to modern understanding employer/employee relations hips, mutual understanding and alignment within the Psychological Contract. It also influential in the basic principles of Nudge theory - a powerful motivational and change-management concept which emerged in the 2000 s. Herzberg's theory According to Herzberg, Man has two sets of needs; o ne as an animal to avoid pain, and two as a human b eing to grow psychologically; certain parallels can clearly be seen with Maslow Hierarchy of Needs Herzberg was the first to show that satisfaction an d dissatisfaction at work nearly always arose from different factors. He suggested that the factors which motiva te people at work are different to and not simply the opposite of the factors which cause dissatisfaction \"We can expand ... by stating that the job satisfie rs deal with the factors involved in doing the job, whereas the job dissatisfiers deal with the factors which define the job context.\" C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 216 (1959 Herzberg) Although with pe ople's well-being at work; he was attempting to bri ng more humanity and caring into the workplace. Most noted for his 'hygiene' and 'motivational factors theory' . Herzberg's ideas relate strongly to modern ethical management and social responsibility, and v ery directly to the Psychological Contract. Herzberg's research shows that satisfaction is temp orary; people will strive to achieve 'hygiene' need s because they are unhappy without them, but once satisfied t hey become de-motivated; people are not 'motivated' by addressing 'hygiene' needs! People are only truly m otivated by enabling them to reach for and satisfy the factors that Herzberg identified as real motivators; advanc ement, achievement, professional development, bread th etc. which represent a deeper level of fulfilment and me aning over time. Examples of Herzberg's 'hygiene' needs (or maintena nce factors) in the workplace are: salary policy relationship with supervisor relationship with subordinates status work conditions company car security personal life C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 217 Herzberg's research identified that true motivators were other completely different factors, notably: advancement achievement work itself recognition responsibility Values and Motivation Motivation is closely linked to Values and Beliefs about what is important in work/life. Values determine what is important to us, and give us drive and motivation. They are what we move towards or away from. They determine how we spend our time, energy and effort. Values also determine how we feel about what we've done after we've done something. Values are important i n out motivation. Our values change across context; we will have valu es associated with work, which may differ for those associated with relationships. Values are held in p lace by a range of beliefs and are convictions we t rust as being true for us.

In 1963 he began his McBer consultancy; helping industry asses s and train staff. David McClelland pioneered workplace motivational t hinking and is chiefly known for his work on achiev ement motivation, with interests in personality and consc iousness. He developed achievement-based motivation al theory and models. His ideas promoted improvements in employee assessment methods; advocating competency-based assessments and tests, arguing the m to be better than traditional IQ and personality- based tests. David McClelland described three types of motivatio nal need (The Achieving Society, 1961) and that mos t people exhibit a combination of these characteristics: 1. The need for achievement (n-ach) The n-ach 'achievement motivated'. chal lenging goals; and advancement in the job. There is a stron g need for feedback as to achievement and progress, and a need for a sense of accomplishment. 2. The need for authority and power (n-pow) The n-pow person is 'authority motivated'. This mai n driver produces a need to be influential, effective and to make an impact. There is a strong need to lead and for thei r ideas to prevail. There is also motivation and need towards increasing personal status and prestige. 3. The need for affiliation (n-affil) The n-affil person is 'affiliation motivated'. The driver is for friendly relationships and is motivated towards int eraction with other people. The affiliation driver produces motivation and need to be liked and held in popular regard. These people are team players. Need for Achievement Need for Affiliation Need for Power C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 219 Abraham Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Motivational Mo del Abraham Maslow (1908 - 1970) PhD in psychology (193 4) at the University of Wisconsin formed the basis of his motivational research, initially studying rhesus mo nkeys. Abraham Maslow developed the Hierarchy of Ne eds model in 1940-50s. The theory is used to understand ing human motivation, management training, and pers onal development. Abraham Maslow's book Motivation and P ersonality, 1954 (2 nd Edition 1970) introduced the Hierarchy of Needs, which he further extended in To ward A Psychology Of Being (19..) Each of us is motivated by needs. Our most basic ne eds are inborn, having evolved over tens of thousan ds of years. we must satisfy each need in turn, starting with the first, which deals with the most obvious n eeds for survival itself. Only when the lower order needs of physical and emotional well-being are satisfied ar e we concerned with the higher order needs of influence and personal development. In times of stress we can drop down through the needs and the higher order needs b ecome redundant for a period of time. The Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs five-stage model: 1. Biological and Physiological needs - air, food, drink, shelter, warmth, sex, sleep, e tc. 2. Safety needs - protection from elements, security, order, law, limits, stability, etc. 3. Belongingness and Love needs - work group, family, affection, relationships, et c. 4. Esteem needs - self-esteem, achievement, mastery, independence, status, dominance, prestige, managerial responsibility, etc. 5. Self-Actualization needs - realising personal potential, self-fulfillment, seeking personal growth and peak experiences. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 220 C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 221 Motivational Patterns How can I overcome barriers to effective coaching relation ship s? An other aspect to understanding the legal and ethical requirements is knowing about the potential barriers to a good relationship between coach and coachee, and how these can be overcome. Most barr iers to effective mentoring stem from: \u0001 personality issues between those involved in the c oaching relationship \u0001 lack of awareness of what the role of the coach really is. \u0001 Lack of understanding of individual difference in m otivation and also culture \u0001 Unclear contracting Co mm on barr iers include: \u0001 poor coach /coachee matching \u0001 lack of support from the organisation \u0001 diss atisfaction from either the coach or the coachee with regards to the way the coaching is conducted \u0001 the creation of unrealistic expectations as to what coaching can hope to achieve \u0001 the lack, or blurring, of boundaries in terms of the coach /coachee relationship Individual differences People have some characteristics in common and diff er in other characteristics. One can either emphasi se the similarities or the differences. At the extremes ar e the 2 opposing viewpoints. At one extreme is the view that all people are basically the same - they are just at a different stage of their development i.e. all peopl e are like us, thus to understand people we only need to understan d ourselves. This leads to a projection of our valu es, beliefs and internal processes on others. At the other extreme is the view that all people ar e different. Each person is unique, has a different history and model of the world. Life may be either a process of discovering and appreciating these differences or of trying to reduce these differences and change other people to be as much like ourselves as possible. Both of these two extremes are based on a kernel of insight and are flawed. The simple fact is that pe ople have some characteristics in common and many in which th ey differ. Throughout modern psychology, there have been various forms of reductionism. We all delete, distort and generalise the informati on that we come into contact with. If we didn't, w e'd go mad! But what determines the elements to deleted, how do we distort and generalise? We all have filters th rough which we view the world, rather like our very own u nique set of sunglasses. One of these filters is 'Metaprogrammes. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 222 Metaprogrammes are specific filters we use to inter act with the world. They edit and shape what we al low to come in from the outside world, and they also shape what comes from inside ourselves as we communicate and behave in the outside world. In short, they're a d oor through which we interact in the world. Although Metaprogrammes make up a key element of ou r personality, they are not fixed in stone. On the contrary, they certainly change over time and with expert help can be changed in moments. Also, for a ll of us at any one time our Metaprogrammes will vary depending on the context (work, friends, family, children, p artner, sport). Metaprogrammes \u0001 change across contexts and as we grow and develop. \u0001 are explicit formations of patterns in thought and behaviour. \u0001 They are meant as a guide and should not be used to box or label. \u0001 are how generalisations are maintained through time . \u0001 They help build coherence in human experience. \u0001 are deletion filters that reveal the aspects of our experience that affect our behaviour and the aspec ts that we delete. \u0001 are a set of distinctions and only have value if th ey provide insight into patterns of a person's beha viour and this is used to influence the behaviour.

They introduc ed the term Appreciative Inquiry and began to look at orga nizations as expressions of beauty and spirit. What is it? Ap-pre'ci-ate, v. 1. valuing; the act of recognizing the best in peop le or the world around us; affirming past and prese nt strengths, successes, and potentials; to perceive those things that give life (health, vitality, excellence) to l iving systems 2. to increase in value, e.g. the economy has appre ciated in value. Synonyms:VALUING, PRIZING, ESTEEMING, and HONORING. In-quire' (kwir), v. 1. the act of exploration and discovery. 2. To ask questions; to be open to seeing new potentials and possibilities. Synonyms: DISCOVERY, SEARCH, and SYSTEMATIC EXPLORA TION, STUDY. David L. Cooperrider and Diana Whitney gave their d efinition of Appreciative Inquiry in their publicat ion 'Appreciative Inquiry - A Positive Revolution in Ch ange', Berrett-Koehler Publishers, San Francisco,2 009: \"AI is about the coevolutionary search for the best in people, their organizations, and the relevant w orld around them. In its broadest focus, it involves systemati c discovery of what gives \"life\" to a living syste m when it is most alive, most effective, and most constructively capa ble in economic, ecological, and human terms. AI i nvolves, in a central way, the art and practice of asking questio ns that strengthen a system's capacity to apprehend , anticipate, and heighten positive potential. It centrally invo lves the mobilization of inquiry through the craft ing of the \"unconditional positive question\" often-involving h undreds or sometimes thousands of people. In AI the arduous task of intervention gives way to the speed of imag ination and innovation; instead of negation, critic ism, and spiraling diagnosis, there is discovery, dream, and design. AI seeks, fundamentally, to build a constructive un ion between a whole people and the massive entirety of what people talk about as past and present capacities: a chievements, assets, unexplored potentials, innovat ions, strengths, elevated thoughts, opportunities, benchm arks, high point moments, lived values, traditions, strategic competencies, stories, expressions of wisdom, insig hts into the deeper corporate spirit or soul-- and visions of valued and possible futures. Taking all of these together as a gestalt, AI deli berately, in everything it does, seeks to work from accounts of this \"positive change core\"\u2014and it assumes that every li ving system has many untapped and rich and inspirin g accounts C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 226 of the positive. Link the energy of this core dire ctly to any change agenda and changes ne ver thought possible are suddenly and democratically mobilized.\" In large and comprehensive surveys conducted on app roaches to managing change, the conclusions were th at organizations work generally on one unwritten rule: 'to fix what's wrong and let the strengths take ca re of themselves'. \"How pervasive is this deficit-based approach to ch ange, which says change begins with the identificat ion of the most pressing problems, the gaps, and their root ca uses? Do you recognize it? Okay, try this: Think ab out the last three projects you've worked on and the last half d ozen meetings you've attended. How many of the proj ects weredesigned to fix something? How many of the meet ings were called to address a problem?\" (A Positive Revolution in Change : Appreciative Inquiry . David L. Cooperrider and Diana Whitney.) It has been learned that systems grow in the direct ion of what they persistently ask questions about a nd this propensity is strongest and most sustainable when t he means and ends of inquiry are positively correla ted. The single most prolific thing a group can do, if its a ims are to to liberate the human spirit and conscio usly construct a better future, is to make the positive change core the common and explicit property of all. Set of assumptions: Appreciative Inquiry works from a set of assumption s. These are: 1. In every society, organisation or group, somethi ng works. 2. What we focus on becomes our reality. 3. Reality is created in the moment, and there are multiple realities. 4. The act of asking questions of an organisation, or group influences the group in some way. 5. People have more confidence to journey to the fu ture (the unknown) when they carry forward parts of the past (the known). 6. If we carry forward parts of the past, they shou ld be what is best about the past. 7. It is important to value differences. 8. The language we use creates our reality. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 227 Appreciative Inquiry '4-D' Cycle Discovery : The Appreciative Inquiry approach to personal or o rganisational change is to begin by looking for wha t is working-APPRECIATING the best of our experience. The Discovery phase is a wide search to understand the \"best of what is\" and \"what has been.\" It begin s focusing on appreciative interview questions which are written as affirmative probes into an organization's positi ve core. They are aiming at generating stories, enriching the ima ges and inner dialogue within the organization, and bringing the positive core more fully into focus. The results of Discovery include: The formation of new relationships, that bridge acr oss traditional barriers A rich description or mapping of the organization's positive core Organization-wide sharing and learning from stories of best practices, golden innovations and exemplar y actions Greatly enhanced organizational knowledge and colle ctive wisdom. Dream : This is to consider what might be-ENVISIONING RESU LTS The Dream phase is the exploration of \"what might b e\": a time for everyone to explore hopes and vision s for their work, their working relationships, their organizati on, and the world at large. It is a time for groups of people to engage in thinking big, thinking out of the box, an d thinking out of the boundaries of what has been s uccessful and meaningful in the past. The aim of this phase is to identify and spread generative, hopeful images of the future. It is C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 228 Exploration can be carried on the following: The organization's most creative positive potential s Courageous and compelling visions Strategic opportunities for the future An higher sense of purpose Design : What should be the ideal?-CO-CONSTRUCTING The Design phase involves making choices about \"wha t should be\" within an organization or community. I t is a conscious re-invention or co-creation of the strate gies, structures, culture, processes and systems ne eded to achieve the organization's or community's highest ideals. In each Appreciative Inquiry the question of what a re we designing is essential and must be answered i n reference to the Strategic Focus. During this phase an organizat ion's or community's positive core of strengths, an d its hopes and dreams for the future are aligned, integrated and e mbedded into a set of design propositions or princi ples. They in turn become the blueprint for its destiny. Destiny : How to empower, learn and adjust or improvise? SUS TAINING The Destiny phase initiates a series of inspired ac tions that support ongoing learning and innovation - or \"what will be.\" The entire 4-D Process is a chance for workers to c ontribute and step forward in the service of the or ganization, change occurs in all phases of an Appreciative Inqu iry process. The Destiny phase, however, focuses sp ecifically on personal and organizational commitments and paths f orward. The result of destiny is generally the laun ch of innovation teams throughout the organization. The tangible result of the inquiry process is a ser ies of statements that describe where the person or organisation wants to be, based on the high moments of where the y have been. Because these statements are grounded in real experience and history, people know how to repeat t heir success. From The Thin Book of Appreciative Inquiry by Sue A nnis Hammond. While these may seem obvious, we know from our own experience that we can look at what isn't working a nd start problem solving. Those of us who are facilitators and consultants kn ow how important it is to ask the right questions w hen we are working with groups of people or individuals. If we focus on difficulties in the past, people bec ome self defeating and feel that life is hopeless. When we ask them about their successes, they become enthusiastic and start to hope again . Examples where Appreciative Inquiry has been used C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 229 Appreciative inquiry has been used as the way of he lping people develop their preferred future in comp anies, governments, and organizations in Africa, Asia, Aus tralia, Europe, and North and South America. It has been combined with large scale interventions such as Open Space Technology and Future Search to great effect in worldwide projects such as United Religio ns (a look at the possibility of having a United Na tions type organization for religions of the world.) In-house people and consultants are using Appreciat ive Inquiry to address organizational issues such a s internal communication and leadership issues, and individual or group effectiveness issues Examples include: Increasing effectiveness of managers dealing with a new role and wider responsibilities through 1:1 an d group coaching. (financial services, and local government sector) Increasing the effectiveness of a department team. (Social Services department) Increasing the level of communication between trust ees of varying experience on the board. (Housing as sociation) Ai is also being used in areas like mediation in th e voluntary sector, international conflict resoluti on situations, City- wide activities like Imagine Chicago, and community activities like Imagine Waterloo. The purpose is to reconnect with the life giving fo rces (what is working)and then go beyond that to wh at could be instead of wasting energy trying to put right what isn't working or needs developing.

Additional reading is required to understand the breadth and depth of the field of coaching. Additional resources may be found at \u0001 C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 233 7 Eyed Model 1. The Coachee system. The focus is on the situation, the problem the coac hee wants help with, and how issues are presented, and keeps the attention upon the immediate agenda of the coac hing work. 2. The Coach interventions. The focus is on what kinds of intervention have bee n made, the rationale for them, and what else could they have done. This focus may be especially valuable for nov ices who are consolidating their basic skills . 3. The relationship between the Coach and their cli ent. The focus is on the dynamic between them, or on wha t is going on at both a conscious and an unconsciou s level, it can offer a mine of information that can assist in understanding the deeper, underlying processes w hich affect the outcome of the work. By paying attention to thi s part of the system, the coach can stay true to th e contract, and learn to tune in accurately to the underlying p sychological climate of the work. 4. The Coach's own experience. Here there is an opportunity to become more self aw are, and so deepen the learning about how to use th eir full potential, and about what may be getting in the way of that happening. 5. The Parallel Process. This is a valuable perspective as the dynamics that are present in the coach and client relationship c an be played out within the supervisory relationship. When this happens, the coach and supervisor learn together wh at it is like for the client to be in the relationship. It is as if the client is present. With an energy perspectiv e, we learn here 3 2 1 4 5 6 7 C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 234 that their energy is present, and has arrived along side the coach. The data gathered in this way, adds another dimension to the supervisee's learning, and effecti veness 6. The Supervisor's own self-reflections. Such reflections give an added dimension to the gat hering of data within the supervision meeting, and may open up new avenues of understanding the coach's relatio nship with the client. 7. The Wider Context. The supervision meeting is also a time to reflect o n the ethical, organisational, contractual, social and cultural aspects of the work. There will be different concer ns at different stages in the work. With this 'eye' , the wider world is held in view, lest the coach shuts out the systemic implications of the wider field. 7-Eyed Model Coaching a Team C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 235 Team Definition A team is a small number of people with complementa ry skills who are committed to a common purpose, performance goals, and approach for which they hold themselves mutually accountable.

Tuckman (1965) FORMING - STAGE 1 High dependence on leader for guidance and directio n. Little agreement on team aims or objectives othe r than received from leader. Individual roles and responsi bilities are unclear. Leader must be prepared to an swer lots of questions about the team's purpose, objectives and external relationships. Processes are often ignored . Members test tolerance of system and leader. Leader directs . STORMING - STAGE 2 Decisions don't come easily within group. Team memb ers vie for position as they attempt to establish t hemselves in relation to other team members and the leader, w ho might receive challenges from team members. Clar ity of purpose increases but plenty of uncertainties persi st. Cliques and factions form and there may be powe r struggles. The team needs to be focused on its goal s to avoid becoming distracted by relationships and emotional issues. Compromises may be required to enable progr ess. Leader sells vision and attempts to mange conf lict. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 241 NORMING - STAGE 3 Agreement and consensus is largely focus among team , who respond well to facilitation by leader. Roles and responsibilities are clear and accepted. Big decisi ons are made by group agreement. Smaller decisions may be delegated to individuals or small teams within grou p. Commitment and unity is strong. The team may eng age in fun and social activities. The team discusses and d evelops its processes and working style. There is g eneral respect for the leader and some of leadership is more share d by the team. Leader facilitates and enables. PERFORMING - STAGE 4 The team is more strategically aware; the team know s clearly why it is doing what it is doing. The tea m has a shared vision and is able to stand on its own feet with no interference or participation from the lead er. There is a focus on over-achieving goals, and the team makes m ost of the decisions against criteria agreed with t he leader. The team has a high degree of autonomy. Disagreemen ts occur but now they are resolved within the team positively and necessary changes to processes and s tructure are made by the team. The team is able to work towards achieving the goal, and also to attend to r elationship, style and process issues along the way . team members look after each other. The team requires de legated tasks and projects from the leader. The tea m does not need to be instructed or assisted. Team members might ask for assistance from the leader with pers onal and interpersonal development. Leader delegates and inf luences subtly , coaching as necessary. ADJOURNING - STAGE 5 Tuckman refined his theory around 1975 and added a fifth stage to the Forming Storming Norming Performing model - he called it Adjourning, which i s also referred to as Deforming and Mourning. Adjourning is arguably more of an adjunct to the or iginal four stage model rather than an extension - it views the group from a perspective beyond the purpo se of the first four stages. The Adjourning phase i s certainly very relevant to the people in the group and their well-being, but not to the main task of managing and developing a team, which is clearly ce ntral to the original four stages. Tuckman's fifth stage, Adjourning, is the break-up of the group, ho pefully when the task is completed successfully, it s purpose fulfilled; everyone can move on to new thin gs, feeling good about what's been achieved. From an organizational perspective, recognition of and s ensitivity to people's vulnerabilities in Tuckman's fifth stage is helpful, particularly if members of the gr oup have been closely bonded and feel a sense of insecurity or threat from this change. Teams need specific coaching questions and activiti es to optimise each stage of their development. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 242 The Transition Curve Exercise: Review this model and the Transition Curve on the f ollowing page and define: 1. What are the issues and concerns you may have at ea ch stage? 2. What are the real coaching opportunities at each st age? 3. What energising and creative techniques can you use at each stage ? C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 243 Trust within Teams \"Perhaps the biggest destroyer of team cohesiveness is the lack of honesty and trust among team member s. Creating situations in which everyone becomes a win ner is completely foreign to some individuals. It takes the cooperation of every team member for a group to fun ction, but uncooperative individuals can cause the team to become dysfunctional.\" Scarnati, J.T.(2001) On Becoming a Team Player. Tea m Performance Management : International Journal, Vol. 7 No. 1 Social Loafing The Ringelmann effect is the tendency for individual members of a group to become increasingly less productive as the size of their group increases. [1] This effect, discovered by French agricultural engineer Maximilien Ringelmann (1861-1931) through experiments with rope pulling exercises and measuring energy output. Ringelmann effect is where the productivity of an i ndividual performace decreases by as much as 50% when the group size inc reases. This is because they believe that others wi ll compensate for you and also that your effort will m ake little diffence to the team. This could be beca use of a number of circumstancs such as lack of confidence a nd being anxious. Motivation loss, or social loafing as it is otherwise known, is the reduction of exert ed individual effort observed when people work in groups compared to when they wo rk alone (Williams, Harkin, & Latan\u00e9, 1981). [3] According to Ringelmann (1913), group members tend to rely on their co-workers or co-members to furnish the desi red effort required for a communal task. The bigger the company, the easier it is for an emp loyee to hide his or her individual work. Other resons can be attributed to social looafing s uch as lack of confidence and being anxious. Masterminding The opposite of social loafing - \"A Master Mind may be created through the bringing together or blending, in a spirit of perfect harmony, of two or more minds. Out of this harmonious blending the chemistry of the mind creates a third mind which may be appropriated and used by one or all of the individual minds. This Master Mind will remain available as long as the friendly, harmonious alliance between the individual minds exists. It wi ll disintegrate and all evidence of its former existen ce will disappear the moment the friendly alliance is broken.\" C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 244 Napolean Hill - The Laws of Success Coaching v facilitation It's noticeable, that team coaching and facilitatio n are often used synonymously. There is, in my view , a distinction between the two. Facilitation focuses o n creating the environment for dialogue. It does no t require specific expertise by the facilitator in the topic under discussion. It focuses on processes for clari fying and making decisions. Coaching adds extra dimensions of creati ng and analysing feedback, sometimes giving specifi c advice, and focusing on performance. These distinctions are currently explorative - as part of the research, w e expect to gather a wide range of views and perspectives. Exercise: In groups of 3 explore what you think the key diffe rences are between Team Coaching and Team Facilitation C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 245 Executive Team Facilitation While specific methodologies vary across consultants and coaches, the unifying theme across all these approaches is that the executives being coached in individual coaching are not expected to become \"per fect\" leaders in any one area; rather, they are each expected to contribute according to their strengths and the ne eds of their team. The same goes for team coaching whic h is not meant to develop perfect teams, but teams that contribute better to their organization. Further, t he successful development of an executive team will yield more effective collaboration, greater alignment in strat egy execution, improved quality, products or servic es for customers, and ultimately, financial returns for th e team and organization. Team size can range anywhere from two to twenty whi le the duration of an assignment can last anywhere from a day to twelve months. Some coaches work with teams on the longer term, every six months and sometimes once a year, accompanying teams in forms of yearly check -ups focused on their past twelve-month progress an d preparing for the coming year. Others also follow-u p executive team coaching processes with organizati on coaching that may involve large groups of up to fif ty or a hundred top managers. These methodologies a re not to be confused with conventions and other top-down del iveries commonly staged by numerous organizations. [2] Executive team coaching differs from executive coac hing in a group setting in that the coaching client is the whole team as a system rather than each of the executives in turn. During executive team coaching sessions, the team works on its usual business , typically running a business meeting, and then is coached on its collective process to achieve results. The focus of the team coaching pro cess is on improving operational interfaces between team members while they work on achieving their objectiv es, rather than focusing on developing each of the executives individually, or simply focusing on impr oving relationships. Executive team coaching is focused on helping all t he team members change their team dynamics regardle ss of the sum of individuals that make up the team. Conse quently, executive team coaching as an approach inh erits from systems analysis or general system theory much more than from more traditional management and psychological approaches. Typically, a team coach does not train or teach, or consult. Only through asking minimal questions an d proposing original, simple team-work processes and architectu res will the coach accompany the team, in order to create conditions for emerging development and growth. Coa ches in general and team coaches in particular have a pull approach or development strategy for their clients. They do not need to have and push pet theories, co ncepts, models, constructs, tools, techniques, games and ex ercises and the such. The team that is being coache d does the work on its own grounds. However, as with any team, contracting is important and must encompass the needs of all members. Often described as a team cha rter, the contract may well have a life after the coaching has been comple ted.

Has your contract addressed the following elements? Procedural How long is the relationship likely to last? What frequency of meetings/ working group / working structure? Where will we meet? (Will this vary?) What notes will be kept? By whom? Where will they be kept? Are they accessible to others? What is the procedure if one of us needs to cancel a session? How will we re-arrange? Do either of us have 'gate keepers' who take messag es or manage our diaries? If so, what will they be told about our relationship? Professional What is the nature of the coaching (traditional, de velopmental, business, life, etc.)? Are we both fully in agreement with that? Have we checked we both have the same understanding of what we mean? What are the Boundaries to our relationship? What issues should the client/student take elsewher e? How will we know when issues are outside our agreed boundaries? What referral options are we aware of (e.g. therapi st, counsellor, business adviser, accountant, etc.) ? What are the expected outcomes from working togethe r? Are we satisfied that the professional level of the contract is within our competence? Have we specified what is outside the contract, such as coach acting on behalf of th e client, or discussing client's performance with a line manager? Psychological What aspects have we brought into awareness that mi ght otherwise have influenced under the surface? Have we both been open about any anxieties or conce rns we have? Have we considered how either of us might unwitting ly sabotage our relationship? Have we planned how to recover trust if something d oes go wrong? Have we addressed the potential dependency issues? The possibility that the client may feel overwhelmed? Or rebellious? What ground rules have we agreed to ensure that eit her one of us will feel comfortable enough to raise any issues with our relationship? If we were to play psychological games, what might the dynamics be? How can we avoid games? C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 249 Team Coaching The role of the team coach is very different to tha t of the one-to-one coach. While the latter may hel p bring into focus the network of intra-team relationships - lin e manager, colleagues and key stakeholders outside the team - the team coach has to facilitate the open and often simultaneous interaction between all of these part ies, often against a background of open or hidden conflict. Where the team coach is also the team leader, it ca n be very difficult to rise above these interconnec tions. The coach in this situation has to rise above the team, taking an independent and objective perspective, w hile at the same time recognising his or her own needs for pers onal change and his or her own direct and indirect influence on the issues the team faces. If the team regards t he leader as a major part of the problem, then his or her capacity to resolve the problem in a coaching style may be significantly reduced. It is, in some ways, like being both a catalyst and a reagent at the same time. In a team where everyone adopts a coaching style to wards their colleagues, it's a lot easier. Issues c ome to the surface and can be discussed openly, in a manner wh ere mutual responsibility is both implicit and expl icit. But getting to that point usually takes a great deal of learning and behaviour change on the part of both the leader and the other team members. Coaches external to the team are often essential in building such a level of intra- team coaching capability. Although the goal for suc h coaches is normally expressed in specific perform ance-based outputs, there is a very strong argument for defini ng the aim of team coaching in terms of bringing th e team to the point where it is largely self-sufficient in co aching itself. The team coach's role - whether internal or externa l to the team -- is also made more complex by the f act that teams are not all the same. As previous CA research has demonstrated, there are at least six different types of team people can be members of - sometimes all at th e same time. These vary in terms of their stability of membership, stability of task, degree of interdepen dence and clarity of structure, reporting lines and purpose. Each team also has its own idiosyncrasies, which co me from historical baggage, personality mix, reputa tion within the organisation and prevailing beliefs (micro-cult ure), all of which influence its ability to perform . Professor David Clutterbuck is one of Europe's mo st prolific and well -known management writers and thinkers. He has written more than 40 books and hundreds of articles on cutting edge management the mes. Co-founder of The European Mentoring Centre and The item Group (a lea ding provider of internal communication solutions), David also of runs a thri ving international consultancy, Clutterbuck Associates, which specialises in helping people in organisations develop the skills to help others . C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 250 The key roles of the team coach Our initial research identifies several core roles for the external team coach, helping the team to: 1. define its purpose and priorities 2. understand its environment 3. identify and tackle barriers to performance 4. build the team learning plan 5. grow confidence in themselves and their leader 6. develop the systems, skills and behaviours to in ternalise coaching Defining the purpose and priorities Like individuals, teams need to know what they are trying to achieve and why before they can focus ful l attention and effort where it is needed. The fad for anodyne mission statements has (thankfully) passed its peak , with at least part of the decline being the result of disil lusionment with the impact of broad statements of p urpose that achieved little in motivating people at the enterpr ise level and probably even less at the team level. In its place, we are seeing more and more reasoned dialogue aroun d what the team is there for. What wouldn't happen if we stopped work? How much would it matter? How can we maximise our team contribution to the overall objec tives of the organisation? - these are all questions that stimulate insight for individuals and teams alike. Understanding the environment Teams exist by consent of external social environme nt (the organisation) and their own members. Where the expectations, purposes, or beliefs of these two for ces conflict, the coach can help identify the sourc e and impact of the conflicts and help the team establish practi cal ways to resolve or defuse them. In recent work with key account managers, one of th e most useful interventions by the coach was to pro vide tools and concepts, by which they could map and man age the four different networks, each needed to ope rate effectively. Two of these networks related to infor mation gathering, in the client companies and in th eir own organisation; two related to getting things done (i nfluencing) in the same two environments. A key rea lisation was that both of the influence networks were in eff ect virtual teams, and needed to be managed as such . One of the key account manager's priority had to be turnin g these from dysfunctional to effective teams. The growth of one-to-one coaching has been much fas ter than team coaching, not least because the latter is more difficult, les s clearly scoped and a less well understood concept in business. In the next five years, we expect to see a lot more employers using team coaching and more coaches expanding their portfolio to include work with teams - and increasing attention to measuring the i mpact of these intervetions. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 251 Identifying and tackling barriers to performance In principle, it's simple. Knowing what the team is supposed to achieve and what it is achieving, you identify and work on the reasons for the gaps. In practice, it t akes a great deal of reflective time, gathering of data and analysis of feedback to establish what the barriers are, whe ther they are external or internal to the team, whe ther they reside within the team as a whole or within specifi c individuals (for example, a skills deficiency), w hether they relate to structures, systems, know-how, or behavio ur. The coach's role is to facilitate the learning dialogue that explores these issues and ensures that \"elephants i n the room\" are acknowledged and dealt with openly. It is also about helping the team recognise and avoid group th ink. Building the team learning plan The team learning plan defines what the team and it s individual members need and want to learn, how th is will contribute to the business purpose and the responsi bilities, each holds to the others in helping achie ve the learning goals. It is as important a document as th e business plan, because it underpins targets and g oals with practical ways of developing capability and capacit y. Growing in confidence A frequent role for the team coach is to work one-t o-one with the team leader and separately with the team members (without the team leader) as well as bringi ng them all together. Crucial here are building the competence to accept and value different contributi ons, to understand the different pressures the team leader is under compared with the team members (and his or he r role in protecting the team from some of those ex ternal pressures) and to develop the feedback processes th at recognise day to day achievements. Developing the systems, skills and behaviours to in ternalise coaching For the team to achieve the level of learning matur ity, where it can do for itself most or all of what a good external coach can do, it needs to develop a qualit y of dialogue well beyond the norm. To achieve thi s, the coach has to make sure that the team does not become depe ndent on the external facilitation. Setting a deadl ine, by which the team will have achieved this level of int ernal sophistication and expertise is helpful, as i s building these competencies into the team learning plan. Maintaining the balance The team coach has a multifaceted role that is neit her fully inside, nor fully outside the team. He or she must be a non-partisan confidant for all the stakeholders wit hin the team, yet able to give sometimes highly cha llenging feedback; encourage the team to think more broadly, yet to maintain focus on the practical; help it ba lance the need for short term performance versus building cap ability for the medium term; and support the team l eader without duplicating or supplanting the line role. M aintaining an appropriate balance is difficult but essential - which is one of the reasons why professional superv ision (in the sense of frequent reflection on pract ice with another experienced coach) should always be part of the deal. The growth of one-to-one coaching has been much fas ter than team coaching, not least because the latte r is more difficult, less clearly scoped and a less well understood concept in business. In the next five y ears, we expect to see a lot more employers using team coaching and more coaches expanding their portfolio to include work with teams - and increasing attention to measuring the impact of these interventions.

NLP was born initially as an alternative school of psyc hotherapy in California, USA, during the mid-sevent ies. It was initiated by John Grinder , a linguistic professor, and Richard Bandler , a mathematician, at the University of California at Santa Cruz (UCSC). The two co-founder s were at the time students of Gregory Bateson at UCSC, and published their first book \"The Structure of Ma gic, I\" in 1975. In this book, they tried to extrac t the rules of human verbal communication, which would be equivale nt to linguistic grammars or to mathematical formul as, by modelling such genius \"therapeutic wizards\" as Milton H. Erickson , the most important hypnotherapist , Fritz Perls , the founder of Gestalt Therapy and Virginia Satir , one of the authorities of family therapy. Since around 1980, NLP has transformed itself from a mere alternative too l to psychotherapy to a full-fledged methodology of \"communicational psychology\", which assists its practitioners in such areas as 1) perso nal development, 2) creativity enhancement, 3) increase d performance, 4) improved communicational skills a nd 5) accelerated learning. NLP provides us with a set of models of the world; they are called NLP presuppositions . NLP doesn't claim that they are necessarily true, but t hey turn out extremely powerful, in the sense that they will assist those who follow those models of the world i n achieving more easily what they really want to ac hieve. NLP Presuppositions NLP provides us with a set of models of the world call ed NLP presuppositions . The main ones are introduced below: \u0001 The meaning of the communication is the response it elicits. \u0001 There are no failures in communication, only outcom es / feedback. \u0001 The map is not the territory. \u0001 Everyone lives in their own unique model of the wor ld. \u0001 People always make the best choices available to th em, given their unique model of the world and of th e situation. \u0001 People have all the resources necessary to make any desired change. \u0001 There is no substitute for clean, open sensory chan nels / listening. \u0001 Resistance you get is a comment about your inflexib ility as communicator; if what you are doing is not working, do something different \u0001 In interactions among people, the person with most flexibility and variation of behaviour can control the outcome of the interaction. The positive worth of an individual is held constan t, while the value and appropriateness of internal and/or external behaviour is questioned. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 262 NLP doesn't claim that these presuppositions are neces sarily true, but they turn out extremely powerful, in the sense that they will assist those who follow those models of the world in achieving more easily what t hey really want to achieve. The importance of all this for effective coaching i s for coaches to make an informed decision about th eir 'way of being' as a coach in order to facilitate strong con nection, trust, intimacy and create a 'safe' space for their clients to share their vulnerabilities. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 263 NLP Communication model Foundation Principles The basis of individual development and learning is personal empowerment. In this section you will consider how you can achieve empowerment and help o thers achieve it too. This frame of mind will help you realise how much impact you can have on al l aspects of your life and how you can use it to reach those goals you are working towards. From Tad James C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 264 Our Filters We filter information in order to make sense of the vast amou nt of information we could pay attention to. Here are some of the main filter mechanisms and determin ants of our experience. Deletion Deletion occurs when we selectively pay attention t o certain aspects of our experience and not others. We then overlook or omit others. Without deletion, we would be faced with much too much information to handle with our conscious mind. In fact, you may have even hea rd that psychologists say that if we were simultane ously aware of all of the sensory information that was co ming in, we'd go crazy. Distortion Distortion occurs when we make shifts in our experi ence of sensory data by making misrepresentations o f reality. This can involve anything from thinking that we rec ognize someone when we in fact don't, to 'imagining ' how a room would look if it were decorated differently. Generalisation Generalization is where we draw global conclusions based on one or two experiences. At its best, gener alization is one of the ways that we learn, by taking the inform ation we have and drawing broad conclusions about t he meaning of the effect of those conclusions. At it' s worst, we can generalize a small number of events and form dis-empowering beliefs about ourselves and our capa bilities and life in general. We are able to delete, distort and generalise infor mation based on a number of factors: our attitudes, decisions and memories and our values, beliefs, language and meta-programmes Values Values are aspects that are important to us. They are essentially a deep, unconscious belief system a bout what's important and what's good or bad to us. Values cha nge with context too. That is, you probably have c ertain values about what you want in a relationship and wh at you want in business. Your values about what yo u want in one and in the other may be quite different. Also values are an evaluation filter. They are how we decide whether our actions are good or bad, or r ight or wrong. And they are how we decide about how we fee l about our actions. Values are arranged in a hier archy with the most important one typically being at the top and lesser ones below that. Beliefs Beliefs are generalizations about how the world is. Beliefs are the presuppositions that we have abou t the way the world is, and either empower or dis-empower us. . So, beliefs are essentially our on/off switch fo r our ability to do anything in the world. In the process of wor king with someone's beliefs, it's important to elic it or find out what beliefs they have that cause them to do what t hey do. We also want to find out dis-empowering be liefs, the ones that do not allow them to do what they want to do. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 265 Language Language describes experiences, they are not the ex perience itself. Often, people's language will inf luence their view of the world, for example bi-lingual people fr equently say that they feel and/or behave different ly when speaking one language compared to another. Meta Programs These are filters which determine what we do and do n't pay attention to. Meta Programs are like a ser ies of windows through which we operate in life. Meta Pro grams are covered in far more detail on the Master Practitioner course C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 266 Supervision What is Supervision? \"Coaching Supervision sessions are a place for the coach to reflect on the work they are undertaking, with another more experienced coach. It has the dua l purpose of supporting the continued learning and development of the coach, as well as giving a degre e of protection to the person being coached\" (Bluckert 2004). \"Coaching Supervision is a formal process of profes sional support, which ensures continuing developmen t of the coach and effectiveness of his/her coaching practic e through interactive reflection, interpretative ev aluation and the sharing of expertise\" (Bachkirova, Stevens and Willis, 2005). \"The process by which a Mentor/Coach/Consultant wit h the help of a Supervisor, who is not working dire ctly with the client, can attend to understanding better both the client system and themselves as part of the cl ient- coach/mentor system and transform their work.\" (Hawkins & Smith-Coaching, 2008) Supervision is a form of experiential learning, ref lection on or in action which results in reflection for action (Carroll, 2007). Supervision is a formal process of professional sup port, made up of a structured and reflective dialog ue which helps us examine our coaching experiences by reflec ting, learning and experimenting as well as celebra ting success, in order to consciously manage our develop ment and raise our own awareness of our safe practi ce for the benefit of our clients, their clients, our prof ession and the coaching community . Proctor (1988) discusses supervision as having thre e main functions; \u0001 Formative and educational; To develop skills, knowledge, att itudes and abilities through reflective practice, the solicitation of professional feedback , exchange of information, observation and practica l experience. To confidentially review and discuss in dividual client cases and learn from other approach es, perspective, theories, models and techniques. \u0001 Normative (quality control); maintaining quality standards a nd ethics to promote safe practice and the welfare of clients and to fulfil requirements for c ertification and accreditation. \u0001 Restorative ; to provide personal and professional support It is likely that supervision will cover all three functions and will take place on a 1:1 or small gro up basis as a long term relationship with an identified supervisor. Th is can be face to face or over the telephone. ICF position regarding Coaching Supervision - Backg round It has become recognized practice that coaches at e very stage in their coaching journey continually se ek development, both personally in terms of deepening their coaching presence and awareness, and professi onally in terms of competencies, ethics and standards. One of the growing trends internationally for undertak ing such C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 267 development is engaging in the practice of 'coachin g supervision' similar in concept to the supervisio n which supports many behavioural science professions. The number of voices globally who have been request ing that ICF give some guidance around this concept is growing and in fact some ICF chapters, as well as s everal training providers have taken steps to furth er define a position regarding coaching supervision. Many parts of the world where coaching is well established al ready consider coaching supervision not only necessary fo r the coach and the client, but also necessary for maintaining the integrity of the profession. There are even cou ntries where regular engagement in coaching supervi sion is part of the hiring criteria for an external coach b eing considered by organizations (e.g., Are you und er supervision and may we check with your supervisor to verify tha t?). Recognizing this trend, a variety of ICF work group s have held discussions with the intent of defining and establishing a clear position regarding coaching su pervision that could be adopted by the ICF. Specifi cally, discussions have taken place in the past within the ICF Credentialing Committee and with some of the credentialing workgroups. More recently a small tea m of subject matter experts met to develop a defini tion and guidelines that could be advanced to the ICF Board for consideration. The recommendations were based o n this work but also took into consideration the definitio n of coaching supervision adopted by the UK chapter . Additionally, a review of the EMCC position on coac hing supervision (mandated by that organization) wa s conducted in order to learn and compare other views /positions on this topic. Major Considerations \u0001 Mentor Coaching vs. Coaching Supervision; One area of confusion around the concept of coaching supervision is about the differences in terminology , between supervision and mentoring. (Currently, IC F defines Mentor Coaching as coaching for the develop ment of one's coaching, rather than reflective practice, coaching for personal development or coac hing for business development, although those aspects may happen very incidentally in the coachin g for development of one's coaching.) Having a clea r definition of coaching supervision is important to help differentiate coach supervision from Mentor Coaching as defined by the ICF. \u0001 Specialized Training; Another common misconception is that coaching supervision is just very high coaching ability and that no additional training/ex perience is required to serve as a supervisor. The awareness that specialized training is needed is ga ining interest but not yet fully embraced by all wi shing to serve in this role. (Please note that at present there are five ICF approved programs that specific ally focus on the training of supervisors and others tha t integrate supervision training as a part of their curriculum. Also note that other organizations such as EMCC are working to recognize training and competency in this area.) Identifying the unique qu alifications, traits, and skills of a coaching supe rvisor and defining how to train coaches to serve in this role will be important in clarifying this misconcep tion. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 268 Operational definition of Coaching Supervision ICF defines Coaching Supervision as follows: \"Coaching Supervision is the interaction that occur s when a coach periodically brings his or her coach ing work experiences to a coaching supervisor in order to en gage in reflective dialogue and collaborative learn ing for the development and benefit of the coach and his or her clients.\" Coaching Supervision is distinct from Mentor Coachi ng for Credentialing. Mentor Coaching focuses on th e development of coaching skills mainly in the contex t of initial development. Coaching Supervision offe rs the coach a richer and broader opportunity for support and de velopment. In Coaching Supervision, the coach is in vited to focus much more on what is going on in their proces s and where the personal may be intruding on the professional. Examples, as developed by the work gr oup are listed as a supplement. Suggested qualifications for those serving as Coach ing Supervisors In the interest of providing some access to Coachin g Supervision in a world which is not yet globally ready to offer sufficient numbers of specifically trained coaching supervisors for the demand that is anticipated, it is proposed that in order to qualify to deliver Supervision for ICF members who wish to pursue this method of pers onal and professional development, the Coaching Supervisor m ust: \u0001 Be an ICF member which implies that the Coaching Su pervisor is familiar with and abides by the ICF Eth ics and Standards and \u0001 Not be under any sanctions from the ICF Independent Review Board for violations of ethical conduct and \u0001 Be an experienced, mature, preferably credentialed coach - at least 3 years FTE practice and \u0001 Has continued expanding exposure to and knowledge o f coaching approaches beyond their original coach training Or \u0001 Be a member of another professional coaching organi zation with a history of using the concept of supervision whose Ethics and Standards the Coaching Supervisor abides by and \u0001 Is not under any sanctions from the Review board of the professional organization to which they belong and \u0001 Is willing to honour the ICF's Ethics and Standards , and Coaching Competencies, which also includes definitions of coaching, the coaching relationship, an ICF coach, the client, and the sponsor \u0001 Is familiar with at least three (breadth of exposur e) different coaching approaches/methodologies The UK ICF chapter have guidelines for recognised C oach Supervisors which include specific training an d The Performance Solution Course meets those needs. It a lso provides much of the content and partial assess ment for the ILM Level 7 Supervision qualification and can a rrange updating to the full qualification. Details on request. C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 269 Guidelines for selection of a Coaching Supervisor The following Traits and Duties for Coaching Superv isors be made available for Coaches who are seeking assistance with making a choice for coaching superv ision. These are not intended as strict requirement s but instead as an initial set of guidelines intended to inform those seeking a Coaching Supervisor. Personal traits of the Coaching Supervisor: \u0001 Evokes a sense of trust and has the ability to conn ect with the coach in terms of fit, chemistry and compatibility. \u0001 Encourages the coach to reach beyond what the coach initially feels is possible \u0001 Demonstrates equal partnership by being open, vulne rable and willing to take appropriate risks, for example, in providing feedback that may make one or both individuals uncomfortable, in the context of the supervisory role \u0001 Understands and is able to model the value of partn ership and encourages the coach to lead in designin g areas to be worked on, in session, in between sessi on, among others \u0001 Is authentic and supports authenticity including ce lebrating who the coach is, her/his achievements an d growth throughout the process. \u0001 Is secure in his/her own work and is able to demons trate appreciation and respect for the unique style of each coach. \u0001 Encourages the development of the coach's own coach ing style within the boundaries of ethical practice \u0001 Contracts to hold both self and coach accountable f or performance and to periodically encourage mutual assessment of the effectiveness of the relationship Duties of a Coaching Supervisor: \u0001 Models effective initiation of client relationship - understands and can convey what the potential coa ch supervisor means by supervision \u0001 Supports coach choice by encouraging coaches to int erview more than one potential 'coach supervisor' i n order to find the best match. \u0001 Explores fully with the coach what they are looking to achieve for maximum clarity about the purpose o f the supervision, establishes measures of success in partnership with the coach and fully discusses fee s, time frame, confidentiality and other aspects of a coach supervision relationship. \u0001 Focuses on full practice development and indicates how they generally work as a supervisor including what is expected from the coach, methodologies and practices used, feedback mechanisms etc \u0001 Demonstrates that s/he is learning about the coach at many levels at once and is able to hold all of t hat in the context of who the coach is, what the coach is seeking and honours the coach's unique style \u0001 Engage in their own on-going supervision \u0001 Value received The Coaching Supervision process has high value for both the Coaching Supervisor and the Coach being supervised. The work group developed the following list of value received as a part of the proposal. Value for the Coaching Supervisor: C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 270 \u0001 Contributing to the further development of the coac hing profession \u0001 Sharpen one's own skills (\"to teach is to learn\") \u0001 Assess and possibly re-create a definition of \"best practice\" for oneself \u0001 Come to appreciate another style of coaching Value for the Coach: \u0001 Environment for customized personal and professiona l growth \u0001 Environment to bring ethical issues \u0001 Environment to bring personal uncertainties and vul nerabilities \u0001 Environment to bring boundary issues \u0001 Diminished risk around ethical issues means diminis hed risk for coach and for coach's clients \u0001 Opportunity to engage in a meta-view of client, com petency, and or practice \u0001 Opportunity to engage in a matrix view of client, c ompetency, and or practice Recommended Practices for engaging in Supervision: \u0001 Be an ICF member (or other professional association ) in good standing, implying subscription to its standards and ethics \u0001 Do some thinking about your learning objectives \u0001 Be willing and commit to applying what you learn \u0001 Be willing to engage in feedback with the superviso r \u0001 If required as part of a group, presenting a case s tudy \u0001 Preparing ahead for each session Supplemental information List of potential aspects covered in Coaching Super vision First, let us stipulate that all of the Mentor Coac h aspects may be included in Coaching Supervision b ut it can and does include many more aspects which a trained Coac hing Supervisor is able to recognize and address. I ssues which reach beyond those in Mentor Coaching and whi ch are often brought to coach supervision at any po int in a coach's professional life may also include (this li st is not exclusive and not in any particular order and some points may seem similar but have a slightly different lang uage): \u0001 Providing appropriate support for the coach's work \u0001 Provide regular opportunities to reflect on the coa ches' work \u0001 Develop skills and strategies that allow the coach to be more effective in their role \u0001 Gain insight and understanding about why things tur ned out the way they did \u0001 Receive feedback on the coaches' actions/approach/b ehaviours \u0001 Be validated and supported as a person and as a pro fessional \u0001 Ensure that the coach is not left to carry alone, d ifficulties, problems etc. as a result of the work that they do \u0001 Have space to offload and express personal response s/feelings that arise as a result of the coach's wo rk \u0001 Plan to use personal and professional resources bet ter C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 271 \u0001 Be proactive rather than reactive \u0001 Manage self in the coaching role \u0001 Check decisions and choices made by the coach in th e course of their work \u0001 Better ensure quality of work.

Inexperienced coaches taking on inappropriate contracts.) Responsibility for required reporting of ethical is sues as determined by the laws in the country which affect the coach - this varies from country to country C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 272 Exercise; Who am I when I am coaching? What is the relationship between me and the client? Who are the clients I connect with best? Who are the clients with whom connection is less ea sy? What areas do I feel less comfortable coaching in? C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 273 Spiral Dynamics Don Beck The dynamic spiral is the framework on which MEME a wakenings and expressions hang. It is the organisin g principle that pulls the 'why' from apparent chaos and translates our values languages. Instead of cla ssifying behaviour or people, Spiral Dynamics guides a searc h for the invisible living MEMEs that circulate far deeper within human systems and pulsate at the choice-maki ng centre in the core intelligences of every person , organisation or society . \u0001 Individuals possess dominant MEMEs which shape thei r life priorities and values from the most basic survival to the global villager and beyond. Child d evelopment involves the awakening, guidance of and learning to express MEMEs in healthy forms at appro priate times. The appearance of new MEMEs often provokes a personal crisis in family and work relat ionships. Executive careers are highly vulnerable t o these conflicts and overloads \u0001 Organisations have MEMEs that will determine their success or failure in the competitive marketplace o r court of social responsibility at their basic cultu ral DNA level. While the task of organisational development has long been to refine or realign the nuts and bolts of what companies do, it is quickly coming to conclude the awakening of new MEMEs. Meme tic change is far more challenging than just working harder or smarter. \u0001 Societies whether local or national, toss to and fr o unless firmly grounded in the critical MEMEs whic h are congruent with the kinds of world they occupy. Both upheaval and stability are products of MEMEs on the move, though few analysts manage to look throug h the fog of confusing ideas to see them C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 274 MEME qualities 1. A MEME contains the basic package of thoughts, moti ves and instructions that determine how we make decisions and prioritise our lives. It has its own sending and receiving channel, organisation design, intensity level, code of conduct and set of assumpt ions regarding the way the world works. 2. MEMEs impact all of life's choices. They are self o rganising entities which elaborate themselves into consistent packages that impact virtually everythin g in our lives. They attach themselves to powerful ideas, people, objects and institutions and each co ntains its own core messages for religion, politics , family life, education, mental health, work and man agement, social order and law. 3. MEMEs express healthy and unhealthy qualities. Heal thy qualities allow and facilitate the positive expression of other MEMEs and unhealthy MEMEs are m alignant and can become closed, locked in and repressive. 4. MEMEs are structures of thinking, and determine how people think or make decisions in contrast to what they believe or value. 5. MEMEs can brighten and dim as life conditions chang e.

It's about knowing what is on your m ind.\" (Jon Kabat-Zinn) Mindfulness involves paying attention 'on purpose' and implies a conscious direction of our awareness; it has its origins in ancient meditation practices. It can be seen as a secular version of Vipassana, which is th e name of a mediation technique in which the practitioner pays attention to sensations as they are, and learns how to accept them as they are. That is one of the core practice to progress on the Buddhist path. Mindfulness bears a close relationship with 'see th ings as they are' and implies an overall mindset wh ich is needed to adopt to pay attention all the time to ev erything. It can be considered an extension of the formal meditation practice into everyday life. The founder of modern day Mindfulness is Jon Kabat- Zinn who founded the Stress Reduction Clinic at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in the l ate 1970's. Since then over thousands of people hav e completed the Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (M BSR) programme to help with conditions as diverse a s chronic pain, heart disease, anxiety, psoriosis, sl eep problems and depression. In the 1990's Mark Williams, John Teasdale and Zind el Seagal further developed MBSR to help people suf fering from depression. Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therap y (MBCT) with Mindfulness. MBCT is cli C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 283 approved in the UK, for exampl e, by the National Institute for Clinical Excellenc e (NICE) as a \"treatment of choice\" for recurrent depression. Focusing our attention to our day to day and busy l ives, it is easy to realize how often we perform di fferent tasks at the same time losing awareness of the present mo ment. We often find really difficult \"to be presen t\" and fail to notice what is positive in our days, fail to hea r what our bodies are telling us, or focus on negat ivity and toxic self critism. Human minds are easily distracted, focus on past ev ents and anticipate the future, this is the same na ture of the mind itself. Becoming more aware of our sensations, feelings and thoughts, and suspending judgement an d self- criticism can have an extremely positive impact on our lives. The seven Pillars of Mindfulness The seven attitudinal factors of mindfulness \"const itute the major pillars of mindfulness practice\" (K abat-Zinn, J. - Full catastrophe living: How to cope with stress, p ain and illness using mindfulness meditation, Londo n: Piatkus 2004) of MBSR and MBCT training and practice. \"The cultivation of mindfulness of moment-to-momen t non-judgmental awareness sounds very simple but i t's actually just about the hardest work in the world f or human beings because we get so caught up in our conditioned states of mind and when we begin to cul tivate awareness it's really important to bring a c ertain attitudinal approach to it so that we're not trying to force anything to happen or sit in the kind of rigid posture or attain some special state that we sort of think, \"A h, that's what it is,\" or \"I'll be enlightened,\" or \"I'll just be or \"I'll be this,\" or \"I'll be that.\" The problem isn't actually with the \"enlightenment\" or the \"permanently wise\" or anything like that. T he problem is with the personal pronouns, I, me, and mine. The y are very very problematic because who we think we are and who we actually are are very different and there's a huge separation. Who we think we are is very very small compared to who we actually are. And so when we are cultivating mindfulness in MBSR or with people we encourage a certain kind of attitude that's brought to the formal and informal practices that you can keep in mind through your daily life as well. And these attitude s - there are seven of them that I put in Full Cata strophe Living when I was writing it because if you start to culti vate acceptance, if you start to cultivate non-stri ving, if you start to cultivate letting go, or letting be, if you star t to cultivate trust and patience, these qualities can be cultivated in everyday life with your children, with your parents , with your partner or spouse, with your colleagues at work and so it's a way of reinforcing and deepening the actu al formal and informal meditation practices\" ((Kaba t-Zinn, J. Video) https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLkgahhWgJW97ADl yc2BYMwOD8wZjcBZ8D&v=kANsRoYcaAo 1) Non-judging \"These judgements of mind tend to dominate our mind s and make it hard for us ever to find any peace\" ( op.cit. p. 33) and can be extremely unhelpful in the context o f meditation and premature judgement and rejection of experience is extremely common. \"Being with\" whatev er arises requires gentleness, kindness and often t he encouragement of a group environment. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwVkxcw1eZE C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 284 2) Patience \"To be patient is simply to be completely in each m oment, accepting it in its fullness\" (op.cit. p. 35 ). To keep bringing the mind back again to the breath, back to sensation of body requires tremendous patience and perseverance. This is the working ground of a medit ation practice. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkW27a8m1mY&t=26s 3) Beginner's mind \"Too often we let our thinking and our beliefs abou t what we 'know' prevent us from seeing things as t hey really are\" (op.cit. p. 35). Approaching each meditation a s if it were your first time, building from \"the gr ound up\" from the body, contacting the breath, asking of yourself \"what is really happening now\" are hallmarks of be ginner's mind. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssqclf52ZpY&t=15s 4) Trust Learning to trust one's own experience, feelings an d intuition \u2014 loosening oneself from the tyranny of authority and inner harsh judgement \u2014 has the \"taste of freed om\", a key hallmark of a genuine practice and essen tial for individual development. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHq_t20tEjQ 5) Non-striving \"Almost everything we do, we do for a purpose, to g et something or somewhere. But in meditation, this attitude can be a real obstacle\" (op.cit. p. 37). The tenden cy to \"driven-ness\" in our culture and society has enabled us to enjoy unprecendented standards of living, comfort a nd security. However, \"driven-ness\" has resulted in extraordinary levels of unsatisfactoriness, stress and other associated problems, and we can inevitab ly bring this tendency into our meditation practice. Within this context, the attitude of \"non-striving\" is best und erstood as not straining or forcing for a result. Loosening up expectations of our meditation practice can be bot h challenging and liberating. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl0DreXY4JI 6) Acceptance \"You have to accept yourself as you are, before you can really change\" (op.cit. p. 38). This attitude is about attending to one's experience with clarity and kind ness, an essential foundation of meditation practic e. Whereas a formal kindness meditation is not taught within t he course material, this quality is inferred to wit hin all the course content. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOGsj0Aklx8 C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 285 7) Letting go \"Cultivating the attitude of letting go, or non-att achment, is fundamental to the practice of mindfuln ess\" (op.cit. p. 39). The tendency to want to hold on to what is pleasant in our experience and to reject what is un pleasant, is usually an automatic response sometime known as bei ng on autopilot (op.cit.). To be asked to neither h old onto, nor to reject experience, is a challenging principl e of MBSR and MBCT courses. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBCithP9JrM To the above seven pillars at a later stage Jon Kabat-Zinn added gratitude and generosity . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6M-ZJLmP4b4 EXERCISE The cultivation of moment-by-moment awareness of ou rselves and our surrounding environment is a practi ce that helps us better cope with the difficult though ts and feelings that cause us stress and anxiety in everyday life. With regular practice of mindfulness, rather than b eing led on auto-pilot by emotions influenced by ne gative past experiences and fears of future occurrences, we roo t the mind in the present moment and deal with life 's challenges in a clear-minded and calm way. Some simple mindfulness exercises can be very usefu l to empty your mind and find some much-needed calm . Mindful Breathing This exercise can be done standing up or sitting do wn, and pretty much anywhere at any time. All you h ave to do is be still and focus on your breath for just one m inute. Start by breathing in and out slowly. One cycle sho uld last for approximately 6 seconds. Breathe in th rough your nose and out through your mouth, letting your breat h flow effortlessly in and out of your body. Purposefully watch your breath, focusing your sense s on its pathway as it enters your body and fills y ou with life, and then watch it work its way up and out of your m outh as its energy dissipates into the world. Mindful Observation This exercise is simple but incredibly powerful. It is designed to connect us with the beauty of the n atural environment. Choose a natural object from within your immediate environment and focus on watching it for a minute o r two. This could be a flower or an insect, or even the cl ouds or the moon. Don't do anything except notice the thing you are l ooking at. Simply relax into a harmony for as long as your concentration allows. Look at it as if you are seei ng it for the first time. Visually explore every as pect of its formation. Allow yourself to connect with its energ y and its role and purpose in the natural world. Mindful Awareness C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 286 This exercise is designed to cultivate a heightened awareness and appreciation of simple daily tasks a nd the results they achieve. Think of something that happens every day more than once; something you take for granted, like opening a door, for example. At the very moment you touch the doork nob to open the door, stop for a moment and be mind ful of where you are, how you feel in that moment and wher e the door will lead you. Similarly, the moment you open your computer to start work, take a moment to appre ciate the hands that enable this process and the br ain that facilitates your understanding of how to use the co mputer. These touch point cues don't have to be physical on es. For example: each time you think a negative tho ught you might choose to take a moment to stop, label the th ought as unhelpful and release the negativity. Or, perhaps each time you smell food, you take a moment to stop and appreciate how lucky you are to have good food to eat and share with your family and friends. Mindful Listening This exercise is designed to open your ears to soun d in a non-judgmental way. So much of what we see a nd hear on a daily basis is influenced by our past experien ces, but when we listen mindfully, we achieve a neu tral, present awareness that lets us hear sound without preconcep tion. Select a piece of music you have never heard before . You may have something in your own collection tha t you have never listened to, or you might choose to turn the radio dial until something catches your ear. Close your eyes and put on your headphones. Try not to get drawn into judging the music by its genre, title or artist name before it has begun playing. Instead, i gnore any labels and neutrally allow yourself to ge t lost in the journey of sound for the duration of the song. Allo w yourself to explore every aspect of track. Even i f the music isn't to your liking at first, let go of your disli ke and give your awareness full permission to climb inside the track and dance among the sound waves. The idea is to just listen, to become fully entwine d with the composition without preconception or jud gment of the genre, artist, lyrics or instrumentation. Mindful Immersion The intention of this exercise is to cultivate sati sfaction in the moment and escape the persistent st riving we find ourselves caught up in on a daily basis. Rather tha n anxiously wanting to finish an everyday routine t ask in order to get on with doing something else, take that regu lar routine and fully experience it like never befo re. For example: if you are cleaning your house, pay at tention to every detail of the activity. Rather tha n treat this as a regular chore, create an entirely new experience by noticing every aspect of your actions: Feel and become the motion when sweeping the floor, sense the muscles y ou use when scrubbing the dishes, develop a more ef ficient way of wiping the windows clean. The idea is to get creative and discover new experiences within a fam iliar routine task. Instead of labouring through and constantly thinkin g about finishing the task, become aware of every s tep and fully immerse yourself in the progress. Take the ac tivity beyond a routine by aligning yourself with i t physically, mentally and spiritually. Who knows, you might even enjoy the cleaning for once! Mindful Appreciation C.O.A.C.H e-GUIDE 287 In this exercise, all you have to do is notice 5 th ings in your day that usually go unappreciated. The se things can be objects or people - it's up to you. Use a notepad t o check off 5 by the end of the day. The point of this exercise is to simply give thanks and appreciate the seemingly insignificant things in life; the things that support our existence but rarely get a second thought amidst our desire for bigger and bet ter things. For example: your clothes provide you warmth, your nose lets you smell the flowers in the park, your e ars let you hear the birds, but... Do you know how these things/processes came to exis t, or how they really work? Have you ever properly acknowledged how these thing s benefit your life and the lives of others? Have you ever thought about what life might be like without these things? Have you ever stopped to notice their finer, more i ntricate details? Have you ever sat down and thought about the relati onships between these things and how together they play an interconnected role in the functioning of t he earth? Once you have identified your 5 things, make it you r duty to find out everything you can about their c reation and purpose to truly appreciate the way in which they s upport your life.
