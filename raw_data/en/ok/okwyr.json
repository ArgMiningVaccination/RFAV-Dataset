Thus itendeavors toputthe human body insuch anormal, healthy condition there isnotsome reason fortheastonishing spread and popularity ofthese therapeutic innovations ? Their success undoubtedly isbased onthefactthatthey concentrate their best efforts onpreventive instead of combative oftreating disease.
