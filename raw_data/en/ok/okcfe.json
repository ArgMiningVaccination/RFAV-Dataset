Shared priorities of interest across the collaborative include Violence Prevention , Mental Health, Infrastructure and Economic Development. A Violence Prevention sub -group was formed, with the expectation that additional sub -groups would be created as needed to advance the overall work. Since August 2021, the Violence Prevention sub -group has held planning workshops and meetings to coordinate investment efforts to reduce violence in Cook County leveraging the significant American Rescue Plan federal relief funds. Initial planning discussions by the Violence Prevention sub -group included: Established the common goal to work together to reduce duplication of efforts and increase coordination and impact in communities who have disproportionately been impacted by violence and disinvestment of infrastructure and resources Established common definitions for violence reduction efforts, using a public health lens Reviewed data on current year funding at the program, grantee and geographic level Shared priorities for upcoming funding (including ARPA) Agreed on two priorities for coordination going forward, and Launched two working groups to focus on these priorities. Those working groups are: Intervention Solicitations and Capacity BuildingARPA Roadmap to Recovery: Intergovernmental Municipal Coordination Communication + Coordination + Collaboration5The two working groups are collaborating to achieve the stated objectives and approach: Priorities Objective Approach Priority 1: Align strategy for intervention* solicitationsBy aligning on key aspects of intervention -focused solicitations, public funders can: streamline the process for applicants/recipients maximize targeted impact of fundingA. Map out timing / sequence of relevant solicitations and communications to applicants B. Use common definitions for street outreach/eligible services and individuals at highest risk of violence (target population) C. Use common data/methodology to target funding to communities with highest violence D. Agree on common metrics for reporting by recipients Priority 2: Integrate approach to capacity buildingBy aligning on approaches for capacity building to support current/potential recipients of public violence prevention funding , public funders can: avoid duplicative efforts maximize support for recipients to scale and achieve outcomesA. Map current state of funding and need for capacity building (by type: nonprofit organizational development, applying for and managing public funding, and programmatic) B. Identify who is best positioned to provide support to which types of orgs, where, with which type(s) of capacity building C.
