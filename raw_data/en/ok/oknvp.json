Although these commercials appear to feature nothing more than a soothing fragrance, there's a lot more to it. In actuality, traditional plug-in air fresheners are more than just pleasant scents. Underneath the jasmine flowers or lilies lie chemicals you likely can't pronounce, and ones that can potentially (and unfortunately) can harm one's health or the well-being of their family members. If you're looking to do an overhaul on your household products, a good place to start is with non-toxic plug-in air fresheners. Making the switch is pretty darn easy (it's as simple as swapping one plug-in for another!) and it's something that you can enjoy in your home every day.

Are for You? The short answer? Air fresheners made with toxic chemicals aren't exactly the best thing to be inhaling in your home. It's up to every individual person to weigh the risks of anything you bring into your living spaces. Maybe you just can't part with your fave Summer Rain-scented plug-in, but luckily, there are plenty of alternatives out there that can be better for your overall health. Toxins in Air Fresheners Like many [fragranced](https://www.thefiltery.com/synthetic-fragrance-hidden-toxic-chemicals/) household and personal care products, companies tend to include chemicals in air fresheners that make the manufacturing process easier and are typically less expensive. Although these chemicals are more convenient, they're not exactly ideal for people who then breathe in the chemicals after using the air fresheners in their homes. One [2017 study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132316304334) in Building and Environment reported that 20% of the U.S. population has experienced not-so-great health effects from air fresheners. This study includes more acute effects like migraine headaches, asthma attacks, mucosal symptoms, infant illness, and breathing difficulties. It doesn't take into account the potential longterm downstream affects of regularly inhaling endocrine disrupting chemicals, such as infertility or even cancer. Air Fresheners and Indoor Air Pollution Air fresheners and plug-ins (like [Wallflowers](https://www.thefiltery.com/bath-and-body-works-wallflowers-safe-toxic-humans-dogs-cats/) or [Glade](https://www.thefiltery.com/are-glade-plugins-safe-or-toxic/)) can cause indoor air pollution. Many people don't know that indoor air pollution can actually be [worse](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0160412086900516) than outdoor air pollution! Since, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), we spend around 90% of our lifetime indoors, indoor air quality is an important aspect of our homes to consider. Traditional air fresheners, personal care items, and [cleaning products](https://www.thefiltery.com/best-non-toxic-cleaning-products/), each with scents and chemicals, can waft into the air, decreasing air quality and resulting in health problems. Are Plug-In Air Fresheners Toxic? Now let's talk about the specific chemicals of concern that can be found in traditional plug-in air fresheners. According to [MADE SAFE](https://www.madesafe.org/toxic-chemicals-in-air-fresheners/)\u00ae, the organization that has helmed America's first non-toxic product seal, traditional air fresheners can include the following less-than-desirable chemicals: Benzene: Known for its sweet smell, this chemical comes from crude oil, coal, or natural gas. It is a known [carcinogen](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/understanding-cancer-risk/known-and-probable-human-carcinogens.html). There's an even higher chance your air freshener may contains benzene if you're using an aerosol spray. In recent years, lab testing has found benzene contamination in a variety of aerosol spray products, from [dry shampoo](https://www.thefiltery.com/best-non-toxic-dry-shampoo/) to deodorant to [sunscreen](https://www.thefiltery.com/non-toxic-sunscreen/). Formaldehyde: That same liquid used to preserve animals seen in biology classes makes its way into air fresheners and other household products. Also known for its industrial germicide and fungicide properties, the [National Cancer Institute](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/substances/formaldehyde/formaldehyde-fact-sheet#can-formaldehyde-cause-cancer) lists it as a carcinogen. Toluene: A chemical produced during gasoline manufacturing, toluene can be used as a solvent and is frequently found in aviation and automotive fuels. It is also a known [carcinogen](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/understanding-cancer-risk/known-and-probable-human-carcinogens.html). Xylene: This chemical has a sweet scent that naturally occurs in petroleum and coal and can be found in aviation fuel, gasoline, and cigarette smoke. It is often found together with benzene, toluene, and ethylbenzene to group together what's known as \"BTEX\" chemicals. Phthalates: These endocrine-disrupting chemicals are commonly used in air fresheners (as well as other fragranced personal care products like soap and shampoo). In these types of goods, phthalates are commonly used to make [fragrances](https://www.thefiltery.com/synthetic-fragrance-hidden-toxic-chemicals/) last longer. However, you'll never see phthalates listed on the ingredient label because they're (legally) hidden under the term \"fragrance.\" Phthalates can have many serious downstream effects, [including](https://www.safecosmetics.org/chemicals/phthalates/) fertility problems, developmental/reproductive issues, and cancer. Other Allergens and Mystery Ingredients: It's not just phthalates that can be hidden under the \" [fragrance loophole](https://www.thefiltery.com/synthetic-fragrance-hidden-toxic-chemicals/),\" however. Under U.S. law, there are about 4,000 different chemicals that manufacturers can include in their product under the simple word \"fragrance\" (or \"parfum\"). Many of these ingredients are perfectly safe, while others of them including endocrine disruptors (like phthalates, referenced above), carcinogens, and allergens. This makes it practically impossible for consumers to take control over what they're consuming. Other VOCs: People use the acronym \"VOC\" to refer to \"volatile organic compounds.\" It's a blanket term for lots of different types of chemicals that can easily vaporize at room temperature, potentially resulting in more air pollution. It should be noted that pretty much all air fresheners (even the natural ones) have VOCs in them (that's even how some of them work, by releasing VOCs into the air). But some VOCs are safe, while others can be toxic. (Those are the ones most people think of when they hear the term \"VOC\"!) One [2011 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3018511/) in Environmental Health Perspectives tested 25 different home products that included air fresheners and detected an astounding 133 different VOCs. Close to half the products generated at least one of 24 carcinogenic pollutants. You can read more about VOCs [here](https://www.thefiltery.com/volatile-organic-compounds-vocs-list/). Air Freshener Poisoning Symptoms Air fresheners can bring about a number of health concerns, whether they're inhaled, make contact with the skin, or are ingested. These poisoning symptoms can either take place over the long-term or in the short-term. Some of the more acute symptoms can include: - Rash and skin irritation - Allergy symptoms - Asthma attacks - Hormone disruption - Throat irritation - Stomach upset - Coughing - Fatigue - Vomiting Are Conventional Air Fresheners Toxic to Pets? Since these chemicals can be harmful to humans, it should come as no surprise that they can be unsafe for our furry friends, too. In fact, they can be even tougher on their systems since their lungs and other organs are smaller than ours. Just like us, dogs, cats, and other pets can be susceptible to symptoms like respiratory irritation, lethargy, nausea, and unfortunately, cancer. There's also the added concern that your pets may try to ingest the liquid in the plug-in, which could sadly result in poisoning. Should I Give Up My Plug-In Air Fresheners? If you are moving toward an increasingly low-tox or toxin-free lifestyle, it can be a wise decision to part with your usual plug-in air fresheners. But don't fret! Luckily, there some great non-toxic and natural alternatives you can turn to that don't use all those sneaky ingredients. Are There Any Safe & Non-Toxic Plug-In Air Fresheners? The short answer is: yes! Look beyond traditional store shelves and you'll likely find a whole world of natural air fresheners online or in natural foods stores. It's promising that non-toxic options are also starting to be sold by nationwide retailers as well. Many plug-in air freshener alternatives could also be called \"mini plug-in diffusers\" that emit essential oils into the air instead of chemicals. Non-toxic pluggable air fresheners are undoubtedly safer to use than ones with toxic ingredients, but even natural air and fabric fresheners do come with caveats. For example, if you use a new essential oil that you haven't used previously, you may experience a reaction anyway if you're allergic to it. Also, some essential oils aren't safe to release into the air if you have a pet (i.e., tea tree is poisonous to pets, even when inhaled in the air). That's why it's a smart idea to do your homework before using an essential oil. Find out which ones are best to use around pets (i.e., lavender is usually safe to use around animals). The second you start to react to a non-toxic air freshener\u2014look for signs like coughing, irritated eyes, headache, and dizziness\u2014unplug it and get medical attention if needed. Next time, consider trying a different oil. A Quick Note for Chemically-Sensitive Folks Although the brands below prioritize safe, transparent ingredients and are free from things like phthalates, those who are extremely sensitive to fragrances in general may still fine them to be too strong. Ever since I became ill from mold, I am much more sensitive to fragrances (even non-toxic ones!). Even though I do use the brands below in my home, fragrances of any kind are still too much for me sometimes, and I have to go completely fragrance-free in my home. I've noted which brands offer the ability to customize the strength of the scent! 5 Of the Best Non-Toxic Plug-In Air Freshener Brands for Your Home Okay, now let's get to it!

Save by signing up for a subscription. Customizable Scent Strength? Yes This company crafts scent refills that fit into traditional plug-ins that are on the market (such as AirWick).
