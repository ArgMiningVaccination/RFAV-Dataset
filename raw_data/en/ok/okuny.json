She is Director of the Diabetic Nephropathy Clinic, Director and Chair of the Peggy and Harold Katz Drug Discovery Institute, Assistant Professor of Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology and Candidate Global Head of Discovery in Cardiovascular and Metabolism at Hoffman-La Roche in Basel. Dr. Fornoni received her medical degree from School of Medicine, University of Pavia, Italy. She completed sub-internship at University Hospital I.R.C.C.S, Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, in Obstetrics, Surgery, Pediatrics, Internal Medicine and Emergency Medicine and her internship on Nephrology and Dialysis Unit at University Hospital Policlinico San Matteo. Dr. Fornoni obtained a Ph.D. Degree in Medical Pharmacology at the University of Pavia, Italy. Dr. Fornoni is a physician-scientist who has maintained a resolutely focused research program that has provided novel and seminal contributions to our understanding of the pathogenesis of kidney disease. Her work was the first to uncover how chronic inflammation in diabetes may negatively affect pro-survival insulin signaling pathways in podocytes (Kidney International, 2008; NEJM, 2010). She was the first to describe that insulin resistance occurs in podocytes prior to the onset of microalbuminuria in diabetic nephropathy (Kidney International, 2008). In an attempt to elucidate the mechanisms of insulin resistance in podocytes and pancreatic beta cells, she reported a key role of the stress-activated-protein-kinase JNK (Kidney International, 2009, Diabetologia, 2008). More recently, she uncovered that impaired reverse cholesterol transport strongly contributes to podocyte insulin resistance and apoptosis in diabetes (Diabetes 2013). Dr. Fornoni also uncovered how nephrin regulates pancreatic beta cell function (Diabetes, 2010, JBC, 2012). While maintaining a primary focus on diabetes, she has expanded her research interests to another glomerular disorder that shares several aspects with diabetic nephropathy, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Her seminal work in this area was the first report that rituximab protected from recurrent FSGS after transplantation. Her studies demonstrated that rituximab has beneficial off target effects in cells other than B-lymphocytes, such as podocytes, through modulation of sphingomyelin related enzymes (Science TM, 2011). She was the first to recognize the de novo appearance of B7-1 in transplanted kidneys of patients with FSGS and to contribute to a new study describing the utilization and mechanism of action of abatactept in B7-1 positive proteinuric kidney diseases (NEJM, 2013). She has developed and patented new assays to predict proteinuria in patients with glomerular diseases (Science TM, 2011; Diabetes, 2013). Finally, she has also substantially contributed to several collaborative studies that have resulted in high-impact publications (Nature Medicine and Journal of Clinical Investigation, 2011) attesting to her abilities as an integral member of \"team science\". Dr. Fornoni's research has been supported by grants from National Institutes of Health and private foundations. She has received prestigious awards, invited to write reviews for prestigious journals (e.g. NEJM), was nominated to the editorial board of Diabetes, presented at national and international meetings, served as grant reviewer for NIH, ADA and AHA and is the PI on two NIH-sponsored clinical trials. She has 69 peer review publications, 15 as first author, 14 as senior author, and 19 as corresponding author. Her contributions have been published in high impact journals: Journal of Clinical Investigation, NEJM, Science Translational Medicine, Journal of Biological Chemistry, Diabetes, Kidney International and the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology.

Dr. Barth A. Green is Professor and Chairman of the Department of the Neurological Surgery at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. He is a world-renowned specialist in the surgical management of complex spinal cord injuries and disorders and a co-founder of \"The Miami Project to Cure Paralysis\", the largest and most comprehensive spinal cord injury and paralysis research center in the world. He is board certified in Neurological Surgery and is a Fellow of the American College of Surgeons. Dr. Green retired as a Lt. Colonel in the US Army Medical Reserve Corps, after 37 years of service. Dr. Green is also a co-founder and Chairman Emeritus of Shake-A-Leg Miami, an adaptative watersport center which combines education with recreation. This innovative program annually serves over 12,000 children and adults with physical, developmental, and economic challenges. Aside from these important initiatives here in the United States, Dr. Green co-founded Project Medishare for Haiti 16 years ago to help improve the health status of Haiti's citizens through an integrated, bottoms-up, community approach to development. Before the disastrous earthquake on January 12, Project Medishare was serving over 85,000 Haitians in the poorest and most isolated areas of Haiti. Dr. Green's service efforts extend beyond Haiti, as a co-founder of the University of Miami's Global Institute for Community Health and Development, a university-wide program focused on improving healthcare and advancing community development, focusing its efforts in the Western Hemisphere. Immediately after the earthquake on January 12th, Dr. Green gathered a small group of doctors and traveled to Haiti in a private airplane, taking with them what they could in a short time in order to provide emergency medical care to victims of the earthquake. Initially working out of the United Nations facility at the airport in Port-au-Prince, Dr. Green and his team treated hundreds of critically injured and ill Haitians every day. While Dr. Green was in Haiti, his colleagues at UM Global Institute / Project Medishare established a massive relief program and airlift bringing thousands of volunteers and tons of medical supplies and equipment to Haiti. The airport field hospital that started in the tents of the United Nations evolved to become the only trauma/critical care center in Haiti. On June 7th, the hospital relocated to a renovated Hospital Bernard Mevs / Project Medishare in downtown Port-au-Prince and is presently staffed by over 100 Haitian healthcare providers and an international team of volunteer mentors. The University of Miami / Project Medishare field hospital treated over 30,000 patients and performed over 1,500 emergency surgeries since the earthquake and served as the only referral center for all severe trauma in Haiti. Its skilled team of volunteers served as the coordination center for patient transfers between hospitals in Haiti and the USNS Comfort, as well as the evacuation of the most critical patients to the US and other assisting countries. Haiti now has an unprecedented number of disabled citizens as a result of the earthquake, and the Haitian health system is not equipped nor are its professionals properly trained to address these special health issues, as exemplified by the thousands of post-earthquake amputees. Dr. Green and his team are working with the Haitian Ministry of Health and numerous NGO partners to enable those injured by the earthquake to have productive lives and access to the same opportunities and facilities that their able-bodied fellow citizens will enjoy. A year before the earthquake, Dr. Green joined hands with a coalition of leaders of the Haitian healthcare and business sectors and with career representatives from the government, to create a public/private partnership. This group developed a strategic plan for a national system for Critical Care / Trauma / Rehabilitation - focused on the five preventable causes of death in Haiti (Major Trauma, Heart Attack, Brain Attack / Stroke, Severe Burns, and Maternal Emergencies) - as well as a national disaster response plan. When funded and functional, this national system and plan will complement Haiti's new national healthcare strategy and plan, without burdening the government financially. A plan for fiscal sustainability is based on the creation of a catastrophic health insurance program wherein private funds will support this partnership's public mission. Dr. Green's passion and energy are contagious and his personal commitment and dedication are totally focused in helping to convert this incomprehensible tragedy into something good for Haiti; now and in the future; the creation of a well-functioning healthcare system t hat can serve Haiti's citizens in a manner that was never considered possible in the past. 2010 Keynote Speaker - Donna E.
