It contains various chemicals, including flavonoids, terpenoids, and organic acid compounds. This study aimed to review the vascular protective effects and molecular mechanisms of hawthorn and its extracts on cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Hawthorn has a wide range of biological functions. Evidence suggests that the active components of HE reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, regulate lipid levels to prevent lipid accumulation, and inhibit free cholesterol accumulation in macrophages and foam cell formation. Additionally, hawthorn extract (HE) can protect vascular endothelial function, regulate endothelial dysfunction, and promote vascular endothelial relaxation. It has also been reported that the effective components of hawthorn can prevent age-related endothelial dysfunction, increase cellular calcium levels, cause antiplatelet aggregation, and promote antithrombosis. In clinical trials, HE has been proved to reduce the adverse effects of CVDs on blood lipids, blood pressure, left ventricular ejection fraction, heart rate, and exercise tolerance. Previous studies have pointed to the benefits of hawthorn and its extracts in treating atherosclerosis and other vascular diseases. Therefore, as both medicine and food, hawthorn can be used as a new drug source for treating cardiovascular diseases. - This article is part of the themed collection: [Food & "}
