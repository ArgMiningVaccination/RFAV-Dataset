Crew will continue to be vaccinated. Masks Currently, masks for guests are optional in all sailing areas. Mask policies continue to evolve. Windstar follows policies in place in each destination. Windstar highly recommends guests wear masks in indoor public spaces. Here at Windstar Cruises, the health and safety of everyone on board is a top priority. The Beyond Ordinary Care program is a multi-layered strategy with key hospital-grade elements: HEPA filters and UV-C ultraviolet germicidal irradiation to filter and disinfect the air, plus electrostatic sprayers to sanitize all surfaces throughout the yacht. We have made a multi-million dollar investment in our fleet in an effort to provide a healthy environment while sailing on a Windstar yacht. Hospital grade high-efficiency particulate (HEPA) filters along with a UV-C air zapping process (ultraviolet germicidal irradiation) have been installed on board all Windstar yachts. Our Beyond Ordinary Care program was developed with consultation and review by the Senior Medical Director in the UC Health Infection Control and Prevention Department at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and implements a rigorous multi-layered approach of science-led best practices aimed at keeping everyone aboard healthy.
