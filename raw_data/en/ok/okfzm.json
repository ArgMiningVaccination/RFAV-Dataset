Reiki is a gentle hands-on healing technique that promotes a deep level of relaxation and healing on a physical, mental, emotional and spiritual level. Reiki uses the Universal Life Force energy to break up energy blockages within the body, allowing healing energy to flow again freely and stimulating the body's natural ability to heal itself. It reduces stress and anxiety and brings the body, mind, emotions and spirit into balance. When our life energy is low, we tend to feel unwell, becoming more vulnerable to illness. Your Reiki Practitioner channels energy, both within and around you, to accelerate your body's natural healing capacity, to release tension and encourage balance and inner harmony. Reiki is particularly recommended at times when you feel physically out of sorts or disconnected from your emotions. Allow 60 minutes $110 I Sat/Sun $120 Wear loose comfortable clothing.

It is a mysterious ladder which reaches from earth to heaven, from illusion to truth, from darkness to light, from pain to bliss, from restlessness to abiding peace, from ignorance to knowledge. Your private session will involve yogic breathing techniques called Pranayama which is generally defined as breath control through breathing exercises. On a physical level these breathing techniques keep the lungs at maximum expansion and therefore achieve optimum ventilation. On the subtle energy level, Pranayama works on opening the nadis (the human body has over 72,000 energy channels) increasing the energy flow and therefore contributing to optimum health, longevity and mental capacities. Ultimately control of the Prana leads to control of the mind going beyond one's normal boundaries or limitations and attain a higher state of vibratory energy.
