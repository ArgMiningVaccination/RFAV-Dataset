Fairfax-Columbo and David DeMatteo ABSTRACT Generic drugs are significantly less expensive than their brand name counterparts, and the use of generic drugs has increased drastically in recent years, representing upwards of 75% of all prescriptions filled in the United States. A large amount of this increase is due to states' adoptions of generic substitution laws, or laws that allow for the substitution of generic drug formulations in place of their brand name counterparts. Theoretically, generic drugs are just as effective as their brand name alternatives; in fact, the FDA requires that generic fo rmulations demonstrate \"bioequivalence,\" meaning that they show absorption rates of active ingredients that are within a range of 80-125% of that of brand name drugs. Despite their theoretical equivalence, generic and brand name drugs can produce disparate results and side effects. This is problematic when states employ substitution schemes in which no notification of either the physician or patient is necessary for the pharmacist to substitute, and is especially problematic when these conditions are met and substitution is mandated. This problem may be exacerbated for individuals with chronic mental illness, where reduced effectiveness of generic medications can produce individually and societally detrimental outcomes and where differential side effects might interfere with already poor medication compliance rates.

INTRODUCTION In March 2008, Andrew Richards was sitting in front of his television when he collapsed suddenly, stating that he felt as if he had been hit with a bolt of lightning. 1 While Richards was indeed felled by electricity, it did not come in the form of lightning; rather, it came in the form of abnormal electrical ac tivity in his brain\u2014in other words, a seizure. 2 Richards, who suffers from depressive symptoms, contends that his seizure was the result of generic substitution, or the process of his pharmacist switching him from a 300 milligram (mg) prescription of Wellbutrin XL, a brand name antidepressant, to a generic version of the drug manufactured by Teva Pharmaceuticals USA.3 R i c h a r d s indicated that immediately following the switch he began to experience \"jolts and jerks,\" and that while he and Teva came to a settlement in the civil suit that followed his seizure, he still experiences spasms and other lingering effects associated with the episode. 4 While Richards' \"jolts and je rks\" may have been warning signs of an impending seizure, in reality warning signs regarding the potential deleteri ous effects of Teva's generic had existed for over a ye ar prior to his attack.5 I n 1 Charles Seife & Rob Garver, No Substitute: When a Generic Drug Isn't What it Seems, PROPUBLICA (Apr. 15, 2013, 8:17 AM), http://www.propublica.org/article/no-substitute-when-a-generic-drug- isnt-what-it-seems, archived at http://perma.cc/VA6Y-WWT5. 2 Id.

As of October 10, 2013, the FDA, having 286 I NDIANA HEALTH LAW REVIEW Vol. 12:1 FDA then retracted its approval of the generic, prompting Teva to voluntarily withdraw the drug from the market.20 The above example is an extreme case\u2014theoretically, bioequivalence testing before generic drugs enter the market should weed out future similar cases. However, the underlying message is the same: just because drugs feature the same and similar amounts of an active ingredient, it is not necessarily ensured that the drugs will perform equivalently. This Article argues that, in general, and at least as regards psychotropic medications, or medications designed to treat and manage the symptoms of mental health disorders, generic subs titution schemes that do not provide for notification or consent of either patients or their doctors are misguided. Part II provides an overview of generic substitution and outlines the different ways that states approach it. Part III discusses scientific issues with generic substitution, exploring the limits of pharmacokinetic studies and th e theory of bioequivalence. Part IV examines the efficacy and effectiveness 21 in treating four major categories of mental illness, considers the benefits and detriments of generic substitution for consumers, and discusses treatment and legal issues that are particular to substituting psychotropic medications. Lastly, Part V proffers several solutions for policy change asked pharmaceutical companies produc ing generic versions of Wellbutrin XL 300mg to carry out bioequivalence studies, has determined that three of the four producers, Actavis, Inc., Mylan, Inc., and Par Pharmaceuticals satisfied bioequivalence standards but one, Watson, did not.

II. GENERIC DRUGS AND SUBSTITUTION : DEFINITION , STANDARDS , AND APPROACHES A. Generic Drugs: What are They? Generic drugs are lower-cost drug alternatives that contain the same active ingredients as their brand name counterparts, but vary in terms of other characteristics, such as drug name, appearance (size, shape, color, etc.), and inactive ingredient makeup.22 Generic drugs are regulated by the FDA, and must fulfill several requirements as compared to brand name drugs to obtain approval: 1) they must contain the same active in gredients; 2) they must be identical in strength, dosage, form, and route of administration; 3) they must be manufactured according to FDA standards for branded drugs; 4) they must have the same intended use; 5) they must meet the same batch requirements for identity, stre ngth, purity, and quality; and 6) they must be \"bioequivalent.\" 23 This Article is chiefly concerned with the last requirement. Generic drugs must be \"bi oequivalent\" to their brand name counterparts, meaning th at they must show similar bioavailability, defined as \"the rate of and extent to which the active ingredient or active moiety is absorbed from a drug product and becomes available at the site of action\" 22 DEPRESSION & BIPOLAR SUPPORT ALLIANCE , GENERIC AND BRAND NAME DRUGS : UNDERSTANDING THE BASICS 4 (2007), available at http://www.dbsalliance.org/pdfs/GenericRx.pdf. 23 What are Generic Drugs? , U.S. FOOD & DRUG ADMIN ., http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/BuyingUsin gMedicineSafely/UnderstandingGenericDrugs/ucm144456.htm, archived at http://perma.cc/59XM-GVFS (last updated May 12, 2009). 288 I NDIANA HEALTH LAW REVIEW Vol. 12:1 under experimental conditions.24 The concept of bioequivalence is premised on the assumption that if two drugs have similar concentrations and absorption rates in terms of their shared active ingredient, they will be \"similarly safe and effective.\" 25 A generic is considered to be bioequivalent when bioavailability ranges between 80%- 125% of the brand-name reference drug with 90% confidence, meaning there is a reasonable certainty that at least 90% of the time the av erage bioavailability of the generic drug will fall within that range.26 Further, bioequivalent drugs exist in two types: pharmaceutical equivalents and pharmaceutical alternatives.27 B. State Approaches to Generic Substitution States consider six factors in formulating their generic substitution laws: 1) whethe r to require pharmacists to utilize the Orange Book (an FDA publication listing/providing guidelines for which generic medications are considered to be bioequiva lent); 2) whether to mandate substitution; 3) whether to create a state drug formulary; 4) 24 Jesse C. Vivian, Generic Substitution Laws , 33 U.S. P HARMACIST 30 (2008), available at http://www.uspharmacist.com/content/s/44/c /9787/, archived at http://perma.cc/Q2K6-5EQP. 25 Pierre Blier & Diane M. Sloan, Q & A: Generic Substitution for Psychotropic Drugs , 14 CNS S PECTRUMS 1, 4 (2009), available at http://www.cnsspectrums.com/UserDocs/0909CNS_Q_A_Blier.pdf, archived at http://perma.cc/7N3H-9N3P. 26 Jaime R. Hornecker, Generic Drugs: History, Approval Process, and Current Challenges , 34 U.S. P HARMACIST 26, 26-30 (2009). In bioavailability trials, the FDA is concerned with three things compared to the branded drug: the generic's area under the curve (AUC), C max, and T max. AUC refers to the mean extent to which a drug's active ingredient is absorbed by the body. C max refers to the mean peak concentration that the active ingredient reaches in the body. T max refers to the mean time it takes for an active ingredient to reach its C max.

NTI drugs are dangerous because the ranges at which these drugs produce therapeutic and toxic effects are close together, making it easy to cross one threshold into another.

Nearly all states allow for physicians to preemptively override substitution by marking prescriptions to be filled with the branded medication only. See AVALERE HEALTH , LLC, supra , at HUMAN SERV., supra , at Appendix A. However, given the decreasing amount of time that doctors are spending with their patients, sometimes as little as eight minutes for newer doctors, it is unclear how often doctors and patients discuss preferences for brand name medications.

SCIENTIFIC ISSUES WITH GENERIC SUBSTITUTION Though many states favor generics because they cost less than their brand name counterparts and are theoretically equally effective, generic drugs remain controversial due to concerns over the way in which bioequivalence testing is carried out and concerns because generics have differing inactive ingredients from the brand name drug, which can impact drug performance. This section will explore these two drawbacks in detail. A. The Limits of Pharmacokinetic Studies The bioequivalence of generic drugs is typically tested via pharmacokinetic studies in which the test generic and branded reference drugs are compared in terms of how 31 See Vivian, supra note 24; A VALERE HEALTH , LLC., supra note 30, at 4; U.S. DEP'T OF HEALTH & HUMAN SERV., supra note 30, at Appendix A. As of 2008, four states allowed for mandatory substitution without consent being required: Massachusetts, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Washington. Seven other states allow for substitution without consent: Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, and Tennessee. Vivian, supra n o t e 2 4 .

First, bioequivalence studies typically involve sample groups of healthy adult male volunteers who take no other medications, do not smoke, receive a controlled diet, are of average height and weight, and are between 18 and 55 years old. 36 A s s u c h , these samples necessarily exclude any investigation of the impact of individual differences in patients that might influence the performance of a medication. 37 This is undesirable because it violates a basic premise of statistics: to extrapolate findings to a po pulation, a sample needs to be representative of that populati on. A sample such as the one described likely is not repres entative of all the patient populations to which the resu lts of the pharmacokinetic study will be extrapolated , least of all the patient population with the actual illn ess or disorder that the drug is designed to treat.38 Second, the use of a single regulatory acceptance range may be problematic for NTI drugs, or \"drugs for which a relatively small change in systemic concentration can lead to marked changes in pharmacodynamics response.\" 39 I n fact, a bioavailability difference as small as 3.5% may yield clinical consequences.40 Using anticonvulsants as an example, this small difference could result in seizures at the 34 Id. 35 Id. 36 Peter Meredith, Commentary: Bioequivalence and Other Unresolved Issues in Generic Drug Substitution , 25 C LINICAL THERAPEUTICS 2875, 2878-79 (2003). 37 Id. 38 Id. at 2879. 39 Id.

In actual use, few drugs are administered in single doses; instead, most drugs require maintenance of a steady regimen to achieve the desired therapeutic result. 46 The level of drug present in a patient following maintenanc e of a steady medication regimen is usually substantially higher than the drug levels present with just a single-d ose administration, making bioequivalence studies that do not account for this regimen especially problematic.47 Also, evidence indicates that the differing inactive ingredients present in generic drugs may influence the metabolism, absorpt ion, and distribution of a drug's active ingredient wh en on a steady maintenance regimen in ways that are not observable following a single-dose administration. 48 Lastly, an experiment consisting of a single-dose administration may not properly capture the 41 Id. 42 Blier & Sloan, supra note 25. 43 Meredith, supra note 36, at 2878. 44 Id. 45 Id. at 2879. 46 Id. 47 Id. 48 Id. 2015 A RE BIOEQUIVALENTS REALLY EQUAL ? 293 effects of drugs that have variable pharmacokinetic profiles the way that a multi-dose experiment might.49 B. Bioequivalence: Do Generi c Drugs Really Produce the Same Effects as Brand Names? Although generic drugs are theoretically thought to produce the same results as th eir brand name counterparts, in reality this may not be tr ue. Though generic and brand name drugs share active ingr edients, they may differ in terms of their inactive ingredients or the salt form in which the active ingredient is presented. 50 These inactive ingredients and differing salt forms can impact the performance of generic drugs in a number of ways. Inactive ingredients can influence the effects of a generic drug in two ways. First, and perhaps most obviously, some individuals may be allergic to the inactive ingredients in generic drug formulations, rendering the generic intolerable. 51 Second, generic and brand name drugs may contain different excipients, or inert substances included in a drug to assist in the process of drug manufacturing, administration, and active ingredient absorption. 52 These excipients may trigger, promote, or partake in chemical or physical interactions with a drug's active ingredient that can jeopardize drug performance and quality. 53 Chemical interactions between active in gredients and excipients may result in drug intolerability, diminished drug safety, and 49 Id. at 2880. 50 Meredith, supra note 36, at 2880. A drug's salt form refers to an \"ionisable drug that has been combined with a counter-ion to form a neutral complex.\" Producing a drug in salt form makes it more chemically stable, allows its pharmacokinetic profile to be manipulated, and allows for easy administration.

First, the salt form of a drug's active ingredient impacts its aqueous solubility, which can lead to disparate in vivo dissolution characteristics between generics and brand names.59 This is important because the dissolution characteristics of a drug determine its active ingredient's extent and rate of absorption.60 Second, differential salt forms of an active ingredient can generate toxicity concerns due to the different conjugate an ions or cations used to form the salt compound as well as chemical impurities that may arise during salt formulation.61 T h i r d , a n a c t i v e ingredient's salt form may influence its tolerability, causing undesirable side effects such as stomach irritation or 54 Id. 55 Id. 56 Pawel Lewek & Przemyslaw Kardas, Generic Drugs: The Benefits and Risks of Making the Switch , 59 J.

A. How Effective are Generics at Treating Mental Illness? 1. Bipolar Disorders Bipolar disorders are mood disorders characterized by the tendency of an individual to vacillate between moods, with the most notable moods being manic (or hypomanic) episodes and major depressive episodes. 73 Manic episodes are characterized by an extended period of excessive elation or euphoria, often in combination with hyperactivity, decreased need for sleep, and grandiosity; major depressive episodes are characterized by an extended period of severe depression in conjunction with sleep disturbances, decreased interest in and experience of pleasure of 70 Enjoli Francis, Psychotropic Drugs: What are They? , ABC N EWS HEALTH BLOG (Dec. 2, 2011, 5:04 PM), http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/health/2011/12/02/what-you-need-to-know- about-psychotropic-drugs/, archived at http://perma.cc/4HDB-LZA6. 71 NAT'L INST.

Mood stabilizing drugs are drugs that are generally considered to produce antimanic effects while either not worsening or alleviating depressive symptoms; however, some have prop osed a more tailored definition, suggesting that mood stabilizers are those drugs that both alleviate acute manic and depressive symptoms as well as prevent manic and depressive symptoms.

Results from a 1979 study found sub-therapeutic levels of lithium in the blood for generic as opposed to branded lithium-based mood stabilizers. 90 Regarding anticonvulsants, one study indicates that depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts worsened upon switching from branded divalproex to generic valproic acid (though this occurred in a patient with schizophrenia), and several studies suggest an increase in gastrointestinal side effects when taking generic versus branded valproic acid. 91 Several studies have indicated potential deleterious side effe cts for generic as opposed to branded lamotrigine, with one study observing increases in anxiety, mood swings, dizziness, agitation, headaches, insomnia, and bad taste in the mouth, and another study observing side effects of ataxia, falls, and vertigo. 92 2.

Schizophrenia and Psychotic Disorders Schizophrenia is a psychotic disorder characterized by a mixture of cognitive, emotional, perceptual, speech, and behavioral disturbances. Common symptoms include disorganized speech, displaying inappropriate emotions or flat affect, experiencing hallu cinations and/or delusions, paranoia, and catatonic movement. 123 Schizophrenia affects about .7% of people at some point in their lives, and the disorder can produce numerous deleterious effects for the individuals who suffer from it, as well as cast a significant financial burden on society; it is estimated that the cost of treating schizophrenics ma y exceed $60 billion annually. 124 Schizophrenia is a chronic disorder. Even with treatment, full and complete recovery is rare; however, psychotic symptoms tend to subside over time.125 As such, the treatment focus for those with schizophrenia is often not on curing the disorder but on mana ging its symptoms.

First, although antipsychotics can help to alleviate symptoms of schizophrenia, they only do so in about 60% of individuals. 127 Second, medication adherence rates for those with schizophrenia are low, with some studies finding that nearly three-quarters of those with schizophrenia stop taking their medi cations within eighteen months. 128 Third, antipsychotics can produce a host of uncomfortable side effects, such as grogginess, blurred vision, dry mouth, akinesia, and motor abnormaliti es, which contribute to the aforementioned low medication adherence rate.129 Though the treatment of schi zophrenic individuals with branded medications already presents some difficulties, these difficulties can be compounded when generic medications are utilized. Although some studies suggest generic and branded first-generation antipsychotics perform equivalently, other studies suggest that patients on generic versions may require increased dosage adjustments and may experience exacerbated side effects, such as unprovoked outbursts and drowsiness. 130 S i m i l a r l y , although a handful of stud ies have demonstrated the efficacy of generic clozapine in treating schizophrenia, another handful have suggested that individuals receiving generic clozapine experience either worsened symptoms or relapse at greater rates than do individuals on branded versions. 131 Regarding another antipsychotic, risperidone, 126 Kiran Panesar, 20, 2012), http://www.uspharmacist.com/content/d/web_exclusive/c/37743/.

Benefits and Detriments of Generic Substitution of Medications for Consumers The substitution of generic versions of psychotropic medications provides at leas t one potential benefit to consumers. Although inactive ingredients in generic medications may influence the way that drugs are absorbed into the body, this risk is more severe for drugs with narrow therapeutic indexes; the risks of differential effectiveness of generic in comparison to branded drugs is less pronounced for psychotropic drugs with high therapeutic indexes. 134 To this end, the cost savings provided by using generic psychotropics may be well worth the small risk of differential effectiveness between generics and brand names for drugs with high therapeutic indexes. For some drugs, the costs savings can be substantial; for example, the branded amphetamine Adderall\u00ae 135 costs approximately $84 for a 30-day supply, whereas generics Dexedrine\u00ae and dexamphetamine cost over $50 less for the same thirty-day supply. 136 Similarly, a 60% increase in the dispensing of generic antidepressants decr eased medication costs by 9%.137 Additionally, this reduction in price may also indirectly impact treatment compliance; lower copays may increase the likelihood that consumers are willing to persist in therapy.138 132 RISPERDAL, Registration No. 1830761. 133 Desmarais et al., s upra note 90, at 755. 134 Laura LaDue, Generic Psychotropic Medications: Issues of Cost- Effectiveness and Patient Benefit , 104 S.

First, as discussed above, generic psychotropics, at least for some individuals, may not be as effe ctive at treating their mental illness as brand name psychotropics.139 S e c o n d , t h e substitution of generic psyc hotropics, at least under schemes without the requirement of notification or consent of the consumer or doctor, ma y infringe on individuals' autonomy in making thei r own medical decisions. 140 Third, generic substitution tends not to reflect consumer preferences. In a 2009 survey of 1047 people, researchers found that while a majority of Americans support the idea of generic substitution, 10% th ought that generics caused a greater number of side effects compared to branded drugs, one-third of individuals expressed some degree of discomfort with generic substitution, and only 38% expressed a personal preference for generics, a result that is contradictory given that a majority reported favoring the idea. 141 This suggests that Americans may believe that generic drugs are right for others, but not for themselves. This effect is less pronounced in younger, more educated consumers, but is also strongly influenced by the seriousness of the illness being considered, with individuals expressing a greater preference for brand-name drugs for more serious illnesses. 142 C. Why Should We Care? Though there may be both bene fits and detriments to the substitution of generic psyc hotropics, the detriments outweigh the potential benefits for three reasons. First, some mental illnesses are chronic diseases, meaning that individuals with those disorders who are treated with 139 See supra Part III(A). 140 See infra Part III(C)(3). 141Halle H\u00e5konsen A Review of Patient Perspectives on Generics Substitution: What are the Challenges for Optimal Drug Use , 1 G ENERICS & BIOSIMILARS INITIATIVE J. 28, 30 (2012). 142 LaDue, supra note 134, at 713. 308 I NDIANA HEALTH LAW REVIEW Vol. 12:1 medications will likely face numerous medication decisions in their lifetime. Second, give n that medication is a favored treatment for some mental he alth disorders, medication adherence is a concern and may be negatively impacted by the substitution of generic ps ychotropics. Third, generic substitution of psyc hotropic medications may lead to several unanticipated problems, such as difficulty in determining criminal liability under both utilitarian and retributivist theories as well as exposing pharmacists to liability for the potential differential impacts that can arise from generic substitution. Fourth, the re cent United States Supreme Court ruling in Mutual Pharmaceutical Co., Inc. v. Bartlett and the Court's holding in PLIVA, Inc. v. Mensing limits the ability of individuals injured by a generic drug to seek remedy.143 1. Mental Health Disorders as Chronic Disorders Of the four aforementioned mental disorders, schizophrenia, MDD, and bipolar are viewed as chronic conditions. Roughly 75% of individuals afflicted with schizophrenia will experience alternating periods of relapse and remission during the course of their lifetime, with full recovery constrained to under one-fifth of cases. 144 Regarding bipolar disorders, re cent research suggests that bipolar manifests itself in a chronic course \"characterized by periods of residual symptoms, emotional dysregulation, sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances, cognitive impairment, and increased risk for psychiatric and medical comorbidity between mood episodes.\" 145 Considering major depressive disorder, research suggests that it is an episodic yet persistent condition, with about three-quarters of individuals who reached clinical levels of depression 143 Mut.

Medication Adherence Given that medication is a key part of treatment for schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, and bipolar, medication adherence is essential. Despite its importance, many individuals with mental illness do not comply with their medication regimens; some estimates indicate that as many as half of individuals on medication for psychiatric illness are not fully adherent. 149 This is problematic, as non-adherence may lead to p oor treatment outcomes such as relapse, weakened treatment benefits, and hospitalization.150 A number of factors may influence non-adherence. Some non-adherence is related to characteristics of individuals, such as a lack of insight into their disease, forgetfulness, the severity of the illness, experiencing depressive and psychotic symptoms, low cognit ive ability, and substance 146 Gavin Andrews, Education and Debate: Should Depression be Managed as a Chronic Disease? , 322 BMJ 419, 419-20 (2001). 147 Nat'l Alliance on Mental Illness, Major Depression Fact Sheet , NAMI 1 (2013), http://www.nami.org/factsheets/depression_factsheet.pdf; Nat'l Alliance on Mental Illness, Bipolar Disorder Fact Sheet , NAMI 1 (2013), http://www.nami.org/factsheets/bipolardisorder_factsheet.pdf; Nat'l Alliance on Mental Illness, Schizophrenia Fact Sheet , NAMI 1 (2013), http://www.nami.org/factsheets/schizophrenia_factsheet.pdf. 148 See supra Part II(A)-(D). 149 Boosting Medication Adherence to Psychotropic Drugs , MPR (Sep. 5, 2013), http://www.empr.com/boosting-medication-adherence-to-psychotropic-drugs/article/310444/. 150 Alex J.

Reasons and Solutions in Psychiatry , 13 A DVANCES IN PSYCHIATRIC TREATMENT 336, 338 (2007). 310 I NDIANA HEALTH LAW REVIEW Vol. 12:1 dependency.151 Some non-adherence stems from the therapeutic alliance, with individuals who perceive their doctor as helpful, tr ustworthy, and collaborative more likely to be adherent than those who do not perceive their doctor in those ways. 152 Still other non-adherence may be influenced by external factors, such as stigma, cost, and availability.153 However, most important to this Article is that some non-adherence stems from factors having to do with the medications themselves. Research indicates that individuals are less likely to be adherent when they experience adverse side effects from a medication, such as weight gain or sexual dysfunction. 154 Research also indicates that individuals are mo re likely to be adherent to a brand name as opposed to a generic medication.155 Additionally, medication switching influences adherence\u2014individuals who notice repeated changes to the shape, color, or packaging of their medications are less likely to be adherent to a medication regimen than those who do not experience such changes. 156 This influence may be magnified for individuals wi th psychotic symptoms, who may perceive such changes to be indicative of maltreatment. 157 Given the many re asons individuals may not be adherent to their medi cation, including brand name medications, it seems foolhardy to compound these reasons by introducing the possible detrimental effects of switching individuals from a brand name to a generic without their consent. 3. Patient Autonomy: The Ri ght to Medical Decision Making In addition to presenting scientific and treatment concerns, generic substitution may present a legal concern 151 Id. 152 Id. at 339. 153 Id. at 338. 154 Id. 155 Id. 156 Correll & Carbon, supra note 119. 157 Id. 2015 A RE BIOEQUIVALENTS REALLY EQUAL ? 311 by detrimentally impacting patient autonomy. The right to medical decision making ha s long been considered a fundamental right, as evidenced in the United States Supreme Court cases of Griswold v. Connecticut ,158 Roe v. Wade ,159 and Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health .160 In Griswold , the Court established a penumbral right to privacy that included an inability of the government to restrict a couple's access to contraceptives. 161 In Roe, a case in which a woman's right to an abortion was disputed, the Court held that abortion was a private medical decision and a fundamental right under the Due Process Clause.162 158 381 U.S. 479 (1965). 159 410 U.S. 113 (1973). 160 497 U.S. 261 (1990). A fundamental right is one which is \"deeply rooted in [the] Nation's history and tradition\" such that it is \"implicit in the concept of ordered liberty\" and that \"neither liberty nor justice would exist if they were sacrificed.\" Washington v. Glucksburg, 521 U.S. 702, 721 (1997) (quoting respectively Moore v. Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 503 (1977) (plurality opinion); Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319, 325-26 (1937)). Fundamental rights can only be restricted when a jurisdiction has a compelling purpose to do so and its scheme is narrowly tailored to the purpose. Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 302 (1993). 161 Griswold , 381 U.S. at 484-86. In Griswold , plaintiffs Griswold (Executive Director of Planned Parenthood League of Connecticut) and Buxton (Medical Director of the Planned Parenthood League of Connecticut) were arrested for providing contraceptive counseling to married couples in violation of a Connecticut statute preventing contraception by medical means. Id. at 480. The Court held the law to be unconstitutional, reasoning that it \"operate[d] directly on an intimate relation of husband and wife and their physician's role in one aspect of that relation,\" that such a relationship fell within the penumbral right to privacy emanating from the First, Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Ninth Amendments, and that the law, in prohibiting the use of contraceptives, swept too broadly and exacted \"the maximum destructive impact upon that relationship.\" Id. at 481-87. 162 Roe, 410 U.S. at 162-67. Roe involved plaintiff Jane Roe (pseudonym), a pregnant woman who desired a legal abortion to terminate her pregnancy. Id. at 120. At the time, abortion was illegal in her home state of Texas unless it was necessary to protect the life of the mother. Id. at 119. Roe argued that Texas's blanket prohibition of abortion in all other instances amounted to an invasion of her penumbral privacy rights stemming from the First, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments, and as such was unconstitutional. Id. at 120. The Court agreed, holding the right to an abortion to be a 312 I NDIANA HEALTH LAW REVIEW Vol. 12:1 In Cruzan , a case in which a vege tative woman's right to refuse life support was at issue, the Court held that competent individuals have a right to refuse medical treatment if they so choose.163 Extending these holdings to generic substitution, taking prescription medication is a private medical decision, much like abortion or contraception. Additionally, much like Cruzan , competent individuals should have the ability to refuse medical treatment, mean ing that individuals should have an opportunity to dissent to the substitution of a generic in place of a brand name medication\u2014this is not possible under generic substitution schemes that require no notification or consent. As su ch, the right of individuals to confer with their doctor and choose which medications they would like to be prescribed should be a fundamental right fundamental right and that while Texas had some compelling reasons for restricting abortions, such as prot ecting health and potential life, a blanket prohibition was broad enough that it exceeded the bounds of those compelling interests. Id. at 162-67. The Court held similarly in a lesser-recognized companion case to Roe, Doe v. Bolton . Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179 (1973). Doe involved plaintiff Mary Doe (pseudonym), a married woman who desired the ability to obtain a legal abortion in her home state of Georgia. Id. at 185. At the time, Georgia law prohibited abortion except in cases where it was necessary to save the life of the mother, where the pregnancy was the re sult of rape, or where the child was at risk of being born with a serious defect or disability; additionally, the statute contained a host of procedural restrictions. Id. at 182-84. Doe alleged that Georgia's prohibition of abortion in all cases not involving these exceptions violated her penumbral privacy rights emanating from the First, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments. Id. at 184-86. Utilizing similar reasoning to Roe, the Court reaffirmed its Roe holding that abortion for women was a fundamental but not absolute right and that numerous of the procedural restrictions on abortion were invalid as being overly broad. Id. at 189-202. 163 Cruzan , 497 U.S. at 278. Cruzan involved the case of Nancy Cruzan, a woman who had fallen into a vegetative state as a result of injuries sustained in a car accident. Id. at 265-66. Cruzan's parents wanted her removed from life support, but hospital staff refused to do so absent a court order. Id. at 267-68. Although the Court held that individuals did have a fundamental right to refuse life-saving medical treatment, it also upheld a Missouri standard requiring clear and convincing evidence of an incompetent individual's desire to refuse this treatment. Id. at 277-86. 2015 A RE BIOEQUIVALENTS REALLY EQUAL ? 313 with which the government, by way of using a pharmacist as a proxy, should not be able to interfere. In addition to considering the right to medical decision making to be a fundamental right, the Court has held that persons with mental illness have a right not to be coerced into treatment or into taking a medication, as illustrated in the landmark cases of O'Connor v. Donaldson164 and Washington v. Harper ,165 as well as subsequent decisions such as Perry v. Louisiana ,166 Riggins v. Nevada ,167 and Sell v. United States .168 I n O'Connor v. Donaldson , the Court held that it was unconstitutional to forcibly confine a non-dangerous individual with mental illness for the purposes of treatment when he was capable of living in the community either on his own or with assistance. 169 I n Washington v. Harper , the Court ruled that the state could forcibly medicate an inmate with antips ychotics, but restricted such forcible medication to situations in which the state had sufficiently shown that the inmate constituted a danger to himself or others and that the medication prescribed was in his best medical interest, indicating a right of non-dangerous individuals not to be medicated against their will. 170 164 422 U.S. 563 (1975). 165 494 U.S. 210 (1990). 166 498 U.S. 38 (1990). 167 504 U.S. 127 (1992). 168 539 U.S. 166 (2003). 169 Donaldson , 422 U.S. at 576. O'Connor v. Donaldson involved the case of Kenneth Donaldson, a Florida man who had been civilly committed to a mental hospital due to paranoid schizophrenia. Id. at 564-66. Though he posed no danger to himself or to others, J.B. Connor, the hospital superintendent, refused to release Donaldson, deeming that he would be unable to adjust to deinstitutionalized life. Id. at 566-67. However, trial testimony indicated that Donaldson was capable of securing employment outside the hospital setting, and that he had the support of numerous individuals willing to assist him upon his release. Id. at 568. 170 Harper , 494 U.S. at 233-36. Harper involved the case of Walter Harper, a Washington man convicted of robbery. Id. at 213. While imprisoned, he initially consented to be treated with antipsychotic drugs to treat symptoms of schizophrenia; however, he later withdrew that consent and was medicated against his will. Id. at 214-15. In an earlier case, Vitek v. Jones , the Court held that the involuntary transfer of an 314 I NDIANA HEALTH LAW REVIEW Vol. 12:1 In Perry v. Louisiana , the Court per curiam vacated a ruling of the Louisiana Suprem e Court that authorized the forcible medication of an inmate for the purpose of declaring the inmate competent for execution.171 Riggins v. Nevada concerned the right of an inmate to refuse medication that would render him competent to stand trial; the Court held that forcible medication for this purpose was unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause unless the state could show that such forcible medication was medically appropriate and that competence could not be restored through less intrusive means. 172 Last, following the framework set by Riggins , in Sell v. United States the Supreme Court held it to be unconstitutional to forcibly medicate a prisoner for the sake of restoring competence to stand trial unless the medication was in furtherance of an important government interest (to be decided on a case-by- case basis); substantial certainty existed to believe that the medication woul d render the individual competent without the substantial risk of detrimental side effects; less intrusive alternative meas ures that could restore competency did not exist; and, that the administration of medication was \"medic ally appropriate.\" 173 inmate to a state mental hospital for treatment of a mental or disease or defect, absent notice and a hearing, violated a prisoner's Fourteenth Amendment right to due process. 445 U.S. 480, 492-93 (1980). 171 Perry , 498 U.S. 38 (1995). 172 Riggins , 504 U.S. at 133-36. Riggins involved the case of David Riggins, a Nevada man accuse d of robbery and murder. Id. at 129. While awaiting trial, Riggins complained that he was having auditory hallucinations and was having trouble sleeping, and was prescribed antipsychotics. Id. at 129. Riggins moved for a determination of his competence to stand trial and was found competent; upon this finding, Riggins argued that he wanted to assert an insanity defense against trial, and it was a violation of his Due Process rights to medicate him as it (1) would not allow him to show his natural state at trial and (2) the drug's negative impacts on him would impede his ability to contribute to his defense. Id. at 129-30. The prosecution argued that, since taking him off antipsychotics would render Riggins incompetent to stand trial and Nevada law prohibited the trial of incompetent individuals, Riggins could be compelled to take antipsychotics. Id. at 130. 173 Sell, 539 U.S. at 180-186. \"Medically appropriate\" means that, in light of the individual's medical condition, the administration of drugs is in his best medical interests. Id. at 181. 2015 A RE BIOEQUIVALENTS REALLY EQUAL ? 315 In applying these holdings to the issue of generic substitution, the Supreme Court has made it clear that, at least regarding prisoners with mental illness, forcible treatment and medication is to be considered a measure of last resort. This is interesting in light of the Court's holding in Turner v. Safley , which indicated that, given reduced individual liberty and security concerns in prisons, prisons should be given deference in the restriction of prisoners' rights provided that such restrictions were \"reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.\" 174 If prisoners, whom the Court has recognized as being subject to liberty and rights restrictions not imposed upon everyday citizens, are not subject to medication ag ainst their will except under a strict set of circumstances, why then would it be fair or constitutional to allow indivi duals who are mentally ill to have a generic drug substituted for a brand name drug when their will regarding such substitution is not known, as in generic substitution schemes that do not involve a consumer's or doctor's notification or consent? Third, generic substitution may constitute a battery under tort law. Most jurisdictions provide for battery actions for patients who di d not consent to a medical treatment. 175 A majority of jurisdic tions allow for patients to recover when they consent to a medical treatment but the physician deliberately deviates from the patient's wishes; additionally, some jurisdictions hold that physicians will be held liable if they provide medical treatment to which a patient has not given express or implied consent.176 An argument can be made that this conception of medical battery should apply to generic substitution, at least in the abstract. First, although pharmacists are not physicians, they play a role in the treatment process as the gatekeepers of medications. Second, under permissive substitution schemes, pharmacists can exercise their discretion in choosing to fill a patient's prescriptions with a generic, effectively allowing them to make a treatment 174 482 U.S. 78, 89 (1987). 175 Nancy J. Moore, Intent and Consent in the Tort of Battery: Confusion and Controversy , 61 A M. U. L. REV. 1585, 1646 (2012). 176 Id. at 1648. 316 I NDIANA HEALTH LAW REVIEW Vol. 12:1 decision for a patient. Third, under a scheme that is both permissive and does not require patient or doctor notification, a ph armacist might ostensibly make a treatment decision but never n eed to inform the patient, thus never providing the patien t an opportunity to render either express or implied consent to the pharmacist. Given the fact that generic substitu tion may allow for pharmacists to facilitate administration of a treatment without obtaining consent, a pharmacist who deci des to substitute a generic drug that has differential effectiveness or detrimental side effects compared to a brand name drug should be liable for battery, at least from a theoretical perspective. All three of the above issues illustrate potential concerns that may arise when considering the impact of generic substitution on pati ents' rights to have a voice in their medical treatment. The Supreme Court has long recognized the privacy of individuals' medical decisions with their doctors and the right of indi viduals not to be medicated without their consent. Ostensibly, tort law should allow for patient recovery if consumers are provided with medication for which they did not consent. Although not all generic substitution schemes are subject to these problems, schemes involving no notification arguably are, and as such should be viewed as a violation of a consumer's right to autonomy in medical decision making. 4. Seemingly Overlooked Problems: Criminal Culpability and Pharmacist Liability Another legal reason for concern regarding generic substitution stems from the seemingly overlooked problems of criminal culpability and pharmacist liability. Considering criminal culpability, so-called \"psychotropic defenses\" are gaining popularity, as evidenced in both news reports 177 and in the 2013 film Side Effects .178 The defense 177 Dan Childs & Lauren Cox, Did the Drugs Make Him do it? The Zoloft Defense , ABC NEWS (June http://perma.cc/AF6T-CP7F; Defense , THE COURANT , Feb. 25, 2015 A RE BIOEQUIVALENTS REALLY EQUAL ? 317 is predicated on controversial research, which indicates that some psychotropic drugs may sp ur an adverse reaction in the form of violent behavior.179 Although controversial, adverse reactions to psychotropic drugs should diminish culpability, at least theoretically. Under the American system of justice, punishment is justified under two main theories: utilitarianism and retributivism. 180 Utilitarianism is predicated on the idea that punishment can function as a social good, helping to protect society and offenders through general and specific deterrence, rehabilitation, and isolation. 181 Retributivism, on the other hand, has its foundation in morality\u2014for justice to be served, a wrongdoer must be punished for his actions.182 Applying the principles of punishment to the psychotropic defenses, at least in the context of substitution that requires no notification, under utilitarian rationales individuals' behavior cannot be deterred if it is not a function of their personality but rather a byproduct of a reaction to a medication people did not know that they were taking. Additionally, punishment of an individual claiming a psychotropic defense would not serve the purposes of rehabilitation and isolation\u2014proper rehabilitation in this instance would not be punishment but rather would be switching the individual back to a medication regimen that was tolerable and did not produce the adverse effects that precipitated a crime, thus rendering no need for isolation. Similarly, under a retributivist rationale in which moral wrongdoing is punished, it is hard to see how justice might be served by punishing individuals whose volition may have 2000, http://articles.courant.com/2000-02-25/news/0002250027_1_lyme- bank-robbery-mental-health, archived at http://perma.cc/AM4-MPPK. 178 SIDE EFFECTS (Open Road Films 2013).

Raymon eds., 2004). 180 Albin Eser, The Nature and Rationale of Punishment , 28 CARDOZO L. R EV. 2427, 2427-29 (2007). 181 Id. 182 Id. 318 I NDIANA HEALTH LAW REVIEW Vol. 12:1 been impaired by a drug th ey did not know they were taking, negating any intention to do wrong. Another controversial defense that generic substitution may engender is involuntary intoxication. Under common law, a defense of involuntary intoxication may arise when a defendant ingests a substance that induces an adverse reaction that triggers criminal activity, and that substance was ingested due to the negligence or malpractice of a physician or the malevolent intentions of another person. 183 Though an involuntary intoxication defense usually stems from the ingestion of alcohol or an illegal drug, some courts recognize the defense when the criminal action is precipitated by a wrongly admi nistered medication or by a medication administ ered correctly but that produced an unexpected effect. 184 Extended to the example of generic substitution, a medication may be interpreted to be wrongly administered when consumers thought they were taking a brand name medication but in re ality were taking a generic. This can also happen when consumers experience adverse reactions to a medication that they did not expect based on their understanding of the br and name medication that they thought they were taking. A second unanticipated concern is pharmacist liability. Considering that the ability for pharmacists to substitute is granted by the state and states have an incentive to keep drug costs down, it might seem intuitive that pharmacists would be shielded from liability in the event that a generic produced differential effects than associated with a brand name drug. In reality, this is not the case. In a survey of its closed pharmacist liability cases in the United States during a ten-year window from January 1, 2002 to December 31, 2011, the insurance provider CNA/Healthcare Providers Service Organization (HPSO) found that 1.9% of its wrong drug dispensation cases involved the failure of a pharmacist to verify the equivalency of a generic prior to substitution and that 3% of its medication mismanagement cases involved the failure of a pharmacist to inform a 183 WELNER , supra note 171, at 635-37. 184 Id. 2015 A RE BIOEQUIVALENTS REALLY EQUAL ? 319 consumer of the change to a generic form of a drug.185 Although not constituting a substantial portion of CNA/HPSO closed pharmacist liability cases, these cases indicate that pharmacists do not enjoy absolute immunity from lawsuits and that they should not be surprised if an injured individual takes ac tion against them for the substitution of a generic drug. 5. Limitation of Remedies for Persons Injured by Generic Psychotropics and Competitor Liability A final legal cause for concern regarding generic psychotropics is the lack of a path to recovery for individuals injured by them. 186 Two recent Supreme Court cases have obscured this path: PLIVA, Inc. v. Mensing187 and Mutual Pharmaceutical Co., Inc. v. Bartlett .188 Mensing arose when two individuals filed suit when they developed tardive dyskinesia after receiving a generic version of Reglan by way of substitution starting in 2001 and 2002. 189 The two individuals sought recovery under a theory of failure to warn, claiming that the generic version of Reglan that they were provided did not provide warning that taking the drug for longer could cause tardive dyskinesia.190 In 2004, subsequent to Respondents' 185 CNA/Health Providers Service Organization, 2013 Pharmacist http://perma.cc/4RBM-725P visited Nov. 23, 2014) (explaining that wrong drug dispensation is a legal claim and medication mismanagement is an ethical claim). 186 Maren Carbon & Christoph U.

Bartlett arose when Respondent received a prescription for brand name Clinoril to treat shou lder pain, but instead was dispensed a generic version. 194 Shortly after receiving the generic, Respondent, a resident of New Hampshire, became afflicted with an acute case of toxic epidermal necrolysis that disfigured, disabled, and nearly blinded her. 195 At the time, Clinoril did not have a warning label apprising consumers of the possibility of toxic epidermal necrolysis. 196 Respondent filed suit under theories of design-defect and failure to warn, claiming that New Hampshire law required drug manufacturers to ensure the safety of the design of their product, which could be established by way of adequate warning about a drug's potential hazardous effects. 197 Relying on its holding in Mensing , the Court again held that federal regulations requiring generic drugs to employ the same warning labels as their branded counterparts preempted stated law, and that Mutual could not have changed its warning labels to address the 191 Id. at 2572-73. 192 Id. at 2577-78. 193 Id. 194 Mut.

LEXIS 26219, at *16-20 (N.D. Ill., Feb. 28, 2014). 322 I NDIANA HEALTH LAW REVIEW Vol. 12:1 V. WHAT SHOULD WE DO? The previous three sections established that generic substitution is a prevalen t practice, that generic psychotropics may not always perform equivalently to branded drugs, and that there are a host of legitimate reasons to be concerned about generic substitution schemes as they apply to people in general and specifically to individuals with mental illness. It would be impractical to think that generic substitution could be abolished. As such, this section will provide several brief suggestions for reform to mitigate some of the issues surrounding generic substitution of psycho tropic medications. A. Eliminate Mandatory Generic Substitution Mandatory generic substitution is the most coercive form of substitution in that it does not allow for discretion on the part of pharmacists, physicians, or consumers. This is exacerbated in a scheme that provides for both mandatory substitution and does not requ ire consent or notification\u2014in these instances, consumers do not even realistically have a choice to not take the drug as they may have no knowledge that they have been switched to a generic until they experiences some type of advers e consequence. By allowing for at least the discretion of pharmacists who could face liability if they do not verify the equivalence of a generic to a branded drug, at least one (albeit limited) safeguard is placed against the dispensation of a potentially less effective or even harmful generic psychotropic drug. B. Notification and Consent Another potential solution is to require that all substitution schemes require ei ther consent or notification of patients or their physicians before substitution can take place. In permissive schemes, obtaining consent from either patients or physicians places autonomy back in the hands of patients and their doctors by allowing them to choose if they are comfortable with substi tution, consistent with 2015 A RE BIOEQUIVALENTS REALLY EQUAL ? 323 aforementioned constitutional and common law ideals regarding medical decision making.203 While requiring notification does not return th e same degree of autonomy to a patient as consent, it does at least allow a doctor to cancel or change a prescription or for a patient to consult with her doctor or decide against taking the generic. C. Education In conjunction with the above, educating consumers about generic drugs may help consumers to make informed decisions about whether they are comfortable taking a generic drug. Further, education may help dispel myths and alleviate anxiety about taking generic drugs, which is desirable in maintaining similar levels of generic substitution as the ones that cu rrently exist. In a study on the effect of patient education intervention on the acceptance of generic drugs, John-Antoni Valles and his research team found that over 98% of patients exposed to an education intervention later agreed to receive a generic formulation as compared to a branded one. 204 Further, the intervention merely consisted of verbal information and handout materials about the ad vantages and disadvantages of both generic and branded drugs, suggesting that the acceptance of generic drugs can be obtained with relatively little effort. 205 D. At the Very Least, Employ the Above Proposals for Psychotropic Drugs Though the above solutions would be preferable as they would impact all consumers, in the event that the above proposals prove undesirable for the general population, they should at least be provided to individuals taking psychotropic medications, give n the specialized concerns of 203 See supra Part III(C)(3). 204 Joan-Antoni Vall\u00e8s et al., A Prospective Multicenter Study of the Effect of Patient Education on Acceptability of Generic Prescribing in General Practice , 65 H EALTH POL'Y 269, 272 (2003). 205 Id. 324 I NDIANA HEALTH LAW REVIEW Vol. 12:1 generic substitution with a mentally ill population illustrated in Part II of this Article. VI. CONCLUSION Every state provides for generic substitution either permissively at a pharmacist's discretion or as mandated by law. Though states approach the concept of generic substitution in a variet y of ways, mandating the substitution of generic for br and name drugs and lacking a requirement for patient/physician consent are particularly deleterious approaches. An approach utilizing both of these schemes seems paternalistic. Although generic substitution provides an economic benefit to consumers, it is scientifically misguided. Though numerous generic versions of medications exist, and though these generics are considered to be \"bioequivalent,\" the concept of bioequivalence is predicated upon a faulty assumption that similar bioavailability between generic and branded drugs yields similar tr eatment outcomes. Further, the pharmacokinetic studies by which bioequivalence is determined are inherently flawed. These studies utilize homogenous samples of healthy, young males who are likely not representative of the popu lation the test generic is supposed to serve, and employ a single-dose administration that is not reflective of the way that medications are taken in the real world. Generic substitution may also give rise to specialized concerns regarding the treatment of mental health disorders. Research suggests that for bioequivalent psychotropic medications, thou gh some generic formulations may prove to be similarly effective to brand name medications, many generic formulations of psychotropic medications exhibit inferior performance in comparison to their branded counterparts as well as produce uncomfortable or hazardous side effects that may discourage medication adherenc e, an integral facet in the treatment of mental illness. This is especially alarming given that rates of treatment compliance for individuals with mental illnesses are already low, and that relapse 2015 A RE BIOEQUIVALENTS REALLY EQUAL ? 325 rates for this population are high. Further, though failed treatments for both physical an d mental illness may cast a financial burden on society, failed treatment of mental disorders may elicit some unforeseen problems, such as determining culpability for individuals who commit crime while unwittingly taking a generic as opposed to a more effective branded medication, as well as determining tort liability in cases where failed psychotropic medications injure consumers. Generic substitution also undermines consumer autonomy. First, it can disrup t patients' right to make their own medical decisions, a right reflected by the tort concept of medical battery as well as a right championed in such Supreme Court cases as: Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health , Griswold v. Connecticut , Roe v. Wade , O'Connor v. Donaldson, Perry v. Louisiana , Riggins v. Nevada , Sell v. United States , and Washington v. Harper .206 Second, it may undermine patient autonomy by not reflecting the medication preferences of the American public. Although it favors the general concept of generic substitution, it does not endorse a personal preference for generic medications. To respect patient autonomy in medical decision making, ensure the maximum effectiveness of psychotropic medications, and manage deleterious social behaviors by individuals with mental illnesses, mandatory generic substitution of psyc hotropic drugs should be prohibited. Additionally, though gene rics may be substituted permissively, pharmacists should always be required to obtain patient consent before substituting, and patients should be educated about the similarities and differences 206 See "}
