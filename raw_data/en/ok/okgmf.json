Chapter 1- Holistic Healing Explained How it All Started I used to believe that health was something that doctors could fix with pills, injections, or surgeries. I never paid much attention to my body or how it worked, until I faced a problem that no doctor could solve. Music was my passion since I was a child. I loved classical music and how it made me feel. When I was 24, I started taking piano lessons and practiced for hours every day. One piece by Rachmaninoff challenged me and inspired me, but it also hurt me. It required big hands and repetitive movements, and soon I felt a sharp pain in my wrist every time I played. The pain didn't go away, even when I stopped playing. It became chronic and unbearable. It affected my mood and my self-esteem. I felt like I had lost a part of myself. I went to see my doctor, hoping for a quick and easy solution. He diagnosed me with carpal tunnel syndrome and gave me a cast to wear on my wrist. He said it would heal in a few weeks. But it didn't. The pain was still there, as bad as ever. He sent me to a specialist, who told me to keep wearing the cast and avoid any stress on my wrist. He said I might need a cortisone injection or surgery if nothing else worked. I followed his advice, but nothing changed. I was desperate and frustrated. I sought more opinions from different doctors, but they all said the same thing. They couldn't help me. I was about to give up hope, when something amazing happened. I discovered a way to heal myself, without any drugs or operations. It was the most empowering moment of my life. For a whole year, I suffered from wrist pain that no doctor could cure. I wore a cast, took pills, and even considered surgery. But nothing worked. I was losing hope and happiness. I couldn't play piano, my favorite hobby. I felt helpless and hopeless. But then, something clicked in my mind. The last specialist I saw told me that stabilizing the whole hand would destroy the muscles. He said it was a bad idea. But I had a gut feeling that it might work. I was willing to try anything, even if it was risky. I decided to make my own cast and wrap my hand tightly for 24 hours. I was scared that I might damage my hand permanently, but I had nothing to lose. The next morning, I unwrapped my hand and felt a surge of joy. The pain was gone! I could move my fingers and wrist without any discomfort. I started doing some light exercises to strengthen my muscles and improve my blood flow. The pain didn't come back. I was amazed and relieved. I had healed myself! That was the first time I realized that I had the power to heal myself. The doctors gave me some information, but they didn't have the solution. I had to find it myself, by experimenting and trusting my intuition. If I had followed their advice blindly, I would have ended up with a surgery that might have made things worse. Now, I can play piano again, as if nothing ever happened. I also learned how to take care of my wrist health and avoid stressing it too much. That was the beginning of my journey into self-healing, but it wasn't the end. It took several more incidents like this to make me dig deeper into health, healing, and the human body. Eventually, I fell in love with healing and decided to become a professional holistic healer. But it wasn't my wrist that pushed me over the edge, it was my digestion. My journey into alternative medicine began with a mysterious back pain that struck me when I was twenty-seven. It was a dull ache that crept up on me over several months, making me feel stiff and sore. I didn't know what caused it or how to get rid of it. I visited my doctor, hoping for some relief, but he didn't prescribe me any pills or surgery. Instead, he referred me to a physiotherapist who practiced a strange technique called acupressure. I was skeptical at first, but I decided to give it a try. Twice a week, I would lie down on a table and let the physiotherapist press his fingers on various points on my back. He would move from one spot to another, applying gentle pressure for a few minutes each time. The sessions lasted between thirty and sixty minutes, and they were surprisingly relaxing. I felt a warm sensation spreading through my muscles, easing the tension and pain. Gradually, my back returned to normal and I could move freely again. I was amazed by the results. How could something so simple and unassuming heal me so effectively? I wanted to learn more about this ancient method of healing that used nothing but the human touch. I later found out that acupressure was related to acupuncture, another form of traditional medicine that involved inserting needles into the skin. But back then, I didn't have access to the internet or other sources of information. I had to rely on books from the library to satisfy my curiosity. And it was only years later that I became serious about exploring alternative medicine. That was when my stomach problems began. Received message. Here is a possible rewrite of the text in a narrative style: My journey into alternative medicine began with a mysterious back pain that struck me when I was twenty-seven. It was a dull ache that crept up on me over several months, making me feel stiff and sore. I didn't know what caused it or how to get rid of it. I visited my doctor, hoping for some relief, but he didn't prescribe me any pills or surgery. Instead, he referred me to a physiotherapist who practiced a strange technique called acupressure.

I later found out that acupressure was related to acupuncture, another form of traditional medicine that involved inserting needles into the skin. But back then, I didn't have access to the internet or other sources of information. I had to rely on books from the library to satisfy my curiosity. And it was only years later that I became serious about exploring alternative medicine. That was when my stomach problems began. When I turned thirty, I faced a new challenge that changed my perspective on health and healing. My stomach started acting up, making me feel bloated and uncomfortable. It didn't matter how much or how little I ate, I always felt like I had a balloon in my belly. It was annoying and distracting, and I wanted to find a solution. So I did what most people would do: I went to see a doctor. But the doctor was no help at all. He shrugged off my problem as something common and trivial, and didn't offer me any advice on how to improve my diet or lifestyle. He only got alarmed when I mentioned that I sometimes had heart palpitations, and he ordered me to do a heart check. Of course, my heart was fine. I was healthy in every other way, except for my stomach. I tried to see other doctors, hoping for a different diagnosis or treatment. But none of them could help me either. They all seemed clueless and indifferent about my condition. They didn't even bother to run any tests or prescribe any medications. They just told me to live with it. I was frustrated and disappointed. How could modern medicine fail me so miserably? How could doctors be so useless when it came to minor health issues? I respected their work in saving lives and curing serious diseases, but they seemed to have no clue about how to deal with simple bodily functions. I decided to take matters into my own hands. I started to look for alternative ways of healing myself, without relying on doctors or drugs. And that's when the universe sent me an unexpected teacher. He was a 50-year-old Mexican man who needed my help with math. He wanted to pass a state exam, and he asked me to tutor him privately. I agreed, thinking it would be an easy way to make some money. But little did I know that he had more to offer me than I had to offer him. One day, while we were working on some equations, I casually mentioned my stomach problems. He perked up and asked me more questions about it. The next day, he brought me a bag of herbs and told me how to use them. He said they were natural remedies that would soothe my digestion and reduce inflammation. I was skeptical, but I decided to give it a try. To my astonishment, the herbs worked wonders. After a few days of drinking the herbal tea, I felt much better. My stomach was calm and relaxed, and I didn't feel bloated anymore. I was amazed by the power of plants and how they could heal me so quickly. I wanted to learn more about this kind of healing, so I started to read books on nutrition and diet. I experimented with different foods and noticed how they affected my body and mood. I learned what foods made me feel good and what foods made me feel bad. I realized that food was not just fuel, but medicine. But that was not all. My math student also introduced me to another form of healing that blew my mind: reiki. Reiki is a technique that uses the energy of the hands to heal the body and mind. At first, I had no idea what it was or how it worked. But one day, when I had a headache, he offered to help me with his reiki skills. He placed his hands near my head, without touching me, and asked me to relax. As soon as he did that, I felt a strong magnetic field around my head. It was like a warm blanket that wrapped around my skull and melted away the pain. It was incredible. I was fascinated by this experience and wanted to know more about it. He explained that reiki was an ancient Japanese method of healing that used the life force energy of the universe to balance the body and mind. He said he was a reiki healer and an herbalist, and he had learned these skills from his ancestors. He opened my eyes to a whole new world of healing possibilities that went beyond what medical books taught me. He showed me that there was more to health than pills and surgery. He taught me that there were natural ways of healing myself using plants, energy, and intuition. He was the first of many teachers that I met on my journey into alternative medicine. He sparked my curiosity and passion for learning more about how to heal myself and others using natural methods. He planted the seeds for my future career as a professional healer. And it all started with a bloated stomach. Another thing that I learned to heal myself with was a relaxation technique that cured my tinnitus. Tinnitus is a condition where you hear a constant ringing or buzzing in your ears, even when there is no external sound. I developed it in my late twenties, and I didn't even realize it was a problem at first. I thought the noise was coming from the outside, maybe from some machines or vehicles. But then I discovered that it was actually inside my head, when I plugged my ears and the noise didn't stop. I was alarmed and confused. What was causing this annoying sound? How could I make it go away? I went to see a specialist, hoping for some answers. But he didn't have any. He just told me to ignore it and not to think about it, because that would only make it worse. He said there was no cure for tinnitus, and I just had to live with it. I was frustrated and angry. How could he be so dismissive and unhelpful? How could he expect me to ignore something that was constantly bothering me? How could he say there was no cure, when he didn't even know what caused it? I decided to look for other ways of dealing with my tinnitus, without relying on doctors or drugs. And that's when I stumbled upon a video about autogenic training. Autogenic training is a technique that teaches you how to relax your body and mind using positive affirmations and mental imagery. It helps you to calm your nervous system and reduce stress. I borrowed the video from the library (this was before the internet) and watched it with interest. I wanted to learn how to relax, because I felt tense and anxious most of the time. I followed the instructions on the video and practiced the technique every day. I noticed that it made me feel more peaceful and relaxed. But what surprised me the most was that it also affected my tinnitus. I realized that whenever I relaxed my neck muscles, the ringing in my ears would get softer and quieter. It was as if the tension in my body was somehow connected to the noise in my head. The more I relaxed, the more the noise faded away. I was amazed by this discovery and wanted to master the technique. I practiced it every day, until I could relax deeply in just five minutes. And whenever I felt the ringing in my ears, I would use autogenic training to make it disappear. I had found a natural way of healing myself from tinnitus, without any pills or surgery. And all it took was some positive thinking and mental imagery. But that was not the only time I healed myself on a mental level. There was another experience that changed me profoundly and made me feel alive and happy like never before. It happened when I turned thirty. For some reason, I had always wanted to spend a night in a wild forest, alone and without any modern comforts. It was a dream of mine, a challenge that I wanted to face. So I decided to do it. I packed a sleeping bag and some food and water, and headed to a national park. The weather was perfect, sunny and warm. I found a spot near a stream, where I could hear the water flowing and the birds singing. I set up my sleeping bag on the ground, without any tent or fire or flashlight. I wanted to be as close to nature as possible. I spent the weekend there, enjoying the beauty and tranquility of the forest. I felt free and adventurous, like a child exploring a new world. I slept under the stars, listening to the sounds of the night. It was an amazing experience. When I returned home, I noticed something different about myself. My senses were sharper and more alert. I could smell things that I had never noticed before, like flowers and spices and coffee. I could hear subtle noises that I had ignored before, like footsteps and whispers and clocks ticking. My taste buds were more sensitive and responsive, making every bite of food delicious and satisfying. But more than that, my mind was clearer and brighter. I felt refreshed and rejuvenated, like I had been reborn. My spirit was high and optimistic, like anything was possible. Life seemed new and exciting to me, full of opportunities and discoveries. I had healed myself on a mental level by reconnecting with nature and myself. There was nothing more healing than feeling that life was worth living. Now you might be wondering why am I telling you all this long story just to introduce you to holistic healing? Well, it's because I don't want to give you a dry definition of what holistic healing is or isn't. I want to show you how I came to understand it through my own experiences and why it matters so much to me. And trust me, if you care about your health, happiness, and well-being, holistic healing will matter to you too at some point in your life. Defining Holistic Healing Before we go any further, let me explain what I mean by holistic healing. It's a term that can be confusing and controversial, especially in the medical world. Many people think that holistic healing is unscientific and unreliable, based on anecdotes and placebo effects. They think that only medical treatments that have been tested and proven on large groups of people are valid and effective. They dismiss anything that falls outside the mainstream medicine as quackery and fraud. But I have a different perspective. I have learned from my own experience that there is more to healing than pills and surgery. I have learned that we are not all the same, and what works for one person may not work for another. I have learned that there are many ways of healing ourselves that are natural, safe, and powerful, but they are often ignored or overlooked by the medical establishment. That's why I define holistic healing as any way of healing a person (without causing harm) that does not fit into the standard medical treatments. It's a way of healing that considers the whole person, not just the symptoms or the disease. It's a way of healing that uses different methods and modalities, such as nutrition, acupuncture, chiropractic, or hypnotherapy, to address the root causes of the problem and restore balance and harmony. Nowadays, some doctors are starting to recognize the value of holistic healing and incorporate it into their practice. They realize that sometimes they need to look beyond the conventional medicine and offer their patients alternative options that may work better for them. But this is still rare and not widely accepted. Most doctors still have no training or knowledge about holistic healing or healthy lifestyle. They still rely on their textbooks and prescriptions, without considering other possibilities. That's why I believe that your health is your responsibility, and you should educate yourself about holistic healing and find out what works for you and what doesn't. There is a lot of information out there, but not all of it is trustworthy or useful. You need to use your judgment and common sense, and be careful about what you try and who you trust. Holistic healing is not a magic bullet or a quick fix. It's a journey of discovery and experimentation, of trial and error, of learning and growing. It's a journey that can transform your life for the better, if you are willing to take it. Chapter 2- The Four Pillars of Healing: Mindset, Emotions, Lifestyle, and Diet Here are a few myths about healing and how people think of it: - For every disease, there is an herb! - All diseases stem from the mind. - All diseases can be cured using \"the right\" diet/homeopathic remedy/vitamin supplements/spine adjustment/energy balancing/detoxification/proper hygiene/genetic engineering, etc. What I am trying to say is that healing is not limited to just herbs, or just diet, or just one type of spine adjustment like osteopathy. Healing involves all of these. Each way of healing has its uses and its limitations. You might be inclined to use one type of healing more than the others, but do not limit your chances. The wider you go, the more likely you will find some solutions. Many people limit themselves to one way of healing, whether it is the orthodox medical system or one of the alternative methods. They think that there is a single solution for their health problems, and they stop looking for other options. They follow what their doctors (or Google) tell them, and they miss out on the opportunity to heal in a deeper and more comprehensive way. But I have learned from my own experience that healing is much more than that. It is about extending your mind and accepting the diversity and complexity of your well-being. It is about exploring all the possible ways of healing and finding what works best for you. Medicine has its own place and value in healing, but it is not the only one. Medicine focuses on treating the symptoms and the physical causes of diseases, often with drugs or surgery. For example, this is how cancer is usually treated: with chemotherapy, radiation, surgery, or other therapies that target the tumor. But medicine does not address the other aspects of your well-being, such as your diet, your emotions, your lifestyle, or your spirituality. Medicine has a narrow view of healing, and many people, including me, have become frustrated and disillusioned with it. But the same problem exists with many alternative methods of healing. They also tend to focus on one aspect of your well-being and ignore the others. For example, a dietician may think that a specific diet can cure your cancer. An herbalist may think that a certain herb can cure your cancer. A lifestyle coach may think that a certain change in your habits can cure your cancer. A spiritual teacher may think that a certain meditation or practice can cure your cancer. A mind healer may think that changing your beliefs can cure your cancer. An energy healer may think that balancing your energy can cure your cancer. An acupuncturist may think that stimulating certain points can cure your cancer. And so on. They are all making the same mistake of looking at only one part of the spectrum to heal. They are all missing the bigger picture of holistic healing. Holistic healing is about embracing all aspects of your well-being and healing in as many ways as possible. It is about combining different methods and approaches to create a personalized and effective healing plan for yourself. It is about being open-minded and curious about what works for you and what doesn't. It is about taking responsibility for your own healing and not relying on others to tell you what to do. Holistic healing is the way to go if you want to heal deeply and completely. I know this from experience, and I invite you to try it for yourself. Healing is not a one-size-fits-all process. Everyone has their own unique needs and preferences when it comes to healing. And sometimes, the source of healing may surprise you. One of the worst things you can do to yourself is to be closed-minded in your search for healing. Of course, I am not saying you should try every quackery out there, but at least give yourself a chance to explore a variety of healing methods. Medicine is one healing method, but it is not the only one you may need. In fact, medicine may not be enough for you in many cases. You may be missing something else that could make a huge difference in your healing. Let me share with you two examples from my own experience. A few months ago, I had this weird lower back pain that felt like inflammation. It was bothering me all the time, especially at night when I was trying to sleep. I had a feeling that it had something to do with my diet, because I had been eating a lot of fried foods lately. They were convenient and tasty, but they were also unhealthy and inflammatory. I decided to stop eating anything fried and switch to a healthier diet with more fresh fruits and vegetables. And guess what? My back pain disappeared in a few days. If I had gone to the doctor, I would have probably ended up with painkillers and maybe even surgery. But by changing my diet, I healed myself naturally and easily. Another time, I had a severe lower back pain that happened when I was squatting down to wipe the floor. I felt a crack in my lower back and I could barely stand up. It turned out that it was caused by hip stiffness. I had noticed that my quadriceps muscles were getting tight and I could not squat comfortably anymore. I was in my early forties, and I did not realize that muscles get stiffer with age. I started doing some stretching exercises, but they were very painful and slow. It took me six months of hard work and persistence to regain some flexibility in my muscles. And then, a friend introduced me to yoga, and it was a game-changer for me. Yoga helped me stretch my muscles more gently and effectively, and it also improved my posture and breathing. Now, I practice yoga every morning, and I enjoy the benefits of being more flexible and relaxed. And to be honest, I had never thought that yoga was useful before I had that episode of back pain. These are just two examples of how different ways of healing can help you in different situations. There are many more ways of healing that you can discover and try for yourself, such as herbs, emotions, lifestyle changes, spirituality, mind healing, energy healing, acupuncture, and so on. The key is to be open-minded and curious about what works for you and what doesn't. Don't limit yourself to one way of healing, but embrace the diversity and complexity of your well-being. Healing is not something that only happens to you when you are sick or injured. It is something that you can do for yourself every day to stay healthy and happy. And it is not something that only some people can do, it is something that everyone can do. Of course, the older you get, the more time and effort you will need to invest in your self-healing. But everyone who wants to stay healthy should start their self-healing journey at some point in their life. If you want to heal yourself in a holistic way, you need to pay attention to four key aspects of your well-being: your mindset, your emotions, your lifestyle, and your diet. These are the four pillars of healing that support and influence each other. If you neglect or ignore any of them, you will not be able to heal fully and completely. Let me explain what each of these pillars means and why they are important for your healing. 1- Mindset: Your mindset is the way you think and perceive yourself, others, and the world. It is the filter through which you experience reality. Your mindset can either empower you or limit you in your healing journey. If you have a negative mindset, you will be trapped in a cycle of self-doubt, fear, anger, resentment, and hopelessness. You will not be able to see the opportunities and possibilities for healing that are available to you. You will also harm your physical health by creating stress and inflammation in your body. A positive mindset, on the other hand, will help you overcome any challenges and obstacles that you may face in your healing journey. You will be able to see the silver lining in every situation and learn from every experience. You will also boost your physical health by creating harmony and balance in your body. A positive mindset is not just a nice idea, it is a mission that you need to pursue in your life. There are many ways to change your mindset, such as hypnotherapy, positive affirmations, the Sedona Method, theta healing, and so on. Many people have witnessed a significant improvement in their health after they had a major mindset transformation. A positive mindset will also help you adopt healthy habits and make progress in your life. Unfortunately, medicine does not recognize the importance of a positive mindset for health and well-being. Even depression is often reduced to a chemical imbalance rather than a mindset issue. That is why more and more people have been seeking holistic healing methods to tackle their health challenges. 2- Emotions: Your emotions are the expressions of your feelings and moods. They are the signals that tell you what is going on inside you and around you. Your emotions can either support you or sabotage you in your healing journey. If you suppress or deny your emotions, you will create a lot of tension and conflict in yourself and with others. You will also cause physical health problems such as stomach ulcers, irritable bowel syndrome, asthma, and heart attacks. Of course, these health problems can have other causes as well, but the emotional factor is often a big one and is often ignored by medical professionals. Emotional suppression can also lead to mental health problems such as anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, and so on. Understanding how to heal your emotions was my biggest milestone in healing myself. 3- Lifestyle: Your lifestyle is the way you live your life every day. It includes everything that you do or don't do on a regular basis, such as your habits, routines, activities, hobbies, relationships, work, etc. Your lifestyle can either enhance or impair your healing journey. If you have an unhealthy lifestyle, you will expose yourself to many risks and dangers that can harm your health and well-being. For example, smoking, drinking alcohol excessively, eating junk food, being sedentary, breathing polluted air, sleeping poorly, etc. These are all factors that can cause or worsen many diseases and conditions. Before 1960, no one used to think that lifestyle could cause disease. People used to smoke and were not aware of the myriad health issues smoking could cause. But now we know better. We know that more than 50% of our health depends on our lifestyle choices. The other 50% may depend on our genes, our age, pathogens, traumas, etc. Even most doctors would agree that diabetes, hypertension, and many other chronic problems can be better managed with proper lifestyle changes than even with the best medications available. Unfortunately, it is well known among healthcare professionals that most people would never change their lifestyle and always prefer to be put on certain medications to help them with their health issues. Now from a holistic health perspective it is imperative to change your lifestyle occasionally according to what you need to heal in your body and mind. There is no such thing as the perfect lifestyle that you should keep on having for life but there is a better lifestyle adjustment for every situation and health problem. One big lifestyle change is learning to practice deep relaxation daily.This will allow you to have rejuvenating sleep and your mind will function much better as a result. Relaxation could be achieved by doing yoga getting a massage session or even an acupuncture treatment. Light exercises to improve your muscles and heart health is another big lifestyle improvement.Most people never do any exercises after 50.You might just need 2 minutes of exercise a day to keep your body in good shape and prevent many health problems. 4- Diet: It's part of your lifestyle, but it is so important that it deserves a pillar by itself! Conclusion: Now that you are left with the four pillars of healing, you have some options. You can choose one or more of them to help you with your healing process, or you can ignore them as unscientific and worthless. Alternatively, you can give them a shot and start taking your health and wellness into your own hands. I believe you'll thank me later. Chapter 3 \u2014 Spiritual Healing Spiritual healing is no less important than other types of healing for a good purpose \u2014 you do not heal until you feel that your life has meaning. If you keep feeling that you have suffered needlessly in this life, then this is by itself causing you more anguish. The beauty of spiritual healing is that it slowly gets you to understand your life from a higher perspective, especially when you start communicating with spirits. Your spirit guides and angels can become a great blessing in your life once you learn some spiritual healing. At the age of thirty, I went to the Alps. It was just a crazy inspiration I got out of nowhere that I needed to spend a decent time in nature, so I went to the Austrian Alps and spent the whole month of August there. I was alone, wandering the entire day, sleeping under a tree at night, and discovering phenomenal sceneries every few hours. The importance of that trip to me was that I went as an atheist and came back as a spiritualist. Long story short, I spoke to God at a certain point during that trip and I saw God once during the night. It was the most life-changing experience of my whole life. My spiritual journey was initiated from that point on. I first needed to make sense of my paranormal experiences, then over several years to understand what my life is about, how to communicate with spirits, and why we live. And what happens after death? It was not an easy journey. I endured some of the most emotionally loaded years during my early thirties, but it was quite rewarding, and I eventually knew that I was blessed to have gone on this path and undergone all that. My life has become meaningful, easy, and happy ever after. And this happiness is not the kind of adrenaline buzz that comes after winning the lottery, but a knowledgeable kind of happiness that comes from knowing that life is always with me and never against me and that my spirit guides, angels, and God are always loving me. The proof is through bona fide experience and communication with spirits. And yes, I have seen spirits often enough to know that they are real and have felt their love intensely enough to leave a permanent impression in my consciousness until the end of my life. Let me tell you how it all happened. It started with a chance encounter with a Reiki master from Mexico. He was in his 50's and he didn't practice Reiki professionally, but he showed me something amazing. He showed me how energy flowed out of his hands and how I could feel it with my own. I was fascinated and curious. I wanted to learn how to do that too, so I started practicing. I discovered that if I held my hands in front of me at a certain distance, they would start to tickle each other, as if they were sending subtle vibrational electric waves to each other. Of course, I had to be in a focused and relaxed state to feel this. Around the same time, I noticed something else. Many people from different walks of life were telling me that I might be a healer or have the potential to be one. This was a strange idea for me. I didn't even know what a healer was, let alone how to become one. But I was intrigued by the idea, especially after hearing it from so many sources. I felt like there was something more to this than just coincidence. I felt like there was a calling for me to explore this path. But I still needed to meet a professional healer and see what it was all about. The opportunity came in 2005, when I heard about a \"spiritual fair\" that was happening in a nearby town. I don't know if these events are still popular, but back then they were quite a big deal. They attracted a lot of people who were interested in alternative healing, psychic readings, and other spiritual topics. They also featured some cutting-edge technology that claimed to measure or enhance your health and well-being, such as microscopes that showed your blood cells, machines that took pictures of your aura, and so on. I was curious about all of these things, but I had limited time and money, so I had to choose wisely. I decided to go for an hour of spiritual healing by a renowned healer that I had read about online. The internet was still relatively new back then, and we didn't have social media or blogs or podcasts like we do now. Most of the information online came from small business websites that advertised their services or products. This healer had one of those websites, and he seemed to have a lot of testimonials and credentials. I went to his booth and he greeted me warmly. He told me that he would invite his \"spirit technician\" to work on my energy body or auric field. He said that this spirit technician would perform something like surgery on me, but without any physical tools or incisions. He said that this would heal any issues or imbalances that I might have in my energy system. He said that all I had to do was sit on a chair and relax. I was skeptical but curious. I agreed to try it out and see what would happen. As soon as he placed his hands on my shoulders and called upon his spirit technician, something in my mind went boom! It was like I was instantly transported to another state of consciousness that I had never experienced before. It was like a trance, but more intense and vivid. I could feel everything that was happening in my body, but not in a physical way. It was more like an energetic sensation that moved across different parts of me as the healer directed his spirit technician to work on them. It was amazing! The hour flew by like it was only three minutes. There was so much going on and so much to witness. The healer also gave me some feedback as he worked on me. He told me things that he sensed or picked up from my energy field, such as the fact that I needed to drink more water because my body was dehydrated. I didn't believe him at first because I didn't think dehydration was a big deal for me. But then he repeated the message again, saying that his spirit technician insisted on telling me this for some reason that he didn't understand. That's when I realized that he wasn't making this up. He was actually communicating with a spirit who could read my mind and knew what I needed better than I did. That blew my mind even more than the healing itself. I left the fair feeling more than satisfied with what I had experienced. Spiritual healing was real, and so were spirits. It wasn't a fantasy or a placebo; it was as real as the floor I was walking on. Spirits existed, and they could help us heal and grow in ways that we couldn't imagine. I still didn't know much about them or how they worked, but I knew they were there and they cared about me. That alone changed my life forever. That year was the most interesting year of my life. I was on a quest to learn and experience as much as I could about healing, both for myself and others. I spent all my money on visiting different healers and learning from them. I learned how to invite spirits to heal me and how to do spiritual healing on others. I even got to see spirits with my own eyes a few times. And let me tell you, it was not scary at all. It was the opposite of scary. It was amazing, exciting, intriguing, refreshing, reassuring, loving, blissful, and informative. It was nothing like the horror stories that some people tell about the spirit world and spiritual experiences. I realized that those stories were based on fear and ignorance, not on reality. I realized that the spirit world was not something to be afraid of, but something to be grateful for and connected with. I also explored many other types of spiritual healing modalities that were available to me. I noticed that they had different methods and philosophies, but they all used the spirit world in some way. Reiki, for example, was one of the modalities that I learned extensively. It taught me how to channel universal life force energy through my hands and into myself or others. Crystal healing was another modality that fascinated me. It taught me how to use the natural vibrations of crystals to enhance the healing process, especially when combined with spiritual energies. I also learned some of Barbara Brennen's healing methods by reading her book and practicing on people who agreed to let me try them out. She taught me how to work with the human energy field and its different layers and aspects. I enjoyed learning and practicing all these modalities, but after a couple of years, I started to feel that something was missing. I realized that spiritual-energy healing was not enough by itself. It could do some good things on the energy level, such as creating deep relaxation, clearing blockages, or balancing chakras, but it didn't seem to have much effect on the physical, mental, or emotional level. It didn't address the root causes of the problems or the patterns that created them. It didn't help me or others to heal fully and permanently. I felt that there was more to healing than just working with energy. That's when the universe brought me new teachers and new lessons. They taught me about emotional healing and how to deal with the feelings and beliefs that were holding me back from being happy and healthy. They taught me how to release negative emotions, forgive myself and others, love myself unconditionally, and create positive affirmations. They taught me how to heal my inner child, my wounded self, and my shadow self. But emotional healing was not enough either. There were still other factors that affected my well-being and that of others. That's when the universe brought me more teachers and more lessons. They taught me about diet, intermittent fasting, yoga, exercise, lifestyle, and other things that influenced my physical health and vitality. They taught me how to nourish my body with wholesome foods, cleanse my system with fasting, stretch and strengthen my muscles with yoga, boost my metabolism with exercise, and create a balanced and harmonious lifestyle. That's how the universe guided me on this amazing journey of healing. It brought me everything I needed at the right time and in the right way. I didn't plan it or expect it; it just happened naturally and beautifully. And I'm so grateful for it. Conclusion: I'm not saying that spiritual healing is the only way to heal or that you should ignore other forms of healing, such as medical treatment. I'm saying that spiritual healing has its own value and significance, especially since it can make your healing journey more enjoyable and meaningful. It can help you to realize that there is a loving and caring power beyond our physical reality, and that this power is always there for you. This can make a huge difference in your well-being. It can give you hope, comfort, guidance, and inspiration. It can help you to cope with any challenges or difficulties that you might face in life. The spirit world is real, and you can experience it for yourself if you are open-minded and willing to look for the evidence. Don't expect it to be exactly like what other people tell you or what you see in movies or books. The spirit world is not a fixed or uniform place; it is a dynamic and diverse realm that adapts to your level of understanding and perception. The spirit world will come to you in the best way that you can relate to and learn from. For example, you might encounter spirits in your dreams, where they can appear as teachers, wise men, women, or even animals. They can give you messages, lessons, or insights that can help you in your waking life. Or you might encounter spirits in your meditation, where they can appear as lights, colors, sounds, or sensations. They can give you healing, peace, joy, or bliss that can uplift your energy and mood. Of course, for some people, spirituality is connected to religion and beliefs that they grew up with or adopted later in life. And that's okay too. The spirit world will respect your beliefs and come to you in the form that you are most familiar with and comfortable with \u2014 Jesus, Buddha, Krishna, White Light, etc. The spirit world is not limited by any labels or names; it is universal and inclusive. Spiritual healing is not a new or exotic concept; it is an ancient and natural one. Our ancestors have used it for thousands of years, and many cultures and traditions still use it today. And we still need it too, because we are more than just physical bodies; we are also emotional, mental, and spiritual beings. We cannot heal ourselves fully by just focusing on one aspect of ourselves; we need to address all aspects of ourselves. That's why I invite you to explore spiritual healing and see what it can do for you. You might be surprised by how much it can enrich your life and enhance your well-being. Chapter 4 \u2014 Why Do We Live? What is the point of living? This is the ultimate question that drives holistic healing. Holistic healing is not just about curing diseases, but about restoring joy and harmony. If we live without a purpose, then we would be doomed to suffer for no reason, and life would be a harsh and random ordeal. Many thinkers have tried to crack the mystery of life and its meaning, but most of them only offer abstract ideas that don't resonate with our hearts. I won't bother you with their theories, because they are based on speculation, not on direct experience of the divine. And experience is what matters, because it can shatter any logic or argument that contradicts the reality. But what about the religious folks (from all faiths and sects), who claim to have the answer to life? Their answer is based on blind faith in ancient texts, not on personal discovery. So, if you are happy with the philosophical or religious explanation of why we live, then you can stop reading right now \u2014 you have already solved the puzzle of your existence and there is no point in confusing yourself with a new idea. The main thing in healing is to have a reason to live that makes you feel that life is worth living and fighting for, even when it hurts. If you have that, awesome! You don't need to care about what I think. But, if your view of life is too gloomy, bleak, and not helping you heal, then I urge you to read on because you need to clear this up in your mind. I know the meaning of life because I was lucky enough to discover how to communicate with the spirit world. The spirit world speaks in metaphors, and so I am going to explain to you the meaning of life in a metaphor. Why a metaphor? Because our minds are not built to understand anything beyond the physical \u2014 you just need to try to imagine yourself living without a body and you will know what I mean. Souls do not have a physical body, they do not have names, numbers, places, and so on. They do not need a language to communicate. They are the closest to a newborn baby, but without a body. A newborn baby has consciousness, but not thoughts; feelings, but not words; awareness, but not knowledge. So, let us get into the spiritual metaphor that was given to me about the meaning of life. Your soul is your consciousness. You can think of your soul as connected to your brain in a way: the brain gives information to the soul, and the soul translates it into feelings, thoughts, and sensations. Your soul is striving to achieve a blissful existence. But with all its imperfections, this cannot happen. That is why you are living your life on earth. You wanted to be here. You needed to suffer. Earth is like a school for your soul. The goal is to get your soul closer and closer to perfection in all aspects. You live many lifetimes. Each lifetime is designed only for you, and all the experiences you have are just to get you to change and improve. You do not keep coming back to the same earthly life. You keep moving across dimensions and living in different realities, different laws of physics, and unusual ways of existence. From life to life, you cross dimensions just like you cross countries and live in a whole new culture, climate, and political system. This earth is just a part of the journey; it is not the goal. The goal is that one day in a trillion years, your soul becomes so perfect that you exist in a blissful consciousness. What is this blissful consciousness? There is nothing that can describe it. Now, you might not see any metaphor in this story. It just looks like a normal literal story, but it is not. This story is just a metaphor for what we cannot describe: your soul journey. It is the closest you can get to the truth, and as I told you, the truth is beyond our imagination. And if you look at life as the school of your soul, what exactly are you learning here? You are nurturing your soul qualities. Some of your soul qualities are generosity, compassion, patience, acceptance, perseverance, modesty, and wisdom. Soul qualities are not things that you can fake or cheat your way to get. You can fool people and make them think that you are generous, but if your generosity is not sincere, it is not part of your soul and therefore it is worthless to your soul's growth. No one can tamper with your soul for you. People can mess with your mind using hypnosis, or they can hack your brain using a microchip implant, but none of that affects your soul at all. Your soul is your own business; no one can do anything to your soul, it is only you who can change your soul awareness and any change is a step forward, you cannot go backwards on the spiritual level. A change of your soul happens only when YOU choose to make it happen. No one else can do it for you. Of course, people and life situations can assist you in the process, but it is only you who will ultimately do the inner work. The process of your inner work is the process of healing. Healing from a spiritual perspective is nothing but that \u2014 doing your inner work to perfect your soul. You get sick, you face money problems, and you struggle with your emotional issues in relationships NOT because you are flawless and everyone else is evil or that life is cruel, but because your soul is not flawless yet and you need the challenges to seek healing. The pain by itself is not the aim, the pain is just the motivation to get you to do the inner work of healing. Your soul thrives on healing. Without it, your life would be empty and meaningless. As you journey through the ups and downs of existence, you discover how each challenge and pain transforms you into a better version of yourself. This is not just a mental shift, but a soulful one. Your soul grows and evolves, and this shows in your mind, personality, and health. Healing is the magic that makes you who you are. Chapter 5- The Story of Helen Keller Imagine you are blind and deaf. You cannot see the beauty of the world, nor hear the sounds of life. You are trapped in a dark and silent prison, unable to communicate with anyone. You are angry, frustrated, and hopeless. This was the reality of Helen Keller, a young girl who lost her sight and hearing at the age of 19 months due to a fever. Her story is one of the most inspiring examples of a healing journey that I have ever encountered. It is also a powerful metaphor for what your soul is doing on earth. Let me explain why. I have always been fascinated by the spirit world and the meaning of life. I have explored different paths and practices to connect with my higher self and to understand my purpose. But nothing prepared me for the profound insight that I gained when I watched the movie: \"The Miracle Worker \u2014 The story of Helen Keller.\" This movie showed me how Helen Keller was transformed from a wild and isolated child into a brilliant and compassionate woman, thanks to the dedication and love of her teacher, Anne Sullivan. It also showed me how we are all like Helen Keller in some ways, and how we can overcome our limitations and discover our true potential. So here is the story as I see it and how you could understand the deep spiritual meaning behind it. Helen was a normal girl who lost her eyesight and hearing before she was even 2 years old. For the rest of her life, she had to experience the entire world only through her other three senses: touch, smell, and taste. She was blind and deaf \u2014 hard to imagine how she could even understand anything happening in this world. Helen was not aware of how tragic her situation was, but she was unable to enjoy a lot of life that we take for granted. She felt safe in her environment, and she found some joy in doing whatever she wanted, like touching everything and everyone without any sense of boundaries and eating from every plate regardless of whom it belonged to. She enjoyed acting without boundaries, and her parents felt so much pity for her situation that they allowed her to do everything. No matter how much they gave her, they could never give her enough. It was out of love, but it did not help her progress in life. Remember that she was getting older, and she had no way to communicate with the world and people around her. She could not speak a word, and she was unaware that people communicated with each other using a language. She could not tell the world what she felt, what she wanted, or what she was thinking of, and people around her were not able to tell her anything. She was living in utter helplessness, just like a helpless baby who cannot do anything for herself. At the age of seven, her parents decided to hire a woman called Anne Sullivan to teach her how to communicate with the world. Ms. Sullivan was aware of the enormous mission of teaching a blind-deaf-mute child to communicate with the world. There was no textbook on how to do it. No one had ever done it before. It was an impossible job. But she took the job anyway because she was a dedicated teacher. When Helen met Ms. Sullivan, she became aware of this new stranger entering her house and spending time with her for no obvious reason. At first, Helen did not feel attracted to Ms. Sullivan in any way, and the longer she spent with her, the less she liked her. Ms. Sullivan started introducing Helen to sign language by drawing each word (which could be the name of an object) on Helen's hand and then getting her to touch the object. But Ms. Sullivan had a terrible problem \u2014 how could she get Helen to understand that she was her teacher and that she was trying to teach her how to communicate with the world? No matter what she did, nothing would work until Helen became aware that the drawings she felt on her hand represented words. As time went by, Ms. Sullivan started putting more energy into teaching Helen sign language, but nothing seemed to work. Ms. Sullivan became stricter with her and started to restrict the unhinged freedom that her parents gave her, all with the aim that Helen would one day realize the importance of what she was learning. For Helen, the complete opposite was going on in her mind. She grew up hating her teacher by the day. This weird stranger who was just trying to restrict her freedom and rob her of the little happiness she had enjoyed so far. She felt that this stranger was like a curse on her, an enemy, her tormentor. She was so far from being able to understand that Ms. Sullivan would one day become the eyes that she could see the world with, the ears that she could hear with, and her most loving loyal life companion. For now, Helen felt like the victim and saw her teacher as the villain. Imagine spending a year trying to teach someone who can't see, hear, or speak, and getting nowhere. Imagine feeling exhausted, hopeless, and frustrated by the lack of progress. Imagine being ready to give up on your mission, thinking it was impossible. That's how Ms. Sullivan felt after trying to teach Helen sign language for a year. Helen still had no clue that the shapes Ms. Sullivan made on her hand were words, and that words were the key to communication. Helen still had no idea that Ms. Sullivan was her teacher, and not her enemy. But then, something miraculous happened. Something that changed everything. Something that opened Helen's mind to a whole new world of possibilities. Something that turned her from a helpless child into a brilliant woman. It was a simple word: water. Ms. Sullivan decided to give it one last shot. She took Helen to the well, and made her pump the water with one hand, while feeling the water flow over her other hand. Then, she spelled out the word water on Helen's palm, over and over again. Suddenly, Helen had an epiphany. She realized that the movements on her hand were not random, but meaningful. She realized that they were the name of the thing she was feeling: water. She realized that everything had a name, and that she could learn them. That was the moment that changed her life forever. That was the moment of enlightenment. Helen was overcome with emotion. She hugged Ms. Sullivan, and asked for more words. She wanted to know everything. She wanted to learn everything. She realized that Ms. Sullivan was not her tormentor, but her savior. She realized that Ms. Sullivan loved her, and wanted to help her. She realized that Ms. Sullivan was her teacher, and her friend. She realized that her life was not a curse, but a blessing. She realized that she had a gift, not a disability. She realized that she could do anything she set her mind to. And she did. She became a famous writer, a human rights activist, and a college graduate with honors. She became an inspiration for millions of people around the world. She became a legend. All because of one word: water. As you read this book, I invite you to dig deeper into this story because every detail has a hidden pearl of spiritual wisdom for you to discover. The meaning will become clear to you when you see yourself as Helen and life as Ms. Sullivan. Life is your teacher, and it wants you to learn and grow. You may be going through hard times right now, feeling lost, confused, or hurt. You may wonder why life is so unfair and harsh to you. But trust me, there is a purpose behind your pain. There is a light at the end of the tunnel. There is a breakthrough waiting for you. I am not speaking from theory or philosophy. I am speaking from experience. I have been where you are. I have faced many challenges and struggles in my life. I have felt hopeless and helpless many times. But I have also seen the miracles that happen when you open your heart and mind to the guidance of your spirit. I have met my spirit guides in my dreams and in real life. They have taught me many things about myself and the universe. They have shown me that I am not alone, that I am loved and supported by God, by the angels, and by the whole creation. They don't appear to me as often as they used to because they want me to be more independent and confident in my own decisions. They want me to grow up spiritually, just like a mother wants her child to grow up physically and mentally. Life is your mother too. It loves you more than you know, but it also challenges you because it knows that's how you will become stronger, wiser, and happier. One of the biggest lessons I learned from my spirit guides is that everything and everyone in your life is here to help you evolve as a soul. Even the people you hate or resent are playing a role in your spiritual journey. They are mirroring back to you the aspects of yourself that need healing or improvement. They are triggering the emotions that need to be released or transformed. They are pushing you to grow beyond your comfort zone and discover new potentials within yourself. Every time you become aware of something that needs to change in yourself or in your life, you are taking a step forward in your soul's evolution. That's why awareness is the key to any spiritual path. Without awareness, Hellen would've never been able to speak. Without awareness, you'd remain stuck in the same patterns of behavior, thought, and emotion that keep you unhappy and unfulfilled. But with awareness, you realize that you are not a victim of life, but a co-creator of it. That's what Helen Keller did. She awakened from her darkness and silence to her light and voice. She became aware of her power and purpose as a soul. She became an example of what is possible when you overcome your lack of awareness. Finally, healing is all about awareness and change! Chapter 6 \u2014 Healing Your Mindset Your mindset is one of the most stubborn things to shift, but it is also one of the most rewarding. Often, you don't realize the need for ptransforming your mindset when you face a problem, you just want to fix it, but sooner or later you will have to transform your mindset because many times the problem can't be fixed from a place of negativity, anger, bitterness, and despair. Life is all about elevating your mindset. The older you get, the more your mindset evolves gradually. Just think of how much better your mindset is now compared to 5 or 10 years ago. Every few months, you are making significant progress in your mindset because if you are not, then your life has no meaning from a spiritual perspective. Your mindset mirrors your soul and life is all about soul growth, so whatever is changing in your mindset will be reflected in your soul's growth. But there is a big difference between changing your mindset naturally and changing it artificially. If the change is not coming from your heart, if you are not the one (the soul) striving for that change, then eventually, your soul will rebel and bring your old mindset back. This is where I want to stress the importance of being true to yourself. The more you try to trick your mind and lie to yourself, the harder you are making your soul progress. Even doing terrible things with honesty is much better for your soul's progress than doing great deeds of kindness without feeling them. A lot of people see life as \"what you do\" or \"how much you achieve,\" but, from a spiritual perspective, it is only how you grow internally that matters, and you always grow in the right direction, even if it looks from the outside that you are growing in the wrong direction. Eventually, the experience (good or bad) is leading you to soul awareness, change, transformation, and maturity. And that is the whole purpose of living through this painful life. Yes, life is painful on different levels \u2014 physically, emotionally, and mentally. No one alive can go through this life without pain. Pain is the foundation of this life, there is no way a life without pain could be of any value to the soul. Your soul can go and live in the most heavenly paradise you could ever imagine, there is no limit to what your soul can enjoy. But what is the point, if you just enjoy pleasure and beauty all the time and your soul is still lacking in many aspects? Your soul is amazing and your mission in this life is to make it even more amazing. Your soul became amazing only after so many lifetimes of learning and progress, and your current life is a continuation of this process. Let me share with you a story that changed my perspective on pain. I was going through a rough patch in my life and I felt frustrated and hopeless. I wondered why my spirit guides were not helping me, why they were letting me suffer. So I asked them in prayer: \"why don't you make my life easy, why do you keep me living with this pain\" ... The next night, I had a dream that shook me to the core. In my dream, I saw myself begging my spirit guides to teach me because I (the soul) wanted to grow and achieve greatness in my heart. They showed me how every challenge I faced was a lesson for my soul, a gift for my evolution. When I woke up, I felt a surge of gratitude and acceptance. I never complained about my life conditions again, no matter how hard they got. I just knew that every time I faced difficulties, my soul was benefiting immensely and that my situation was exactly what I needed for my soul to progress. So, this is how a spiritual experience can heal your mindset. Without any meaningful spiritual experiences, you would struggle a lot more to change your mindset when things go wrong. Let me tell you why relying on religious beliefs alone is not enough, especially if you have experienced a lot of trauma. Beliefs are great, but they need some evidence to back them up, otherwise, they are easily shaken. On the other hand, negative emotions, especially the ones that come from deep wounds in your childhood, have a huge impact on your mindset. When you are emotional, your mindset gets taken over by your emotions. For example, if you hate someone, your mind blocks any positive thoughts about that person, until the emotions fade and you slowly realize that you were exaggerating in the way you thought when you were emotional. That is why emotional healing is one of the main pillars of healing, and addressing emotions is different from addressing the mindset. Although the mind is the source of emotions, emotions just get stored in the body and they are the domain of the muscles and nerves rather than the mind and thoughts. That's why one of the most powerful healing tools I have learned in my life was emotional release through emotional expression, commonly referred to as catharsis. But before you think it's so destructive and not very effective, let me say that there are bad, destructive ways of expressing emotions and there are very good, safe ways of doing the same thing with a 100% clearing effect. Let me share with you why I usually don't like positive affirmations. There are two reasons: first, the emotions are often too strong to be influenced by positive affirmations; second, if your positive affirmation is not something you believe in, then you are somehow fooling yourself when you keep trying to force it into your belief system. So, if positive affirmations are not the best way to change your mindset, what can you do to change your mindset then? Think! Yes. Through thinking! Thinking is the most natural way everyone is changing their mindset regularly in this life. There are other (artificial) ways to change your mindset, but they all have to be tested by your daily thinking and real-life experiences. Thinking has gotten a bad reputation in this modern age of stress and anxiety because it can be harmful if it is done too much. But the problem is not the thinking process itself, it is the way you do it. Thinking can be wonderful if you see it as life's gift for your personal growth. Nowadays, people all over the world are getting curious about meditation practices, thinking it is the way to go to quiet their minds, relax their minds, feel peace of mind in their being and start enjoying life. Well, if you have ever tried any meditation practice, you would know that meditation does not stop the mind, it just gives your mind plenty of time and space to process all the thinking that you have been avoiding because the memories are too painful. Memories are never TOO painful. Sure, a lot of memories that we need to process to heal ourselves are painful, but they are still within the range of what we can handle and process. Life is clever. Life never throws us a curveball that is too big for us to catch. It may seem like that at first, but every challenge in this life is tailored to our ability to handle it. It may take many years to overcome a certain challenge in life, but it is always doable and achievable. So, next time you find yourself obsessing over a certain memory, unable to let it go, feeling annoyed and irritated that you are just thinking about what you don't want to think of and unable to sleep, then remember that life is trying to teach you something. You may have a brilliant insight the next morning, and this insight will be life-changing, because all the events in your life are arranged to happen in a way to get your soul transformation going, and a moment of awareness is the sign that your soul transformation is back on track, so your life events don't need to be as hard anymore because you're doing well. Let me show you how you can tell when you need to change your mindset and in what direction you should change it. The simple answer is whenever you get too emotional, that is when you need to change your mindset and the right direction is the one that makes you feel less negative emotions. For example, whenever you catch yourself feeling too angry, take a break and try to examine your mistakes. Blaming only others for your anger will make you feel angrier and this vicious cycle will make you act in crazy ways that will hurt your relationships and your health. Now, I'm not saying this is easy or that you can do it right away every time you get angry. What I'm saying is that this is the goal you need to aim for to achieve a great mindset that will make you happy, successful, loved, relaxed, and wise. Another example is when you feel unlucky in life, and you start fantasizing about how happier you would be if you were the richest person on earth or if you had a loving spouse taking you on a sunny yacht trip. The more you dwell on the idea of being the unlucky one, the worse your mood will get. Over many years or even decades, you develop a constant gloomy mood, and you think that you are just the victim of a cruel life. This is how many of us end up with the mindset of the victim. This whole process has to be reversed to heal your mind. Every time you feel unlucky in life, think of the many people who are worse off than you, and appreciate what you have. Also, the more you realize that you have some luck in this life, the more you get motivated to seize the opportunities that come your way. Before long, you are not just thinking that you are lucky... You become lucky! Once again, the formula of mindset healing is to be aware that extreme emotions are your warning signs that your thoughts are going in the wrong direction. Even extreme happiness is not what you want to have because sooner or later, something will go wrong and you will suddenly lose that happiness. This causes mental and emotional chaos, the stress of disappointment, failure, loss, and back to feeling like the unlucky one and the victim. Conclusion Life is not that hard, but it is not easy either. Life simply has its natural adversities. Your ultimate mission in life is \"to learn the art of living with grace.\" That is exactly what my spirit guides told me when I asked them about the meaning of my life. When you start becoming able to be stable and confident when your life is down, and relaxed and thoughtful when your life is up, then you have learned the art of living life with grace. The gap between the difficulties will get slimmer, and your excessive emotions will never get the best of you any longer. Chapter 7 \u2014 Healing Emotions In 2005, I was on a quest to heal my emotions, and it was the most amazing adventure of my life. It took me almost a decade, but it was worth every challenge, every tear, every breakthrough. Because I learned to master my emotions like no one else I know. My emotional turmoil began when I was thirty-two and faded away when I was forty-two. It wasn't a sudden change, but a gradual one. I felt lighter, happier, freer from all the negativity that weighed me down. And now, I hardly ever feel any bad emotions, and even if I do, they don't stick around. I have the secret to feeling good, and it's mine forever. That doesn't mean I never get stressed out anymore. Of course I do, life is full of ups and downs. But I don't let the stress get to me, I don't let it pile up inside me. So I have a much easier life than ever before, and probably easier than anyone else on this planet. The thing is, life will always throw you curveballs, but if you keep stuffing your emotions down every time something goes wrong, you're only making your life harder and your pain worse. But if you go through life without any negative emotions in your system, it's like being high all the time. You know how some people use substances to cope with stress and make themselves feel better? Well, that's how I feel naturally. Nothing has changed on the outside, but everything has changed on the inside. And that makes all the difference. The secret to any substance that can make you feel better is not that it increases the dopamine, serotonin, or other chemicals in your nervous system. It is that such a substance simply blocks your emotional baggage from bothering you. When your life gets stressful enough, your emotional baggage gets triggered, which makes you feel hysterically angry, anxious, or depressed. In other words, once you get rid of ALL your emotional baggage, the hysteria of emotional drama, tantrums, extreme highs and lows, and so on will become obsolete. This is not to say that clearing all your emotional baggage is easy, simple, or quick. It is a difficult process, but it is worth it, and not only that, but it is also necessary, because trust me, the more you keep your emotional baggage in your system, the harder your life will become. So, let's start your emotional healing right away! Children are experts at healing their emotions! If you are serious about healing your emotions, you need to feel like a child again, and gradually you will be more honest with yourself, connect with your deeper hidden emotional baggage, and start releasing it. The emotions get released automatically once you establish this connection. Establishing this connection takes time because you have been suppressing your emotions for years and decades, so for each year of emotional suppression you need a month of emotional expression. Eventually, you will cry like a child, laugh like a child, scream like a child, and dance like a child \u2014 Don't you miss these things as an adult? I bet the answer is YES. The reality of life is that everyone learns to suppress emotions as they grow older, especially between the ages of 10 and 20. When a baby laughs, you know it is coming from the heart; you feel a certain rawness and bliss in it. When an adult laughs, you subconsciously know it is a social maneuver. Adults are too aware of people around them to allow their emotions to be real. How many times have you smiled when you felt extremely angry inside? If you are a normal social human being, then you are suppressing your emotions to hide them from others, but you should not hide your emotions from yourself. The art of healing your emotions is to connect with your emotions in your own safe space, and this connection is nothing more than spending time being aware of the feelings that arise inside of you. It is like meditation. And this might well be the reason meditation has been so popular among spiritual masters. Of course, not everyone who meditates would understand this, but there must be many spiritual experts who experienced how meditation for long enough would bring out the buried emotional pain. Of course, going through such an experience is not pleasant, but the result of finally releasing the emotions is blissful and worth all the patience and effort. Emotions get stored in the gut and the chest. Some of the emotions also get stored in the throat and even a little in your hands and legs. Every part of your body could store some emotional energy, but this energy tends to accumulate much more in the organs. So, start by having your quiet time and private space and investigate where you are storing your emotions. Eventually, you will notice anger stored in your tummy and throat and sadness stored in your chest. Once you feel any of these emotions making themselves noticed, relax and allow them to flow. The flow is just the most natural thing in the world; children do it naturally because they have not learned how to suppress it. You just need to feel like a child and the flow of tears, screaming, and sobbing is guaranteed. Once you get your emotions to flow, you will find yourself overly sensitive and a lot of normal things will hit a chord with you and get you quickly emotional. That is fine if you do not overreact in social settings, embarrass yourself and make a scene. You need to keep your emotions to yourself and only express them to yourself when you are on your own. No one likes to see someone going into an emotional meltdown. People are afraid of emotions, and they consider emotional reactions (in an adult) very inappropriate, while they see them as very natural and benign in babies. Once you learn to release your emotions enough, it is only a matter of time until you master your emotions and start feeling relaxed all the time. You will eventually become aware of how your beliefs have created your emotions in the first place, and you can start healing your mindset effectively. A healed mindset does not create destructive emotions. Now, there is a delicate balance between mindset and emotions. The more you heal your emotions, the easier it is to heal your mindset, and the more you heal your mindset, the easier it is to heal your emotions. If your emotions are getting the better of you, then start with emotional release. If you notice that your mind is making you miserable, then start fixing your mindset. Sometimes it is easier this way, and sometimes it is easier the other way. If nothing works, then spiritual healing is your go-to. At the end of the day, no one can heal until they start from a place of purpose, and the purpose is always found spiritually. Changing your lifestyle comes as a result. It is fruitless to try to heal your life by just transforming your lifestyle. Spiritual meaning and purpose are indispensable; otherwise, why set yourself on such an arduous journey when your life is going to end anyway? Chapter 8 \u2014 Healing Lifestyle You want to heal something in your life, whether it is your body, your mind, your emotions, your relationships, or your finances. But how do you get there? The answer is simple: you need to change your lifestyle. You need to adopt a healing lifestyle that supports your well-being and helps you overcome the challenges you face. A healing lifestyle is not a one-size-fits-all solution. It is a personal and customized way of living that suits your unique needs and preferences. It is based on your own judgment and intuition, not on what others tell you to do. A healing lifestyle is made up of your daily habits. Some of these habits are good for you, and some are not. A healing lifestyle is about increasing the good habits and decreasing the bad ones. It is about learning new skills and practices that can enhance your health and happiness. It can be anything from yoga to meditation, from sports to breathing techniques, from herbs to sleep patterns, and so on. The possibilities are endless, and the more you explore them, the more you will discover what works for you. A healing lifestyle is also a journey of search and discovery. It is not about settling for what you already know or what others tell you. It is about being curious and open-minded, and seeking new information and options that can help you heal. It is about looking at yourself as a whole person, not just a collection of symptoms or problems. It is about finding the root cause of your issues, not just treating the surface. It is about being proactive and empowered, not passive and dependent. A healing lifestyle does not mean that you have to do everything by yourself or that you have to avoid professional help. On the contrary, it means that you can benefit from the wisdom and guidance of various holistic healers who can offer you valuable insights and tools for your healing journey. However, it also means that you do not give up your power and responsibility to them. You do not rely on them to fix you or to tell you what to do. You use them as teachers and mentors, not as saviors or authorities. You learn from them and apply what you learn to your own life. You become your own healer. One of the myths that many people have about healing is that it requires a lot of money. They think that they need to spend a fortune on expensive treatments, supplements, therapies, and so on. They think that healing is only for the rich and privileged. But this is not true at all. Healing is for everyone, regardless of their budget. Healing is not about how much money you have, but how much will you have to change. The universe knows what you need for your healing journey, and it provides you with the resources that are best for you. You do not need to worry about having too little or too much money. You just need to adapt to what you have and use it wisely. You might be surprised to find out that wealthier people do not heal better or easier than poorer people. In fact, sometimes it is the opposite. I have seen many clients who had a lot of money but did not heal because they did not put enough effort or commitment into their healing journey. They did not want to change their lifestyle or their mindset. They just wanted a quick fix or a magic pill. On the other hand, I have seen many clients who had a low budget but healed amazingly because they were willing to learn, grow, and transform. They were eager to change their lifestyle and their habits. They were open to new possibilities and opportunities. So, what is a lifestyle change? A lifestyle change is simply a change in your daily habits that supports your well-being and helps you overcome your challenges. A lifestyle change is different for everyone, depending on their needs, preferences, and goals. A lifestyle change is not a fixed or rigid set of rules that you have to follow blindly. A lifestyle change is a flexible and creative way of living that suits your unique personality and situation. For example, one of the lifestyle changes that I made early in my healing journey was to live in nature. I used to go to national parks and spend as much time as possible there, enjoying the beauty, fresh air, quiet loneliness, and thrilling adventure. This helped me heal several chronic health problems with my digestion, tinnitus, back, and more. Living in nature was a healing lifestyle for me at that time. But this does not mean that it is the best or the only healing lifestyle for everyone. It does not even mean that it is still the best healing lifestyle for me now. Every period of life requires a new lifestyle. Life should not be a boring constant routine, which is not the point of a healing lifestyle. A healing lifestyle is an always changing and developing one depending on the need, age, and joy. A healing lifestyle is also a more enjoyable one. If it is not enjoyable anymore, then it is not healing. The healing journey is a journey of excitement and discovery, not a journey of following rules and boredom. Your creativity is not only helpful, but it is also necessary for you to have a great healing journey. Living according to a certain fixed healing dogma is not what a healing journey is about. You need to get inspired by others and discover as much as you can about healing, but at the end of the day, just follow your heart and you are the only person who knows what is right for you. My intention is not to tell you that you must do this and that practice to have a healing lifestyle, on the contrary, I want you to just discover everything for yourself because whatever worked for me might very well be useless to you. Conclusion Medicine is about fixed procedures; holistic healing is about a flexible practice that you incorporate into your lifestyle. Medicine applies one therapy for everyone; holistic healing is about finding your unique ways of healing. Taking the best of what works for you and incorporating it into your lifestyle... That is what healing your lifestyle is about. Chapter 9- Nutritional Healing Welcome to the wild west of the modern world: nutrition! In this land, there are no rules, no laws, and no consensus. You can find any claim you want, backed by some expert or another, and contradicted by another one. Example! Are eggs good or bad for you? Well, that depends on who you ask. Some health gurus will tell you eggs are the devil's food, while others will praise them as nature's perfect protein. And that's just one food item. Imagine the chaos when you try to figure out the whole picture. Why is nutrition so confusing? Because it's not a settled science. It's a young and evolving field that hasn't made much headway in the last few decades. So why bother with nutritional healing at all? Why not just eat whatever we like and rely on other methods of healing? The answer is simple: nutrition matters. A lot. Some health problems can only be solved by changing your diet, and good nutrition is a vital part of any healing journey. Let's hop on a time machine and explore the history of nutritional healing. Two hundred years ago, people had no clue about vitamins. They only knew about three kinds of nutrients: carbs, proteins, and fats. They didn't even know about minerals. The first big breakthrough in nutrition science came with the discovery of vitamin C. There are whole books written about vitamin C and its link to scurvy, a nasty disease that used to kill a lot of people in the 19th century, especially sailors who spent months at sea. Scurvy made people weak, bleeding, and falling apart. It was like their bodies were disintegrating because their tissues were wasting away. Nobody suspected that a missing ingredient in their food could cause such a horror. Until one day, someone experimented with giving lime juice to the scurvy-stricken sailors and found out that it cured them. Any food with enough vitamin C would have done the trick, but vitamin C is tricky because it doesn't last long in old food \u2014 only fresh fruits and veggies (which sailors couldn't get) had enough of it. The cool thing about this discovery was that the guy who made it was British, so Britain had the secret to keeping its sailors alive and healthy. That gave them an edge over other countries in their naval adventures. After vitamin C, people found out about vitamins A and B. Of course, they didn't call them that at first. They called vitamin C anti-scorbutic, because it prevented scurvy. Ever wondered why vitamin C is also called ascorbic acid? It's because of its connection to scurvy. Later, they called it vitamin C because it fit the definition of a vitamin \u2014 something that's essential for life. A lot of people died in the past because they didn't get enough vitamins in their diets, and those deaths helped scientists figure out what vitamins were and what they did. After vitamins, they also found out about other essential nutrients like minerals, fatty acids, and proteins. Interestingly, they never found any essential carbs. With all this knowledge, you'd think that most people (except the very poor) would get enough of the essential nutrients. But nope. Recently, some kids went blind because they didn't get enough vitamin B12. Many young people are so hooked on junk food that they eat tons of bread and fries but very little meat and other foods that have vitamin B12. It's very rare these days that someone dies from a lack of essential nutrients like vitamins and minerals. But it's very common that people feel sick or tired or cranky because they don't get enough of them in their diets. The only way to find out what works for you is to experiment and see what happens. You may discover some surprising combinations that make your diet unique and beautiful. That's how I see nutrition. It's not a science, it's an art. A science of nutrition tries to tell you what is good or bad for everyone, based on large studies and statistics. But you are not everyone, you are you. You have your own body, your own metabolism, your own preferences, your own needs. What works for someone else may not work for you, and vice versa. What works for you today may not work for you tomorrow, or next year, or in ten years. Nutrition is not static, it's dynamic. It changes with time, with seasons, with circumstances, with emotions. So how do you find out what is good for you? By experimenting, by listening to your body, by paying attention to how different foods make you feel. I'm not saying you should ignore the science of nutrition completely, it can give you some useful information and guidance. But don't take it as gospel, don't let it limit your choices or dictate your decisions. Don't fall for the hype or the fads that promise miracle cures or instant results. Don't let others tell you what is best for you without trying it yourself. I have learned this lesson the hard way. I have tried many diets and followed many rules, hoping to find the perfect one that would make me healthy and happy. But none of them did. Some of them made me feel worse, some of them made me feel better for a while but then stopped working, some of them had no effect at all. I was frustrated and confused, until I realized that I was looking in the wrong place. I was looking outside of myself, instead of inside. I decided to stop following rules and start following my intuition. I decided to experiment with different foods and see how they affected me. I decided to be curious and open-minded, instead of rigid and dogmatic. And guess what? I discovered some amazing things about myself and my nutrition. I discovered that seafood gives me more energy and vitality than any other food. I discovered that dairy products make me bloated and sluggish. I discovered that fruits and vegetables make me feel light and refreshed. I discovered that grains and legumes make me sleepy and irritable. Are these scientific facts? No. Are they true for me? Yes. And that's what matters. That's what makes me feel good and healthy and happy. You can do the same thing. You can discover your own nutritional art by experimenting with different foods and observing how they make you feel. You can find out what nourishes you, what heals you, what satisfies you, what delights you. You can create your own masterpiece of health and happiness. Now we come to the practice of nutritional healing, and unfortunately, it is harder than we wish. Most people have their meals in a group, and this makes experimenting with your diet hard and inconvenient. It requires some special effort and willpower to be able to stick to a certain diet for a specific period. You can already see the spiritual lesson in this \u2014 building your soul quality of discipline. You might find it hard at first, and most people give up because of the social pressure and inconvenience, but try as much as you can, and soon being disciplined in your diet gets easier. When life gives you the ability to live on your own, take it as an opportunity to experiment with different diets for limited amounts of time and see how this is affecting your vitality, mood, well-being, and health conditions. There is nothing more healing than an approach of open-mindedness and self-reliance. The story of how Jordan Peterson discovered a diet to heal his arthritis is a very inspirational one. No one told him to try this diet or that diet, but he experimented and figured out that a carnivore diet healed him better than anything else he had tried before. This is not proof that a carnivore diet is an ideal diet for everybody. I know a lot of people who will get unwell if they eat nothing but meat. Some people have a stomach that is not adapted to digesting meat. You cannot put all people in one basket. The ideal diet is unique to each person. Conclusion There is a lot of inaccurate knowledge about nutrition out there. People have different opinions and experiences, and the information is often contradictory. Your job as a true seeker of holistic healing is not to be biased or fanatic about any specific diet, supplement, herb, or nutritional advice. The best way to go about it is to learn what is good for you through personal experimentation. Your body is unique, and so is your experience. It is more valuable than most scientific experiments and experts' opinions. Learn as much as possible from the experts, but take only what works for you. Chapter 10- Medicine:An Imperfect Science One of the most damaging aspects of modern life is the idea that medical science has all the answers, or at least it has the potential to have all the answers. I am not a doctor and I have never had any formal training in medicine, but I have worked my butt off to understand all concepts of medicine over several years. On one hand, I became aware of the enormous value of medicine, but on the other hand, I gained so much reluctance to accept the entitlement of medicine to claim that every single physical, mental, and emotional health or well-being issue has its solution in medicine or at least should be dealt with using the scientific medical approach. In a way, just restricting oneself to the medical approach could be harmful. For example, in the last 20 years, the idea that we need to fix every mood disorder by studying how to balance brain chemicals has gained a lot of popularity, and the idea that everything we think of is somehow merely a series of operations happening in the brain has become the truth for most scientists. No one can explain how consciousness arises from a bunch of cells operating in an extremely complex way, but everyone assumes that must be the absolute truth. People have started to rely on brain scans to understand their mood disorders rather than seeking a psychologist who would help them process their painful memories and heal themselves in a meaningful way. We are almost entering an era where people want to believe that everything should be solved using a pill to manipulate our brains. If you are savvier and more realistic, you would be aware that the complexity of our physiology is infinite and that a narrow perspective in treating every mood disorder by chemically manipulating the brain is like a big experiment humanity is going through. One hundred years later, people might be horrified at the way medicine is dealing with our mental and emotional well-being. History has plenty of examples of how such an experiment could go awry. For example, back in the 1950s, lobotomy was once considered to be a magical treatment for mental disorders. I am sure that any doctor who would perform a lobotomy today would end up in jail for a long time and would never be allowed to practice medicine ever again. Heroin was once the most celebrated cough medicine and then it turned out to be extremely addictive and harmful. Any doctor prescribing heroin today would end up in jail for life. Of course, medicine has saved billions of lives over the years using antibiotics, vaccinations, and amazing surgeries, but this does not make it perfect for dealing with every health, mental and emotional problem. Medicine will always have its deficiencies no matter how many scientific advances humanity achieves, and this is the way life is designed from a spiritual perspective. There is a lot about medicine that I love. For instance, there is nothing more beautiful than getting the right medical attention after having an injury to your body. It is a great blessing that we live in this modern era and that we have access to emergency surgeries when we know for a fact that without surgery we might be living in excruciating pain and physical disability for the rest of our lives. Nothing is more valuable than medicine in those cases. On the other hand, there is a lot about medicine that I hate. Oftentimes, doctors give you some sort of a death sentence by telling you that there is no cure and that you should not even search for a cure because science knows it all and your doctor just assumes that if the answer is not found in the thick medical books then no one has found an answer. From my personal experience, I know that I have healed myself from so many \"incurable diseases.\" Diabetes II might be the perfect example of a common health condition that doctors treat badly. I know many people who figured out how to heal their diabetes by changing their diet. It is not simple or easy, but it is possible. One day in the future, science will start acknowledging that. But in general, whatever went wrong in medicine in the past is rarely talked about or discussed and an apology is rarely ever made in connection to what was a standard treatment in the past but is now considered to be just a horrible idea. The Covid-19 pandemic was a revelation to many. Of course, for the non-savvy, it became a matter of pride to argue against vaccination, and most arguments out there are just based on ego, biases, and bigotry. I believe that medical science has lost some of its perfection in the eyes of most people and that is not a dreadful thing since it gave us more space to think creatively and most importantly to start taking our health into our own hands. It was like humanity needed this pandemic to increase the awareness of how much we should rely on medicine and how much we could rely on our own experience to heal. We are somehow more aware of the limitations of medicine and that is a good thing! Conclusion: Life, health, well-being and happiness are firsthand experiences that we learn and benefit from. We should use all the information available to us, but also make our own judgments and decisions. As the saying goes, \"The best teacher is experience.\" Medicine is great, but with all its greatness, it is far from being perfect. However, your healing process is perfect! It is your unique experience of learning and progressing as a soul. And it is all yours. No one else can get your experience. It is the gift of this life to you. And \"Every cloud has a silver lining.\" Chapter 11- Holistic Healing Modalities Join me as I take you on a journey through the amazing world of healing modalities that I have explored in the past 15 years. I will share with you my honest opinions and personal stories about each one of them, but remember: your mileage may vary.

Conclusion If you are on a journey to heal yourself from whatever is holding you back, you have a map, but it's not very clear. You have to look closely, compare different sources, and make your own decisions. You can't just follow anyone who claims to know the way. You have to be open-minded, but not gullible. You have to be critical, but not cynical. You have to find your own balance between trusting and questioning. I've seen many people who fall into the trap of either extreme. Some are so eager to find a quick fix that they believe everything they hear, without checking the facts or the evidence. They end up wasting their time, money, and energy on false promises and empty hopes. Others are so skeptical that they reject anything that doesn't fit their conventional worldview or their doctor's advice. They miss out on the opportunities and possibilities that the universe offers them. They close themselves off from the healing power of their own intuition and creativity. Don't let yourself be one of them. Find your own sweet spot in the middle. Be curious, but be careful. Be hopeful, but be realistic. Be flexible, but be discerning. And most importantly, have fun along the way. Your healing journey is not a chore or a burden. It's an adventure and a discovery. It's a chance to learn more about yourself and the world around you. It's a gift from the universe, and it's waiting for you to unwrap it. Chapter 12- The Healing Lifecycle Every cell in your body has a lifecycle, and so does your healing process in this life. It has a specific structure that you can understand and use to your advantage. By knowing this structure, you can figure out where you are and where you're going next in your healing process. You can also speed up or slow down the ride, depending on what you need and want. Are you happy with your life right now? Do you feel lucky, satisfied, fulfilled? Or are you unhappy with your life right now? Do you feel miserable, wronged, stuck? The answer to these questions depends only on where you are in your healing lifecycle. If you're happy, it means you're at a certain stage of healing that allows you to enjoy the fruits of your labor. It doesn't mean that your life is better or worse than others, it just means that you're at the right place at the right time. But don't get too comfortable, because this stage won't last forever. Sooner or later, you'll face new challenges and obstacles that will test your faith and resilience. It might take months, years, or even decades until you hit rock bottom in your healing cycle, but rest assured it will happen one day. On the other hand, if you're unhappy, it means you're at a certain stage of healing that requires you to face your wounds and fears. It doesn't mean that your life is hopeless or doomed, it just means that you're at the wrong place at the wrong time. But don't despair, because this stage won't last forever either. Sooner or later, you'll overcome your difficulties and discover new opportunities that will lift your spirits and inspire your dreams. It might take ages, but it will happen one day. They say time flies when you're having fun, and drags when you're not. You might think that some people have more fun than others, or that some people have more pain than others. But the truth is, everyone has a balance of happiness and unhappiness in their lives. Everyone goes through cycles of joy and sorrow, success and failure, love and loss. You can't stop or skip these cycles, they are part of your soul's evolution. You can only move through them, sometimes fast, sometimes slow. And what happens when you die? Well, the ride doesn't end there. It continues in another form, in another place, in another life. Your soul remembers where you left off, and picks up from there. So if you die happy, you'll start happy in your next life. And if you die unhappy, you'll start unhappy in your next life. That's why it's important to heal yourself as much as you can in this life, so that you can enjoy the next one better. Here's a tip for living a fantastic life: Make the last chapter of your life the happiest one. When you die, say goodbye to this world with gratitude and excitement for what's to come. Heal yourself as much as you can in this life, and trust me, you'll thank yourself in the next one. Now, let us zoom in on all the stages of the healing life cycle. Stage Zero \u2014 Normal (feeling Neutral) This is the stage of feeling normal. Life resembles a routine you live through. You are neither incredibly happy nor very unhappy. Your needs are met. You feel fine within yourself and with the world around you \u2014 no big drama. Life is fine but somehow boring. You have plenty of time for contemplation, creating your internal philosophical monologue, and observing how other people live, feel, and think. This neutral stage could last anywhere from one to ten years, depending on how much rest and rejuvenation you need. This is the analog of your summer school holiday. Your soul at this stage is making slow progress, but more importantly, you are unconsciously getting prepared for your next healing cycle. Stage One \u2014 The Pain (The Root Cause) This is the stage of extreme shock. Someone you loved suddenly passed away and you cannot imagine how to live without them. You lost all your money, and now you might be spending the rest of your life homeless on the street. You just discovered that your husband of 20 years is cheating on you. You cannot even imagine what your life will be like next. This stage could last from one month to one year. At this stage, you live in such confusion that you do not know who you are anymore. It is more than what you can deal with and therefore you just shut down until the next stage. Stage Two \u2014 Suppression Stage (Denial) This is the stage of denial. You were unable to deal with your pain (physical or emotional) before but now you have found relief in the unhealthiest way, but still a temporary relief. You are borrowing time to get yourself ready for the healing stage. You are stuck and you know it, but you still do not see how or why you would snap out of it. You are getting into serious addictive behaviors, but you are too weak to resist them. You know that something is wrong with your life, but you cannot imagine any way to fix it. Life is ugly at this stage. It is so ugly that doing unethical things is the right way to live. You are becoming a destructive person. You could not care less about your life. The entire world is wrong, unethical, inhumane, greedy, selfish, and hateful at this stage. You are stuck in a downward-spiraling negative mindset. This stage could last from one year to a lifetime. A lot of people get stuck at this stage. Some people inadvertently end their lives through their unhealthy way of living. Amy Winehouse died from alcoholism. Michael Jackson died from drug abuse. Lots of celebrities get stuck in this stage for ages. If you think money and fame are the way to happiness, you are so far away from the truth. Life is fair. Everyone will have to experience this stage in their healing cycle. No one keeps having it easy and happy forever, even though it might appear to be so. Stage Three \u2014 Rock Bottom (Unhappy Life) This is the worst phase of your life. If you ask yourself whether your life is a happy or unhappy one, you will immediately say that life is very unhappy. At this stage, you just forget about everything happy that you have experienced in your life and see life through the blackest glasses ever. Your whole life is unhappy \u2014 That is what you become sure of. The characteristic of this stage is that all the terrible memories of the past start popping up in your head. You just cannot suppress the painful memories anymore. You prefer not to live. Death for you sounds like a relief at this stage. You might even try it. If you do not try it, you are thinking of trying it now and then. If you survive to the next stage, you are lucky because you will be on your way to safety and happiness. If you hear about someone who committed suicide, you should know that they got stuck at this stage for too long. This stage could last a maximum of 3 years. Any longer than that and the person would be surely dead. Life puts you through this stage, not to torture you aimlessly, but to get you to snap out of your suppressive behavior and start transforming your soul. The decision is yours. No one can steer you in the right direction, although some people might well inspire you, and that is hope! Stage Four \u2014 The Hope (Back on Track) After hitting rock bottom, the universe gives you the most life-changing experience in your cycle. That marks the end of your lowest point and the only way to go is uphill. In 2008, I experienced this hope during an emotionally releasing healing session of Rebirthing Breathwork. I felt such a blissful feeling after that 2-hour healing session that I knew deep in my heart that my life would never be the same and that the future would be beautiful no matter what. I vowed to learn everything about emotional release, to become a healer, and to make it my life mission to pass it down to the world. Now, after 15 years have passed, I am a full-time healer and have helped hundreds and thousands of people heal from all sorts of problems. The hope stage can be best understood when you think of Jean Val Jean (from the famous story of Les Miserables) getting transformed when he experienced the love of a selfless priest \u2014 Something that shocked him to the core and made him realize that life was not just ugly and terrible, there was a deep genuine love out there as well that he had forgotten about. This is the aha moment. The wake-up call. The start of hope. You were living in the most depressive pessimistic internal world, and now you realize that you were wrong. Not everything in life is so bad. The spark of happiness, hope, and love enters your heart, and you can consider yourself lucky since you are onto something great. This stage is usually a short one, no more than a few months long. Stage Five \u2014 The Search (Feeling Incomplete) The stage of hope is not the end of your misery. You are now hopeful, but somehow still miserable. Less miserable than before, but you still have a long way to go to transform your life and soul. However, it is much easier from now on, and it will just get easier and easier. You are on track. You are safely heading toward the best period of your life. I remember my late father (who used to show up very often in my dreams) showed up and told me that he was now feeling relieved that I got there. He told me I was safe now. I was on track. He could put his mind to rest and not worry about me going off track again. But the search period is usually a long one. It took me a decade to finish this stage. This is a stage of healing leading to your soul transformation. It is slow. During this period, you are a work in progress. You are not the final product yet, and you do not even know what the final product will be like. You just know that you are changing slowly every day. Your heart is changing. I used to feel my heart becoming so sensitive that it was melting with the love of everything. You become overly sensitive to people's vibes at this stage. You do not always feel good, and you know you are not perfect and somehow incomplete. Something about you is still incomplete, but you are discovering yourself every day. Life is making more sense every day. You are building a new fresh outlook on life. You do not see life the way you used to see it before. Life has a much deeper and more mysterious meaning than you ever thought. You have the urge to tell everyone about it. But you are still in the process of understanding it. You do not consider your life to be happy or unhappy at this stage, you just consider it to be exciting and mysterious. Stage Six \u2014 The Transformation (Feeling Complete) This is when you start feeling complete. Your life and soul have been transformed and you are now a new person who knows your way in life, but you have not achieved what you are destined to achieve yet. At the time of authoring this book, I am living in this transformation stage. I know my life mission, but I still have a long way to go to work it out and this book is one part of my life mission. This is a very productive stage. This stage could last anywhere between three to ten years. It is the period of getting used to your new self and becoming settled with all the changes in your personality. You have developed into a nicer, calmer, gentler, more loving human being, but you still have traces of your old self that get triggered now and then. The transformation will need to be completed before you can get to the next stage, which is the pinnacle of your healing cycle. Stage Seven \u2014 The Rewards (Happy Life) This is the prime time of your life. You have more than you asked for. You feel blessed with everything and everyone. You look back at your life and feel that it all makes sense now and that it had to be that way. You needed to go through all the hardship and challenges to get to where you are now. If anyone asks you whether your life is a happy one or not, you would say it was happy all along, although, in reality, you were about to commit suicide from unhappiness at a certain point. Once again, you look at it now in a positive light and you even see it as a happy, lucky, positive, important event of your life. You have simply forgotten everything hard you went through, and you are too overwhelmed with the blessings in your life to be able to think that life is cruel in any sense. You feel the divine protection and love all over you. You trust and believe in the higher power that kept you alive and guided you every step of the way. It is a very spiritual time. It is the time when you give from the heart and people see in you a loving soul. This stage lasts anywhere between days, weeks, or even years depending on how much reward the universe wants to give you. The more work you have put in previous stages to transform your soul, the longer the happiness stage will last. Your soul at this stage is taking a break. It is like celebrating your graduation. The only problem is that your soul is not going to be progressing much during this period. That is why this stage cannot last a lifetime. Eventually, you will have to move on to your next healing life cycle which could also be in your next lifetime. My spirit guides told me repeatedly that my life will end on a high note while I am feeling complete and happy during this reward stage. It is good to leave this world feeling complete. Stage Eight \u2014 Normalizing Again (End of Cycle) Unfortunately, nothing lasts forever and the happiness and joy of having achieved your goals will slowly become old news and you are back to mundane life, a bit boring, but still fine. You just feel normal at this stage. Conclusion A healing life-cycle is a series of stages that you go through to heal your wounds, learn your lessons, and fulfill your purpose. Each cycle has a beginning and an end, and each one brings you closer to your true self. Sounds amazing, right? But how long does it take to complete a cycle? And how many cycles can you do in one lifetime? Let me tell you. The average healing life-cycle duration is 30 years. That means it takes about three decades to go through all the stages and reach the peak of your happiness and fulfillment. Of course, this is not a fixed rule. Some people may take longer or shorter than that. The minimum time to complete a cycle is seven years, and the maximum time is forever. Yes, some people may never finish a cycle, because they get stuck in one stage or they resist the change. The longer the cycle, the more intense the transformation. So, you get the point! That is why we live so long. We are here to heal and grow as much as we can. But what about those who die young? Do they miss out on their healing journey? Not at all. Even if they don't complete a full cycle, they still go through some stages and make some progress. Every stage counts. Every experience matters. No life is wasted or useless. And who knows, maybe they will continue their journey in another lifetime. And what about those who live very long? Do they get to do more cycles than others? Well, yes and no. The maximum number of cycles that anyone can do in one lifetime is three. That means if you live more than 90 years, you can complete three cycles. That's quite impressive, don't you think? But most of us will not be able to do more than two cycles. I am now 50 years old, and I am in the middle of my second cycle. My spirit guides showed me that I will finish my second cycle in about 12 years. After that, I will be happy for the rest of my life (I am not expected to live beyond the age of 70). I will not need to start the third cycle. You might be wondering: can we choose when to start a cycle? Can we speed up or slow down the process? The answer is YES. Of course, most people are not aware of their cycles or their spirit guides, but if you are like me, and you have a strong connection with your spiritual helpers, you can ask them to guide you to your next cycle when you are ready. Yes, this is very rare, but I chose to start my second cycle right after I finished my first one because I saw how much it changed me for the better. I wanted more of that. "}
