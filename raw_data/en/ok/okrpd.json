It is a longblock\u2014as close to four weeks as possible\u2014so I had time to develop a multi-dimensionalapproach to chemistry. I also had a wide range of students to consider. Classes aretypically made up of interested students some who are not so interested. I had to treat thesubject in a way that can woo those who might think a test tube will swallow them wholeif they get too close and win those who can't wait to see the whole school go up in a ballof fire. Fortunately I find chemistry to be very exciting without the great balls of fireand am particularly fond of the human side of it. And that gave the range of purpose aspecial focus. We are all human, at least in our better moments, I reasoned, so why notmake that the key to a wide range approach to chemistry? And that is just what this littlehistory of chemistry tries to do\u2014get to the human side of how the science developed andshow just how human it is. That way I could show how chemistry (or any other science)is a process rather than an authoritative body of knowledge that is remote from thestudent and indifferent to human experience. Not only that, but perhaps even more tothe point, history paralleled with some period experiments can give an orderly anddevelopmental approach to the basic laws of chemistry. And if I did it right, I toldmyself, I could put the historical approach to some new use in a variety of ways. Justplain chapter summaries were one option for a class with some really good writers. Ormaybe paragraphs on each major player in the process. Or thematic studies, say, of howtrends of thought go from Pythagorus, to the law of constant proportions. Or, I could usethe text to introduce major characters and let it act as a springboard for student reports.Anyway, the idea of such an approach was exciting\u2014it offered a way to maximize myoptions. And even, I told myself perhaps too fondly, the book could be a good little readin case anyone might want a short look at the history of chemistry with a few extrasadded. So with a grab-bag of possibilities in mind, I looked over my bookshelf andnoticed some books on chemistry I hadn't gotten around to reading and put my veryhuman intentions to work.Bearing in mind that the book had to be a good read that made the materialaccessible and even \"fun work\" I had some definite parameters. I had to be careful notto make it too long\u2014didn't want to turn anybody off. I knew I had to shape the wholething so it would get to the essence of the science and of the human in an imaginativeway. I also knew that Waldorf students have high expectations and can be very picky.As teachers we can perhaps take the blame for some of that; all around high expectationsbeing the staff of life on the daily menu. And what goes around comes around. So Iknew I'd better come up with something that would be a combination of cool, fiery andsmooth, yes, but which also developed an approach to science that captured theenthusiasm and intensity of the chemists who spent incredibly long hours in dirty labsanalyzing concoctions of dubious smoky looking fluids, and smelling it all down inreeking rooms\u2014just to see the beautiful mysteries of an unknown world. Yes, chemistshave to be a little crazy and that was fine. My students could relate to that. But the6question was, did I mix it all together in the right proportions so they could sense at leastthe presence of those beautiful mysteries transmuting themselves into reality? That canbe tricky. It requires a very deft hand and a subtle pen\u2014far more subtle than my clumsyattempts at getting the words to wriggle right. So on the book's first try some years ago,I was a little anxious to see how the class would go for it. And they didn't bat an eye.They just took it, read it and with a little urging discussed it and treated it like it wasanother day's work. They seemed to think it was the most natural thing in the worldthat a teacher would write something like that and that was that. I didn't even get thehonor of being cool. Not even 20 seconds of fiery fame. On second thought though,why should I be surprised? After all, even as a good read this translated into some goodwork and lots of it. But the main thing was, it seemed to be working. It went with theflow and I tried to tell myself that down deep they were enjoying it. But there were a fewgroans. Part of me said this was great\u2014no pain to gain. Yeah! This is taking them upthe old hill for a little exercise! Then I thought I'd better read it again and decided tochange a few things here and there. I had to admit there really were some rocks in thestream, some places the needed some more clarification, better phrasing, etc. And that ishow a lot of the editing went. The students would suggest this and that or ask too manytimes to have a point clarified and I knew I had to go over it again. I did and all was fine.In fact they kind of liked helping write it as long as they didn't have to rewrite anysummaries. Fortunately this never happened. So what follows is the result of a lot ofback and forth work. In many ways it is a book written for students I taught and bystudents who taught me.On the other hand, the book took a direction that wasn't necessarily the directionmy students wanted to see. It kept growing. With the editing came the rethinking andwith the rethinking came a little more here and a little more there. And then, finally, theinevitable happened. The last chapter grew and split like a one-celled organism and asequel was born that attempts to tell where it is all going. The organic metaphor isdoubly appropriate as the verbal growth was largely inspired by recent work in the fieldsof biochemistry and biology. The science of complexity that has grown from discoveriesin these fields has focused on how organisms function as holistic units and depend oncooperative relationships, both in their chemistry and in their nurturing environments.And this fitted right into the direction I wanted to go for the twelfth grade. Indeed, as thebook grew, so did my ideas on how to use it. I began to see that the last two chaptersoffered a launching pad of ideas and suggested an experimental repertoire that leddirectly to a study of holistic systems, both as chemical and biological phenomena. Thiscould easily be taken into the direction of certain suggestions Rudolf Steiner made onhow the twelfth grade was to take up the study of chemistry in the human body. It wouldalso allow me to move rather nicely back into the organic direction in a way thatcomplemented our studies in the tenth grade. Just as we passed from the organic cyclesof nitrogen into the chemistry of inorganic polarities via the lime cycle in the tenth year,now we were exiting the realm of the inorganic via the electric fields generated by theelectrolytes of Arrhenius and Faraday. These fields would open the way tounderstanding holistic systems and how they generate fields of their own. Thus the bookseemed to open a certain holistic pattern to the pedagogy as well. Of course this meant alot of work and research for yours truly. A little something, I told myself, that mightmake my students feel like they weren't alone. And why not. Growing is what we're all7about. Never grow too old to grow, I tell myself and if my students can teach me howit's done the least I can do is plant a few growing signs that tell where it all might go.And then there's the question of the endnotes. Truth is, there was just so muchthat I felt I just couldn't leave out. Then I got to thinking that the notes might be usefulon other levels besides direct course support. As the scope widened it seemed like theexpanding material might give the book a wider appeal that would make it useful foranyone with more general interest. Or a student with a deeper interest. So as I annotatedthe quotes to tell who wrote what, it made sense to throw in a little more about the howand the why. Dust off the facts and add a trusty thought or two...and that is how theendnotes grew. But dusting off meant casting off the dusty reputation endnotes have fornot being the most exciting stuff to peruse. They required their own brand of color to bein their own endnote way, a good read. And so I colored and added a little here and alittle there. And the endnotes, they became, lo and behold, something of a companionvolume. A little subtext on the sly. I congratulated myself: I had succeeded in sneakingin another whole little book without defeating the original short and sweet purpose. Well,almost. But at least the information is there in case I want to refer to it in class. Or incase that student with a deeper interest needs a little more to chew on. There really arestudents like that. Some students would rather be doing exciting stuff like creativewriting, drama, basketball; some students get their jollies doing chemistry. They are rareand you have to take good care of them when they do come in and smell the latest bestcreation in the molecular line or just want to chat. And because they deserve the best (Itell myself) they get the best, endnotes and all. Then there's always some poor studentwho misses a day or two due to illness or to just being worn out from too much living intoo short a time. For them the book (with or without the endnotes) can provide a muchneeded thread of continuity. The idea then is not to just provide a little something for afew lucky souls, but also a grain of special interest for those who want it, continuity forthose who need it and a meaningful introduction to all. So here it is. Right here were usstudents can use it the best way we can.8OriginsAs Berthelot states in the introduction to Les Origines de L'Alchimie, ancientchemistry is derived from a book of secret knowledge given to man when certain celestialbeings made amorous and successful advances to the women of earth.1 Unlikeastronomy, which has revealed some of man's aspirations to more heavenly pursuits, itseems that the origins of chemistry hail from a desire to go the other way bring heavendown to earth. Others would point out that this might also refer to how those of a higherplane became enthusiastically coupled with affairs of a lower order. But high or low, it ishard for mere mortals to interpret such things; suffice it to say that ancient chemistry wasquite literally a marriage of above and below. Other accounts carry this \"as above sobelow\" theme a step further and attribute the dawn of chemistry to Hermes Trismegistus,meaning \"thrice wise,\" who in the Egyptian pantheon of the gods is associated with thedeity Thoth, the deity of healing (hence the Greek association with the god Hermes).Thoth is also known for bringing the divine fire of writing to of the Land of Chem, asancient Egypt was known.2 Far from meeting the same fate as his Greek counterpart,Promethius, Thoth-Hermes was looked upon as the guiding spirit of all-healing wisdomand the preserver of ancient secrets of nature and the gods. The religious focus of Thoth-Hermes was to transform the land of Chem\u2014\"chem\" meaning meaning black, the colorof the earth brought down by the Nile each year\u2014into a path of initiation that unitedhuman consciousness with the divine consciousness of the gods. This required a lot oftransformation and that was what Egyptian initiation was all about\u2014the transformationof the dark fertile earth without into an inner path that would reunite the soul with itscosmic origin. Thanks to their gift for writing, the Egyptians described this path ofinitiation in hieroglyphics which we have learned to read. They told of how they lookedforward to the return of the soul to the cosmic world of light\u2014a return that reunited thesoul with Osiris, the deity of light and wisdom. When Osiris was slain by the wind godSet, he retired to the heavens where he welcomed light bearing souls who transformedthemselves with wisdom and truth. Isis, his ever faithful spouse, remained on earth tohelp the process along. Part of that process became the science of Chem, later to beknown as chemistry. And that, of course, is the part that interests us here.To be sure, this process was a rich and substantial one, full of many great works.Sacred architecture in the temples of Karnac or the pyramids of Giza (especially theGreat Pyramid) preserved a wisdom that even today proves to be astounding. Fromstudying Egyptian architecture and reading Egyptian hieroglyphics we find for examplethat the Egyptians must have known the radius of the earth and the distance around theequator with an accuracy that has only been equaled in the 20th century.3 We also knowfrom the extensive use of the Golden Mean in sacred architecture that the Egyptiansattached a great deal of importance to proportions found in nature. This combined with adesire to unite the soul with the source of divine inspiration created both a horizontaldimension and a vertical dimension to Egyptian life that some have compared to theChristian cross.4 For the Egyptian, however, the horizontal and vertical dimensionsserved to unite the above and below of life that made the soul truly human where to betruly human was to also be divine. Both in myth and in practice, the credo of Egyptianscience was indeed \"as above, so below.\" It was a science of process, both inner and9outer, that married the human, the natural and the divine. For the Egyptian initiate this\"thrice wise\" process would leave the mind with a clear focus on how the human upliftedand fulfilled nature and render the eye clairvoyant and the spirit receptive to workingwith a divine being or beings.Ah, but the times, they do change...or seem to. Now science serves the real andthe physical and the things of everyday life. So it is not too surprising that along the wayfrom then to now the ancient science of Chem became more involved with tilling theblack soil (oil?) of human progress than with cultivating relationships with nature, otherpeople or the gods. Part of this might be because we have become our own gods. Wehave created a whole new world we can hold in our hands, a world that ranges fromplastic cups to satellite communication systems. And between the cups in the gutter andthe satellite dish, it can seem like the healing aspect of early chemistry has beenforgotten. Later we will see how this will work itself out and how something of the oldwill be reborn in the new. As far as we are concerned now, however, it will take us werewe want to go if we consider that satellite dishes and pyramids really do have somethingin common. It is a universal fact of life that regardless what civilization we are in wehave to deal with the physical substance of life. Even the Egyptians, with all theirheavenly wisdom, had to understand the nature of matter. In this light we can see howthey too shared a common goal with modern chemistry. Old or new, there is anunderlying assumption that the world will somehow be a better place if we can onlyunderstand the nature of substance. But a note of caution: the black substance of science has a dark side. Recenthistory tells us that any na\u00efve assumption about science being the gateway to progress canbe hazardous to our health. When an openness to all phenomena unites with a sinceresearch for truth we can hope to make the world a better place through science. Butscience, like anything else in the wrong hands, can go awry. Dr. Mengele of NaziGermany and his wartime atrocities with human guinea pigs is an example of the worstrank. Mengele, like thousands of his countrymen, had allowed himself to become thetool of degenerate powers. Though one can argue that these powers are beyond thecontrol of any one individual the fact remains that individual responsibility for one'sactions is a moral issue. We had a much less drastic though comparable case of the samemindset when, in the final days of WWII, the first atomic bomb was being rushed tocompletion at Los Alamos. Frank Oppenheimer, brother of J. Oppenheimer whodirected the project, sounds a warning note regarding those frantic last hours when therace to complete the bomb was a national priority:Amazing how the technology tools trap one, they're so powerful. I wasimpressed because most of the sort of fervor for developing the bomb came as akind of anti-Fascist fervor against Germany. But when VE Day came along,nobody slowed up one little bit. No one said, \"Ah well, the main thing\u2014itdoesn't matter now.\" We all kept working. And it wasn't because we understoodthe significance against Japan. It was because the machinery had caught us in itstrap and we were anxious to get this thing to go.5If the story of science is the tale of man's predominance over nature, the predominance oftechnology over man seems to be a case of the tale wagging the dog. As in the case10today with so much controversy over global warming, cloning and the misuse of geneticinformation (including genetically modified foods), moral questions of individualresponsibility are always an issue. And many scientists warn of what can happen or willhappen if we do not heed the warning signs that are ever more obvious in our humanexperience and in our environment. Frank Openheimer's alarm sounds a familiar call;the need to \"get this thing to go\" coupled with the need to \"get the dough\" are, alas, thethemes of endless tragedy. Indeed, the lesson seems to be that the Egyptians had goodreason to insist on science being accompanied by a more responsible moralconsciousness. We will see some hopeful signs at the end of our brief history that a newturn in this direction is happening.The French have a saying that the more things change, the more they stay thesame. To some extent the history of chemistry bears this out. Though the way weperceive the world around us has completely reversed itself in the last four hundred yearsmany of the basic assumptions and concepts remain unchanged. Yet there has been afundamental twist that has given modern thought a new direction. Instead of looking foruniversal truths pertaining to love, hate, or our place in the cosmic order of things, as wasthe custom inherited from the Greeks, modern science has become a search for truths ofthe universe, truths that tell the acceleration of a falling object, the speed of light, or thedistance to the nearest quasar. The Greek philosophers started from the top; they soughtthe reasons for existence in universal principles and then looked for how these principlesworked in the details of everyday life. Modern science begins at the bottom with thedetails and builds them into a comprehensive view or theory. The first method is calleddeductive in that it deduces from a holistic principle how fundamental truths apply to theworld as a whole. The second is called inductive as it derives from analytical detail aview of how all the parts work together. An example of deductive reasoning can befound in the way we apply the universal principle of breath\u2014a principle that inhales asmuch as we like to exhale\u2014to how metals expand or contract, to how plants expandupward to bloom and contract into a seed, etc. A classic example of inductive reasoningmight be the boy who tears apart a clock to see how it works and then has to figure outhow to get the pieces to tell time. It will become clear that one of the purposes of thiscourse will be to show how these two approaches to knowledge, the one starting with theholistic approach, the other with the analytical, can complement each other andessentially end up at the same place. Yet the two modes of thought and their effect onindividual consciousness can be very different. To see how this can be and to see howwe owe so much to both modes of thought, we will often need to compare the modernwith the ancient. And because we owe so much of our modern thought to the Greeks(who borrowed extensively from Egypt) we will take a brief look at those Hellenistic andholistic attitudes that laid the foundation for western philosophy and modern science. Berthelot quotes Parmenides, a fifth century Greek philosopher, as saying that\"everything stems from a uniquely eternal and immobile essence.6\" Other axiomaticstatements such as \"one is all, by this all is\" are common in Greek alchemical andphilosophical writings. One-ness was seen to represent a divine wholeness that split orengendered two-ness when the world was created. All opposites therefore come fromone-ness. But a more modern mind might do some head scratching and ask, \"What onearth does this mean?\" So consider a cloud. It is one and uniform\u2014a body of watervapor\u2014and being on the heavenly side of life, as good an example of heavenly one-ness11as we are apt to find in everyday life. So we have this cloud, this earthly example ofone-ness. Then raindrops form in the cloud and it is no longer one or uniform, it containswater and vapor. Aha! Two-ness. Parmenides would say the cloud represents the\"uniquely eternal and immobile essence.\" The drop represents the first step in creation.But it is a very special drop\u2014the very smallest drop beyond which one cannot get anysmaller. Otherwise there would be nothing. This smallest \"drop\" is what he callsbeginning or primordial substance. According to Parmenides, all matter is made of thesesmallest drops. Pack them together in different ways and we have true bluesubstance\u2014or maybe some true yellow substance (when the sun shines). All fresh fromheaven to your doorstep. But don't laugh. As we shall see, he was very close to hittinga modern mark; an important part of modern physics called particle theory is all aboutfinding the smallest drop.Another Greek philosopher whose thought left marks on western science wasPythagoras. In contrast to Parmenides who sought a unifying concept with hisprimordial substance, Pythagoras sought to connect heaven and earth. In this he was verymuch a student of Egypt. Like the Egyptians, he saw a harmony of nature and the divineas essential to the well-being of humankind. And the way to achieve this harmony waswith numbers, numbers that told of relationships between the human, the natural and thecosmic-divine. For Pythagoras, numbers represented certain principles like the one-nessand two-ness above and the play of earthly opposites (as in yin and yang). He also sawthe dynamic presence of numbers in nature. He knew of the Golden Mean from hisstudent days in Egypt and was familiar with how the proportions derived from theFibonacci series live in the many forms of plants and animals. We might recall how wedemonstrated this in the ninth grade with the pineapple, the way leaf stems rotate up astalk and our own bodies. We saw how the Golden Mean relates to how organismsgrow; it is a proportion of nature, of earth. The circle, on the other hand, relates to howthe sun and stars rise and set; it belongs to the heavenly worlds, to the cosmos.7 The onebrings harmony and beauty to earth; the other expresses a connection with the universe.But again, numbers: the cosmic and universal value of was found by the Egyptians andby Pythagoras in the simple fraction, 22 / 7 (22 \u00f7 7 = 3.1428). They knew this was notexact: the value of 3.1416 was used in the Great Pyramid.8 But the numbers 22 and 7were highly symbolic. The number twenty-two represents both two-ness and one-nessunited (as in 2 x 11). The number seven, as everybody knows, represents the sevencolors in a rainbow, the seven planets and the 7 x 4 days in a lunar month. How cosmiccan you get! Small wonder that for Pythagoras the harmony of heaven and earth was aquestion of simple ratios. All that remained was to apply simple fractions to music andhuman beings could tune themselves to the heavenly spheres. To achieve such loftyaims, western music was born. It was thanks to the Pythagoreans that we have our seven-tone scale with its major and minor ratios between notes to locate the pitch in accord withsimple fractions. It works as follows. If C on a piano, for example, has a frequency of fo,the G above it will have a frequency of 3/2 fo to create an interval of a fifth. This can beseen on the scale, C, E, D, F, G, A, B (do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti) as being the distancebetween C (do) and the fifth note, G (sol). Likewise, a fourth corresponds to a C_Finterval where the frequency of F is 4/3 fo. This can be seen as the distance from do tofa. A major third has a C_E ratio of 5/4 and a major sixth a C_A ratio of 5/3, etc.9 Soevery time we play the lyre we have special cause to remember the original seven strings12in Apollo's heavenly lyre or the fact that Pan put seven reeds in nature's flute. We alsohave the story of how Orpheus wooed hill and dell with his seven toned lyre. We willhave reason to keep this in mind when scientists start talking in the 19th century abouthow the laws of matter conform to what, in all seriousness, is called the law of octaves.Pythagoras was not alone in adding a vital chord to modern western culture.Heraclitus, a sixth century philosopher and younger contemporary of Pythagoras, alsosounded a recurring theme with his search for permanence in an ever changing world.His well-known saying that one cannot stand in the same river twice alludes to this.Though the river as a river is permanent and will always be there, one cannot stand in thesame water twice because the river as water is always flowing downstream. But thesearch for permanence doesn't end there. What makes a river flow, for Heraclitus, iswarmth, since once frozen the river will cease to exist as a river. Hence his conclusionthat warmth was the permanent essence of the universe that kept it all flowing\u2014like a bigriver. For Heraclitus, the primordial essence spoke of above must be an \"ever livingfire\" which pervades all existence through its many aspects of transformation. We willsee by and by how us moderns have a similar take on something near and dear to ourculture\u2014something we even fight wars for. Stay tuned (Pythagorean pun intended).The old adage that no man lives on an island holds just as true for the early Greekphilosophers as for the scientists who created modern chemistry. This is not just becausemen and women are necessarily affected by their times, rather it is more because it ishuman nature to reckon with the times in which we live and try to understand them. Thefifth century Greek philosopher Empedocles was no exception. Writing and teachingduring the time of the Peloponnesian war, he saw the world as divided between opposingforces such as love and strife. His philosophy also allowed for the four elements, earth,water, air and fire to act out their opposing natures in the play of existence. And thenthere is Democritus, the student of Leucippus. We will never know if a feeling of humanpowerlessness in the face of a warring world gave rise to the notion of a worlddetermined by atoms, but it is curious that the first attempt at atomic theory was ripenedin the mind of Democritus at this tumultuous time. Atoms offered a far more fragmentedlook at the world than Empedocles ever dreamed of. They became the unifying principlethat Democritus developed not into a science, but into a philosophy. Like the rest of theminds of his time, he was only interested in principles, not experimental fact. Butbecause he tried to explain purely physical phenomena with an idea, he did anticipate themodern trend of adopting a theory that would require verification in the physical world.In all the Greeks there was an implicit faith in the power of the mind to discoverthe meaning of life. In this way the Greeks in general and the Greek philosophers inparticular are the true sons of Odysseus, the wily prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Athena, the goddess of witand wisdom. And the greatest of Greek philosophers, Socrates, and his disciple, Plato,held the mind in especially high regard. Plato, the student of Socrates, saw reason as akind of divine fire that united the inner world of the mind with the nous or universalMind. With Plato we have a body of thought that in many ways united much of theGreek philosophy that came before him. For example, the nous or universal Mind ofPlato is closely related to the \"living fire\" of Heraclitus. To illustrate this we have hisallegory of the cave.10 In Plato's cave prisoners are bound with their backs to a fire thatcasts shadows before them. Since the only thing they see is a world of shadows, it is thiswhich they call reality. Finally, upon breaking free, a prisoner discovers the fire that13creates the shadows. In so doing he discovers the power of reason that lives in his ownmind. Upon venturing outside the cave, however, the prisoner discovers the sun, the lightthat illumines the whole world of which the individual mind is only a part. The sunrepresents the universal Mind that makes it possible for the individual mind to conceiveof an ideal world that differed from the real and non-ideal world of everyday life. In thelight of this universal Mind we learn to see how all of nature and human existence ismade of patterns (archetypes and forms) that exist in the spiritual world. These patternscan also be ideal patterns of behavior such as honesty, fidelity, etc. For Plato it was thetask of the wise philosopher to guide others toward a better way \"patterning\" their liveswith such virtuous ideals and of seeing the archetypal patterns in nature. Perhaps thegreatest and most consequential gift of Plato was the manner in which he sought to guidethe mind toward an understanding of a more ideal way of life. The story of the cave is acase in point. For Plato the mind would have to look upward to see the enlightening sunbefore human beings were ready to truly find meaning and ultimate direction in life. In Raphael's painting, The School of Athens, Plato holds a copy of the Timaeuswhile pointing with his right hand to the heavens and Aristotle, holding a copy of hisEthics, extends his right hand horizontally toward the center of the painting. In fact it isthe center since the vanishing point of the painting and Aristotle's hand occupy the samepoint. In this way the artist chose to illustrate a Renaissance perception of how the twophilosophers differed. By showing Plato pointing to the heavens and Aristotle holding alevel hand over the earth the point is made that Aristotle's philosophy, being lessconcerned with ideals and archetypes of the spiritual world, looks more to the earth for itsdefinition of truth. Raphael's evaluation is as perceptive as it is suggestive. It points toAristotle as a philosopher who was more focused on here and now relationships. Forexample: suppose you are building a house and your design is a very postmodern mix ofEnglish Tudor, gothic and ranch style architecture. If you try hard you can imagine sucha thing\u2014lots of battle-ready turrets, a few gargoyles overlooking the ranchy verandas andsome three story stucco held in place with those Tudor looking boards... And whatwould Plato think of your house? Well, after gazing in dubious wonder at the mix ofpatterns and forms he might scratch his head and wonder if you'd had a sunstroke. Butnot Aristotle. He'd be more concerned with the quality of the stone, the grain of thewood and whether or not it were downwind from the Parthenon or your neighbor'sprivy.11 And if you were being super scientific you would probably note that almost allof his observations would be rather hard to measure. But you also notice (with no smallrelief) that he doesn't say one word about the gargoyles in the vestibule if they make agood hat rack. It's your house, your mind, and if you want to live in your mind's idea ofa house, it's up to you. But he would tell you to keep a true head for functionalrelationships and suggest that a suit of armor in the kitchen might be out of place. Tothis we might add that the real question for Aristotle has more to do with how the mindsees relationships here and now and how to determine what is true from how objectsrelate to one another. In this way, we might say that Aristotle gave a new and moremodern twist to the Greek search for truth. He is less concerned with philosophicalgeneralities and indeed has a level handed way of comparing objective details. Histhinking appreciates the quality of relationships in a way that is distinctly lacking in themeasure all number all and weigh all thinking so characteristic of modern science. But14don't sell him short for all of that\u2014we will discover in our last chapter that a science ofqualities and relationships has a modern role to play.A major stepping-stone from Greece to the Middle Ages was the Philosopher'sStone. In many ways it was a kind of Platonic ideal that existed in the mind and in otherways it was a kind of Holy Grail of alchemy that stood at the end of a long quest. Thequest was half method and half inner development and half art and if the halves didn'talways add up the inner struggle did. This much recalls the Egyptian approach to sciencewith its long initiation that changed the initiate to give him or her new faculties of insightand vision. For the alchemist this amounted to new powers of understanding at the endof long search. And human nature being what it is, alchemists varied in their approach:some went for the arts of wisdom and insight (esoteric) and some went for the method(exoteric). This made the search for the Philosopher's Stone a quest for truth and/or theright method to achieve the \"Great Work.\" This \"Great Work\" could consist ofknowledge, the elixir of life, healing medicines or perhaps the secret of transmuting baserstuff into something that glitters. There were recipes for the Stone that combined suchwild sounding ingredients as Philosophical Gold, Sophic Mercury and Salt of thePhilosophers along with purified gold, silver and quicksilver (and if it wasn't pure, thewhole work could fail). This would be mixed and treated with fire in the Philosopher'sEgg (also called a Hermetic Vase) where a combination of pressure and fire created the\"Process of the Great Work.12\" Mark that word \"process.\" We heard it before with theEgyptians. Now we find it alive and well with alchemy. As with Egyptian science,alchemical process was seen as an art to improve on natural process.13 Now add to thethis a dash of primordial substance\u2014the alchemical secret spice. And consider:diamonds and other gemstones are formed in the earth from the natural process of heatand pressure. If the alchemist could duplicate this, treating the right combination ofsubstances with the right heat and pressure, it's perfectly reasonable to suppose that withthe right method and process one might shift the primordial substance around bit andchange some dull and drossy substance like lead into gold or something black intosomething that really glitters like diamonds. And with that much prepared for the GreatWork, we can get into our time travel device and skip to the 21st century where the searchfor the right method/process and the desire to improve on nature lies at the heart ofanother Great Work, the work of modern science. And alchemy? Today we process theright method to perform alchemical feats as a matter of routine. We create artificialgemstones from diamonds to sapphires, manipulate primordial substance in nuclearreactors to transmute elements (where plutonium is more valuable than gold, alas) andafter reading how genetic engineering hopes to improve on nature one wonders if theelixir of life is hype or just another hop down the yellow brick road to the Wizard of Oz.And while we're so busy improving things, some may wonder if we need a realPhilosopher's Stone to improve the quality of our thinking\u2014and provide the wisdom toknow what to do when the golden bricks don't fit!Fortunately we don't have to worry about turning yellow bricks to gold\u2014that'sfor modern science to deal with. And we aren't there yet. For now it's back to the realstory of alchemy, to a historical individual who was at least in the shadow of thePhilosopher's Stone. Phillipus Aureolus Theophrastus Bombast von Hohenheim (1493-1541), who avoided the tamer name of Phillip by rechristening himself Paracelsus, aname that gave the second-century medical writer, Celsius, a new face. And what a face15it was. A sweet smelling moniker like Phill, Aury or Theo would never have done justiceto the larger than life character Paracelsus became; here was a man who not only chose agrander name but also a destiny to match. Born near Zurich into a life of medicine, hetook the advice of his physician father to study metallurgy and alchemy in the mines ofthe Tryol mountains. From there he went to Italy and pursued a degree at the Universityof Ferrara.14 After these formal studies and much traveling to acquaint himself with folkremedies and the medicines of different cultures, we then find him in Basil where heproved his medical skills by curing a local dignitary of a chronic and debilitating disease.Thanks to this success he became Medical Officer of Health at Basel. He wasn't to staythere for long, however\u2014he was to leave, as one author writes, in an \"undignifiedmanner.15\" This is not surprising. Not one to mull over his opinions in private, he wasable to offend the academic doyens of medicine at the University of Basel in grand style.What made this all the more galling and enabled Paracelsus to practice in Basel as long ashe did was the fact that he had become a household name for healing. To achieve thisfame he practiced medicine instead of just spinning out a lot of theory. He practiced hiscures and treatments both on himself and on others. He believed that if you didn't try amedicine either on yourself or see its effectiveness with your own eyes it was unprovenand suspect. This experimental approach was opposed to the philosophical \"medicine\"passed down for the works of the Arab healers, Galen and Avicenna. In 16th centuryEurope, practical medicine such a bleeding, tooth pulling, surgery, applying herbalremedies, setting broken bones and the like was done by barbers. All too frequently theirattempts to heal were guided more by local superstition than by any real knowledge ofherbs or the human body. Real \"doctors\" mixed Galen and Avicenna with localsuperstition and passed it off as the philosophy and theory of medicine of the day. Theytaught at the universities where handling a corpse was unthought of. To touch diseasedtissue was seen as undignified or worse. The medicaments they prescribed often hadlittle to do with the ailments in question and a lot to do with the wealth of the person whowas ailing. Paracelsus railed against such abuses. After publicly burning the works ofGalen and Avicenna in a symbolic show of contempt he challenges the medical elite ofBasel with mocking ridicule:If your physicians only knew that their prince Galen...was sticking in Hell, fromwhence he has sent letters to me, they would make the sign of the cross uponthemselves with a fox's tail. In the same way your Avicenna sits in the vestibuleof the infernal portal.Come then and listen, imposters who prevail only by the authority of yourhigh positions. After my death, my disciples will burst forth and drag you to thelight and shall expose your dirty drugs...16To be sure, we have to remember that rhetorical invective went along with the times.Luther called the obese King Henry VIII that \"fat hog on the throne of England.\" AndParacelsus, like Luther, was a man to put deeds behind his words. An apocryphal butlikely story has it that he invited the medical worthies of Basel to a lecture. These verydignified men entered a room to behold a closed vessel on the lecture table. Paracelsusbegan the lecture by removing the lid and revealing a huge pile of human feces. With hisusual mocking style he railed against the hypocrisy of his audience for assuming to know16of the body while refusing to consider the most basic of alimentary functions. He wenton to extol the virtues of fermentation and the need to enliven the soil with excrement,human or otherwise. If the episode really happened there is no doubt that such ademonstration must have made a lasting impression on his listeners. But true in fact ornot, it seems more than true to character; the most improbable part of the story is that ittook his foes two years to get him chased out of Basel! Part of Paracelsus' fame grew from the fact that he lectured in German instead ofLatin, as was the custom of the day. Part of it was because he achieved very real cures toback up his words, cures that were notably lacking in the medical pretensions of hiscontemporaries. And part of it was because he breathed new life into the alchemicalfires that still burned beneath the science of his time. He taught that sickness was due toan imbalance of head, blood (heart) and limbs. He referred to these parts of the body asthe salt (head), mercury (heart/blood) and sulfur (metabolism/limbs) poles. And what,we might ask, is so heady about salt? Well, potato chips came after the time ofParacelsus so he didn't know how they put a little salt on the brain and wake it up. Butlong before Paracelsus the world knew of the stimulating power of salt. And mercury?It's easy to see how flowing mercury relates to heart and blood. That leaves fiery smellysulfur and metabolism. Don't have to eat garlic\u2014which contains a lot of sulfur\u2014toknow how they connect! So these general alchemical principles were not without a validand empirical relation to how the body functions. Then he leaves the strictly empiricaland turns the body into a universal principle that needed balance and harmony andexperimented with medicines that gave it. In this he was a child of the Greeks andEgyptians. Yet he also foresaw a more modern approach to medicine that gave attentionto the individual patient. Though his ideas of how to treat an illness were steeped inalchemical generalities, his threefold structure of head, heart and limbs, of thought,feeling and will, anticipated the modern attempt to link mental and emotional factors toour physical condition. His attempt to apply science to actual phenomena set him apartfrom his contemporaries and made him a much more modern figure. Yet he believedvery strongly that there were unifying principles in the body and the cosmos that neededto be respected in order for a person to be in good health. For Paracelsus the body wasthe laboratory that proved the truth of his science. In this much he was modern. But hesaw his body soul and mind as the instrument of his investigation. Through years of trialand effort he trained himself to see the cause of sickness rather than rely on, say, astethoscope or a thermometer, neither of which had been invented in his day. In this hewas a member of the old school. In many ways he was both a precursor to the modernand in many ways one of the last voices of the ancient schools of initiation that trainedthe soul and mind in higher powers of perception. It is significant that he died 23 yearsbefore another man of science, Galileo Gallilei. Both men were very much a part of theRenaissance that was sweeping Western civilization and harbingers of ideas that were tochange the way we think.Although born almost 100 years after Paracelsus died, Johann Becher (1635-82?)fulfilled Paracelsus' prophecy that those who followed him would carry on the GreatWork of alchemy and bring it to the light of day. Every bit the romantic revolutionary ofParacelsian fame, Becher is proud to carry on the alchemical tradition. In his mostimportant book, Physica Subterranea, he describes himself as17...one to whom neither a gorgeous home, nor security of occupation, nor fame,nor health appeals to me; for me rather my chemicals amid the smoke, soot andflame of coals blown by bellows. Stronger than Hercules, I work forever in anAugean stable, blind almost from the furnace glare, my breathing (sic) affected bythe vapour of mercury. I am another Mithridates saturated with poison. Deprivedof the esteem and company of others, a beggar in things material, in things of themind I am Croesus. Yet among all these evils I seem to live so happily that Iwould die rather than change places with a Persian king.17Like Paracelsus, Becher found in alchemy an expression of world and cosmic order thatconnected him with the human and the divine. He saw Nature as being created by God,the ultimate chemist, and in this creation the cycles of change and exchange were set inmotion to offer the world of man ample opportunity to be fruitful and multiply in mind,body and soul. He found in the mercantile community an expression of change andexchange that paralleled that of the original creation and felt that it was the role of thechemist to unveil the secret processes of God's ever-changing universe. Hence the divineresponsibility of the chemist to master the ancient challenge of finding economicallyimportant minerals, not the least of which was gold. In addition to founding a technicalschool in Austria under the auspices of the Austrian emperor, Leopold I, he also launcheda scheme in the Netherlands for recovering gold from silver by means of sea sand. Therewere some ethical questions about this latter venture since Becher left the country beforeproducing the promised gold, taking the funds of those who invested in the enterprisewith him. He insisted on his sincerity, however, and returned some years later in theattempt to make good on his intentions. A second failure resulted in yet anotheralchemist being chased out of town. He traveled extensively after this and is supposed tohave died after investigating the tin mines of Cornwall in the effort to improve on themining techniques that had not changed all that much since the times of the Romanconquest of England in the second century CE.Half mystic, half scientist like Paracelsus before him, Becher was more than justenamored by the fire and smoke of the chemist: the secret of fire was for him and othersof the period the secret of creation just as the breath of the bellows was analogous to thebreath God blew into the nostrils of Adam to raise the first man from the dust. It wasparamount therefore to solve the mystery of fire before the secrets of creation could beproperly understood. To this end, Becher proposed that the fiery nature of sulfur waspresent in all combustible materials and was released when a substance burned. All thatremained was to give this essence of fire a name which Georg Stahl, a contemporary ofBecher, did by calling it phlogiston. The science of chemistry was born with theanalytical attempts to discover the mysteries of this elusive phlogiston, a quest that wasnot to end till the beginning of the nineteenth century when Lavoisier finally put thewhole matter to the test with his famous balance.1. Les Origines de L'Alchemie, p. 12. The gift of writing enabled people to record events and thoughts for futuregenerations. In this way it provided for continuity between past and present at a18time when people were forgetting the old oral traditions that relied on memory(like Homer) to recall an epic past. Hence the need for writing that could recallwords that spoke of immortal truths that live for ever, words that can take oneprepared to read them into realms that would otherwise be inaccessible. That isone reason why writing was looked upon as divinely inspired. The power ofwords is the power to transform. And for Thoth/Hermes the power to transformlived in how we use words and ideas to better understand how to heal illnesses ofthe present and to transform the mind to better receive divine truths from the past.In this way we become better prepared to transform the earth and better providefor the future. This transformation of the earth became the science of Chem, laterknown as alchemy, a corruption of the Arabic al chem., and finally as modernchemistry.3. Secrets of the Great Pyramid, pp. 189-213.4. The \"as above so below\" theme takes on a literal meaning in the way theEgyptians considered the Milky Way to be the Nile of the Sky (The OrionMystery, pp. 119-122). But the connection between heaven and earth is auniversal theme in the mythology that also affects our own culture. In the Judo-Christian tradition, which shows many similarities with the Egyptian, we have inGenesis how Adam was raised from the dust by divine breath and how he wascreated in God's image. In Plutarch's Moralia, vol. V, we also have the story ofIsis and Osiris that allows Osiris a place in the stars to welcome worthy souls.The whole story of Isis and Osiris with the death of Osiris and Isis' birth of aredeemer son, Horus, contains many parallels to Christian symbolism. ChristianJacq quotes from the Egyptian Sarcophagus Texts where the divine voice says, \"Iam eternal, I am the Light...I am the one who created the Word, I am theWord...\" (Le Message Initiatique Des Cath\u00e9drals, p. 79). This recalls thebeginning of the Gospel of John: \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Wordwas with God, and the Word was God...\" There are many other parallels thatdidn't miss the early Christians. St. Augustine was to remark upon consideringthe mummies and burial rites of the Egyptians that they were the only Christianswho truly believed in the resurrection (Ibid, p. 83). The common cause betweenEgypt and Christianity was not lost to the esoteric school of alchemy either. It isvery likely that the esoteric side of alchemy with its emphasis on how alchemy isas much an inward transformation as an outer one owed its science to Egyptiansources.5. The Double-Edged Helix, Genitic Engineering in the Real World, p. 4.6. Les Origines de L'Alchimie, p. 87. The 3.1416 value of is given by 6/5 of the Golden Mean, _, squared or =6/5_2. This provided yet another confirmation of the fundamental relationshipbetween heaven and earth.198. The Great Pyramid literally conceals a whole world of secrets that link with thevalue of the Golden Mean, _. The Pyramid is built to duplicate the dimension ofthe northern hemisphere with the height corresponding to the radius of the earth atthe north pole (and slightly shorter than the radius at the equator) and the sidescorresponding to the latitude and longitude of the Pyramid's location. (SeeSecrets of the Great Pyramid, pp. 189-216.)9. The Science of Musical Sound, p. 6410. This story, though found at the beginning of Book Seven in Plato's Republic, isreally of Pythagorean origin and as such is probably Egyptian. (See Le Nombred'Or, Vol. II, p. 9.)11. These observations roughly coincide with Aristotle's nine or ten categories. Thelist usually includes quantity, substance, quality, relation, position, time, position,action and passivity. In Aristotle, pp. 21-23, Sir David Ross states that Aristotletakes no pains to be consistent over the exact number of them.12. The relation between Egypt and medieval European society remained a close onenotwithstanding the burning of the library of Alexandria. Christian Jacq writesthat these links were nurtured by commerce and the exchange of art, especially byway of Byzantium. Coptic and Byzantine influence spread to adorn the altars ofGerman religious orders with ivory carvings and other treasures. Between the 6thand 8th centuries Merovingian scribes, especially Gr\u00e9goire de Tours, often referredto oriental merchants who were established in several French cities with thecollective name of \"Syrians.\" That these close ties also fanned the flames ofalchemy with esoteric inspiration (or exoteric speculation) would be expectedconsidering that alchemists were among the most well traveled and cosmopolitanof artisans. (See Le Message Initiatique des Cath\u00e9drals, p. 90.)13. For the alchemist as artist, see The Norton History of Chemistry, p. 22.14. Some doubt has been cast as to whether or not Paracelsus actually received adegree. No record of it seems to exist. But it would have been out of characteranyway\u2014and his antagonistic feeling for academic medicine may in fact datefrom this period.15. The Norton History of Chemistry, pp. 43-4416. The sixteenth century was a fiery time when people used fiery words and oftenresorted to fiery deeds. When religious matters were at stake, charges of heresyand witchcraft all too often became hotter than words. This made Paracelsus andhis outrageous raving seem all the more courageous. But behind this side of theman there was a fervent devotion also worthy of his time. I take the liberty hereto quote at length from some of his own words (Parecelsus, Selected Writings,Bollingen Series XXVIII) to show how he was at once typical of his age and on20many matters far beyond it. His practical idealism regarding women, forexample, avoided the chivalric pedestal or the opposite extreme of outrightmisogyny so common at his time. Some of his ideas are amusing (no red beardedsurgeons allowed!) and some typical for the age (his views on the mating game)but his ideas on medicine were quite advanced. His religious views, thoughcolored by the Reformation theology of Luther, owe some of their deep regard fornature and man alike to Neo-Platonist concepts most likely inherited from hisexposure to ideas of the Italian Renaissance while in Italy.On medicine:The physician does not learn everything he must know and master at high collegesalone; from time to time he must consult old women, gypsies, magicians, wayfarers,and all manner of peasant folk and random people, and learn from them; for thesehave more knowledge about such things than all the high colleges. (p. 57)Medicine should be taught so cleanly and clearly in the language of the homeland thatthe German should understand the Arab, and the Greek the German... (p. 62-3)Every physician must be rich in knowledge, and not only of that which is written inbooks; his patients should be his book, they will never mislead him . . . and by themhe will never be deceived. But he who is content with mere letters is like a deadman; and he is like dead physician. As a man and as a physician, he kills the patient.Not even a dog killer can learn his trade from books, but only from experience. Andhow much more is this true of the physician? (p. 50)Some of the qualifications of a good surgeon are as follows (pp. 52-55)A clear conscienceA gentle heart and a cheerful spiritMoral manner of life and sobriety in all thingsGreater regard for his honour than for moneyGreater interest in being useful to his patient than to himselfHe must not be married to a bigotHe should not be a runaway monkHe should no practice self-abuseHe must not have a red beardHe must despise no oneRegarding knowledge of the body:He should know all the bones of the bodyHe should know all the blood vesselsHe should know the veins and arteries of the whole bodyHe should know what injury can befall each organRegarding the practice of his art:He should know all the vulnerary herbsHe should know all tissue-forming remediesHe should know the effect of each remedy21He should know plaster for woundsHe should know lotions for wounds On human dignity:Thoughts create a new heaven, a new firmament, a new source of energy, from whichnew arts flow . . . For such is the immensity of man that he is greater than heavenand earth. (p. 45)We are born to be awake, not to be asleep!Therefore, man, learn, and learn, question and question, and do not be ashamed of it;for only thus can you earn a name that will resound in all countries and never beforgotten. (p. 105)On medicine as a divine calling:It is the physician who reveals to us the diverse miraculous works of God. Andhaving revealed them he must use them in the right way, not in the wrong way...sothat many people may be able to see the works of God and recognize how they can beused to cure disease. (p. 67)On man and woman:A woman is like a tree bearing fruit. And man is like the fruit that the tree bears . . .(p. 26)God does not want man or woman to be like a tree which always grows the samefruit. (p. 32)God endowed man with reason, in order that he might know what desire means. Buthe himself must decide whether to yield to it or not, whether to let act on him or not,whether to follow his intelligence or not . . . But all this takes place only if hehimself wants it; otherwise there is no seed in him . . . It is the same with woman.When she sees a man, he becomes her object, and her imagination begins to dwell onhim. She does this by virtue of the ability that God has bestowed upon her . . . It isin her power to feel desire or not. If she yields, she becomes rich in seeds; if not, shehas neither seed nor urge. Thus God left the seed to the free decision of man (andwoman), and the decision depends upon man's will. (p. 33)17. The Norton History of Chemistry, p. 79.22Transition TheoriesPhlogiston was a child of the 17th century, a time of turmoil when new ideas ranlike fire in the blood of Europe. The Reformation had born fruit a century before and thetide of independent thinking it brought carried with it a new desire for freedom anddiscovery. Even the Thirty Years War could not quell the voices of freedom that madeFrankfort a refuge for free thinkers during the devastating first half of the century. The\"Pilgrim fathers\" (and mothers?) set sail for the New World. The last of the FrenchProtestants, the Huguenots, flee the port city La Rochelle on the western coast of Franceand seek refuge from England to South Africa. England survived the beheading ofCharles I at the hands of a Puritan Parliament led by Cromwell. This short-livedexperience in theocracy gave way to the colorful and promiscuous reign of Charles IIwhile Reformation Part II raged on the continent to feed the every hungry stake.Christian Humanism, inspired and formed by the 16th century freethinker Erasmus ofRotterdam, met the fatalism of Spinoza and the materialism of Hobbes. Rembrandtapplied new concepts of light and dark to painting, Galileo focused his telescope on sunspots and the moons of Jupiter and Copernicus conceived of a heliocentric solar system.Descartes philosophizes on his dictum, I think, therefore I am. But he was hardly alone;it seemed like the whole busy world was thinking. It was a time when old ideas werebeing reborn with new faces. It was a time when new ideas were plunging into unchartedseas of exploration. While a whole New World beckoned to explorer and revolutionaryalike, a whole new horizon hailed a new age of thought. It was a time when science hadto happen.Not only did science become a major player in all of this drama, but with the fieryquality of the age, it seems almost too on cue that phlogiston take center stage. But it didand the mystery of fire (like the mystery of life itself discussed today in terms of genesand intelligent design1) was approached both empirically with facts in hand andphilosophically with handy ideas. Georg Stahl, as a professor of medicine with aknowledge of metallurgy, was able to provide the facts in hand from what he knew ofmetal refining and the handy ideas from his vitalist views that life was imbued with a lifeforce that made it separate from the mineral world. Both of these backgrounds cametogether to help form his ideas on phlogiston, a substance that on one hand assertedphysical properties and on the other seemed to possess non-physical if not vitalisticattributes. Enough practical chemistry had been done to determine that metals could notbe broken down any further by fire or other means. If attacked by acid they turned intolusterless and friable something else called a salt. But metals were shiny and thusretained a fiery nature, a nature that indicated the presence of phlogiston. Because noone had ever isolated phlogiston or identified it in the lab, its presence was theoretical.In short, phlogiston was a handy idea. But as handy ideas go, it seemed to explain somebasic phenomena. A look at a common example from metal refining will explain why.Stahl knew that metal ores were heated with carbon to obtain the pure metal. Hereasoned that because metals represented a phlogiston rich element, an ore must be aphlogiston poor substance that need added phlogiston to reveal the pure metal hiddenwithin. This phlogiston rich substance was the carbon:23ore (phlogiston poor) + carbon (phlogiston rich) _ metal/phlogistonIf this was true, the reverse must also be the case. When a metal is heated, it will lose itsphlogiston and become a calx or metal ore:metal/phlogiston _ calx or ore (phlogiston poor) + phlogiston (driven off in theform of extra heat)Many things remained to be worked out. Sulfur, for example was seen at this time as a\"mixt\" of phlogiston and \"acid former\" because when burned the gas given off wouldform an acid when mixed with water.2 But what was sulfur, really? It seemed like averitable chameleon in the many forms it could take. Other questions begged furtheranalysis and it was felt that further investigation would provide the needed answers. Thechase for science was on. Looking back on it now, we can see that the quest for theenigmatic phlogiston was especially significant because it looked at nature as the sourceof truth instead of philosophical argument. The elusive explanation for phlogiston wassought not in philosophy books, not in arcane teachings of bygone civilizations, but innature herself. That is why the search for the cause of fire, for the mysterious substancecalled phlogiston, opened many doors. It was a search that insisted on looking for facts\"out there\" as opposed to inward speculation. Most of all, phlogiston was an idea thatrequired verification. It was an idea that required facts to support it, facts gleaned fromobservation. The quest for phlogiston became a questioning of substances and in doingso it led to a much clearer distinction between elements and compounds and betweenphysical properties (weight, color, density, etc.) and chemical properties (what combineswith what and how). This created a new vision of nature where theory and experimentworked hand in hand.As the facts started coming home to roost, the new theory was put to the test. So,we might ask, did Becher and Stahl get to share some early equivalent of a Nobel Prize?Not quite. To see why we need to look more closely at how theory and fact fit or didn'tfit. The theory states in various ways (which kept changing to fit the facts) that certainsubstances such a metals, carbon, wood, sulfur and jewels such as diamonds or sapphireswere rich in phlogiston. All of these substances will either support combustion, or, aswith the metals and precious stones, shine with a \"fiery\" luster. According to the theory,those substances that were phlogiston rich could be induced to give their phlogiston tosubstances that were phlogiston poor. Carbon, as we saw above, when heated with ametal ore would lose its phlogiston and thereby cause the ore to turn into a pure metal.Since phlogiston was supposed to be substantial, that is, have weight, the pure metalshould therefore be heavier than the original ore. When this proved not to be the case,the theory had to be altered. It was said that phlogiston was like fire itself, weightlessand characterized by levity. Warm air from a fireplace, for example, would rise to theceiling because being imbued with phlogiston, it was not as affected by gravity. And soon. As theories go, it might seem, to our eyes, a little dubious at best. But for over ahundred years it survived because no could come up with anything better. It alsosurvived because it was a kind of transition idea that had one foot (or hand) in a scienceof observation and another in the philosophical principles of the Greeks such as the\"living fire\" of Heraclitus.24Another transition idea that had roots in classical thought was the acid alkalitheory. This theory of opposites can be traced back to Empedocles (5th century) and itasserted that bodily fluids revealed themselves to be either acid or alkaline. It wastherefore thought that illness came from an imbalance in the natural balance of thesepolarities. Bile was seen as alkaline, the heart as acidic, as was saliva. Digestion wasseen as a kind of warfare between acids and alkalis that was resolved by neutralization.This particular theory of oppositions did not have as long a career as phlogiston becauseno one really knew what an acid or alkali were, it was just known that they effervescewhen mixed. The idea of opposite forces as a basis for understanding the chemistry ofsubstances did not die out however. It was transformed by later discoveries into theelectro-chemical theory of bonding. In this theory, as we shall see, compounds werethought to be formed as a union of oppositely charged elements.Did you notice how the world force crept into the above? It occurs in theinnocuous phrase \"opposite forces\" and as such would normally pass unnoticed. But theconcept of \"force\" did not go unnoticed to the minds of the 17th and 18th century. Thiswas because a force must be felt to be experienced. This gave it a subjective quality thatcould not be measured and objectified\u2014a factor that made it suspect in an age when truthwas weighed on the balance. Never mind that the concept of force was crucial to thescience of mechanics, as Newton determined with his laws of motion. In the eighteenthcentury\u2014the century of enlightenment when human minds could reckon with God, muchless Newton\u2014the empirical philosophers David Hume and Bishop Berkeley speculatedon ways to remove \"force\" from the English language as a \"relic of animism.3\"Animism was the belief that all of nature was embodied with a life force, a belief that wascommon among many early cultures. By the 17th and 18th centuries a somewhat tamerversion called vitalism claimed organic substances could only be created by the vitalforce of living organisms. But both views put the concept a force in the non-weighablecategory of principles and indeterminate causes. For people who wanted to pin downtruth and make an exact science really exact such vagaries of the mind were unthinkable.But in spite of all efforts to \"disappear\" or alter the meaning of force, force seemed hereto stay. It was too formulated and ensconced in the fabric of science to be removedwithout leaving an ugly hole to remind everyone where it had been. (It's a good thingthey didn't try to remove Empedocles' love and strife, the two forces that lived at theheart of his natural world. They would have left behind something a lot bigger than ahole!) So force it was and force it remained. People were forced to admit that no matterhow many times you recite Newton's formula, F = ma or say the words, force equalsmass times acceleration, it doesn't do nearly as well as dropping a brick on the toe toconvey the meaning of the word force (with an ouch!). So the empiricists were hard putto force their way out of the force dilemma. And yet there was a solution. Not beingable to abolish the subjective aspect of force outright, empirical science did the next bestthing. The word became an innocuous abstraction something like the word energy. Thehopes were that ultimately it would be swallowed up by a grand Theory of Everything(TOE) after being atomized as a strong force and a weak force\u2014the two forces that holdthe nucleus of an atom together. And that is the transition saga of how empirical sciencegot a toehold on the thought of the times. But we are getting at least one step ahead ofour story. We need to go back to atoms and look once again at how they too were part ofthe transition scene.25We mentioned in the last chapter that the two philosophers, Leucippus andDemocritus, introduced the concept of atoms. We don't know much about Leucippusexcept that he inspired Democritus to teach that all existence was determined by Beingand Not-Being and that Being was composed of atoms. It might be easier to translateNot-Being into the more current concept of Void. But regardless how you translate it,the philosophy stated that spirit and body alike consisted of finite particles and emptiness,and that the way these particles or atoms mixed with emptiness was what determined theexistence we perceive with our senses. Atoms of different shapes would combine andreshuffle the stuff of the universe and thereby cause the different substances and the fourelements. Like tiny machines, they were guided and propelled by a world of externalforces. Which naturally sounds pretty mechanical and that was the whole point. In fact,such ideas lay at the basis if what became the mechanical view of nature so popularamong scientists in the 17th century. But as modern as this might sound, such ideas werenot the result of work in the laboratory, neither for the old Greeks nor the new adherentsto the mechanical model. As applied philosophy the principle of atomism was used toexplain many phenomena in the beginning days of modern science and because it did sosuccessfully it slowly became an accepted reality. For the Greeks, however, it remainedpure philosophy. The concept of atoms, as a philosophical principle, was to free themind from fear, both of death and of the gods. Basically Democritus said that we aremade of atoms and that atoms alone are immortal\u2014even the gods were made of atoms.So there was no need to fear death or the gods. Since all was made of atoms and whatatoms did was determined by the laws of nature (physics), we might as well make thebest of our atoms and live in equanimity with the natural laws that determine us. In otherwords, enjoy life to the fullest and let atoms be atoms. Contrary to what some havesupposed, this didn't translate into hedonism or to a wanton slavery to the dusty senses;rather, it meant that we learn to enjoy the finer things of life. As we fine tune our atomsto become more like the gods we can lead more perfect lives, lives that wouldnevertheless end when we died and our atoms, determined by the laws of physics, didwhat atoms always do. Hence the easy out plan: no wrathful gods to please, no afterlifeto prepare for, only atoms to obey as we learn that the best way to go is flow with thelaws of nature in a harmonious way. But there was a problem: it was too easy. Thephilosophy of Democritus left no room for free will. And free will, as any reader ofHomer or of Greek history knows, was just as fundamental to Greek character as olivesor Spartan gruel. So the next champion of the atomistic view, Epicurus (341-270 BCE),took Democritus to task and created a philosophy of atoms that allowed for free will. Hewrote that \"it would be preferable to subscribe to the legends of the gods than to be aslave to the determinism of the physicists.\"4 To free himself from the determinism ofphysical law and still retain the easy out plan, he kept the atoms, the void and the conceptof endless atomic motion that determined the nature of substance. To bring the principleof free will to this Epicurus said that atoms would swerve in their motion so that differentatoms could bang up against each other and create variations of substance. The differentshapes of atoms was not so important; the ability of chance to cause new substancebecame the deciding factor. And if chance prevailed in the nature of things, we, ashuman beings, can take our chances, make what choices we will, and determine our ownexistence. Of course he didn't use the word probability, but if he had he'd be ready forthat great leap forward that led to quantum physics. Or to some modern theories about26how life happened. But Epicurus wasn't any more interested in creating a new sciencethan his spiritual mentor, Democritus. He only wanted a philosophy that allowed peopleto live in peace with all atoms, no matter if they belong to you, me or to Joe Diabetesover there in Boeotia. But his ideas caught on. Lucretius was to popularize them in hislong (very long) philosophical poem, On the Nature of Things, in the 1st century CE.5The poem was rediscovered and printed in 1473 and heralded by the Italian Renaissanceas the next best thing to a new wave of the future.6Now, back to the 16th and 17th century, to the French philosopher, Rene Descartes(1596-1650), the most influential proponent of atomism of his day. Lucretius had beenthe topic of some fervent philosophical discussion for a good number of years now butonly that. The idea of atoms was in the air but it wasn't till the 17th century that theybecame means of actually explaining phenomena. It was the job of Descartes to helpmake this transition from philosophy to the laws of physical chemistry. His dictum thatnature abhors a vacuum suggested that something had to fill space and atoms were themost likely candidates. His ideas themselves seemed to fill a vacuum: they filled a lackof explanation for how air fills any space in any shape of container. It was seen by theIrish born chemist, Robert Boyle (1627-91), that a gas expands to fill any space becausethe particles (atoms) of this gas would simply grow further apart. The gas would becomethinner but it would still fill the space. Boyle also explained heat as the agitation ofparticles or corpuscles and in his voluminous and rambling writings became a spokesmanfor what was known as the mechanical or corpuscular theory of matter. That is to saythat with Boyle the mechanical movement of corpuscles or atoms was a useful way ofexplaining certain phenomena. (Epicurus would applaud that one!) But it still needs tobe pointed out that atoms were still regarded as a philosophical principle that explained afew facts. No one, of course, had ever seen an atom. It would be well into the 19thcentury before the concreteness of atoms was universally accepted among chemists. Bythen the evidence of things unseen would become insurmountable. But a new step hadbeen taken. The effect of Boyle's writings was to create an understanding between themechanical philosophers and the chemists of his day and show the philosophers that inorder to understand their own philosophy they had to account for experimental findings.The age of empiricism was born.One might say that it was a twin birth: alongside the atoms and the mechanicalmodel came the mechanical philosophy that made God into the Great Clockmaker whoset the universe running and let the cogs and gears do the rest. The philosophy wasgranted ism status with the name of Deism, and became something of an establishedcreed. Religion or philosophy, Deism offered a mechanical worldview that made natureeasy to analyze. Hard facts and certainty replaced the philosophical ambiguities thatseemed to characterize the thought of older cultures. But the old can anticipate the new;modern atomism finds its roots in the thought of Democritus and Epicurus. Passeddown from Epicurus to Lucretius and then to Descartes, the old clock of atomism waswound and set running for a new age of mechanical model. Boyle set his clock to thenew times and set to work applying the mechanical model to a new science. And whynot? After all, a science based on tangible facts one could weigh and measure at leasthad the potential of being certain and solid. Understanding nature became a task ofanalyzing the cogs and gears of the clock. But what about the human side of theequation? Where did human beings fit in this clockwork universe? Faced with27somewhat the same free will problem as Epicurus, Descartes had to set human beingsapart from the mechanical laws of physics. To do this he philosophized that only manhas a soul; the rest of nature is soulless. His dictum \"I think therefore I am\" wassupposed to show how by thinking we prove the existence of this soul. The ability tothink, for Descartes, was what set man apart from the rest of nature. Many would agreewith him and this separation between man and nature became known as the Cartesianpartition. Boyle and many others accepted this as an adequate view of the universe andfor certain physical phenomena like the elasticity and spatial expansion of gases thismechanical model seemed to provide the right answer. But the bridge from philosophy toempiricism proved to be a long one. Boyle never really crossed it. He failed to create aworking hypothesis that would enable the chemist to explain what goes on in the firesand alembics of the laboratory. Small wonder: this task was to require efforts ofscientists for the next two hundred years.1. The concept of intelligent design refers to how intricate and complex systems inorganisms imply that some degree of intelligence was responsible for thecomplexity of the system. The term has always suffered in the hands of empiricalscience because it always seemed to deny the strictly empirical assumptions ofmodern science by implying that there is some creative intelligence behind thecomplex relationships that make life happen. But Michael Behe's recent book,Darwin's Black Box, opens the question up from the viewpoint of biochemistrywith some surprising insights. We go into these in the last chapter.2. Norton History of Chemistry, pp. 80-823. Goethe's Natural Science, p. 1594. Introduction to On the Nature of Things, p. xxvii5. The Presocratics were more concerned with the nature of matter and the Socraticphilosophers, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle and Plotinus, more concerned with moralquestions of how to live, how to best achieve a perfect society, etc. But it was aunifying trait in Greek philosophy as a whole to express a profound reverence forthe mind. This was just as true with the atomists and the Stoics as it was withthe Platonists and Aristotelians. Democritus was said to have starved himself todeath when, in old age, he found that his memory was failing him. Epicuruslooked upon the refinement of the intellect as the one thing that provided thesurest link to the gods. The refinement of the mind provided the greatestpleasures in life. According to Lucretius powers of the mind also seems to holdsway after death. In Book Three of On the Nature of Things he states thatIf only they perceived (the cause of their malady) distinctly, they would atonce give up everything else and devote themselves first to studying thenature of things; for the issue at stake is their state not merely for one28hour, but for eternity\u2014the state in which mortals must pass all the timethat remains after death (1071-1075).This seems to contradict other assertions that body and spirit, being composed ofatoms, fall into endless sleep at death. Actually, the point is more that whateverhappens after death is not worth thinking of while alive, and most certainly notworth dreading. Death is irrelevant; the study of natural law and the \"nature ofthings\" is all that matters. That is what provides peace of mind while alive. Wemight ask if this might be compared to modern points of view. Or, if it has anyrelevance to the modern scientific attitude.6. We might want to ask what Plato would think of the above view expressed byLucretius. He would probably say that souls that can so forget the spiritual worldhave drank too deeply of the River of Forgetfulness before being reborn and havethus ascribed to the folly of denial and illusion. (See Book X of the Republic)But we are a long way now from Plato and will need to go a lot further...29A New Science is BornThe 18th century has been called the Age of Enlightenment, ostensibly because ofthe intellectual advances taken by the brightest denizens of this ambitious period butmore because it was a time when civilization, for better or for worse, began to look morelike our own. In the hands of the encyclopedists, Chambers and Diderot, knowledgebecame a thing one could quantify and collect. In England, Samuel Johnson edits thefirst English dictionary. His contemporary, Goethe, pioneered studies in human and plantmorphology, developed a theory of light that countered the corpuscular theory ofNewton, and wrote his lasting comment on science with his Faust. In France,meanwhile, La Metrie writes L'Homme machine (The Man Machine), a book that issymptomatic of the times and the extension of the Cartesian view of mechanical nature toinclude man himself.1 (Consider how, in our \"modern\" times, we rather casuallycompare man to a computer). It was a time of great wit in letters. We have the plays ofMoliere, the satires of Voltaire, the biting couplets of Pope and the witty dramas ofSheridan and Goldsmith. It was also a time of social unrest and change. The seminalwritings of Jean Jacques Rousseau idealized life in the Nature of the New World andargued just as forcefully in favor of the essential goodness of man as the behavior of thereagents of the period seemed to attest to the contrary. England suffered under the twoGeorges and lost her American colonies. France endured the despotic legacy of LouisXIV whose long reign lasted till 1715. Subsequent kings did little to address the needs ofthe people who finally resorted to revolution. The French War of Independence reapedthe bitter and bloody harvest of centuries of repression while extolling the ever elusivevirtues of libert\u00e9, egalit\u00e9 and fraternit\u00e9. As might be surmised, it was a time whenemotions ran high. It was a time when human rights were a hats off topic to some and aheads off topic to others. It was above all a time when the mind and the head thatcontained it were seen as a highly individual organ capable of changing the world. It wasno accident that the century was called the Age of Reason. In pursuit of \"reason\" a longlist of eccentric and remarkable characters would take western civilization down therational road of humanism and natural science.Among these pioneers and innovators, none was more remarkable nor morecongenial than Joseph Priestley (1733-1804). Truly a man of his times, Priestley's lifewas as pivotal as his experiments. Unlike Boyle, who was a friendly, correct and longsuffering Anglican dedicating his life to posterity and science, Priestley, a Presbyterian inthe days when holy words could be fighting words, was caught in the middle ofdissension and even riot. He was honored to be made a citizen of the French Republic forpublishing a caustic reply to Edmund Burke's attack on the French War of Independence.In fact it was at a Bastille Day meeting in support of political freedom in general that thedissenting Priestley saw his meetinghouse burned. Though he was to win four thousandpounds in a court settlement against the good people of Birmingham for this deed hecontinued to suffer persecution during these inflammable times.Yet Priestley was not a Samuel Adams. He was a very complex man capable ofintelligent conversation on many levels and in some half a dozen languages.2 Hisinquiring mind was always seeking new frontiers of intellectual as well as political andreligious freedom. Destiny seemed to be waiting. It took the form of an encounter with30that dapper dandy of Franco-American fame, Benjamin Franklin, to kindle the alreadysmoldering fires of Priestley's scientific calling.3 With the characteristic enthusiasm of atrue amateur (in the original sense of the word as a devoted enthusiast), Franklincommunicated his zeal for the world of science\u2014a zeal that could well have cost him hislife when kite-fishing for lightning. But regardless where he found his ideas, whether inthis world or baiting the next, Franklin had been where whole new realms awaiteddiscovery. True enthusiasm is contagious. Priestley caught the sacred flame. With aloan of books from Franklin and research of his own he summarized what was knownabout electricity and what he had found out on his own in The History and Present Stateof Electricity, in 1767. In the meantime, based on his own work with static electricity, hehad been elected a member of the Royal Society.4His first researches in chemistry had a curious beginning at the public brewerynext to his house where he experimented with the smelly gas that bubbled to the surfaceof the large vats. We can only wonder at what his parishioners and neighbors must havethought. A minister lighting wood chops and then watching them go out over the strangegas must have been a bizarre sight for those more accustomed to sermons on demon ginand the sins of Fleetstreet. But he had other interests. He suspected the gas might be thesame \"fixed air\" previously discovered by Joseph Black when heating limestone. He wasalso attempting to explore the connection between air and spirit. After all, hadn't Godbreathed life into Adam? Little did he suspect at the time that his search was breathingnew life into science. Further experiment showed that the gas made a pleasantlyeffervescent mixture when mixed with cold well water and allowed to warm to roomtemperature. The gas wasn't all that soluble but enough dissolved to give a delightfullyfizzy taste that reminded Priestley of the authentic Seltzer. Of course he was not awarethat he had discovered what we now call carbon dioxide nor was he aware that thesparkling glass of refreshing carbonic acid he offered the Royal Society was the world'sfirst Club Soda. But there it seemed that good taste prevailed. In 1773 the Societyawarded him the Copley Medal for his report on fixed air in which he emphasized itspossible medicinal value.5 Evidently, with his work on electricity and now, with somerespectable fizz to recoup any fall from flavor, he could be passed off as a harmlesseccentric if need be. And everybody knows that in the best of times the English loveeccentrics. Unless, in the worst of times, one becomes too revolutionary, too outspoken,or just plain too out of line to be a good thing...Meanwhile, in the early days of discovery, the indefatigueable Priestley pursued acareer as an eccentric priest while his flock wondered at the possible dementia that laybehind his fervent interest in strange stinks and quaint bottles. Among the former,hydrogen chloride and ammonia no doubt exceeded the confines of family discussion.(Priestley was also raising a family at this time). He was able to collect these two gases,both of which are very soluble in water, by putting a familiar invention, the pneumatictrough, to especially good use. As originally designed by Stephen Hales in 1727, sixyears before Priestley was born, the pneumatic trough provided a way to let gases bubbleup into a vat that held an inverted vessel full of water. The gas would displace the water,which went into the vat, and be collected in the jar. But this, of course, only works if thegas is insoluble in water. Borrowing from Cavendish the idea that mercury might do thejob better, Priestley set to work and soon collected enough of the two soluble gases tocombine them. He was pleasantly surprised by a white cloud that settled to form a white31powder of unknown substance.6 Using the same technique he went on to collect a gasthat been discovered a century earlier that had the strange property of turning brownwhen exposed to air.7 This gas, known as saltpetre gas,8 and its ability to brown out anduse up the vital part of air\u2014the part that would support plant life\u2014was well known. Itwas its ability to use up part of the air that had led Robert Boyle and others to questionthe homogeneity of air. Experiments with these gases would lead Priestley to carry thisquestion to a decisive answer and provide his greatest discovery\u2014a discovery that wouldenable him to make a far more astounding appeal to the Royal Society than ever hisbrewery gas and artificial Seltzer. An Early Version of the Pneumatic TroughAs with many great events, a setting of fortuitous coincidence aided and abettedthe great discovery. Priestley's experiment was hardly new. It was the heating of redcalx of mercury to obtain free mercury, a reaction well known since the days of alchemy.What was different was that Priestley, using the pneumatic trough with mercury,collected a substantial quantity of the gas given off. This in itself wasn't so unusualeither. The gas had been collected before9 and even Priestley had performed the oldalchemical reaction that produced the gas by heating saltpetre. But he didn't collectenough to test it out. This time, however, enough gas was collected to make thedifference. And Priestley happened to have a lit candle nearby and wondering whatif...he placed the candle in the jar containing his newly collected gas. Unlike hisexperience with the \"fixed air\" the flame was far from extinguished. Indeed, it burst intoa white flame. A glowing coal from the nearby fire did the same with the added thrill ofa few sparks. Here was a wonder of wonders and Priestley was quite at a loss to explainit. Providence works in strange ways. Priestley, writing of the pivotal event some yearslater in his memoirs, wonders at the coincidence:If I had not happened to have a lighted candle before me, I should probably neverhave had the trial and the whole train of my future experience relating to this kindof air might have been prevented...More is owing to what we call chance than toany proper design or preconceived theory.1032This chance made history. It enabled Priestley to demonstrate to a world ready to listenthat air was composed of not one gas but at least two, one of which would supportcombustion. Robert Boyle, referring to similar findings, had written that air contains a\"vital Quintessence essential to animal life, although most of it serves no such purpose.\"11But like much of Boyle's work, this too had been ahead of his time. A hundred yearslater Priestley found an audience more ready to accept a challenge to the Aristotelianpurity of the four elements. Air was not an individual element. This much was definitely proven. The natureof the unknown gas Priestley discovered was such that if it itself would not burn it wouldcertainly cause other substances to do so. Priestley thereby called it dephlogisticated air,or air that was so hungry for phlogiston it would take it from whatever substance it could.This dephlogisticated air could sustain a mouse as well as a flame. The story has it thatPriestley placed two mice under bell jars containing ordinary air and his newlydiscovered gas. While waiting for the results he became so engrossed with playing hisflute he lost track of time. When he rushed back to see what had transpired he found thatthe mouse in ordinary air had expired. Deprived of the vital nature of the newlydiscovered gas, the little creature had given up the ghost. But the other mouse, given amore ample supply of the life sustaining air, was still hail and hearty. Priestley, moreattentive this time, ran the experiment again and was able to prevent a second tragedy.Later experiments with lead showed that when the metal is heated in air it too wouldproduce a reddish powder, which, upon reheating, will become lead. By reversing theprocess he confirmed that metals as well as animals \"breath\" this vital substance. Likebreath, what had been given off had been taken in. The cycle was complete.The work was far from over, however. From 1770 to 1800 Priestley continued touse his pneumatic trough to study some twenty new \"airs.\" Among his discoveries were(in our terminology) sulfur dioxide, nitrogen and the oxides of nitrogen, carbonmonoxide, hydrogen chloride and, of course, oxygen.12Priestley lived not only to see his famous discoveries carry his name abroad, butto finish his days in the country he had defended with such zeal for a righteous cause,America. He came to the new land of hope and ambition and finished out the last yearsof his life while Cavendish, his crusty contemporary, reaped the rich fruits of a lifetime ofdiscoveries. The principal and most seminal of these discoveries was like a curious twinto Priestley's dephlogisticated air.Much has been said about Cavendish's ways. Richwhere Priestley was poor, aristocrat where Priestley was a commoner, agnostic wherePriestley was devout, the two men make a kind of odd couple, opposite in almost everyway and yet complementary in their extremes. A fellow founder of pneumatic chemistry,Cavendish's interest in gases set upon the trail of the enigmatic air given off when acidsreact with metals. Paracelsus had written of this reaction over a hundred years ago;others had done the same. But no one had bothered to collect sufficient amounts of thegas to really study it. Cavendish collected it by placing iron, zinc and tin in dilute oil ofvitriol (sulfuric acid) and collected the gas. Then he did the same with hydrochloric acid.Upon testing with a lighted taper he discovered the same blue flame to burn with eachsample of the gas. Leaving no ash, causing no smoke, the gas seemed like the veryquintessence of fire itself. Then he weighed it and discovered that although lighter than33air, it still had weight. There could no longer be any doubt: here was indeed the elusivephlogiston!He communicated his astounding results to Priestley who discussed them in hisLunatics Society where many of the leading savants of the day met to discuss the latestscientific developments. Other discoveries were also discussed there at this gathering ofeccentrics and free thinking intelligentsia, discoveries such and the fabulous lightning jarcreated by the Dutch physicist Pieter van Muisschenbroek, now called the Leyden jar.Pieter demonstrated the effects of his device by lining up nine hundred monks,13 eachconnected by an iron wire. The device was charged and great was the jump as the joltdischarged through the obedient hands of unquestioning brothers. Of course the joke hasit that here was a leap of faith of a new order. And now, with his discovery ofphlogiston, Cavendish instilled a leap faith in the new order of science. Then he createdanother challenge as he set about to discover what really happened when his newfoundphlogiston burned.After ten years of careful experimenting, using new spark devices to dischargevarious mixtures of his new gas and the dephlogisticated air of Priestley, he finally cameto the conclusion that phlogiston and dephlogisticated air react to form nothing less thanwater. It is hard today to understand how something so basic could require so mucheffort and demand such intricate preparation. But Cavendish did not want to leaveanything to chance. He was also intrigued at the mixtures of the two gases that wouldproduce the best results. Then there were those pesky errors that inevitably slipped intoan experiment due to the crude apparatus of the day. There was the task of weighing theresults and comparing this weight to an equal volume of water. This required the bestbalances of the period. The work was tedious and time consuming. Fortunately,Cavendish had plenty of time and money, being one of the richest men in England, but hewas never in any hurry to rush into print with the great news. No, he was a very carefuland methodical man who realized that he would have to be absolutely certain before hedared announce that the Aristotelian element of water were indeed a compounding of twosubstances.In March 1783, he made his conclusions known to Priestley. The followingJanuary he dropped the bomb before the Royal Society. Water? A compounding of twotasteless vapors? Where was the proof? Cavendish gave a dramatic demonstration ofhow he came to his conclusions by gathering large quantities of the gas and condensingthe vapors given off. Then he showed how two volumes of his phlogiston react with onevolume of dephlogisticated air to produce water with no gas left over. Then a curiousthing happened. All of a sudden it seemed as if everybody had discovered the samething. A controversy arose over who discovered it first. News of the discovery comesfrom Holland and France and other parts of England. To his credit, Cavendish could careless about such squabbles. But it wasn't till some ten years had passed before the issuewas decided. The President for the British Association for the Advancement of Sciencepublished a lithographed facsimile of Cavendish's original notebook where the dates ofeach experiment had been duly recorded. This put a rest to the matter. But thecontroversy brings up an often overlooked but frequently occurring aspect of scientificdiscovery. Is it just coincidence that brings so many minds to a single focus so thatseveral are discovering the same thing at once? Is it pure chance that Priestley happenedto have a candle nearby? Or is there something literally \"in the air\" as Priestley might34have it, something akin to the union of spirit and matter that he was looking for in thefirst place? The answer to these questions would take us far into the twentieth centurybut they have become part of the living legacy of science that doesn't fit the mechanicalmodel.141. Though symptomatic of its time, L'Homme machine and its author werecondemned by the medical establishment in Paris as well as by religious leadersall over Europe. It was chastised by religious leaders because it took Descartesone step further and said that not only do animals not have souls but neither dohuman beings. Or, if they did have a soul it was located somewhere in the brain.(As opposed to Van Helmont placing it in the stomach.) But La Mettrie made itclear that he subscribed to the Lucretian view that thoughts, like everything else,were composed of or created by physical causes (atoms) that could be analyzedby physical means. The treatise was condemned by the medical authoritiesbecause it renewed De La Mettrie's ongoing crusade against academics whorefused the new empirical medicine being developed elsewhere in Europe,especially in Holland by Hermann Boerhaave, La Mettrie's teacher and mainsource of inspiration. Boerhaave was a very influential teacher of his time whosought to unite (though not without reservations) chemistry and practice whilelending strong support to the mechanical model. Underlying the work of bothBoerhaave and La Metrie was the quest for certainty that so colored the age.This quest strove to cast out the old school of philosophical vagaries that createdsuch frustration for Paracelsus. In fact, Paracelsus was a major influence onBoerhaave; both men allied themselves with the need for effective cures based onactual practice and both enlisted the aid of chemistry in the effort to find them.La Mettrie polemisized this impulse with satire and vitriolic wit at the expense ofthe academic school of medicine in Paris and earned a heady place as the mosthated man in medical academe. When his L'Homme machine appeared he wasalready half way to the pillory. But vitriolics aside, La Mettrie was doing littlemore than stating the case for what would become accepted thinking in the 19thcentury. As his intellectual biographer Kathleen Wellman points out, LaMattrie's comparisons go from animals to man rather than vice versa. Manevolved from a primitive inarticulate existence to finally develop rationality.This, after all, is essentially what Darwin will propose a hundred years later. Anda hundred years after that and we have Desmond Morris' Naked Ape. We mightwonder what Paracelsus would think about that! (La Mettrie, Medicine,Philosophy, and Enlightenment, pp. 171-186)2. This is all the more significant since Priestley was reputed to have had a seriousstuttering problem. But his brilliant mind made up for it. At fifteen, in order toprepare himself for entering the Dissenting Academy at Devantry, he learnedHebrew, Chaldee, Syriac and some Arabic from a local Dissenting minister.Later he was to learn to be proficient in French, Italian and German and especiallyGreek. While developing his unorthodox opinions at the Academy, in addition tohis heavy study load he had a daily regimen of translating ten folio pages of35Greek a day. His skill with languages was to stand him in good stead as hestruggled to raise a family as a minister of small congregations of fellowdissenters. He more than once supplemented his meager livelihood with work asa language teacher.3. The Royal Society was something of a club devoted to the advancement ofscience. It was acknowledged by the ruling sovereign and membership gavestatus and recognition to those who had made important discoveries orcontributions in the field of science.4. After leaving the Academy Priestley already showed an interest in science.While teaching at a day school he provided his students with an air pump and amachine for making static electricity.5. Given what Priestley believed about the relation of spirit and air, the medicinalquality was a serious claim. He made it based on the effect of the solution offixed air and water. He obviously hadn't tried to breathe it like he would breatheoxygen a few years later!6. We will discover what this is as a class.7. This gas, nitric oxide, was discovered by the Cornish physician, John Mayow(1641-79). When exposed to air it would turn into the brown nitrogen dioxide.At the time, however, Mayow ascribed to the nitro-aerial theory that comparedlightning and thunder to gun-powder, which got its explosive force from sulfurand nitre (salt peter). Mayow thought that \"nitro-aerial spirit\" and sulfur weretwo opposing forces just as acids and bases (a polarity mentioned above inrelation to Empedocles that lived on as the two-element acid-alkali theory popularat the time). According to his theory, the fiery quality of sulfur would react withthe nitrous particles in the air to produce lightning and thunder to create nitre thatwould descend with the rain to fertilize crops. Nitre seemed to prove its anti-fireproperties (pyrophobic) by lowering the temperature of water. It was also arguedthat nitre caused snow and hail. Interestingly enough, this view has some merit ifwe consider the inert and \"pyrophobic\" properties of nitrogen as a polarity to thefiery and reactive properties of sulfur. (The Norton History of Chemistry, pp. 72-73)8. The reason why is uncertain but the term owes its origin to the fact that it wasfound that saltpetre or nitre produced a gas upon being heated. This gas wasthought to be \"spirit of nitre\" or nitric oxide. Later experiments also showed thatheating saltpetre would produce oxygen, the two gases combining to make thebrown acid forming nitrogen dioxide. This led Boyle to suspect the formation of\"spirit of nitre\" and cast doubt on the theory that related saltpetre to the \"nitre\" inthe air. (The Norton History of Chemistry, p. 74) It might also be noted thatsaltpetre gas or nitric oxide was also commonly prepared by reacting a metal(usually iron or copper) with dilute nitric acid.369. To set the record straight, oxygen or what Priestley would call dephlogisticatedair, was discovered by Carl Wilhelm Scheele in 1771, three years before Priestley.But Scheele did not publish the news of his discovery till 1777, after Priestley hadalready made his diphlogisticated air a public phenomenon. But the two men hadmore in common than diphlogisticated air. They were both lifelong supporters ofthe phlogiston theory. They were both avid experimenters who cared little fortheory or even for quantitative science. They weren't concerned about how muchof this made how much of that. Instead both men made copious contributions toscience by discovering new elements and compounds. Scheele discovered avariety of acids (tungstic, molybdic, arsenic and hydrocyanic), tasting them as hewent. He also made the first phosphoric and hydrofluoric include silicon fluoride (SiF4) and arsenic hidride (AsH3).Captivated by much of the fiery enthusiasm that we saw in Becher, he was aprolific chemical adventurer whose habit of tasting his discoveries and recordingtheir taste was but another example of the naivet\u00e9 of the period. Nowadays welet rats do the job but thanks to Scheele someone dared give a taste test tohydrocyanic and arsenic acid so others might know what they are missing. Buthe wasn't another Mithridates, who survived, \"saturated with poison.\" He died at43.10. From Crucibles, The Story of Chemistry, p. 44. This comment is typical for theage. Priestley echoes the disdain many expressed (see note 1 above) towardtheory as opposed to experiment.11. The World of the Atom, p. 38.12. The Norton History of Chemistry, p. 104. These include the oxides of sulfur andnitrogen, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, hydrogen chloride and oxygen, ammonia,and silicon fluoride. Other sources give a lower number but Sir Humphrey Davywas to observe that \"no single person ever discovered so many new and curioussubstances.\" And that is quite a compliment from a man who discovered twoalkali metals (sodium and potassium), four alkali earth metals (magnesium,calcium, strontium and barium) as well as phosphine and hydrogen telluride.13. Like some fish stories, this one may have grown in the telling. This versioncomes from Bernard Jaffe's enthusiastic telling of the story in his Crucibles: TheStory of Chemistry, p. 59.14. There is definitely more to science than meets the eye. One of the mostremarkable cases of simultaneous discovery is that of the American and Frenchchemists, Charles Hall and Paul Louis H\u00e9roult. Without knowing each other,both scientists discovered the electrolysis process of refining aluminum. But thecoincidence doesn't end there. They were born the same year (1863), patentedtheir process the same year (1886) and both turned their discoveries into major37industries (ALCOA and P\u00e9chiney). They died in1914, each one aged fifty-oneyears and one month.Laying the Corner StoneA large bell rings and a new democracy is born in Independence Hall,Philadelphia. The sound is heard around the world but most clearly in France. Longbefore France sends her great compliment to the Land of the Free in the form of a ladyholding the torch of liberty, the despotic legacy of French kings and despoiling nobility istorn to shreds by the Goddess of Reason, the patron deity of the French revolution. Thenfear and years of repression combine to erect the guillotine in her place and the Reign ofTerror shocks a complacent Europe into a new awareness of itself. A new struggle isborn, the struggle of the people against the autocratic powers that would enslave it. Theeffects of this struggle would literally turn the world on its head. Those who were belowwould replace the aristocracy at the top; the spirit of democracy would give power to thepeople. The echoes of this struggle will be heard around the world. They will resoundthroughout the nineteenth century in the factories of England and Europe, in the tradeunions organized to protect the rights of laborers everywhere, in the politics of richagainst poor and vice versa and in the far off streets of colonies and protectorates thatwere only beginning to shake the shackles that bound their peoples to the purse strings ofa European aristocracy. Alongside these efforts to turn the world around came, as wehave seen, the efforts of science to distance itself from old concepts of universal truthsand seize the day with tangible realities that could be experimentally proven. It was as ifthe discovery of the new and very tangible profits to be gained from colonies in the newworld and in Africa extended its mode of exploration and exploitation to the mentality ofscience as well. Indeed, we can turn the dictum that \"nature abhors a vacuum\" on itshead and apply it to the modern empirical science of the day. We see that science, withall of its emphasis on the atom, on the parts of matter and on exploring the exploitableaspects of matter, did not happen in a vacuum. It was part of a world change ofconsciousness that made it part of a much greater whole.But we are getting ahead of ourselves. Let's go back a bit to the years 1763-66when a young French aristocrat, Antoine Lavoisier, was helping a geologist friend of theLavoisier family map the whole of France's mineral possessions and geologicalformations. During this tour of the natural resources of France, Lavoisier wasparticularly interested in the chemistry of gypsum, otherwise known as plaster of Paris.Gypsum has to be heated in order to be suitable for plastering the walls of Parisianhouses. This heating drives out water from the rock hard gypsum to give a soft powderyresidue that can be mixed with water to become hard and rocklike. Lavoisier found itremarkable that water in the original rock hard gypsum had to be freed from the gypsumbefore it could be used a plaster with the addition of water. He called the original waterin the gypsum \"fixed water\" and the idea that a substance, in this case water, could be\"fixed\" or chemically united with another substance stuck in the budding scientistsimagination and was to prove the undoing of the phlogiston theory some years later.1In the spring of 1772 Lavoisier read an essay on phlogiston that reported howmetals actually gained weight when heated and turned into a calx (oxide in modernterms). Now we will recall that a metal, shiny and bright, is supposed to be rich in38phlogiston. When heated and turned into a calx the phlogiston is given off. Accordingto theory therefore a metal should lose the weight of the phlogiston lost when heated andturned to a calx. So the essay Lavoisier read was quite surprising; it suggested theopposite was happening. Then there were other papers saying the same thing.2 Butothers recalled the lighter than air phlogiston of Cavendish and suggested that the loss ofweight was due to an anti-gravity effect. Still others ascribed to Priestley's view thatmatter is spirit\u2014a theory or idea that seemed born out by the vitalizing effect of hisdephlogisticated air.3 Now, as more research provided more facts, the face of phlogistonwas changing as fast or faster than the facts it was supposed to explain. With such\"explanations\" in the air it was becoming clear to Lavoisier that the concept of phlogistonhad become more of an ideal than a reality and as such had outlived whatever usefulnessit once had as a key to understanding the hard facts of chemistry. Lavoisier,remembering his experience with gypsum, began to have other ideas.Since the truth of the matter must have something to do with weight, the wealthyyoung aristocrat, who by this time had acquired a fully equipped and very modernlaboratory for his day, was prepared to give the question a thorough analysis. Thanks tohis position with the Fermes Generals, a kind of Department of Internal Revenue run byaristocrats, he had access to the balance used by the national mint. The use of this veryaccurate balance in the hands of the very able young scientist was to prove the undoing ofphlogiston.Not right away, however. In 1774 Priestley came to France and in a conversationwith Lavoisier revealed his own experiments with mercury and the strangedephlogisticated air that was given off. Prior to this time, Lavoisier had thought that airwas liberated when a metal was heated to form a calx much in the same way water wasliberated from gypsum. Now he realized it was the other way around: when a calx isheated by itself the strange air of Priestley was given off. But when heated with carbon,as was the case them metal ores were refined, the fixed air of Priestley's brewery wasgiven off. This was also the gas observed when diamonds were burnt. Amidst theconfusion, Lavoisier perhaps only saw in Priestley's work another opportunity for moremuch needed research. In 1772 he said as much when informed of Priestley'sexperiments with hydrogen chloride and the oxides of nitrogen. But he complained thatPriestley's work failed to bring any new insight into the reasons for what he observed.4From this we can perhaps surmise that Lavoisier was looking for reasons andexplanations to help him understand his own experiments. At any rate he never didcredit Priestley's work.5 What we do know is that after this meeting Lavoisier began toduplicate Priestley's experiments with the red calx of mercury. In doing so, he utilizedhis accurate balance to weigh the initial calx and the products generated as a result ofheating it. He carefully weighed out four ounces (grams were not yet established as thepreferred scientific measure) of the calx and proceeded to heat it. He heated it for twelvedays, nonstop. At the end of the twelve days of constant heating he carefully weighed themercury and calx that still remained in the heating flask and the gas that was given off.He discovered that together, the two weights equaled the weight of the calx he hadoriginally placed into the flask when the heating began. Thus the conclusive facts werethere to read: a calx was really a metal that was \"fixed\" with air. He called this airoxygen and the calx became known in the modern terminology as an oxide. Then, toremove all doubt, he reversed the experiment and by heating pure mercury caused it to39use up about one fifth of a reservoir of air. Thus he not only demonstrated the process ofoxidation, but he also confirmed other estimations that the air contained nineteen totwenty percent oxygen.By showing how chemistry could be understood in terms of finite and weighablequantities of reactants, Lavoisier laid the cornerstone for what became modern chemistry.From the time of Lavoisier, the door was flung open to establish the composition ofdifferent compounds by carefully weighing both the reactants and the product(s) theyform when chemically united. A lot of work had yet to be done, however, and the aboveretelling of the story is very simplified. The truth is complicated by many factors not theleast of which was the strange behavior of hydrogen, a gas so unlike oxygen. It alsocomplicated the picture that prior to the work of Lavoisier, no one really had a clear ideawhat an element was or even what a compound was. This confusion was to last well intothe 19th century but Lavoisier helped provide the tools and conceptual basis for moreaccurate analysis. The quest was on.To spur the search even more, Lavoisier also rewrote the book of chemistry, bothfiguratively and literally. Figuratively, because he redefined the rules of chemistry andmade it a quantitative science that used the laboratory to establish factual weights andvolumes as a basis for discovery. Literally, because he simplified the existingnomenclature and established what we know today as the language of chemistry. Therenaming of \"dephlogisticated air\" as oxygen was only a beginning. From there he gavethe known elements of his day many of the names we still use. The names attempted todescribe the properties of each element. Since Lavoisier thought that the gas given off bythe heated mercury calx would form acids, he called the gas oxygen which means acidformer.6 He arrived at this name because of the way nonmetal oxides, such as sulfurdioxide and carbon dioxide, form acids when dissolved in water. Hydrogen, the gas helater proved (along with Cavendish) to unite with oxygen to form water, means \"waterformer.\" Because Lavoisier threw out the phlogiston terminology used by Cavendish anddefined water as the compounding of the two elements, hydrogen and oxygen, Lavoisieris often given credit for discovering the elemental composition of water. Cavendish'swork predated Lavoisier's however and, differences of terminology aside, it was finallyCavendish who was given credit for the initial discovery. At least that is the way theEnglish saw it. Of course, if you are French you will feel free to interpret this historicmoment as French eyes will see it.All of this controversy only underscores the basic need of the time, the need for anew terminology. Lavoisier's work continued to address this problem in his Trait\u00e9Elementaire de Chimie (Treatise on the Elements of Chemistry) where he defined anelement as any substance that could not be analyzed by chemical means. He gave namesto the thirty three elements then known, among which are sulfur, phosphorus, charcoal(carbon), antimony, arsenic, bismuth, cobalt, copper, gold, iron, lead, molybdenum, nickel, platinum, silver, tin, tungsten, zinc, lime (calcium),magnesium, aluminum, silicon, oxygen, azote (nitrogen) and hydrogen. Because severalof the elements had names that began with the letter \"m\" alchemical names weresometimes retained. Hence mercury gets the alchemical name hegalium and the symbol,Hg ans sodium the symbol Na for natrum. For traditional reasons, gold and silver retainthe old Latinate monikers of aurium and argentium. Lead is called plumbium and coppercuprum. The sign language was still the old one handed down from the alchemists,40however. This would not change till Berzelius gave the modern abbreviations. Iron, forexample was the circle with an arrow used in astrology to designate the planet mars.Copper was given the astrological sign of venus. You can well imagine what a chemicalreaction must have looked like when written with all of the obscure and arcaneterminology which represented different things to different scientists. The Treatise on theElements of Chemistry came a long way toward creating a simplified vision of chemistry.It was to be used for the next twenty years to rechart the science of the day and preparefor a science that would lend itself ever more effectively to research and to the mineralexploitation of nature's resources. In this way the cornerstone laid by Lavoisier wouldalso be used to pave the way to the Industrial Revolution every bit as much as theinvention of the steam engine by James Watt. Applying the mechanical model to matterand the Cartesian partition to nature would make scientific exploration and industrialexploitation co-partners in the effort to turn the crank of the natural machine. Added tothat we have a human nature that \"gets the thing to go\" as it exerts the natural machine tocreate more power for the benefit of both humankind and human unkind alike.7A biographical note must be added to this story of humankind and human unkind,however. Like Priestley, Lavoisier became embroiled in the political events of his time.Unlike Priestley, however, the outcome was to be more tragic than the burning of ameeting house. Lavoisier had the misfortune of being an aristocrat when to be noble wasto be persona non grata during the mobocratic rule of the Reign of Terror. History oftenproves that when those who have heads abuse them, a state of affaires ensues where thosewho keep their heads can lose them. Such was the fate that awaited Lavoisier who, alongwith his father in law, was sent to the guillotine in 1774. A man who had based hisscience on the use of the analytical balance was overthrown by the unbalanced times inwhich he lived. He was guillotined while Priestley was en route to America.81. The Norton History of Chemistry, p. 912. At this time Lavoisier was pursuing the mystery of burning diamonds.Diamonds, it was discovered, would disappear under intense heat when theoperation was done in an open vessel. When the diamond was buried in charcoaldust and placed in a sealed container no amount of heat would affect it. Not onlythat, but the gas given off when the diamond burned was found to be the samefixed air that Priestley discovered at the brewery. Now consider: diamondsglittered and sparkled and were supposed to be just full of phlogiston. Whenheated all of this phlogiston disappears and all that is left is some fixed air that isvery heavy, much heavier than normal air. This would seem to say that thephlogiston, which is forced out of its diamond (leaving nothing behind), creates agas that is heavier than air. The fact that this only happened in an open vesselmeant that heat alone was not responsible for the change. Therefore, phlogistonreacted with air to make it heavier. And therefore phlogiston must haveweight\u2014a weight at least proportional to the original diamond. But now we getthese papers that tell of how phlogiston rich metals gain weight when heated toform a calx. Phlogiston, which must have weight according to the diamondexperiment, is lost by the metal and the metal gains weight? You can understandwhy Lavoisier was left scratching his head. (See Lavoisier, pp. 46-60.)413. This view of breath as giver of life force recalls the doctrine of vitalism thatascribed to life a vital force. (Norton History of Chemistry, pp. 99-11) But it alsostrikes a common chord with the abstract and essentially lifeless concept thatmatter is energy. This view is of course derived from Einstein's famousequation E = mc2.4. Lavoisier: La Naissance de la Chimie Moderne, p. 54.5. Priestley was annoyed at this and protested against Lavoisier's borrowing andobjected to gaps in his reasoning. Convinced that it was he who had tippedLavoisier off on the idea of using mercurius calcinatus (mercury oxide), heimplies that Lavoisier is acting out of suspicious motives and expresses hisconcern that this has led to some poor science:After I left Paris, where I procured the mercurius calcinatus above mentioned, andhad spoken of the experiments that I had made, and that I intended to make withit, he (Lavoisier) began his experiments kupon the same substance, and presentlyfound what I have called dephlogisticated air, but without investigating the natureof it, and indeed, without being fully apprised of the degree of its purity. Andthough he says it seems to be more fit for respiration than common air, he doesnot say that he has made any trial to determine how long an animal could live init. He therefore inferred, as I have said that I myself had once done, that thissubstance had, during the process of calcinations imbibed atmospherical air, notin part, but in whole. But then he extends his kconclusions, and, as it appears tome, without any evidence, to all the metallic calces; saying that, very probablythey would all of them yield only common air, if, like mercurius calcinatus, theycould be reduced without addition. (Lavoisier, Economist,p. 80):6. Lavoisier knew the nonmetallic oxides formed acids and this led him to assumethat it was the oxygen that was responsible.7. A contemporary of Lavoisier, was the industrial inventor, Nicolas Leblanc, whowas as much a pioneer in commercial chemistry as Lavoisier was in the purescience. He pioneered a method to make sodium carbonate from sodium chloride,a substance that was used in soap and paper and textile manufacture, dye makingand in the tanning of leather. After the French revolution it became impossible toimport sodium carbonate and the need for an inexpensive means to manufacture itwas in great demand. Leblanc obtained a patent for his process and began toproduce sodium carbonate in 1791. The process combined salt (NaCl) fromseawater with sulfuric acid to make sodium sulfate and hydrochloric acid (ventedoff as a gas). The sodium sulfate was heated with calcium carbonate and carbonto produce sodium carbonate, calcium sulfide and carbon dioxide. Unfortunately,either for lack of enough sulfuric acid or financing, Leblanc's plant never attainedfull production. Competition from others who also claimed to be able to produce42sodium carbonate from seawater also undermined his financial prospects.Finally, Leblanc was to end his days by committing suicide in a poorhouse. Thusboth he and Lavoisier came to a tragic end. But the story of Leblanc does notend here. As seen from the above chemical process, the process he and othersdevised for manufacturing sodium carbonate gave off the noxious pollutants,hydrochloric acid and calcium sulfide. A visiter to the south of France inProvence reported in 1820 that the \"vapors that were given off from themanufacturing plants blackened and burnt the surrounding region; one wouldthink they were standing at the edge of a volcano.\" (Histoire de la Chime, p. 207)The industrial age had arrived.8. Priestley left for America in April of 1794 and Lavoisier was beheaded May 8,1794. But the story has an interesting twist. The Swiss revolutionary leader,Jean Paul Marat had pretensions to become a chemist but several years before therevolution Lavoisier had called him to task for his shoddy science and brandedhim as a charlatan. This so incensed the soon-to-be pamphleteer of therevolution that when time came to even the score the guillotine was waiting tooblige. The irony of this is that Marat becomes a national hero in the Pantheon ofParis while the name of Lavoisier is not even listed among the great men of thenation. But the French, of course, are not alone in such omissions. We alsohave American politics to remind us ever more how those who have heads stillabuse them...43Laying the FoundationAn InterludeFrom the time of Lavoisier chemistry became an exact science. With the intrepidfaith of the true believer, scientists embarked on the journey toward the ultimate quest fortruth and the conquest of nature. Reason and logic, weights and measure were their tools.Yet, this ultimate faith in himself left man alone, desperately struggling to extract thetruth of the universe from the sweat of his own efforts. There was a price to be paid, aprice perhaps best described by the 19th century scientist and historian Berthelot (not to beconfused with Berthollet, mentioned below):The world is today without mystery: the rational mind claims to clarify andunderstand everything; it struggles to give all things a positive and logicalexplanation and extends its fatal determinism as far as the world of morality. I donot know if the factual deductions of reason will reconcile some day divinepredestination and human free will, once so fervently discussed. At any case, theentire material universe is claimed by science, and no one dares any longer toresist the face of this claim. The notion of the miraculous and of the supernaturalhas vanished like a vain mirage, a bygone bias of another time.1These words were written almost exactly a century after Lavoisier wrote his ElementaryTreatise of Chemistry. Yet, as despairing as they sound, as we shall see, a strange newmystery will begin to unfold in the very hands of the logic that has done and will do somuch to strip away the old beliefs. The bare language of matter itself, as naked as thebalance of Lavoisier, will show how nature is only the more eloquent for all her nakedbeauty.We can begin to glimpse this mystery if we take a thematic look at what hashappened so far. From the earliest time breath has been looked upon as sacred. Curiousthen that so many men of science who laid the foundations for chemistry began bystudying the air we breathe. We know that Priestley was looking for some sort ofconnection between the Biblical \"breath\" that raised Adam from the dust and the airs heexamined in his laboratory. But such ideas were soon to be seen as old-fashioned. Withthe fall of phlogiston, the last shred of philosophical science had fallen away. Now themechanical model and a strategy of facts that could be weighed and counted provided theanswers to questions of the day. The strategy of facts would be translated into theoryand every analytical tool in the chemist's arsenal of apparatus would test it. Clarity andprecision were the needed focus; the analytical approach was here to stay. Under itsscrutinizing glare we have seen old concepts and paradigms disappear and be replaced bya world of parts and proportions. We have seen how the air just wasn't what it used tobe in the minds of the times. It had been analyzed, weighed and measured. It wasalmost as though the sacred breath of life itself had been given over to the balance whenLavoisier disproved phlogiston. By the time Berthelot could look back on a century of44scientific investigation, the air, fire, the very ground we walk on and the water we drinkhad become the subject of quantitative analysis. Yet, as T. S. Eliot reminds us in hisFour Quartets, all things of man and nature coincide with ever recurring themes:The stillness as a Chinese jar is stillMoves perpetually in its stillness.Not the stillness of the violin while the note lasts,Not that only, but the co-existence,Or say that the end precedes the beginningAnd the end and the beginning were always thereBefore the beginning and after the end.2The notes from the violin do indeed grow still as nature turns to atoms. But let us seehow this end contains a new song, a new music where, as the poet promises, was alwaysthere. And proceed with guarded optimism.The Birth of Modern Atomic TheoryJohn Dalton (1766-1844), mentioned above, is generally considered the father ofmodern atomic theory even though others pioneered and championed the idea many yearsbefore him. Boorse and Motz in their history of the atom comment on how...it is a sobering thought that two thousand years of atomic speculation (since the time ofDemocritus) produced no mind able to formulate atomic theory in questions simpleenough for direct experimental answers....It would be logical to expect that if the greatestminds of two millennia had found no way to question nature in atomic terms, only ademigod might be expected to see where mortals were blind. But no demigod appeared.Instead, the fates sent an unprepossessing country schoolmaster of silent mien anduncouth manners, who, in a chance flash of revelation, caught a glimpse of an open doorand passed through.4Now wait a minute. Demigod? Door opener? Where others are blind? What ishappening here? Didn't we just read few pages back where Paracelsus, La Metrie,Priestley and Lavoisier were breaking down the doors of knowledge, crying for a moreempirical, experiment-driven science? It sure sounded that way. But it seems they weretoo successful. There was such a welter of new facts that people didn't know what tomake of them. The facts were like fish in a mountain stream; they were swimmingeverywhere. And it wasn't enough to watch them swim; one had to catch them. And thething to catch a fish is a net. That net is what Dalton provided\u2014he provided a theory tocatch the facts that were filling the stream of science. The need was for some unifyingand relatively simple pattern of ideas\u2014a paradigm\u2014that would turn a chaos of45observations into meaningful order.4 Gone were the days when holistic ideas like thefour elements provided a unified worldview.5 Now the need was for precision andclarity in the realm of physical truth. And along came Dalton. As the saying goes, ifDalton hadn't existed, someone would have invented him. He became the spokesmanwho articulated the new paradigm\u2014a paradigm with a long past, as we have seen,fostered by the philosophy of Descartes and by the science of Robert Boyle. About hisatoms, Dalton was dead serious\u2014in fact, there seems to be little humor in his rather drylife as a Quaker schoolmaster. Maybe that's why he has such a fixation on studyingclouds. Not to say that he didn't have clouds of his own. In fact, it might strike some asamusing that as an inveterate pipe smoker he struck the match to the new smoke of theday. We might even picture him as a pipe smoking surfer who caught the wave of fieryenthusiasm that broke on the shores of hard science.6 A hard science indeed, asBerthelot was to lament, a science with a schoolmaster's rule: Dalton was every inch aman of the empirical cut with a ruling urge to quantify and measure. He owed thesuccess of his theory to the fact that it provided a way to do just that. To this effect,Alexander Findlay gives a more sober assessment of Dalton's contribution:The most important advance made my Dalton in the development of thehypothesis of the atomic constitution of matter was the introduction of thequantitative factor, and since, according to the atomic theory, the relative weightsof the atoms, the so-called atomic weights, are fundamental units of chemicalscience, the determination of these atomic weights was clearly a matter ofimportance for the verification and for the application of the theory.7 The key phrase is the \"quantitative factor.\" Dalton provided a map for determining thenature of matter not on relationships and qualities but on relative weight. The balance ofLavoisier was to reign supreme as it determined what quantity of this substance reactedwith a certain quantity of another substance to produce a predictable quantity of product.Thus the search for exact knowledge increasingly defined chemistry in terms of weightand number. And so we see that weight and number became the paradigm for the nextstep in the coming age of science while chemical and physical properties wait in thewings for a more dramatic entry.8So how did this great step for mankind come to be? As said above, Dalton was ameteorologist. Of course, it is understood that he was an amateur meteorologist. No onewas getting paid in those days for such questionable activities as looking at clouds andpredicting the weather. Every peasant worth his clod could do that much. What madeDalton unique was the way he went about it. He kept pages and pages of notes about theweather. You didn't start a friendly conversation with John Dalton about the weather,not, that is, if you expected a short reply. Here was a man who could tell you far moreabout cumulus clouds than you ever wanted to know. A short, color blind Quaker wholived by himself and graded papers, he found clouds to be an exciting diversion to arather colorless existence. And, of course, for a man who loves clouds, England is aparadise. So what in heaven's name made led him from clouds to atomic theory? In thefirst place, like all amateurs who make the history books, he asked questions no one elsecould answer and then started to find some answers on his own. He had read from thecurrent scientific discoveries of Priestley, Cavendish and others that the atmosphere was46composed of different gases. He knew from the work of Priestley that plants gave offoxygen and that they took in what we now call carbon dioxide. He also knew what youknow, namely that carbon dioxide is very heavy, that it could be poured from a bottle andit would flow downward like water. He knew the approximate composition of the air tobe about four fifths azote or nitrogen and one fifth oxygen. He was up to date oneverything that was in the air about air. And he asked questions.The question that haunted him most was why, with all the different gases ofdifferent weights in the air, why was the composition of air so uniform? In some ways,the question is similar to the one Robert Boyle asked over a hundred years ago. Boyle, aswe remember, asked why air was so elastic and why it filled any empty space. And likeBoyle, Dalton chose atoms as an explanation. The simple answer he gave for thequestion of uniform composition of air was that the atoms of air mixed themselves up bycolliding with one another and causing a uniform distribution of the different gases.This sounds so simple, so logical that we moderns are apt to scratch our heads andask why no one thought of it before. We have to remember, however, that in Dalton'stime the idea that the air was a mixture of gases was still fairly new. In schools acrossthe country the old Aristotelian model was still taught and that was how most people stillthought. It still made sense to think of airiness as a quality that applied to all gases (seefootnote 5 below). The new analytical way of thinking was new; the old qualitative waystill prevailed. Unless, that is, you happened to be a student in the little classroom ofJohn Dalton.The world soon filled this little classroom. Though Dalton's theory of the atomiccomposition of air was untried and was to be far from flawless, it was a workablehypothesis and the feeling ran high if the right answers were forthcoming everythingwould fit into place. To account for the different densities and weights of the elementsDalton gave the atoms weight. He suggested that hydrogen be given the atomic weight ofone, it being the lightest element. The rest of the elements could be seen as multiples byweight of hydrogen. If all matter were formed of atoms like the different gases in air thenthere was every reason to believe by carefully weighing the reactants and the productsthey produced one could identify the composition of elements in any given compound.Dalton's theory of atomic weights was made workable by the law of constantcomposition and constant proportions, a law that stated that any given compound wouldalways be composed of the proportions of elements. Water, for example would alwaysbe H2O no matter where you found it; it would always be composed of hydrogen andoxygen united in a 2:1 ratio. But as obvious as that might sound, it was anything butobvious in the early part of the 19th century when Joseph Louis Proust (1754-1808)struggled with conflicting data and a very incomplete knowledge of the elements. Healso struggled to convince his fellow Frenchman, Claude Louis Berthollet (not to beconfused with Berthelot, above) was insisted that nature has a freer hand. A verycompetent chemist, Berthollet was quick to champion the chemistry of Lavoisier. LikeLavoisier he was interested in the perfecting of gunpowder and his discovery ofpotassium chlorate, KClO3, unfortunately led to the very rapid combustion of a powdermill. But his idea that chemical affinity was proportional to the mass of the reactantsconvinced him that compounds did not have to combine in fixed ratios. This led him to acourteous conflict with Proust that was only resolved after some mistaken notions ofwhat was a compound and what was not were cleared up. Berthollet, for example,47thought that glass was an element. Later, of course, it was found to be an oxide ofsilicon. Finally, after a long struggle to clarify compounds and establish the elementsthat composed them, Proust's law of constant proportions was vindicated after eight longyears of effort. He exclaimed that...the stones and soil beneath our feet and the ponderable mountains are not mereconfused masses of matter; they are pervaded through their innermost constitutionby the harmony of numbers.9Here at last was proof that the world was made according to number and proportion.Water would always be 2 parts hydrogen and 1 part oxygen; ammonia 1 part nitrogen and3 parts hydrogen, etc. Pythagoras would have smiled and said , \"I told you so.\" Indeed,in the efforts of Proust and others to arrange nature in orderly systems and proportions wehear a distant echo of those ancient Greeks, an echo that resonates with the same fervorfor universal truth that lived in the minds of those bygone philosophers. The paradigms,they were a changin', but the quest for a unifying theme was here to stay.While Dalton was developing his atmospheric observations into the atomic theoryof gases, other scientists were making discoveries that would suggest new ways to testthe composition of matter. In Italy, Luigi Galvani (1737-98) had discovered some yearsbefore that frog legs that had been preserved in brine and hung on copper hooks wouldjerk as though alive when the wind blew them against an iron railing. Galvani concludedthat this must be caused by something happening in the muscles of the dead legs. Hiscountryman, Alessandro Volta (1745-1827), upon further examination of the jerkingspasms, concluded correctly that the phenomenon was caused by an electric currentgenerated by the action of salt water on the two metals, copper and iron. The legs servedas conductors of the current produced by the action of salt water on the two metals. Thiscurrent caused them to jerk. This discovery led to Volta's great invention, the voltaicpile, or the first battery. He replaced the frog legs with a cloth soaked in salt water oracid. He sandwiched the cloth between two metals, say, copper and iron, and showedhow it allowed a \"current\" of electricity to pass between the two metals just as the froglegs had done. A single sandwich was called a pile. By attaching wires on the twometals he could make this \"current\" go through a wire. By increasing the number ofsandwiches, or the number of piles, he could increase the amount of \"current.\" Hedevised the idea of current to describe the apparent flow of electricity and the word stuck.Today the whole world speaks of electric current though the analogy is far from a provenfact. The idea, for example, that electrons \"flow\" refers to how electrical energy fills thespace in and around a wire. It is a way or referring to the effects of an electric field. ButVolta's metaphor seemed appropriate and it has stuck in our vocabulary like a rock at thebottom of a river.Soon the voltaic pile was put to work. Volta himself used it to break down waterand show how the two gases, hydrogen and oxygen could be generated by the electrolysisof water. In England, Humphry Davy (1778-1829) was to apply a huge voltaic pile tomolten salts of potassium, sodium and isolate those metals. He was to do the same withcalcium, strontium and barium. Later chlorine and iodine would join his growing list ofelements isolated by using the voltaic pile. The success of his experiments with thevoltaic pile convinced Davy that compounds were held together by electrical forces.48Davy did not, however, develop this explanation into a theory that went beyondthe range of his own experiments. This task was accomplished by the Swedish scientist,J\u00f6n Jacob Berzelius (1779-1848). Berzelius, working at the same time as Davy, had alsoused the pile to isolate the elements cerium, selenium and thorium. Knowledge ofDavy's work and the work of John Dalton led him to develop the electrolytic theory ofcompounds. The theory stated that elements united because different elements haddifferent charges. In the experiments of Davy and Berzelius, the positive and negativeelectrodes of the pile were placed in molten salts. Metals such as sodium or potassium,because they were attracted to the negative pole, were said to be positive whereasnonmetals like chlorine and iodine, attracted to the positive pole, were said to benegative. Likewise, the electrolysis of water indicated that hydrogen was positive(attracted to the negative pole) and oxygen was negative (attracted to the positive pole).The consistency of these results led to the theory that elements conformed to the nature ofelectricity and to how opposites attract.10In addition, Berzelius completed the job Lavoisier had begun: he furthermodernized the nomenclature of chemistry, gave it the language we know today, andfurther refined the elements by finding their atomic weights. Instead of the oldalchemical/astrological symbols still used he adopted the abbreviations using the Romanalphabet while keeping the names used by Lavoisier: mercury was abbreviated as Hg (forthe Greek, hydrogyros = liquid silver), copper as Cu (for the Greek, Kupros, the ancientname of Cyprus, the reputed birthplace of Aphrodite), gold as Au (for the Latin, aurum),silver as Ag (for the Sanscrit, argunas = shiny, milky white, brilliant), potassium as K (forthe Arabic, kali and Latin, kalium = ashes).11 Then he attacked the question of correctatomic weights for each of the elements. Like Dalton, he compared each element tohydrogen and by careful and tedious experiment arrived at a table of atomic weights.Berzelius found that the weight of carbon, for example, was twelve times that ofhydrogen; the weight of oxygen as sixteen times that of hydrogen and so on. By 1826Berzelius had identified the comparative weights of chlorine, hydrogen, copper, lead,nitrogen, oxygen, potassium, silver and sulfur at very close to the values accepted today.Thanks to the work of this great pioneer of chemical science chemistry was placed on afirm foundation with a systematic approach to understanding the composition ofcompounds and the nature of chemical affinity.Of course he was not alone. The work of Proust and the law of constantproportions described above had done much to make the work of Berzelius possible, asdid that of Davy and Dalton. And now another scientist gives a breath of fresh air to theold question of gases. In 1808 Gay Lussac (1778-1850) was experimenting with theelectrolysis of water and the ratio of two parts hydrogen and one part oxygen therebyproduced. The experiment had already been done by Volta and was nothing new. Butthe fact that hydrogen and oxygen would be produced in simple ratios intrigued theyoung scientist. He tried other combinations of gases to see if they would follow thesame general rule. He found that a measured amount of nitrogen gas would always unitewith three times that volume of hydrogen, producing ammonia at the simple ratio of 1:3.More experimentation showed the same mathematical simplicity. This led to thediscovery of the law of volumes which states that gases combine with each other insimple ratios. But his discoveries didn't agree with Dalton's theory. He found that onevolume of nitrogen combined with one volume of oxygen made two volumes of nitric49oxide gas instead of the one volume predicted by Dalton. Likewise, hydrogen andnitrogen combined to form two volumes of ammonia instead of one. This was well andgood as far as the law of volumes and simple ratios went. But why two volumes of nitricoxide instead of one as Dalton's theory predicted? According to Dalton, one atom ofnitrogen should unite with three atoms of hydrogen to form one molecule of ammonia.The same for nitric oxide: one atom of nitrogen and one of oxygen should unite to formone molecule of nitric oxide. This contradiction was not to be resolved for another fiftyyears. Because the law of volumes was a well demonstrated fact, the contradiction putDalton's theory in serious question. Atoms were the accepted model but what they didand how they did it were questions no one could answer.His theory was further compromised by the fact that people weren't yet certainwhat was an element and what was not. According to Lavoisier's definition an elementis supposed to be a substance that cannot be analyzed or broken down by chemicalmeans. But it was by no means certain what fit that definition. Some said chlorine wasan element (Davy) and some said not (Berzelius). We recall that the reason Proust hadsuch a hard time proving his law of constant proportions was that his challenger,Bertholet, argued that his reactions with glass as well as with certain alloys did notconform to Proust's law. It would be discovered later that glass was really thecompound, silicon dioxide. The sheer number of elements was also seen as a problem.Davy and other chemists found it hard to believe that God would create a universe out ofsome fifty different building blocks. He had already proved that some of Lavoisier'selements were in fact compounds. He argued with others for a simpler theory of matter.After all hadn't the law of volumes and the law of constant proportions proven that theuniverse was based on simple ratios?William Prout (1785-1850), an Edinburgh trained physician, offers a solution.Familiar with Greek philosophy, he recalled the search for primordial substance we knowfrom Parmenides. Aristotle had also concluded that all substances were modifications ofprimary matter. Prout was struck by the fact that experimental evidence showed thatatomic weights were close to whole numbers. He reasoned that this could only bebecause they were in fact multiples of hydrogen, that hydrogen was the primordialsubstance Aristotle and others had anticipated in their philosophy. He called thisprimordial substance, the proto hyle of the universe and made it equivalent to hydrogen.One might say that this is not all that different from Dalton's comparative weights thatbased the weight of the elements on the weight of hydrogen. But Prout is sayingsomething more. He is saying that the different elements are actually made up ofhydrogen. Oxygen, for example, with an atomic weight of sixteen, indicated that sixteenvolumes of hydrogen had condensed to form oxygen. Prout's hypothesis, as Berzeliuscalled it, became a launching pad for all sorts of discussion and proved to be a stimulus toresearch for the next hundred years.1. Les Origines de L'Alchemie, p. v. (author's translation)2. Collected Poems, p. 180. We have a similar mood in Keat's Ode to a GrecianUrn. In either case the jar or urn depicts a design or painting that shows an eventhappening while yet frozen in time. In that way it \"moves perpetually in its50stillness.\" As we turn the jar the scene revolves so that you cannot say this is theend or beginning of it, or find where the end precedes the beginning. \"And theend and the beginning were always there, Before the beginning and after the end.\"We have already seen something of this happening with the themes that keepcoming back. We might ask, \"Where did they begin?\" Or, \"Were they alwaysthere?\" What would Plato say about this?3. The World of the Atom, p. 139.4. The concept of a paradigm shift was applied by Thomas Kuhn in his TheStructure of Scientific Revolutions to the consciousness shift that enablesscientists to break away from old modes of thinking and develop new ones.Examples would be the Galileo-Copernican change in our view of the solarsystem or Darwin's theory of evolution. Both of these caused a rethinking of aworld view. Kuhn's book has become something of a consciousness shift in itsown right because of the accurate manner in which it revealed the dangers ofclinging to old ideas that hinder the advancement of knowledge. As one pinch-hitting wag put it, being a scientist (or anything else) demands that however weplay the game, after we hit the ball, we've got to let go of the bat.5. In his Warmth Course (pp. 15-16, 45), Rudolf Steiner points out how the Greeksconceived of the element earth as sharing an identity with all solid substance thatby virtue of its solidness was self-centered just as the earth is gravity-centered.Thus the \"earthly resides within a solid.\" Water, on the contrary, is not self-centered, rather it is earth centered. Water is pulled uniformly toward the centerof the earth; it does not have a center of its own. This is the unifyingcharacteristic of all liquids; hence their watery quality and their belonging to theelement of water or waterness. Air, on the other hand, has no center at all andflies off in every direction. This is a quality that it shares with all gases; henceall gases are in the element of air. As Steiner goes on to say, it is important thatwe see how the Greek concept of element pertained to how the qualities of asubstance related to the earth as a whole. It was a holistic earth view that did notseek to analyze; rather, it sought to integrate. Ultimately this leads to a view thataccepts the interrelations of nature as being intimately related to man. One cansee how a worldview that truly accomplishes the feat of relating man to natureand to the cosmos can be very satisfying. It is for this reason that we haveattempts to devise a mathematical \"Theory of Everything\" and reduce theuniverse into a Legrangian, a formula that can fit a tee shirt. But the reductionistmodel is doomed to failure in this effort from the start. The math for such atheory is based on an abstract generalization, a paradigm that only exists insomeone's head. The rest of the body, the whole human being is left out of thetheory that professes to be about \"everything.\" And no matter how manydimensions or other worlds one has in a theory, this will not change. Regardlesshow you do the numbers, mothers still have to have babies to do the counting.And both parents hopefully will be there to answer questions like \"who am I?\" If51we don't then we are on the verge of letting a reductionist paradigm tell us whowe are. And the Greeks might think that a trifle too tragic.6. Like many men of his time, Dalton took his tobacco seriously. Speaking of anacquaintance he was to have made the remark that the fellow could never be ascientist because he didn't smoke.7. A Hundred Years of Chemistry, p. 14.8. For example, Dalton thought solubilities of gases were a function of the sizes ofparticles:I am clearly persuaded that the circumstance depends upon the weight andnumber of the ultimate particles of the several gases: those whose particles arelightest and single being most absorbable, and others more according as theyincrease in weight and complexity (The Norton History of Chemistry, p. 143).9. Crucibles, p. 9210. Note how this is progressing. First we have a theory based on weight andnumber. Now chemical affinity as it pertains to inorganic molecules is beingdefined in terms of electricity. Though this brief history does not attempt to dealwith the complexities of organic chemistry which deserves another \"brief historyof its own\" it is nevertheless important to point out to the students how theconclusions that seemed to pertain to the inorganic world only created moreconfusion in the organic.11. Dictionaire des Corps Purs Simples de la Chimie.52The Search for OrderThe scene is set for the 19th century. The world of chemistry is confronted withproblems. In the first place, Dalton's atomic theory, though still considered a workablemodel for reactions between liquids and solids, was not giving the right answers forgases. The electrolytic behavior of acids, bases and salts in solution was yet unexplained.There was no adequate explanation on the atomic level for why solutions of acids, basesand salts conducted electricity. The new science of organic chemistry was a tangle ofunproven formulas that made no sense at all; isomers, different compounds with the samemolecular formula, were not even suspected. (For example, glucose and fructose, twodifferent substances which both have the same formula of C6H12O6, are isomers).1 But byfar the most troublesome lack was for a comprehensive ordering of the elements. In spiteof Prout's hypothesis about all elements being formed from hydrogen, the many diverseand different elements seemed like the many members of an ever growing family. Theymight all trace their ancestry back to a common parent, but they are all different, they allclamor for their place in the universe and they are all here to stay. The yearned forsimplicity of Proust and Davy seemed lost in the noisy, smelly and unruly goings on inthe laboratory. Was nature meant to be this way? Persistent ideals of order and harmonysaid it wasn't. Equally persistent reality said it was.Science is full of stories. And we realize by now that science is a very humanendeavor. Almost without exception the struggle to bring forth new ideas was a hardone. For years Berzelius was to work in a primitive laboratory before bringing forth thefirst truly accurate atomic weights. Both Davy and his illustrious student, MichaelFaraday, came from humble backgrounds that left them no choice but to struggle for theireducation. There was also the resistance to new ideas by those who held tenaciously tothe old ones. But quietly at home in Turin, Italy, Amadeo Avogadro (1776-1856), didn'tquite follow the pattern: he simply waited for the rest of the world to catch up with him.It was a long wait. History is full of \"what ifs\" and in Avogadro's case the hiatusbetween conception and recognition was to witness over fifty years of controversy.Avogadro's conceptions were twofold. Based on the findings of Gay-Lussac, hishypothesis stated that equal volumes of gases (at the same temperature and pressure)contain the same number of atoms or molecules. The logic of his argument is not hard tofollow. From Gay-Lussac's work we know that gases combine by volume in simpleratios. From this we can easily see that if one volume of a gas combines with one volumeof a different gas atom to atom, then the two gases must have the same number of atoms.Since the gases combine atom to atom, they must produce a compound that has the samenumber of molecules and the same ratio of atoms per molecule. An example of thiswould be hydrogen and chlorine as one volume of each combines to form hydrogenchloride gas or HCl. Hence, the ratio of the reactants is preserved in the product. In thecase of hydrogen and oxygen, two volumes of hydrogen combine with one volume ofoxygen, making a 2:1 ratio and the resulting compound is H2O or water. In the case ofammonia we combine one volume of nitrogen and three volumes of hydrogen. Wetherefore expect a compound that reflects this 1:3 ratio and we find it: NH3 for ammonia.53Thus we see that gases combine in whole ratios that agree with the molecular ratios of thecompounds they form.Fine. We now agree that one volume of hydrogen will combine with one volumeof chlorine to form HCl, etc. We have an experimentally accurate picture of what thereaction produces molecularly. But so far we have said nothing about the volumes eachreaction produces. And there is where the problems begin. They begin when wediscover (as Gay Lussac did) that one volume of hydrogen and one volume of chlorineproduce not one volume of HCl but two! Likewise, one volume of nitrogen combineswith three volumes of hydrogen to produce not one volume of ammonia but two. And ifyou are wondering what the big deal is, consider what is supposed to happen inaccordance with Dalton's theory. According to Dalton's theory one volume of hydrogenshould combine with one volume of chlorine to make one volume of the new gas,hydrogen chloride, HCl. Like wise with nitrogen and hydrogen: the gases combine sothat one volume of nitrogen attaches itself to three volumes of hydrogen to produce onevolume of ammonia. And so on. But that wasn't what was happening. The gaseswould seem to combine and multiply at the same time. To explain this, Avogadrohypothesized that the gases in general, hydrogen and chlorine included, were diatomic,that is, they normally existed in pairs. Instead of simply O or N for oxygen and nitrogenwe would have O2 and N2. Thus we have an example of an idea that attempts to fit thefacts rather than starting with an idea and attempting to find the facts to fit it. Applyingthis idea to the facts, we have the following:H2 + Cl2 2HClandN2 + 3H2 2NH3This way, in each reaction, we produce twice as many molecules. Hence, we have twicethe volume. We only have one volume of diatomic H2 and one volume of diatomic Cl2,but when these react, they create two hydrogen chloride molecules. And with twice asmany molecules we double the volume of the product. The same show goes withammonia. This shows how the reaction produces two volumes of gas from only onevolume of each of the reactants. The facts and the idea are one: reality is served.Unfortunately, ideas are often stronger than the facts; we would rather see ourideas than the facts that lie before us. The idea of Davy and Berzelius that chemicalaffinity was electrical in nature insisted that only atoms of opposite charges couldcombine. Avogadro's hypothesis made no sense from this point of view: the atoms ofoxygen or nitrogen would be of like charge and repel each other. Because Berzelius wasthe dean and first authority of the scientific community in his day, just as much asAvogadro was a virtual unknown, it was the theory of electrical repulsion that held thefield. Avogadro had published his hypothesis in 1811. It wasn't the Karlsruheconference in 1860 that his Stanislao Cannizzaro succeeded in presenting athorough application of Avogadro's hypothesis that differentiated between atoms and54molecules\u2014atoms being the single particles of an element and molecules being thediatomic units of gases and the union of atoms in a compound. It was idea whose timehad come. Avogadro himself had died four years before.After 1860, the application of Avogadro's hypothesis, that gases were diatomicand that equal volumes of gases contained the same number of diatomic pairs ormolecules opened the way for determining the correct atomic weights of the gases. Thelatter part, that equal volumes contain the same number of molecules, comes directlyfrom the law of volumes.2 According to Dalton it works like this: if one liter of hydrogencombines with one liter of chlorine to one liter of hydrogen chloride molecules.Avogadro concluded that this tells us that the liters of hydrogen and chlorine must havecontained the same number of atoms. But Avogadro also explains why Gay Lussacdiscovered that one liter each of hydrogen and chlorine make two liters of hydrogenchloride or twice as much as Dalton predicted. He explained this by saying that thehydrogen and chlorine liters contained diatomic molecules of each gas. A diatomicmolecule of hydrogen or chlorine contains two atoms, giving us H2 and Cl2. Thediatomic atoms combine to form twice as much hydrogen chloride, HCl. The sameholds true for all the gases\u2014they are all diatomic. Knowing this made it possible todistinguish between that atomic weight of a gas found in a compound and the molecularweight of the diatomic gas. For example, the weight of chlorine (Cl) in the compoundHCl is about 35 times heavier than the atomic weight of hydrogen (H). But the weightof Cl2 is twice that or 70 times heavier than the atomic weight of hydrogen. (Of coursethe relative weight of Cl2 is only 35 times heavier than diatomic hydrogen.) This wascausing a great deal of confusion. But by understanding that the chlorine gas is diatomicit was understood why the relative weights seemed to vary. This provided a means ofdetermining the correct atomic weights of the gases. And with the correct atomic weightsfor the gases as well as for the other elements, patterns started to emerge.In 1865, John Alexander Reins Newlands (1837-98), a consulting chemist ofScottish and Italian parentage made note of the fact that an arrangement of elements bytheir atomic weights revealed a pattern of familial correspondence between them. Therelationship of the elements according to these correspondences was seen to go throughrepeating groups of seven:Newland's Table of OctavesNewland's Table of OctavesThis prompted Newlands' \"law of octaves\" as some analogy between matter and musicseemed inevitable. Unfortunately for Newlands, there weren't any Pythagoreans on theRoyal Society at the time. He was even less fortunate than Avogadro: his law wasn'tignored, it was laughed out of the Society when he tried to present it. This was partly due55to a lack of sufficient experimental evidence and partly, as our wag would have it, due toa lack of the right club soda. Without sufficient proof, the coincidence seemed tooextraordinary. But where science rushed to judgment, patriotic fervor came to the rescue.After the periodicity of the elements had been confirmed by a German and a Russian, theVery English Society made amends and awarded him the Davy Medal in 1887. Happily,he was still alive to honor his country by receiving the metal.The German chemist who was to challenge English pride walked out of theKarlsruhe conference with Cannizaro's pamphlet on Avodadro's hypothesis in his hand.Julius Lothar Meyer was deeply impressed by the clarity the \"new\" hypothesis affordedto the point of exclaiming that the scales drop from his eyes. The German chemist wasnot long in coming up with his own version of the periodicity of the elements. Meyer notonly based his findings on the atomic weights but also on the physical properties of theelements. He plotted the atomic volume (volume of one gram multiplied by the atomicweight) against the atomic weights of the elements. It was due to Avogadro's provisionthat gas molecules such as chlorine and bromine were diatomic that Meyer was able tofind their appropriate places on the chart. The same correspondences Newlands haddiscovered are here seen very clearly. It is of particular interest to note how theperiodicity of the chemical properties can be generated from a consideration of physicalproperties alone. Mayer's Periodic Table Meyer's Periodicity of the Elements56Mendelyev who derived a table based on both the chemical and physicalproperties of the elements took the next and decisive step. His work was communicatedto the Russian Chemical Society in March 1869, in a paper entitled, The Relation of theProperties to the Atomic Weights of the Elements. The thoroughness of its contents leftno doubt as to the years of research that preceded the conclusive findings. He arrangedthe elements in vertical columns according to atomic weight. As can be seen from histable below, the elements are also arranged according to horizontal groups or periods.Due to its unique properties, hydrogen appears by itself in the upper left hand corner.Immediately beneath it, lithium begins a second period of seven elements that ends withfluorine (F) in Group VII to the far right. Just as in Newlands' table of the elements(which shows the periods vertically), a second period follows the first and extends fromsodium (Na for natrium) to chlorine (Cl). The elements of this period demonstratechemical properties which have a direct correspondence to the chemical properties of thefirst period. Sodium, for example, is similar to lithium (and hydrogen) in its reactivity.All three elements react with oxygen at a ratio of 2:1 (as in H2O). The reactivity withoxygen is shown at each group heading by the expression R2O, RO, where the \"R\" standsfor all of the elements of a particular group. The R2O means that in Group I all theelements will combine at a ratio of 2:1 with oxygen. Sodium oxide, for example, will beNa2O. In Group II (RO), all the elements combine at a 1:1 ratio with oxygen, giving usMgO and CaO for magnesium and calcium oxides. Furthermore, the elements go fromMendelyev's Periodic Classification of the Elements (1872)3ndelyev's Periodic Table being strongly electro-positive on the left to just as strongly electro-negative on the right.Valence is the measure of how electro-positive or negative an element is. On the far left,in Group I (R2O), we have what are known as the alkali metals. Because they combine ata 2:1 ratio with oxygen it is said that the alkali metals have a valence of plus one and thatoxygen has a valence of negative two. In Group II (RO) we have the alkali earth metals(beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, etc.) which have a valence of plus two.When we get to Group VII (fluorine, chlorine, etc.) we have a predictable valence of plus57seven. It is found, however, that the elements of this group combine with hydrogen (plusone) at a ratio of 1:1. This tells us that the elements of Group VII have an effectivevalence of negative. Hence the RH, which means that one chlorine, will combine withone hydrogen at a ratio of 1:1 to form hydrogen chloride. From Group IV to Group VIIwe see both a RO rating and an RH rating which shows more clearly the valence of eachgroup and how it corresponds to the group number. What this means is that the chemicalproperties of the elements in each group are much the same. The fact that each grouprepeats in cycles of eight establishes a fundamental order or harmony among the elementsthat had heretofore been lacking.4 Not that there weren't irregularities, however. The third period has a run ofseven that goes from sodium to chlorine. It is followed by a fourth period that beginswith potassium and extends out to a Group VIII comprised of iron (Fe), cobalt (Co) andnickel (Ni). After calcium (Ca) the period comes to an unknown (at. wt. 44), to titanium(Ti) with a valence of four (appropriately in Group IV), to vanadium (V) with a valenceof five, to chromium (Cr) with a valence of six and manganese (Mn) with multiplevalences that include seven. Iron, cobalt and nickel are placed in Group VIII becausethey share the same chemical properties. Then the cycle returns to Group I with copper(Cu) and zinc (Zn) behaving very much like potassium and calcium with valences of oneand two. The pattern continues. Because each of the elements behaves in accordancewith the group it is in, the properties of the two unknown elements that follow (at. wts. 68and 72) can be determined. Mendelyev called the unknown elements with an atomicweight of 68 and 72 eka-aluminium and eka-silicon and predicted their properties. Hedid the same with the other gaps in the chart. When these elements were indeed found toagree with the predictions Mendelyev made the chart became an astounding success. Itproved itself and proved that the world of the elements and nature in general was ruled byorder after all. We can almost hear Proust's exultant cheer for the \"harmony of numbers\"and perhaps a distant \"I told you so\" from Pythagoras. From Mendelyev's work we havenot only a harmony of numbers but of properties, both physical and chemical. We havethe physical property of atomic weight (and atomic number to come later) andcorresponding chemical activity working hand in hand with the same cyclical pattern.All in all the Periodic Table seems to confirm some hidden law that prescribes order inall its manifestations. The electro-chemical properties discovered by Berzelius and Davypoint to a fundamental polarity that matches up with the metals and nonmetals of thePeriodic Table. We see this in the valences and the reaction patterns of each group. Thegroups to the far left and right, for example, are the most electro-chemical whereas theelements like carbon in Group IV are the least. With a closer look at these middleelements we see that the table reveals not only polarities, but also affinities. The middleposition of carbon is of particular importance. As a middle element, carbon shows anaffinity for a great range of elements from either side of the Table. Instead of a polar,electro-chemical bond, carbon shares itself with other elements to form what is called aco-valent bond. It is this sharing of energy with other elements that leads to the functionof carbon in the building and structuring of life supporting systems. Without carbon, lifeas we know it would not be possible.The nature of a bond is reflected not only in the way an element or compoundbehaves chemically, but also in the structure it forms physically. Crystals are anexample. The rigid form of a crystal indicates some degree of polar bonding, especially58in inorganic crystals. The crystal's rigidity testified to the kind of bond it contains and toa kind of atomic tension that holds the atoms of the crystal firmly in place. The geometryof a crystal is also determined by the way the atoms fit one another. For each inorganicsubstance there are therefore a very limited number of ways a crystal can form. Carbon,on the other hand, forms compounds that can vary all the way from the bark of an ironwood tree to the tissue that makes up the supple bodies of animal forms. This is possiblebecause of the bond-friendly nature of carbon that lets it form huge molecules capable ofmany complex functions. The huge protein molecules and the rings and chains ofcarbohydrates, enzymes and other organic compounds all contribute to help create asupple body that can adapt to change.Carbon is responsible for the chameleon like quality of life forms that have tochange and appear in so many different forms and shapes. This is true right down to themolecular level. It is because of the many ways carbon can bond that we have thephenomenon of isomerism mentioned above with relation to glucose and fructose. It hadbeen known for some thirty years that for an unknown reason different compounds of thesame molecular weight and composition had completely different properties. In 1828W\u00f6hller found that ammonium cyanate had an identical composition with the ureaextracted from a dog's urine (see footnote 1 below). The list kept growing. The periodictable helped explain why this could happen. It was due to carbon's being located in themiddle of the chart and due to its ability to combine equally with elements on either sidethat it was so prolific in making compounds, many of which had the same structure. Butthe table didn't solve the problem of how to identify the structure of isomers. Forexample, the different properties of fructose and glucose could be explained by thedifferent structures of the molecules. But a whole new science had to evolve to studywhat this structure could be. Hence the term structural chemistry, the chemistry oforganic molecules and how to identify the ways carbon can bond to create differentmolecular shapes. The shape of a molecule was just as important as the elements itcontained. Then it was discovered that carbon could bond just as easily with chlorine aswith hydrogen. This totally contradicted the electro-chemical theory of Berzelius. Withcarbon a whole new branch of chemistry was necessary. In the twentieth century thisnew area of explorations would transform the world we live in.Electrochemistry was alive and well, however, in the solutions of acids, bases andsalts. The work of the Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius (1859-1927) was to create anew theory of electrolysis from the work of the period to explain why these solutionscould conduct an electric current while organic solutions of, say, alcohol or sugar, couldnot. There was clearly something different happening with the inorganic, polarizedcompounds that was not happening with the organic compounds of carbon. It wasunderstood that there was some disassociation of the electrolyte, of the acid, base or saltin solution when a current was being applied. From the time of Volta it was well knownthat when a current was applied to a dilute solution of water and sulfuric acid oxygen wascollected at the positive pole and hydrogen at the negative pole. But what happens whena current is not being applied? The answer usually given was that the salt, acid or basewent back to its molecular form. If the electrolyte was salt, NaCl, for example, it woulddisassociate into sodium and chlorine while the current was applied to the solution butwhen the current was removed the sodium and chlorine would reunite. It was thoughtthat the current prevented any chlorine from escaping the aqueous solution or the metallic59sodium from appearing. Once the current was removed, the molecules came backtogether and remained together in solution. The re-association of the salts, acids or basesin solution seemed like the only reasonable answer. Otherwise, what would keep thechlorine from escaping as a gas?This did not suit Arrhenius. He was puzzled over the fact that a more dilutesolution of an electrolyte could conduct current as easily as a concentrated solution.Concentrated sulfuric acid, for example, has the same conductivity as a solution of onlyone part per two hundred. Similar observations were noted for salts and bases. Up to apoint, dilution made little or no difference in the conductivity of an electrolyte insolution. This meant that the amount of an electrolyte in solution was not whatdetermined conductivity. Some other principle must be at work than the physicalpresence of an acid, base or salt.To help clarify the situation Arrhenius, along with colleagues working on thesame problem, called the disassociated parts of electrolyte ions. In a sodium chloridesolution, for example, there would be sodium ions and chlorine ions, designated aspositive and negative. The positive sodium ions would rest in equilibrium with thenegative chlorine ions. The greater the degree of disassociation, Arrhenius reasoned, theless the resistance. From this he concluded that the more dilute the electrolyte thegreater the disassociation. From here he made the leap to what seemed obvious. As onestory goes, after a sleepless night in May of 1883 his many hours of work with some fiftydifferent solutions finally bore fruit with the realization that ions are not created bycurrent, they are a natural part of any electrolyte solution. It makes a good story, but intruth Arrhenius may have only suddenly realized the meaning of research that had beendone by others some years before. However this may be, he was convinced that ionsdon't need a current to keep them separate. They maintained their own equilibrium as awhole. Not only that, but it was also clear that water itself was included in this whole.Water was also ionized. Why else would oxygen and hydrogen appear when current ispassed through a solution of sulfuric acid and water?Even though others had already come to similar conclusions, Arrhenius'\"solution\" to the electrolyte question was hard for a lot of scientists to swallow.Independent chlorine ions in solution? Where were they? Why can't we smell them?Taste them? And sodium? If you have free sodium in an aqueous solution, why doesn'tit react with the water to form sodium hydroxide? Why doesn't a salt solution, if freesodium ions are really in the solution, test out to be basic? Finally, however, the fact thatthe theory fit the facts began to win more acceptance. Again we have an idea, much likeAvogadro's hypothesis, that lived partly because it fit the facts and partly because a fewbelieving scientists championed it. Slowly Arrhenius' ions won the day simply becausethey seemed to explain results in the lab. Test after test was run. Yes, a dilute solutionconducted a current as well as a concentrated solution. Yes, this must indicate that thereare more ions when the electrolyte is more dilute. But why? Why doesn't a moreconcentrated salt solution conduct better than a dilute one? Answers to some of these questions had already been given half a century earlierby Michael Faraday. As a result of Faraday's discovery of induction, it was found thatany moving charged body creates a field of electric energy around it. And the greater thenumber of charged bodies or the greater the movement the greater the field. Sodium and60chlorine ions, for example, were always charged and always moving in solution. Anddiluting this solution, it was found, would increase conductivity. This could only meanthat by diluting the electrolyte the actual number of ions or their movement or both wasincreased. Then came the clincher. Michael Faraday had already shown that the smallestvoltage could produce a current in a salt solution. This suggested that ionization occurredwithout the application of electrical energy. The next step was taken a few years laterwhen Rudolf Clausius asserted that ions were independent of applied current. Itremained for Arrhenius to take up the cause and differentiate between \"active\" and\"inactive\" parts of an electrolyte. In a more dilute solution, he argued, there were more\"active\" parts, more ions, than in a concentrated solution. These active parts or ions werewhat enabled even the smallest current to pass. To say, therefore, that current createdions was to put the shoe on the wrong foot. It was, if anything, the other way around.The moving ions were already creating a field of electric energy that would act as aconduit to any electromotive force applied to a solution. It was the overall effect of anelectric field on the whole solution that made electrolysis possible, not the number of ionsin solution.What had become obvious was that it was just as much the field of energy thatdetermined how and electrolyte worked in solution as the material ions themselves. Infact, some would argue even more so. But regardless what one thinks about ions, it isimportant here that the quality of energy they demonstrate depends on moving bodiesresponding to and creating a field of force. Here energy is not such an abstract universal;it has a dynamic quality that creates quantifiable effects, whether in electroplating or inelectrolysis or in conducting electro-magnetic fields. It is also important that we considerhow the phenomenon of electrolytes must be viewed as a relationship of forces that createa continuum of energy. In this direction we will perhaps come to the kind of thoughtimages that inspired Faraday with a conception of how a field of force creates its ownspace. These were the thought images that helped inspired Maxwell's work.5 Speakingof them Maxwell writes,...Faraday, in his mind's eye, saw lines of force traversing all space where themathematicians saw centers of force attracting at a distance. Faraday saw amedium where they saw nothing but distance...Faraday's methods resembledthose in which we begin with the whole and arrive at the parts by analysis, whilethe ordinary mathematical methods were founded on the principle of beginningwith the parts and building up the whole by synthesis.6Perhaps a truer understanding of electrolytes and of ions will represent something of thiswholeness as we continue to explore the connections between energy and matter. Infact, it seems that as the old adage will have it, the more we know the more it seems wedon't know...However this may be, one thing does seem certain. The more science advancedtoward the twentieth century the more it became clear how intertwined energy and matterreally are. By this time William Crookes is already exploring what he calls radiantmatter. In 1895 Roentgen will discover x-rays. A year later Becquerel will discoverthat uranium exposes photographic film through a black cloth. And one of his students,a young Polish girl, will turn this strange event into a research project that will lead to the61discovery of two new elements and to new secrets at the very heart of matter. Sheseemed destined for the task. It was she who was mixing chemicals in her cousin's labin Warsaw, Poland, when Mendelyev noticed her. The Russian scientist was visiting herfather, Dr. Sklodowska, who was a professor of mathematics and physics in the highschool where young Marja Sklodowska was working in the lab. Mendelyev wasimpressed by her and promised a good future for her if she pursued her work inchemistry. She was to come to France some ten years later to form one of the mostunique partnerships in science with her husband, Pierre Curie. And so we see once morehow the science of human events and the human events of science play on and if welisten, we just might catch a few notes of that violin... 1. Organic compounds abound with isomers. In fact that is one of the reasonsorganic chemistry is a different world that inorganic. But the two worlds docross over. Take the example of urea and ammonium cyanate. Both have theempirical formula of N2H4OC, or NH4OCN for ammonium cyanate andH2NCONH2 for urea. The two amino groups on the urea molecule identify itsrelation to the life process though urea is a waste product at the end of the organicline. Nevertheless, when W\u00f6hler synthesized urea by heating ammonium cyanatein 1828 it was quite a sensation in the chemical world. Until that time the vitalisttheory of organic chemistry insisted that organic compounds could not be createdfrom inorganic compounds, that the creation of organic substances required a vitallife force. It became apparent with W\u00f6hler's experiment that this was not thecase.2. This can be shown by considering how a volume that contains one atom ofnitrogen combines with three equal volumes that contain one hydrogen each toform one molecule of ammonia. Fine: this is in accord with the law of volumes.The law of volumes also tells us that if one increases the number of atoms equallyone will increase the volumes equally and the product, ammonia, will increaseaccordingly, thus preserving the original ratios. Following this reasoning leadsus to the conclusion that equal volumes of gases have equal numbers ofatoms/molecules. Then we can slip in the diatomic part to explain the twovolumes found by Gay Lussac. In this way we see how simple and yetperceptive was Avogadro's explanation.Later, in the twelfth grade, a study of Avogadro's hypothesis leads to theintroduction to the concept of atomic and molecular weight and molar volume.This offers an occasion to introduce Avogadro's number. Originally, Avogadro'snumber was the number of diatomic molecules in one gram molecular weight of agas. But it also applies to the number of atoms or molecules in any substancethat is composed of discrete atoms or molecules. (By definition an ioniccompound does not have single discrete molecules since they are held together bya single field of energy and thus, in the usual way of speaking, representcollections of oppositely charged ions.) So derived? number was originally determined byelectrochemistry. The idea is this: if the ratio between electrons depositing silver62on a plate and the exact weight of silver on the plate can be determined, we candetermine how many atoms of silver make up that exact weight. That is becausein a solution of, say, silver nitrate, AgNO3, it takes exactly one electron to depositone silver atom. We can write the equation for the plating reaction as follows:Ag+ + 1e- _ AgoWith the proper apparatus to measure the current (electrons) and amount of silverdeposited it was determined that one gram atomic weight of silver (108 g)contains 6.02 x 1023 atoms of silver. By definition of gram atomic weight this ofcourse means that one gram atomic weight of any element has 6.02 x 1023 atoms.In the case of gases, however, because they are made of diatomic molecules, wespeak of gram molecular weight and gram molecular volumes, or molar volume.And we discover that a gram molecular weight or one molar volume of any gasoccupies 22.4 liters and contains 6.02 x 1023 diatomic molecules.3. The charts for Newlands table of the elements and Meyer and Mendelyev'speriodic tables were taken from A Hundred Years of Chemistry, pp. 50-53.4. Speaking warmly about a lecture given by Eugene Kolisko on the periodic tableand why it was arranged in octaves, Steiner goes on to discuss how matter ispermeated with music. (See Warmth Course, Chapter XIV, p. 108.)5. James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879) laid the foundation for the wave theory ofelectromagnetic radiation. With what became known as Maxwell's equations hecalculated the speed of propagation of an electromagnetic wave and discoveredthat it was the same speed as the speed of light. This led to the conclusion thatlight was of the same nature as an electromagnetic wave. Some questions stillremain regarding this however. For example, why are transparent bodiesgenerally nonconductors of electricity? And why do polarizing crystals polarizelight but not an electric current? And last but not least, why is light nonpolar butelectricity polar? These are questions to ask your physics teacher!6. Spiritual Science, Electricity and Michael Faraday, p. 25 This holistic view willbecome the central theme of the last chapter, \"Where It's All Going.\" Faraday'sway of seeing with his \"mind's eye\" is the same as Goethe's archetypal vision. Ineither case the mind has developed a sense for seeing how harmonic relationshipsinteract to form a collective whole. Stay tuned.63And the Violin Plays On...In 1859, one year before the Karlsruhe Conference tackled some of science'smost pressing problems and decided on the metric system as the international system ofweights and measure, Charles Darwin published his epoch making work, The Origin ofSpecies by Means of Natural Selection. Regardless what one thought of natural selectionas a mechanical model of evolution, the idea of evolution was \"in the air\" and became thebanner cry of the day. Evolution was another of those ideas that was ready to hit the everfaster tracks of life. Indeed, Darwin had to rush his ideas into print before Alfred RussellWallace beat him to the punch with a similar theory. Along with the ever-evolving paceof things, progress became synonymous with survival of the fittest, though Darwinhimself didn't coin the catchy phrase. In a mood of mind where the sun never sat,Herbert Spencer's philosophy of social Darwinism1 spread a doctrine of survival of thefittest to justify the expansionist and opportunistic attitude of the English empire. Themodern technological age, which arguably began in 1784 with James Watt's invention ofthe steam engine, was by now going full steam ahead with a full fledged IndustrialRevolution fueled by such raw materials as distant colonies and rich beds of English coal.And while the beds of the poor became thinner and the deeds of the rich became poorer,the breath of change was hardly limited to the smog-thickened air of London. All ofEurope had caught the evolution fever and increasingly science was seen as the harbingerof a new species of human being, homo technophilius, or technology loving man.Though it was some time before the members of this new evolutionary stream would beseen walking down the street with cell phones growing from the sides of their heads theseeds were being planted for the latest step in the ongoing evolution of the species. Did Isay ongoing? Well, maybe. To date the human genome has not revealed a cell phonegene. Yet, genes or no jeans, one thing is certain: social selection has long agooutstripped natural selection; the mind has left the naked gene\u2014and the nakedape\u2014behind. Social Darwinism has passed the way of the dinosaurs. Or, it has mutatedinto yet another monster called social indifference. But monsters aside, the attempt to getbeyond the mechanical model has created a need for greater vision. At the very least,with the Periodic Table, the cogs seem tuned to a greater rhythm. The elements seemconnected to a greater whole. Beyond the cell as beyond the cave, the phones areringing......and we pick up the receiver and a melodious voice at the other end informs methat there really is music in the way Mendelyev based his Periodic Table primarily on amarriage between physics and chemistry. And the voice goes on to assure me that atomicweights, the backbone of his table, are physical phenomena; they are as non-chemical ascomparing the weights of two bags of sand. And before I can get the beat of that one themelodious voice adds that chemistry has always been the science of how substances64create new substances when a chemical reaction occurs to create new relationships...aha!So that's what she's getting at...new relationships...and my mind drifts to that wonderfuldream-vision in the Fifth Day of the Alchemical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutzwhere Venus is revealed in all her naked glory on a couch just waiting for somebody towake her up2...but before I get to that part the melodious reminds me where I am at theother end of the phone and the next thing I know we're talking about marriage! Wow!Is this chemistry or what? On one end of the line I get this alchemical message thatrelationships\u2014the kind that really connect, the kind that, you know, make thingshappen\u2014those relationships...that's what it takes to make chemistry happen on this endof our conversation. Yes, and about this marriage thing...and here the melodious voiceturns really smooth and adds that, \"Yes, you must know darling that we're speaking ofhow the marriage of the physical and chemical and the successful descriptions it providedfor as yet unknown elements really slipped the ring on the periodic finger.\" But before Icould comment on this being a rather strange romance I really did have to admit how theconnections fit, how there was a real need for a marriage like this, how it might havebeen made in heaven... And I stood ready to admit that physics and chemistry weremeant to be together, though each was different, and I understood why the French say,\"vive la difference!\" But I knew that the marriage would see some rocky times (thecourse of true love never being smooth) and was going to need a lot of music to see itthrough. I knew that because from now on, the relationship between physical propertiesand chemical properties will become ever closer. But organic chemistry, chemistry thatis truly organic, would always be in a class apart. And yet connected in intimate ways...And the voice at the other end of the line, the melodious voice that spoke so true, gave along sigh and before I could ask for her number, said good-bye.I should have known; such things are beyond number and measure. Such thingsbelong to the imponderables of science that never make it to the chemical formula. But Iknew I could never forget the caller with the melodious voice, could never forget themusic that makes the connections that really tie the knot... And then my thoughtsbegan to float a bit and I began to wonder about that young Polish girl who caught theeye of Mendelyev. Perhaps it was the seriousness with which she went about her routinechores in a chemistry lab, perhaps it was some intuitive hunch of an older and moreinsightful mind, but if the story of Mendelyev seeing for her a promising life in chemistryis correct, it did indeed prove prophetic. Marja Sklodowska (1867-1834) did choosechemistry for her career. And as a chemist, she would cross new frontiers of physics.She was to become Madame Curie and the discoverer of radium as she and her husbandPierre turned to a labor of love...A touch of romance? Why not... What else but love or insanity would drive ayoung couple to spend the formative years of their relationship sweating over a pile ofpitchblende in search of an elusive element that exposed photographic plates throughlayers of dark paper? But let's not get ahead of our story...Pitchblende, a name for a certain uranium ore from Austria, had revealed itsstrange power to the French scientist Antoine Henri Becquerel (1832-1908) quite byaccident. He had covered some unexposed photographic plates with black paper in adarkroom and had casually placed a rock of pitchblende on the paper to hold it in place.Much was his surprise he came back later to discover that the plates were exposeddirectly beneath the rock. The French equivalent to \"weird\" is the word bizarre and65bizarre it certainly was. To rule out some freak accident, he tried the same experimentwith different kinds of uranium ore with similar results. There could be no doubt aboutit. Becquerel thought he had found the strange X-rays discovered by Wilhelm KonradRoentgen in 1896. Only instead of being produced by a vacuum tube, the rays seemed toemanate from a piece of uranium ore to penetrate the dark walls of matter with an unseenlight of their own. But there was a catch: pitchblende did a far better job of developingthe covered plates than the other uranium ores he tried. There seemed little doubt: someother element besides uranium must be responsible for the extra power of this enigmaticstone.Here was science waiting to happen. But nothing happens simply because ithappens\u2014nothing is that simple. This time science happened where young Marja\u2014shequickly changed he name to the more Franco-friendly Marie\u2014was working inBecquerel's lab in Paris, at the Sorbonne. But the trip to Paris had not been a free ticket.True, she came from a good family with scientific credentials\u2014her father, Dr.Sklodowska, was head of the science department at the secondary school where Mariehad first shown an interest in chemistry\u2014but nothing is certain, least of all in Polandwhich was literally under Russian occupation at the time. It was a brutal period.Occupation is never the way to go; occupation Cossack style is very close to rape pillageand burn. For these reasons young Marja's decision to leave Poland were not entirelyscientific. A long history of having Russia as a neighbor had made freedom a sacredword in Poland and it seems that she had joined a group of young revolutionaries.Perhaps it was her father that convinced her that other options could be more fruitful, apoint with which she evidently concurred though the option she chose, to study science,was impossible in Poland which denied higher education to women. After six years ofwork as a governess to save money for going to school outside of Poland she goes toKrakow, which belonged to Austria at the time. She attempted to enroll in the scienceprogram at the university but the secretary at admissions laughed at her. Women werenot meant to be scientists; it was biologically incorrect. She was told to take cookingclasses instead. And that was the lesson that sent her packing for Paris where freedom,the freedom that once rang the bells of revolution, still retained a melodious ring.France was also a practical choice. Marja had learned French in Poland and shehad a sister who practiced medicine in Paris. With a place to live and a life to live for,the young \u00e9migr\u00e9 began her studies in physics and mathematics with a will to overcomewhatever stood in her way. Revolutionary zeal melted into the iron determination.Finding the distance from her sister's house to the Sorbonne too great, she moved to thecheapest quarter she could find next to the Sorbonne. Living on a budget of 100 francs amonth, she spent the little money she had on her education and her room and ate as littleas possible, living on high energy chocolate when she could afford it. Coal for her smallstove was a luxury she could do without, even in the cold months of winter. Occasionallyfainting from hunger, she was nevertheless able to pull through. Call it guts, call itfortitude intestionale, call it what you want but she had what she needed. At the end ofher strength, she took first place in her master's examination in physics. And went hometo Poland to recuperate.Returning to the Sorbonne the next fall with a modest scholarship, she took up herstudies in the laboratory of Becquerel who accepted the Polish girl on the strength offamily background and work she had already done in the university. And...like66Mendelyev, the older man had taken a liking to the serious young mind that met his gaze.He had just the job for Marie. He set her to solving problems concerning the magneticproperties of metals in solution. Pierre Curie, discoverer of piezo electricity\u2014theelectricity caused when certain crystals are subjected to pressure\u2014was also working inthe lab.3 She felt drawn to this serious young man who could work for hours with thecrystals he was studying for his doctor's thesis. And they might have heard that samemelodious voice, the one that somehow prompted those visions of Venus on her couch...But of course we will never know precisely; such things must join the imponderables ofthe chemistry wedded to physics. All we know is that they were married in 1895.They were an unusual couple\u2014and prepared for an unusual honeymoon.Becquerel recognized in the young couple just the team he needed to take on thechallenges of the hard work necessary to isolate the unknown element that lay hidden inthe bizarre uranium ore. At sixty-five, he was too old to do it himself. He was moresuitably at the age to offer a guiding hand. Marie was quick to take it and herenthusiasm probably convinced Pierre to choose the more adventurous route to adoctorate. It was to be her route to a doctorate as well if the obstacle of getting enoughpitchblende could be overcome. The ore was very expensive. Fortunately, the emperorof Austria heard of the effort and prompted the Joachimsthal mine in Bavaria to part witha ton of pitchblende residue, the part left over after the uranium had been extracted, andsend it to the Sorbonne.4 A quaint gift indeed from a king to a lady but all the better forboth sides of the bargain\u2014the Curies didn't want the uranium anyway. They were afterthe mysterious element(s) that caused the ore to emit an even more powerful radiation.News of the new research had gotten around in other circles as well. Mendelyev, whoalways kept abreast of the latest goings on in science, got wind of what his young prot\u00e9g\u00e9was up to and sent word that according to his Periodic Table there was indeed room for anew element in the alkali earth family below barium. This could be the one the Currieswere looking for. The search was on.The year was 1896. The place was an unheated shed with a leaky roof that hadformerly been used as a dissecting room. The task literally amounted to a mountain ofhard labor. Or perhaps blind labor might be more to the point. Without knowing theproperties of the elements they were looking for or even the kinds of compounds theymade (sulfates, oxides, etc.) all methods of extraction had to be tried. This meantleaching out all soluble salts\u2014especially chlorides\u2014and treating it with variouschemicals to break down what resisted the water, the acid and the endless toil. Insolublesulfides were a prime target5 and finally yielded the prize. To get them solutions had tobe treated with hydrogen sulfide, a gas that makes rotten eggs smell like rotten eggs.Then, when one batch was purified and the desired crystals obtained, it was tested forradioactive content. This was done by placing the suspected specimen between metalplates of a condenser. Because a radioactive material electrifies the air and turns it into aconductor of electricity, the amount of radioactivity could be measured by passing acurrent across the plates and measuring the voltage. After much coaxing, the seeminglyendless hours and days and weeks and months of work finally isolated a metallicsubstance that proved to be a new element which Marie named polonium. It was a hardcall; the atomic weight of the new element (209) was nearly the same as bismuth(208.98). But the chemical properties differed\u2014the chloride of polonium was heavierthan that of bismuth and the density of the metal, when finally isolated, was slightly67lower. Now work began in earnest\u2014as if it had only been play before\u2014in the attempt toextract yet another element. It was clear that polonium was not sufficiently strong toexplain the radioactive power of the ore. And there was the indication given byMendelyev that a new alkali earth metal was waiting to be found... Finally, a year later,she was able to look upon the chloride of the element she and Pierre had beenseeking\u2014an element so powerfully radioactive that one ton of it would keep a 100,000tons of water boiling for a year. In the meantime, domestic life and the joys of marriagehad not been neglected. Two children and two new elements later she and Pierre wouldshare the 1903 Nobel Prize in physics with Becquerel. The two had coaxed the elementpolonium, named after Marie's beloved homeland, and the elusive and most powerfullyradioactive element of all, radium, from the ton of ore. Radium was so powerful it wasmore than just dangerous to handle. Pierre had his hand so severely burned fromdemonstrating it while doing experiments in England that he could not hold his knife andfork at dinner. Becquerel suffered a bad burn on his stomach from carrying a very smallvial of radium chloride in his vest pocket when going to England to demonstrate the newelement to the Royal Society. Like fire from the gods, it demanded that it be handledwith respect.Then, while at the pinnacle of success and happiness, disaster struck. In 1906,only three years after receiving the Nobel Prize, Pierre was struck down by a cab as hewas crossing a street. A heavy van from the other direction ran over his head; he diedinstantly. Stunned by the loss, Marie now had to live for both herself and her husband.She devoted herself to carrying on the work she and Pierre had shared with suchdevotion. Against all tradition, she was given the professorship position held by Pierre.She picked up where he had left off\u2014with a lecture on the new element polonium. Butmuch work needed to be done in the lab as well. The element radium had yet to beseparated from its chloride and tested to see if indeed it was the alkali earth metalMendelyev had predicted. At long last, in 1910, she passed an electric current throughthe molten salt and watched the negative mercury electrode. Yes, sure enough, anamalgam was being formed. She collected the mercury alloy and heated it in a silica tubefilled with nitrogen under reduced pressure. The mercury boiled off, leaving behind thelong sought pure radium. For this work she won the 1911 Nobel Prize in chemistry.The work of Marie Curie was to be as seminal in its own way as the work of thepneumatic chemists, Priestley, Cavendish and Lavoisier so many years before. Just asthese pioneers had proven that the air we breathe and the water we drink was not whatthey were once thought to have been, so the Curies proved that matter itself was not thesolid stable stuff it was once thought to have been. There was some force, some secretfire, within matter itself that was revealed in elements like uranium, polonium and aboveall in radium. Did all matter contain this fire? If so, then why did only a few elementsreveal it while others remained silent and cold? And what of the X-rays discovered byRoentgen? Where did they fit in with this fire?Some years before Roentgen's history making discovery, Sir William Crookeshad coined the term \"radiant matter\" to describe the strange radiations that were given offby vacuum tubes when an electric discharge passed through them. Known as cathode raytubes, they gave off a ghostly light that would later lead Roentgen to the discovery of x-rays and the pictures of the human skeletons that became a worldwide sensation. Thougha famous scientist and discoverer of the element thallium, Crookes went the other68direction; instead of bones he looked for a more ethereal revelation. Caught up in thespiritualism that was sweeping Victorian England, he sought in the strange emanations adoorway to the spirit and a possible way to contact his deceased brother. Today wemight smile at such a na\u00efve notion. As Berthelot had foreseen, the modern, rationalmind has no place for such intimations of the supernatural. In our rush to have all theanswers we forget that wonder\u2014even the wonder caused by so-called ignorance\u2014is theherald of discovery. For Crookes, however, such considerations simply meant keepingthe doors open. While keeping alive a belief in psychic phenomena he went on toanalyze the cathode ray emanations. He was convinced that their \"fourth state of matter\"was particulate in nature. He very pointedly referred to the \"projected molecules\" in thetubes. He concluded one lecture with the prophecy that his tubes would \"reveal tophysical science a new world.\" 6The one to discover this \"new world\" was J. J. Thomson. It is hard to understandthe magnitude of Thomson's work unless we realize that prior to his experiments with thenature of cathode emissions the atom was still considered to be the \"hard, impenetrable,movable particles\" so described by Isaac Newton over two hundred years ago. Thomson,however, was mindful of the work of Michael Faraday. In 1834 this discoverer of themagnetic field had written a paper on the equivalents of electrochemical decompositions.In it he noted that the amount of electricity required to break down a given quantity ofwater by electrolysis equaled the amount given off when this same quantity of water wasdecomposed by chemical means (say, by sulfuric acid). Whatever this energy was, itacted the same in both electrical and chemical reactions that left the reactants essentiallythe same. This energy could come and go, but hydrogen remained hydrogen and oxygenremained oxygen. And yet the energy belonged to each. In the first case (electrolysis) itseparated the two elements; in the second (as with an acid) it was given off when theywere separated by chemical means. In either case the energy could be measured (injoules, the unit of energy). Faraday concluded that this energy could only come from the\"grains\" of water themselves. This could only be true, he reasoned, if there was someindivisible and minimal unit of energy/charge shared by these molecules that was takenand given equally. There was even more to the atom than didn't meet the eye.Faraday went on to estimate the ratio of hydrogen's mass to this charge, e, anddiscovered the M/e = 10_4 or M/e = 1/10,000. \"What an enormous amount of energy,\"he wrote, \"is required for the decomposition of a single grain of water!\" But what wasthis charge? Did it have mass? Was it, like Crookes thought, some kind of particle? Orwas it ethereal\u2014a mere wave of energy somehow connected to an atom? Faraday did nothave the tools at his disposal to answer such questions.Thomson felt there was a connection between the mysterious glow in the cathoderay tube and the Faraday's grains of charge. Like Crookes, he suspected that the tubecontained \"projected molecules\" of energy. Only instead of psychic phenomena,Thomson saw in these strange emanations a more universal truth. As Thomson ponderedover the nature of whatever caused the cathode rays or the enigmatic fourth state ofmatter, the answer seemed to point again and again to some aspect of matter that wascommon to all substance. Like Faraday, he saw the same energy whether it belonged to ahydrogen atom or an oxygen atom. From Berzelius and others he also had the wholetradition of electrochemistry to suggest that atoms in general were charged. And thenthere was Arrhenius and his ions... With all of this in mind, Thomson took the logical69course and decided that whatever the cathode discharge was, it must be part of all atoms,a property of all matter. And to find out what it was, he knew he had to allow for bothenergy and mass considerations and treat the beam as though it were composed ofparticles, or corpuscles of both energy and mass. The next step took him to the lab wherethe apparatus was simple but ingenious.In order to create an experiment that would allow him to determine the nature ofthe electric emission that glowed across the cathode tube, Thomson designed the tube sohe could investigate the effects of both electric and magnetic fields on the discharge. Thecathode (labeled as C on diagram) would send a concentrated discharge over the plates Dand E, which could be charged to deflect the beam. This deflection would be carefullymeasured as it caused a spot of light to move on the phosphorescent area at the bulb endof the tube. The magnets, which would be placed on either side so that the direction offield would be perpendicular to that of the electric field, are not shown. Thomson's cathode tube: The rays from the cathode C pass through a slit in the anode A,which is a metal plug fitting tightly into the tube and connected with a ground. Afterpassing through a second slit in another grounded metal plug B, they travel between twoparallel aluminum plates, D and E. They then fall at the end of the tube where they createa well defined patch of phosphorescence.7The electric field between the two plates would indicate both the magnitude of thebeam's charge and whether it were negative or positive. If plate E, for example, werepositive and plate D negative, this would deflect the electric beam down if it werenegative up if positive. The amount of deflection would depend on the amount of chargeon an electric particle. As the voltage across the two plates would be known, and theamount of deflection could be measured, this would lead to a way to measure the chargeon the electric particle relative to its mass. Don't forget. If the particle has mass it alsohad momentum. This too affects how much it bends. The result of these two factorsgives a ratio of mass to charge that Thomson calculated to be 10-7 or a thousand times lessthan the amount Faraday had found for the ratio of the charge to a hydrogen atom. Thismeant that either the mass of an electron (as the particles were later to called) was verysmall or the charge very large or something in between. It would be later confirmed that70the mass of an electron is 1/1700 the mass of a hydrogen atom. And it had a negativecharge.8When he had successfully determined the value for m/e with the implications thatthe likely mass of an electron was very small, Thomson was quick to put forth the ideathat the \"corpuscles\" of cathode rays were a universal constituent of all matter. He writesthatThe explanation which seems to me to account in the most simple andstraightforward manner for the facts is founded on a view of the constitution ofthe chemical elements which has been favourably entertained by many chemists:this view is that the atoms of the different chemical elements are differentaggregations of atoms of the same kind. In the form in which this hypothesis wasenunciated by Prout, the atoms of the different elements were hydrogen atoms; inhis precise form the hypothesis is not tenable, but if we substitute for hydrogensome unknown primordial substance x, there is nothing known which isinconsistent with this hypothesis...9Prout was not alone: Crookes had also used the word protyle to designate this universalsubstance. But neither Prout nor Crookes were able to isolate a likely candidate as anexperimental fact. Thomson's work made the concept of a protyle scientifically tenable.Parmenides, here we come.It's not quite back to the future yet; but we are on our way. The next major steptoward discovering the constitution of matter was to be taken by a student of Thomson,Ernest Rutherford (1871-1937). Rutherford, a native of New Zealand, had come toLondon in 1895 just as the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge where Thomson madehis momentous discovery opened its doors to accept research students from otheruniversities. This allowed Thomson to welcome the aspiring young man to be a memberof the university. Rutherford joined Thomson in studying the ionization of the airproduced by X-rays. When X-rays would pass through the air, they would cause the airto become positively charged as though they had torn something away from the atoms ofoxygen and nitrogen. Thomson thought rightly that the powerful X-rays were strippingaway electrons, leaving behind the positively charged whatever that remained. This andsubsequent work would result in his \"plum pudding\" model of the atom that stated thatelectrons were stuck in an atom in a way that resembled cloves stuck into a plumpudding. The X-rays would simply knock the electrons, leaving the positive \"plumpudding\" behind. Some found this rather amusing and Thomson himself probably sawthe humor in atoms having an English flavor. After all, England did lay claim to aconsiderable portion of the world in those days. Why not claim atoms as well?However that may be, Thomson was well known for his playful spirit. As for Rutherford,playful or not, the nature of the pudding remained a question to be pursued.But first a little history. Because Rutherford's effort to get to the \"plum\" of thematter parallels the work of Thomson, we need to see where the plum starts and whereelectrons end. Experimental work pertinent to Rutherford's research on the atom beganwhen Norman Lockyer discovered mysterious gas in the sun's corona in 1868. He madethis discovery with a spectrometer when he found a spectrum line unknown to any earthlyelement. With this he concluded that he had indeed discovered a new element which he71named, appropriately enough, helium, after Helios, the Greek god of the sun. In 1895the Scottish chemist William Ramsey (1852-1916), famous for discovering the noblegases argon, krypton, xenon and neon, takes up the study of an unknown gas given off bythe uranium rich ore, cleavite. He was able to show that this gas has the same spectrumlines as the gas Lockyer discovered.10 (But it is important to remember that this is a gasgiven off by a radioactive element.) In 1910 he would also discover the radioactivenoble gas, radon, given off by radium. The plot thickens. In 1899 Rutherford, workingwith uranium, discovers two kinds of radiation given off, one with high penetratingpower that goes through several thin sheets of aluminum and one with low that is easilyblocked. He reasons that both emanations must have mass, otherwise they wouldn't beblocked at all. The one with the least penetrating power, having the greatest mass, hecalls the alpha particle (_-particle) and the one with the greatest penetrating power hecalls the beta particle (_-particle). To really prove they have mass, he tests them in amagnetic field and yes indeed, they are deflected. One goes the positive way (_-particle)and one goes the negative way (_-particle). Putting two and two together at this pointisn't hard. Ramsay finds helium around uranium; Rutherford finds _-particlearound uranium...could there be a connection here? Rutherford suspects there is andgoes on record as stating that the _-particles are indeed related to the helium atomsRamsay found. But of course, suspicions don't amount to much without proof. Finally,in 1908, Rutherford gets the chance to perform the experiment that connects the _-particle to helium. He puts some radium emanation (radon) in a thin walled tube. Thewalls are so thin they will allow _-particles to go through them but not diatomic helium.The thin walled tube is then placed inside a tube with thicker walls to collect the _-particles given off. These he tests with an electric discharge and sure enough, he gets thespectrum lines of helium. The next step was to determine the mass of the _-particle.Once the charge was determined to be twice that of a hydrogen ion, and the ratio ofcharge to mass was found to be 1:2, it was seen that the mass had to be four times that ofhydrogen. That put the plum in the pudding. The _-particle was found to have the samee/m as an electron.11 All of this neatly steps over the years between 1898 and 1907 when Rutherfordwas professor of physics at McGill University in Montreal. While there the other half ofthe puzzle, the half that treats what happens to the atom when it loses an _ or _ particle,or both, was taken up. With the help of the chemist Frederick Soddy, Rutherfordconducted a series of experiments that examined the radioactive properties of variouselements, including the radium of Marie and Pierre Curie. From these studies he was todiscover that all radioactive elements have what he termed a \"half-life\" or a definiteperiod of time in which the element loses one half of its radioactivity. The half-life couldbe a matter of minutes, days or years. For uranium the half-life is 4.5 \u00d7 109 years and forplutonium, 24,400 years. Einsteinium, an artificially created element, has a half-life of276 days and Lawrencium, another artificial element, a half-life of 8 seconds. Radium'shalf-life is a short 1620 years, a fact that would account for its being so rare. Half-lives,however, remarkable as they may seem, were not the most astounding part ofRutherford's discoveries. When a substance decayed, it turned into a completelydifferent substance with different atomic weight and different chemical properties. Whennaturally occurring, radioactive decay begins with uranium. Uranium (U238) loses an _-particle (atomic wt. = 4) to make an isotope of thorium (Th234). Then other changes10 not72understood at the time lead us to actinium and radium. When radium (atomic wt. = 226)gives off an _-particle it turns into the radioactive gas radon (atomic wt. = 222). Now wefind that actinium, polonium and bismuth all have radioactive isotopes with an atomicweight of 210. This indicates the loss of four _-particles.12 Then the last step in the decayprocess brings us to the stable lead isotope, Pb206. More research will fill out picture andexplain intermediary steps (such as the decay of thorium to produce protactinium) but fornow it was clear that the loss of _-particles largely determined radioactive decay. Herewas something close to the alchemist's dream: a true transmutation of substance. HadRutherford found the Philosopher's Stone?Well, that depends on how you see it. Some might say the _-particle was at thevery least a close second. Alpha particles not only became known as Rutherford's petbut they became a runner up for the primordial substance award. They were lookingmore and more like the building block of matter. Very curious how many isotopes of theelements seemed to vary by units of four... Meanwhile, with the jury still out on thatone, Rutherford trained his pet to perform its most sensational feat yet. It had beenobserved that when a narrow beam of _-particles passed through a thin sheet of substancethe beam becomes diffused. The thicker the sheet the more the diffusion. This scatteringwas attributed to the atoms of the target material as they deflected the alpha beam. Onething led to another as the alpha beam continued to bombard different targets. Thenhistory happened. The alpha beam actually bounced back from the target\u2014an actualrecoil from a head-on or nearly head-on collision! Rutherford's comment was that thiswas like firing a 15 inch projectile at a piece of tissue paper and having it come back atyou. Further experiment confirmed, by increasing the thickness of the foil, that anincrease in backwards scattering would result. This proved beyond all doubt that theparticles that had penetrated the target were being turned back. For Rutherford, whoknew the tremendous energy of the alpha particle, a very massive projectile by atomicstandards moving at 10,000 miles a second, this was a phenomenal event in the highestorder.Two conclusions were forthcoming. One, that the atom was largely empty spacethat would allow the penetration of the alpha beam. Two, that the atom itself must have avery massive core that was capable of reversing the energetic bombardment of the alphaparticle. Both of these conclusions were formulated in Rutherford's model of the atom.Though at first he was not certain if the nucleus was positive or negative (in fact, heoriginally opted for the latter), he was certain that the atom must be the seat of an intenseelectric field in order to produce such a large deflection at a single encounter. Later, thepositive charge of the nucleus was established and Rutherford's planetary model of theatom emerges with a positively charged nucleus and a swirl of electrons outside it. Thepositive charged particle that helped make the nucleus so massive was called the proton.Because it was found that each hydrogen atom had one proton in its nucleus, the weightof the proton was established as one. You might say, wait a minute\u2014isn't that the sameweight as a hydrogen atom? Yes, it is. But a hydrogen atom turns out to have a protonfor a nucleus with one electron orbiting around it. Because the electron weighs so little(1/1700 the mass of a proton) the proton is verry verrrry close to having the the samerelative weight of the hydrogen atom. Together, the proton and electron, for all practical(and atomic) purposes, could be said to have the weight of one. But this picture was notcomplete. Rutherford was never able to explain why the atomic nuclei of helium and73other elements weighed more than the number of positive particles or protons theycontained. A piece of the puzzle was still missing.The missing piece was to be found, fittingly enough, by one of Rutherford'sstudents, James Chadwick. By 1920, Rutherford had become so certain that some neutralparticle had to exist that, typical for him, he began to speak of them as though theyalready existed. He coined the word neutron and started a search for their existence. Itwasn't until 1932, however, that Chadwick, when investigating the bombardment ofberyllium with alpha particles, noticed strange rays given off from the target after thebombardment. To test these rays he directed them at a nitrogen target and measured theamount of recoil of the target nuclei. To his surprise, the calculations confirmed theprescience of his former teacher and the neutron was born. It was found that the neutronwas a proton (+1) and electron (-1) combined so that the positive and negative chargesneutralized each other. Because the electron is so light (1/1700 of a hydrogen atom), theneutron was also given the atomic mass of one.13The neutron, composed of an electron and a proton, is a kind of collapsed form ofthe proton/electron polarity we also find in the hydrogen atom. Being the simplestelement, the nucleus of hydrogen is simply a proton with a 1+ charge. To balance off thispositive charge, the hydrogen nucleus has one electron(1_) orbiting around it. Helium,however, contains both protons and neutrons in its nucleus. It has two protons and twoneutrons, giving the nucleus a net 2+ charge, balanced off by two orbiting electrons. Soonit was found that the atomic nuclei of all the elements were made of protons and neutronswith enough electrons in the outer orbits to balance off the positive protons in the nuclei.Together then, the proton and electron, whether they appear as a hydrogen atom or as aneutron, can be said to be the primary constituents of all matter. Above we asked ifhelium might be the fundamental building block of matter. But because helium turns outto have a nucleus made of the protons and neutrons, we can see that the proton/electronpair win as candidates for Prout's protyle (proto hyle) or fundamental particle. True, laterresearch will reveal even more fundamental parts of the atom, but this is pure physics.As far as chemistry is concerned, hydrogen keeps its primordial rank. According topresent theory, stellar fusion causes hydrogen and other elements to combine in a processthat forms the other elements. Bringing this cosmic fire down to earth, hydrogen alsorecalls the phlogiston of Cavendish and by dint of our new findings, the universal fire ofHeraclitus. Remember that Chinese jar T. S. Eliot was so fond of? And how it's hard tofind where all this ends and begins?While we are meditating on how the beginning is always here, or there, oranywhere and how the \"end precedes the beginning\" we might also consider Einstein'sequation E = mc2 which translates to say that energy equals mass times the speed of light(in centimeters per second) squared. The point is not just that a little mass amounts to alot of energy. With this in mind, Werner Heisenberg, noted among other things, for hiscontributions to quantum physics, also notes in his physics and Philosophy that \"energy\"is to modern physics what fire was to Heraclitus. He allows that for Heraclitus fire wasnot an abstraction; like energy that expresses itself in particle and wave or in an endlessarray of organic systems, it too was a universal that expressed itself in all conditions ofexistence in different ways. It was what caused the dynamics of \"strife\" between allbodies and emotions. It was also what caused the life of the mind to respond to anoutward flame with a force of its own. It had more forms than Proteus as it lived in a74world that was at once one and many. The fire of Heraclitus was both Being andBecoming; it was imperishable change that renovates the world. Acknowledging this,Heisenberg states that \"we may remark...that modern physics is in some way extremelynear to the doctrines of Heraclitus. If we replace the world \"fire\" by the word \"energy\"we can almost repeat his statements word for word from our modern point of view.\"15He also notes the step toward materialism take by Empedocles whose polarities becamefixed principles. And then the fire became the deterministic atomism of Leucippus andDemocritus. No matter how we turn the jar it seems that the world of energy comes inendless patterns. But one thing we can note as a change, modern science has harnessedenergy to the plow of everyday life in a way the Greeks never dreamed. One effect ofthis is of course to make us complacent as we lazily flip the switch to \"get the thing togo.\" And if it blows up, hopefully it will be on T. V. But another is to think of all thework that got the switch there in the first place. We seldom ponder the pioneering effortsand the years of research that went into creating the electric field that toasts our toast orcooks our scrambled eggs in the morning before we head out of our cave and into theworld... But maybe we should. Maybe we should even throw in a littlephilosophy\u2014even a little primordial fire\u2014to spice up our sometimes scrambled life.Maybe we'll get so we like the sound of violins in the morning...or something similar toget us in tune with the fire that enlightens us before we become toast...1. Herbert Spencer (1820-1903) was the father, along with Walter Bagehot, of socialDarwinism and the person who coined the phrase \"survival of the fittest.\" Hewas a proponent of evolution before Darwin and argued that differences of richand poor were a natural result of superior and inherent moral traits, the richgetting richer because they are better. Because attempts to reform society wouldinterfere with this \"natural\" process of selection, they should be avoided. Freemarket, unrestricted competition and a laissez faire status quo are therefore inaccord with natural selection. Similar states of \"mind\" have appeared throughouthistory to justify imperialist and racist policies in one way or another. But socialDarwinism is unique in the way it claims biological justification for its doctrine ofpower and exploitation.2. The Chemical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz tells of how the protagonist,Christian Rosenkreutz, is initiated into the mysteries of esoteric alchemy. Theallegorical story is divided up into seven days, each day representing a certainstage of initiation. On the fifth day Christian enters an underground chamberafter passing through an underground corridor lined with precious stones. Led byhis guide, who can be seen as representing his ego, Christian discovers a chamberwhere Lady Venus is lying naked on a couch. After this revelation, he reads thatwhen she awakes she will be the mother of kings. Aside from a certain romanticflavor this story lends to the above, it is also significant because the work withradioactivity, led by the Curies and followed by Rutherford, will indeed stripaway the veil from nature to reveal her in the \"nude.\" But placed in the contextof the initiation Christian experiences, this beholding of the nakedness of naturetakes on heightened meaning. In what Venus represents he discovers a universal75play of forces and relationships that nurtured one another in a way that keep thewhole of nature alive. The role of human beings is to wake Venus with theindividual consciousness that brings love to the nature and nurture relationship.Enlightened to the higher meaning of love he perceived the inner relationshipsthat create harmony between man and nature, that create a music of the mind thatunderstands how to connect with the flow of things. This wisdom enablesChristian to undergo certain trials on the last day that enable him to see the truescience that transforms the human spirit and prepares us for a new consciousnessand a new relation to nature. And there is where we are today\u2014at the thresholdof a new relation to nature. After the discoveries of the Curies evolved into anunderstanding of the atom, and after all that has happened since, we find that weare a little like Christian Rosenkreutz and Frank Oppenheimer combined. Andwe are left with a question as to how we will wake Venus. Are we going to standthere before the open veil and ask how we can \"get this thing to go\" or are wegoing to gently wake her so she will respond in an affectionate manner that willgive birth to kings, to a new consciousness that understands how to rule the earthwith loving regard for the whole of nature? The choice is ours. But we mightconsider while making it what Venus might have to say about it when she wakes.After all, we could have a bomb in our hands.3. Pierre Curie (1859-1906) was the son of a physician. Dedicated as a young man,he was home-schooled before entering the Sorbonne where his passion for sciencequickly took root. As a young man of 19 he became the lab assistant of theFacult\u00e9 des Sciences while attending courses. After graduating in four years hewas appointed chief of the laboratory at the School of Physics and Chemistry ofthe city of Paris. There he did the research on piezoelectricity and magnetismthat was to be of great importance to the broadcasting and communicationsindustries. He also published a seminal work on magnetism. (The World of theAtom, pp. 427-8)4. Apparently there was still some uranium in the ore. In their writings on how theyextracted the polonium and radium, the Curies speak of uranium and thoriumremaining in solution. (On a New Radioactive Substance Contained inPitchblende, by Pierre and Marie Curie, Comptes Rendus, 127, p. 176, as citedfrom The World of the Atom, p. 433.)5. The following rough outline of the procedure is taken from On a New RadioactiveSubtance by Pierre and Marie Curie. The directions in the original are not meantto be exact and are here paraphrased with the intention of giving some idea of theanalytical challenges involved. It is hoped that this will also give an approximateidea of the procedure used. Essentially it involved the isolation of the sulfides ofbismuth and of an unknown active substance that proved to be over a hundredtimes more radioactive than uranium. This method was initiated by treatingsolutions with hydrogen sulfide. The sulfides then obtained were then treated with76ammonium sulfide removed the sulfides of arsenic and antimony. Thesulfides insoluble in ammonium sulfide were dissolved in acids to separate out asnitrates or sulfates, in particular lead sulfate. \"The active substance present insolution with bismuth and copper is precipitated completely with ammonia [alongwith bismuth] which separates it from copper (?). Finally the active substanceremains with bismuth.\" And then the admission that \"we have not yet found anyexact procedure of separating the active substance from the bismuth.\" One cansense the calm frustration mixed with determination. And then something of abreakthrough but expressed with the same steady calm. It was discovered thatheating the pitchblende cause the sublimation of \"some very active products.\"The story goes in their own words: \"This observation led us to a separationprocess based on the difference in volatility between the active sulphide andbismuth sulphide. [For this purpose] the sulphides are heated in vacuum to about700\u00b0 in a tube of Bohemian glass. The active sulphide is deposited in the form ofa black coating in those regions of the tube which are at 250\u00b0 to 300\u00b0, while thebismuth sulphide stays in the hotter parts. (On a New Radioactive SubstanceContained in Pitchblende, as cited in World of the Atom, pp. 433-4.)6. Let's do the math on this. From the diagram of the tube above we have the twoplates, D and E and an electron beam between them that is being deflected:The deflection and what determines it is the core of the problem. This deflection,or the angle of deflection would be, for the purposes of the experiment, the sameas the ratio of the velocity, V1, in the direction of the discharge (along the x-axis)and the velocity, V2, in the direction of the electrical field, F. (Actually, the ratioof V2/V1 gives the tan _ but for reasons which will become clear, this can beignored).The velocity, V1, in the direction of discharge is he unknown velocity that will befound at the outcome of the experiment. The velocity in the direction of F, or V2,can be seen to be directly proportional t the intensity of the field, F, the charge, e,and the time, t, between the plates but inversely proportional to the inertial mass,m, of the charged particle. Since this exhausts the variables we have the equality,V2 = F(e/m)t (1)Thomson set the time equal to the length of the plates divided by the velocity, V1:V2 = F(e/m)( l/V1).(2)Since the angle of deflection, _, has been set equal to V2/V1, we have_ = F(e/m)(l/V12)(3)If, instead of an electric intensity a magnetic force, H, acts on the charge particle,we have to allow for the horizontal velocity, V1, to have a direct effect on the77deflection. This is because any charge in motion creates a magnetic field just asthe current in a coil of wire creates an electric magnet. The formula for V2 with amagnetic force, H, thereby becomesV2 = H(e/m)V1t(4)and,V2 = the angle of magnetic deflection, _,_ = H(e/m)(l/V1)(6)Since V1 is the only velocity we now consider it can simply be V. Dividing (6) by(3) we getV = _F/_H(7)and by squaring (6) and dividing it by (3) we solve for m/e:m/e = H2_ _ l / F_2In the actual experiments, Thomson adjusted H so that _ = _. This let theequations becomeV = F/H and m/e = H2l/F_Since all of the values, F, H, l and _ could be found from the apparatus the valuesfor m/e and V could be determined.

It is important to know here that these conclusions were found to apply to any gasand were therefore universal for gases. This is one of the main considerationsthat led to Thomson view that the electron is a universal particle. (World The ofthe Atom, p. 425.)9. Ibid, p. 426.10. Lockyer and equal credit for discovering helium, though Ramsay isgiven credit for isolating it as and earthly element. This makes him the onlyscientist to have discovered an entire period.7811. In the French speaking part of the world credit is generally given to the Frenchscientist, Paul Villard, for discovering gamma rays in 1900 But across theChannel, the ascertainment of their wave lengths by Rutherford and Andrade in1914 quantified their existence and formal credit is generally given to Rutherfordfor being the bona fides English discoverer. He had spoken of them as early as1903 and considered them a part of his atomic \"family\" though not on as intimateof terms as the _-particle. (Rutherford and the Nature of the Atom, p. 69.) Thetext book picture of how the three emanations are affected by a magnet is givenby the following diagram: 12. Changes that produced _-particles were not understood till the discovery of theneutron in 1932.13. With the discovery of the neutron it was understood that _-particles must comefrom neutron decay. Such decay explains how Thorium, for example, transmutesinto protactinium. When thorium-234 decays it shoots off a _-particle, a high-speed electron from the nucleus. To make this happen a neutron decays and splitsinto an electron and a proton. The thorium nucleus has 90 protons. With thedecay of a neutron and the ejection of a _-particle, however, it has one moreproton. This gives it 91 protons and turns it into a new element, protactinium.14. An example of the particulate behavior of energy occurs whenever when take aphotograph using black and white film. Photons of light energy initiate areaction that reduces the silver halides on the film (AgCl and AgBr) to yield freesilver (the dark part of the negative). An example of the wave behavior of energyis in the refracton of light that produces rainbows or in diffraction phenomenasuch as the rainbow colorations of oil slicks in the gutter after the rain falls.Physics and Philosophy: The Revolution in Modern Science, pp. 62-3.79Where It's All GoingSo when all is bread and done, have we gone astray to claim that man doesn't liveby toast alone? Or a plate full of crumbs? Or so many atoms in a bowl of alpha-petsoup? That is, in so many words, what Berthelot was asking in our \"Interlude\" as helamented how the \"entire material universe is claimed by science.\" But he might havedrawn some consolation from the fact that the material universe belongs to nature andnature will not let us be complacent. To keep up, science has to stay on the move.We've seen already how that goes; science never was still\u2014it always was changing.Indeed, it's a little like those moving electrons that generate all those electromagneticfields. In fact we are about to see science generate some new fields of its own. To getthe field of that one, we will be focusing on some recent changes that are causing somerethinking and some reshaping of some old paradigms. Which, of course, is the way itshould be. Thomas Kuhn dubbed such rethinking and resorting of established ideas aparadigm shift in his The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\u2014and it is the purpose of thischapter to give some indications where the shift is shaking. But be forewarned: whenshaking up old ideas one can shake up the people who hold on to them. Some things canhappen that are, well, revolutionary. That might not mean so much to you but for olderfolks (like me) there might be some cherished notions out there\u2014notions that reflect howwe once upon a time read (or misread) the book of nature. Fortunately, nature with hereternal play of process, could care less about that. Which is great if you like beingnatural. It keeps you moving and fit\u2014and ready to adapt. And ready play a bit with thenotion of survival...Meanwhile, the notes of Eliot's violin still play among the many strings andthreads that connect this universe and the struggle to understand it. So if we listen to thestillness of Eliot's Chinese jar, the stillness of a violin while the note lasts...can we hearwhere the song is taking us? Beneath the sometimes noisy weave of patterns, particleand wave, can we still hear the stillness? What's that? A ringing sound? Betchya it'sour friend with the melodious voice calling to see if we made it to the meaning ofscience. Or at least to the end of the course. It is! She laughes\u2014asks if I still like hermarriage plans...yea! To the tune of that? Sure, with that kind of harmony to tie theknot we'll unlock the door to science with a major key! Got it...the beat...the cosmicbeat...star we go, goho! Hey, we'd better watch it. We havereaders here who are trying go figure out what we're so goho about. Sure\u2014it's all rightthere\u2014from Proust's law of constant proportions to Gay Lussac's law of volumesand\u2014you know, maybe it would help if they knew you were having a little party overthere\u2014complete with a chorus of voices doing the acappella with the periodicity of theelements and the predictability of chemical properties...and well...why not? With all80the other bits and pieces of matter, the crumbs of substance have some music inthem...that's no news. That's it...yeah...yeah....oh yeah! With some cookies for Proutand a few pretzels with Crookes in them along with Thomson and Rutherford with theirintimations of primordial substance, and the way the atomic weights frequently vary bysteps of one, two, three or four...we've covered that! Hear all about it: hydrogen and itsfat cousin, helium, the building blocks of matter, yep\u2014yoou've sure got that one right.What's that? A change of tune? Put on something from those rapper guys who keepgoing on about that bunch of sunshine in their eyes\u2014yeah, they're the ones. Ha! OK,if we make it with those fields of life in the shine, sure thing! You know, when youlaugh like that it really makes me wonder...that laugh...sounds like it's got a fancy knotand some secret under the wrapper...what? Ah yeah\u2014right. That's the cool part. Gotit\u2014yeah\u2014the connections... I'm listening... ...the connections between them arewhat really matters, are what really tell us what's more than the matter with matter...Right! Relationships\u2014that's the word. That's what gets the chemistry flowing, whattakes the solo out of the goho and gets to where it's all go... What's that? You want toleave us with a question to help us get there? How Waldorf of you! Yeah, yeah, fireaway. Hey! Whoa! Not so fast. Let me translate in slow words for our reader: Shestarted rapping with her chin on the spin about how we need to sow the flow of the knowwhere the jar's gotta goho so we can begin again with the trend on the mend... OK, Imissed the question part but you'll have to admit I was pretty close...ha! I like that.Sounds like were on the same note to me...don't worry, we're looking out for that one!Yeah? Where the jar is on empty because it's so full? You got it!\" Hey, don't...go...She's gone. And I still didn't get her number! Oh well. What was I saying? Ohyes...\"where it's all going...\" Good question...and come to think on it, what did shemean by that \"jar on empty because it's so full\" bit...Ah, what does it all mean, that is the question... Well, for starters, I think shemeans to ask if we're going to spend the rest of eternity spinning around that Chinese jar.And that's a big one. But we have already answered it at least half way. In our littlestory of chemistry we have put human beings\u2014and above all, ourselves\u2014inside the jar.That was a definite step in the right direction. It centers us in a way that lets us see all ofthe jar rather than just our side of it. It enables us to gain a holistic view of how thewhole thing turns, of how the past relates to the present and even to the future. And thisgives us an indication of where it's all going. See how simple that was?Rinnng! Uh oh, sounds like our melodious caller again. Halloha to you too!We thought it might be you. Thanks. She hates to disillusion us but being simple is notwhere it's at. That's not where it's all going... What? Complexity...yeah, of courseI've heard of it. You don't think I was going to Simple Simon our way out of here...No...no...right! We don't want to follow those Chinese dragons...yeah yeah, the oneswith the theoretical green fire in their eyes and the brown spots on their tail\u2014those arethe ones....uh hum....reducing the story of the world to a flip of the molecular tale...You know that's not what I meant by...simple! All right, we'll look out for thosekind\u2014they can chase their tales till the world spins dry. Right! The safest place toavoid them being in the heart of the jar...right...where the old turn ends and the newbegins...sounds like you've been there! Thanks! Right...where all the pieces turntogether...along with the other still points of the turning world. Gotchya. Give you acall when we get there... She congratulates us for the little bit about the holistic view\u201481put her own tap on the rap about taking the solo from the goho... And chimes off with amelodious hint as to where the next part of our answer might be.Ah! Don't say it! Did it again... Oh well, I guess as long as she has ournumber when we get there... Right now, it's the getting there that counts. And we dothat with a melodious hint...and if it gets complex, well, that's life. Soooo...Ms.Melodious, here we go. Melodious. Sounds like we need to think back again, back tothe energy dance as we science along with the proton and the electron and hit the beat ofthe elemental band and discover resonance. Just don't, with all the musical metaphor,get any ideas that resonance has anything to do with how your vibes jive. Here the wordresonance has to do with a dance of a different color. We can spare ourselves thetechnical definition and paraphrase Linus Pauling, the Nobel winning chemist who cameup with the perception of how it happens. Resonance, as we speak of it here, happenswhen an electron bilocates or even trilocates, and finds itself in two or more places atonce (my words, not Pauling's). Or, to be more exact, it delocalizes and actsexperimentally like its covering a multitude of bases. The important thing is that withresonance we have another example of how electrons are always moving. In fact, if wewant to keep in party mode we might think of resonance as describing a kind of electrondance as electrons do a kind of ring around the molecule.1 But the point is this (and I sayit again): the electrons are moving. And with a little recall, we remember what MichaelFaraday said about moving charges\u2014that they create magnetic fields. Fields. As yourecall, we mentioned fields with regard to the ions of Arrhenius. I won't go over it againbut if you've forgotten it's till back there where we left it\u2014something about ions beinganother pattern in the jar, as I recall. Or rather, another pattern in the field. Anyway, ifwe keep fields of energy in mind it's all a matter of learning to read the patterns on the jarso it's the jar that spins, not our heads. The moral of that tale is this: play the field. Givethe patterns and symbols some room, some space for action at a distance, some spatialswing, and they become dynamic partners in the dance. And as we dance we can re-interpret the terms polar bonding, co-valent bonding, etc. The one holds the jar together,gripped in field of energy, the other enables an organism to create the myriad forms andfunctions that make life a vast web of interacting fields. For as any dragon can tell you,what happens between atoms in any compound, organic or not, represents some sort offield/energy exchange, some sort of giving and receiving of energy that causes theelectron energy\u2014the field energy\u2014that surrounds an atom or molecule to connect inpredictable ways.With people the energy fields connect when two or more individuals are on thesame beat, when they warm up to each other and discover how the quality ofrelationships is no simple affaire. With the molecules it's a little less personal. But youprobably catch the drift\u2014we're getting warmed up to that notion of complexity. Andwith that notion of complexity, to how reactions depend on the nature and the quality ofthe fields that make them happen. So I want to say a few words about quality. If we getspecific about what we mean when we refer to the quality of a substance or substances, ofevents or phenomena, it will help us cover the ground ahead. Now it's rather obviousfrom what we know so far that some substances are more conducive to exchangingenergy than others. We have seen this with regard to various elements (nitrogen,phosphorus, etc.) and compounds (ATP, nucleic acids, proteins, etc.). For now however,to show how complexity can work on a nuts and bolts level, let us consider the titanium82screw. Used in surgery when it is desirable for the metal to bond with bone, the titaniumscrew is a screw of exceptional quality. Stainless steel used to be used for this but itcaused complications due to stress corrosion and cracking. Stainless steel is also subjectto pit corrosion and consequent galvanic effects that make the situation worse, especiallyaround bodily chlorides like common salt. Titanium, on the other hand, has none ofthese defects. The two metals, one an element and one an alloy, have differentproperties, different crystalline structures and different electron configurations. Be thisas it may, it is likely that several properties of titanium are responsible for its uniquerelation to bone growth. These can include density, specific heat, valence, whether it ismagnetic or paramagnetic or a good or poor conductor and so on. It would beinteresting, for example, to experiment with how electric fields affect bone growth anddetermine if titanium somehow contributes to the process in a way that was differentfrom stainless steel.2 As with all organic processes, force fields play a contributing rolein how things grow. But in any case, no experiment can eliminate all other properties ofthe metal and isolate one single property responsible for the unique relation to organicprocess any more than we can eliminate all players on a basketball team but one anddetermine if that one is responsible for winning the game. This is because organicprocess entertains a complex array of reactions (the team) that requires a unique set up(s/he shoots...) that depends on how several proteins (the players) act together inresponse to several metallic properties (the relief players) in a comprehensive manner(that includes the whole team\u2014hey, get that rebound!). This team character of severalproperties working together makes it necessary to use the word quality when referring toan effective relationship that wins a ballgame.3 And so it goes from titanium toteamwork. To go from there to chemistry, consider how the magnesium in chlorophyllgets changed to iron to form a simple hemoglobin\u2014a transition we've discussed onnumerous occasions with regard to how an array of interactions and relationships dependon molecular structure and elemental properties working together. Teamwork scoresagain. Or in the way we use catalysts in the lab to accomplish what enzymes in anorganism achieve with such admirable efficiency. Score again. Then, for someteamwork of really exceptional quality, there's always the great example of rhizobiumbacteria and legumes and how they join forces to form an oxygen carryingleghemoglobin so the nitrogen fixation process can fix nitrogen with oxygen and createnitrates that contribute to the growth of more chlorophyll, proteins, enzymes and DNA.Such symbiotic teamwork gets complex (there's that word again) as it creates an ongoingcycle of mutual dependency. But such relationships are common and show how lifedepends on organisms working together as a whole\u2014and the qualitative nature of lifedetermines how well this works. In fact the more we look for team action in nature themore we seem to find a qualitative array of relationships and properties in full courtpress. It all shows us how the qualitative and the quantitative can express valid aspectsof a process that is fundamentally holistic. Like an energy field. Or like a symphony.Stay tuned.But first a little word form our sponsor. Breath. Never go anyplace without it.Take a deep one. And exhale. Or whistle a little tune. That's it. We take a deep breathand admit that there really is some lively music there. But we can't stop\u2014no, please,whatever you do, don't stop\u2014we really must keep breathing and moving. After all, weare on a quest, no time to rest, you know how it goes. So let's go a little further into the83past to see our way to the future. A little further, back to Priestley's idea of breath and allthat it took to raise Adam from the dust. If we really dust off the past, we even find thatPriestley was not alone in having such a lively regard for breath. Wolfgang von Goethe,whom you perhaps remember from when we studied the archetypal plant in the ninthgrade, also saw breath as something of an archetype. For Goethe, breath was what madethe dynamics of nature possible. In more modern terms, Goethe's \"breath\" was ametaphor for the giving and receiving of energy, for the inhaling, exhaling, expandingand contracting of all that unites us with the in and out stream of co-existing fields andforms. In many ways Goethe reminds us of the archetypal and universal thinking ofGreek philosophers but in other ways he was every inch a modern scientist. He was avery astute observer of natural phenomena and felt that his work in science was hiscrowning achievement, though he was to attain far greater recognition as a man of letters.But this may be changing. It seems that part of the world might be about to catch upwith Goethe. As a thinker and observer he had little use for the analytical mind thatreduced natural phenomena to a mechanistic model. He was concerned with how natureworked as a whole, with how the bones of a body shared a common formative principle,with how the leaves of a plant metamorphosed from a parent form\u2014how the parts relatedto a greater whole. When he observed nature he saw systems of dynamic processinteracting with other systems. Though he didn't quite say it this way, for Goethe naturewas a vast array of interconnected and interdependent relationships. In seeing naturalphenomena this way, he anticipated some modern trends of thinking that are at long lastchallenging some of the old dragons who might be a trifle too fond of their place on thejar\u2014so fond that they cling to some old paradigms and theories without seeing that thejar is turning beneath their claws. So take a little advice from our sponsor. Think ofPriestley and Goethe and all the other denizens of the breathing world. And take a deepbreath. Take quite a few in fact and take some along for the next step of our journey.By going backwards to find some thinking that was many years ahead of its time, we aremaking progress in our quest. The sound of the violin is in our ears...playing some grandold theme that leads us back to where we are...and to where we are going...Nature is as full, it seems, of surprises as we are full of ways to see her. She loveschaos but relies on highly complex systems of intricate relationships in order to keep herorganisms alive. Recent breakthroughs in biochemistry provide a vision of theserelationships and in so doing open windows to some much needed fresh air. So takeanother of those deep Goethean breaths. We have arrived. Take a giga whiff. Smellit? Complexity is in the air. And since this is a book on chemistry, we might as wellstart with what a biochemist has to say about it. Enter Micheal Behe. He has taken avery close look at the biochemistry of life, at what the molecules do in living organisms,and at the complexity of molecular interactions that make life possible. The result ofsuch work done by Behe and numerous others is a new science of complexity that crossesover into many fields, connecting biology and physics with biochemistry right in therewielding its tools of technological precision. The cutting edge of these tools is a sharpone. It allows us an almost intimate look at what the molecules are doing and how theyinteract. The use of computer models to cross check data gained from living tissueenables scientists to check interpretations of life processes without interrupting them. Orif they do, the results can be integrated into a view of how an organic process works as awhole. But even with the gadgets, the word interpret is a big one. To interpret and84correctly account for what one sees requires a perceptive eye and mind coordination anda healthy dose of honesty. Behe combines humble metaphor, a few jokes and a lot ofscience to qualify. He writes with flowing ease, combining technicality and humor withrespect for the facts of biochemistry. But it still comes as a surprise when he comparesnature's complex molecular mechanisms to a Rube Goldberg device\u2014the kind where alever is timed to drop a ball into bucket of water to splash an inclined plane and cause itto tilt and free a waiting wheel that strikes the end of a hammer that hits a nail that pops aballoon that wakes up a sleeping daredevil canary that jumps off its perch to land on theback of a snoozing cat who swats at the laughing canary and knocks over a glass of watercaught by a funnel that drips onto the forehead of a sleeper and causes him (or her) towake up and put the cat outdoors. That kind of device\u2014the irreducible kind where eachpart has to be there to make it work. If the canary doesn't wake the cat misses a night onthe prowl and the canary gets a night with the cat. Not good, even for daredevil canaries.Fortunately for our canary, every aspect of the intricate awakening device was irreduciblyin place, every step did its essential bit to make the whole thing work. Behe uses suchGoldberg cat and canary devices to parody the irreducible complexity of, say, theintricate interrelationships and reactions that cause blood to clot. Bringing in thescience, he shows how the intricate processes of blood clotting work down to the lastprotein interaction. What emerges is a detailed exposition of a cascade of reactions thatall have to be at the reaction site (the wound) and ready to react. If any single step in thewhole series of the reactions is missing, the whole system fails. Blood doesn't clot andthe wounded animal (or human being) bleeds to death. And that is only one system.One among thousands. And all the systems depend on one another just like all the partsof each system depend on one another. Small wonder then that organic complexityforces us to see the body as a whole organism determined not by its parts but by how thewhole system works together as a mutually integrated unit. And here we get to the crux of the matter\u2014and to the controversial part. I didwarn you about as much at the start of this chapter. So here goes. The controversyrevolves around what we have been taught to think about genes and their role inevolution. The standard paradigm of neo-Darwinian evolution theory says basically thatrandom mutations cause changes in genetic structure that can create some novelty in anorganism that makes it better able to survive. That process is called natural selection.Behe's findings give rise to many questions about how this process might happen and hisideas challenge some cherished models of current theory. But wait, you might say, isn'tthis a book on chemistry? Yes, indeed\u2014and that is precisely the point. It isbiochemistry to the tune of complexity theory that is raising so many questions andproviding answers that raise even more questions. In other words, biochem is raising aruckus. And who wants to miss a good ruckus? Especially when it happens in ourbackyard. So here we go. Behe entitled his book Darwin's Black Box for a reason.Complexity is like a dark voice in the closet of evolutionary theory and neo-Darwinianswould just as soon it stayed there. But out of the closet it comes\u2014such things never stayin there once they are known\u2014and the doctrine that says random mutations are the primemovers of evolution is in for a shake-up, to say the least. Let's see why. Let's say anorganism gets lucky and against some very stiff odds a random mutation produces one ofthe protein agents necessary for the blood clotting process (one among thirty or so). Butthe organism also needs to produce a trigger protein that activates the blood clotting85agent. Otherwise, the blood clotting agent would cause all the blood to clot and theanimal dies an excruciatingly painful death. No organism wants that to happen. So let'ssay our happy organism gets very lucky and another \"random\" mutation gets that stepright. Now it has a protein blood clotting agent and activator ready to go. Bravo!Bully for our organism. But now the question arises, go where? The protein agent-trigger duo is useless without the other twenty-nine or so proteins necessary for the wholeprocess. And for random mutations to produce all twenty nine in assembly line orderwould be something of a contradiction of terms. According to Darwinian rules, it ain'tgonna happen. So what does an organism do with useless proteins? Well if we followthe ground rules of natural selection any novelty (read random mutation) that doesn'tcontribute to the immediate survival of the system is like excess baggage\u2014it either getstossed or sent to the recycle bin. Don't need that stuff on the steep stairs of life. Bloodclotting? I'll get by with a system of vascular shut off valves, thank you very much.(But we won't begin to go into the complexity of that one.) Or, if things aren't sosimple\u2014and recent research suggests they are not\u2014and a novelty, say, gets \"put onstandby,\" then we have to explain how that can happen with yet another complex set ofrelationships. And in this case, it's a set of relationships that only has a reason to be inthe future! (Which reminds me, would anyone like to donate a few precious moments tothe cause of our science and do a report on junk DNA? You will find that it is a goodexample of seemingly superfluous substance that relates to either the past or futureorganism or both.) So it seems that regardless how you cut it complexity is where it'sflowing. (Did I say cut? Ouch! Oh I do hope that prothrombin and thrombin aren'tmaking out in the corner somewhere when I need them to get my blood to clot!) YesMatilda, simple solutions are out; complexity, it seems, is in. But if you are about to cutin (Ouch again!) and object, let us hasten to add that none of this in no way contradictsevolution, it only demands that we rethink some notions about how it works. The groundrules of evolution might be shifting, but evolution is still on the map. Which is to saythat Behe's findings have caused some rumbling among the orthodox map makers,among those who adhere to a more orthodox neo-Darwinian view. Darwin and the neo-Darwin camp placed all of their bets on the viability of random mutation\u2014on a change ofpart, not to be confused with change of heart\u2014and how it leads to natural selection. Ifthat doesn't work, the theory bites the dust. Or, like the primal Adam, it's in need ofsome of that breath to get going again. But these days that breath is coming from thebiochem labs. And that is why complexity has given our Chinese jar a new spin. Thepatterns on the jar are changing. Even if it means that we have to break the jar.4 One would hardly want to call Behe a jar-breaker. He is a scientist who lookseye to eye with what he sees and gives an honest interpretation. Just like scientists aresupposed to do. In this case, however, the honest but inevitable interpretation returnsfrom the past like another pattern of our ever-present jar. The pattern is called intelligentdesign and it harkens back to the Greeks and beyond when it was felt that man was builtin accord with the divine image, etc. Like a lot of old notions the concept of intelligentdesign got some fresh wind in the 17th and 18th century but was pretty much booted out inthe 19th by natural selection and Darwin's Origin of the Species. But now it's back in thecontroversial soup of science as another part of the process. And it has some folksstewing. Behe revives the topic of intelligent design because as a scientist he has toconfront the Rube Goldberg nature of organic reactions that seem to defy any random86origin. They reflect intelligence in the intricacy of their interactions; they reveal thepresence of Rube\u2014of conscious design. And for most scientific folks there's the rub: thewords intelligent design are too close to Rube for comfort. Intelligent design is notsomething one should say in the polite company of the scientific minded (not to mentionthe materialistically inclined). That is because, as Behe freely admits, on the other side ofthat almost four letter expletive resides the implication that there might be some divineauthor of this intelligent design. (Egad! A divine author with the name of Goldberg!Heaven help us...) But of course you see the ridiculousness of the situation. You seethat this pits something subjective and irrational against a long tradition of empiricalreason that demands a strictly objective world. Conventional wisdom has it that if youthrow a divine factor into an equation, God knows what will come out. Even if purechance takes it from there, the odds are pretty good that it won't be science. But Behe isnot conventional and yet he is very much a scientist. In the spirit of science he debatesthe pros and cons of the issue, exploring different views and essentially concludes, asnumerous other scientists have done before him, that \"religious\" views, whetherphilosophical or a professed belief, are personal matters and should at all costs be left outof science. Science has its own guidelines and procedures that define its range andmethod of inquiry and these need to be respected if the word science is to have anymeaning. This is not to say, however, that science is not about the expanding ofconsciousness through observation of natural phenomena. And of course, there are nolimits to this expansion. The mind must above all be free. In a concluding sectionentitled \"Don't Fence Me In\" he states that \"a man or woman must be free to search forthe good, the true and the beautiful.5\" One might add that a lot of Waldorf studentsmight agree. They might even add that with regard to fences it is the quality of thinkingthat opens the gate of seeing to a vision of relationships that is free of philosophicallimitations. To achieve this, science demands a certain professional honesty thatprevents a scientist from adulterating his or her science with a personal agenda. With thisin mind Behe gives the knife a little twist. He is very concerned with the quality ofthinking that goes into science and like other scientists very disturbed when religion orphilosophical bias does creep into science via the back door. In fact he warns againstthis very thing regarding how some tenants in the tree of evolution cling to their theory asthough it were something of a religion.6 Behe is saying that we can stand outside thistree and see it in a new light. In this light\u2014the light of complexity\u2014we see how organicsystems work as a whole to include genes as partners in the life of an organism. This, aswe will see, has far reaching implications that go well beyond any controversy overwhether complexity is intelligent or not. In fact, we might even say that for the sake ofour present argument, the topic of intelligent design, though full of the spicy stuff thatmakes the story of science vital and interesting, is just another pattern on our jar. Thebottom line is that Behe's work suggests several new ways of looking at chemistry andbiology, ways that can prove seminal if we don't become bedazzled by those greenflashing dragon eyes that end up chasing those spotted tails again and again...with nary athought as to where they lead or where they end...and all the while jarring the world withspinning theory to explain why the thing is turning so...All right. Those were my words, not Behe's. But regardless whose words theyare, those spotted tails somehow remind me of Paracelsus. Only the Paracelsus of oldwouldn't have said it so nicely. He was a man who called a dragon a dragon and who87knew dragon dung when he saw it. Fortunately, to spare us the smell of dragon dung or apile of feces on the lab table, we have some modern versions of Paracelsian verve with asmoother flair for words that flows with a cooler nerve. Brian Goodwin, author of Howthe Leopard Changed its Spots, takes us right to the heart of the jar. In the introductionto his book he writes thatThe recognition of the fundamental nature of organisms, connecting directly withour own natures as irreducible beings, has significant consequences regarding ourattitude to the living realm.7 (Italics added.)Now when anyone says that something has significant consequences you know thatperson is serious. And since we are a part of the living realm it is kind of nice to havesomeone take us seriously for a change. It's the kind of attitude we might like to seemore of in the world. But what on earth does he mean by the \"our own natures asirreducible beings\" part? As with Behe above, the word irreducible is thrown in to meanthat we are defined by our complexity not by our parts, that the bright smile we make inthe morning mirror can't be reduced to a pile of molecules, that the whole really isgreater than its itty-bitty pieces. In this way you are like a mousetrap. (Sorry, I just sawthat big smile and I thought of cheese.)8 Anyway, mousetrap. We can't define amousetrap by its spring, by its snapper, by its cheese. If we take away any of its parts itwon't work. It's irreducible. Take away the spring, the snapper, the cheese and thething is useless. So you can relax and smile some more: your smile expresses a qualitythat is uniquely yours as it represents the whole you. With smile you remain, bright andwonderful, a holistic unit. Likewise, Goodwin adds that an organism functions as aholistic unit. In so many words this means that our molecules, our genes, our choices,our personal history, social environment, the works\u2014all of it works together to make amutual contribution to who we are. Irreducibly yours truly, we are more than ourmolecules. And with all of that his book asks us to take off the tinted glasses of anytheories or philosophical attitudes that predispose us to think a certain way and see witheyes that approach an organism, not as a complex molecular system determined by genes,by genocentric biology, but as a whole that functions as an organocentric unit thatincludes both the organism and the space in which it lives. We might recognize thisholistic approach as sounding somewhat familiar, being as it is so intimately a part ofGoethan thought. So take another of those deep breaths. Goodwin writes that \"Goethebelieved in a science of wholes\u2014the whole plant, the whole organism, or the whole circleof colors in his theory of color experience. But he also believed that these wholes wereintrinsically dynamic, undergoing transformation\u2014in accordance with laws or principles,not arbitrarily. So he was an organocentric biologist, and a dynamic one to boot!9\"Goodwin concludes that \"the ideas I am developing in this book are very much in theGoethean spirit.10\" So you see how this last chapter of ours follows a very definitetheme? It's taking us somewhere as quick as you can say the word complexity. Soonwards! We need to look more closely at what it means to be \"organocentric\" and howthis will take along the way on our quest to see where it's all going.Remember Descartes? Remember the mechanical model? Remember theCartesian partition? Good! Now we can take the ball and play with it. Goodwin beginsthe last chapter of his book with the question, \"Is an organism a mechanism?11\"88Swish\u2014right in the net. There it is. Right to the heart of the matter. On thescoreboard, his answer will sound familiar. He sees organisms as holistic expressions ofwhat he calls a \"morphogenetic field.\" (You caught that word, \"field,\" right?)Morphogenetc field is a concept he borrows from physics as much as from biology and itrefers to the organization of space about a living organism in much the same way themagnetic field organizes space around a magnet. If you inhale really deep you can catcha whiff of chemistry as well. Look at that ball\u2014it has resonance written all over it as youpass it around so fast it looks like its two places at once. The action becomes ever morecharged with a field of energy that pushes the game to the point where\u2014yeah! Score!(Deep breath.) Now take this analogy into the realm of biology and similar factors scorea morphogenetic field but do not stop the game to define it. A morphogenetic field isdefined by its own dynamics. The key is movement: a complexity of moving partsenergizes an organism with a field of its own. The terms are borrowed from physics butapplied to biology. By borrowing from physics Goodwin is doing what we are doingwith basketball: grafting his biology onto a viable set of metaphors and relationships. Heis not saying that biology can be reduced to physical laws or to a mechanical model. Heis very clear that an organism is a self-ordering entity. Unlike a machine that isassembled from premade parts, an organism creates itself. In case there is any doubt headds that \"organisms are not molecular machines; they are functional and structuralunities resulting from a self-organizing, self-generating dynamic.12\" It is this self-organizing and self-generating game plan where all the parts work as a whole, as anirreducible team, that makes an organism a dynamic entity, that gets it going as amorphogenetic field and distinguishes different species. In this light a house cat and amountain lion have different morphogenetic fields; so do a dog and a hyena. Each fieldexpresses its nature \"through particular qualities of form in space and time.13\" Andthere's that word quality again. You can probably guess that it refers to a dynamiccollection of traits that cannot be measured or quantified. Goodwin stipulates that it isthe dynamics of this collection of traits that distinguishes different species (house catfrom cheetah, etc.). And here is where the organocentric part comes in. As part of theoverall dynamics of the organism, the genes do their part as regulatory factors in thereproduction of these traits. But they do not determine how these traits came intoexistence. The origin of what makes a house cat a house cat and a cheetah a cheetah isfound, according to Goodwin, in how the morphogenetic field of a whole organismachieves optimal fitness with a minimal expense of energy. How this happens canentertain a complex array of relationships between an organism and its environment,relationships that bring into play a whole host of internal response factors such asreproductive habits, diet, choice of habitat, climate adaptation, etc. All of these factorsare expressions of nature that achieve \"particular qualities of form in space and time.\"To see what this means on the human level we might play a bit with how you or a friendmight look on any given day in the qualitative history of your life. You dye your hairred, wear shades and the latest in designer jeans that look like they barely survivedOmaha beach (with tank tops to match) and you have a certain quality that would not bethere if any of these necessary glad rags were not a part of your attire. There is no way Ican measure this quality; I can only observe and note that it is there. The measurementsyou add to that (which may or may not add to your self esteem) would naturally includeyour quantifiable properties such as your electric charge, magnetic force, heat content,89weight, mass, position, or even the notes you sing on the way to chem. class. But youare not just singing just because you like chemistry\u2014no, you are singing because yoursong is more than its notes. You know this because you feel the music you sing. Andyou know that the movement of a tune is a series of musical gestures that passes throughvariations on a theme and that it must have a certain je ne sais quoi that makes it real, acertain quality for it to knock 'em over and shatter wineglasses. And with thisrealization (which, of course, you got from not being late to chem class) you become anoperatic success and a happy diva. And in your next lifetime you become a chemist withholistic vision or a perhaps a biologist with a Goethean tune.14 You find it natural tocompare organisms to music; you discover how musical qualities pertain to \"real\" aspectsof an organism. Whew! And after all of that you understand how these qualities forman organocentric whole as the mind's eye learns to integrate living functions into a visionof self-supporting relationships so that every bone, every corpuscle, every muscle, everyligament are like one huge extended Chinese family. And you have this vision of aChinese jar, turning, turning, and among the patterns you see from the heart of the jaryou see life organocentrically. You see how all the parts of an organism, genes included,work together to create an irreducible whole. Like a song, like a tune that might beginwhen someone turns a chaotic feeling into a note that leads to another note... And youunderstand what the phrase \"emergent order\" might mean and you can see how it mightlead to some very complex music in the realm of life. You know because you have justlived through a very analogous series of events... And the chances are pretty good thatyou aren't even Chinese.On a slightly different note, the natural consequence of all of this comes to whatGoodwin calls a science of qualities that recognizes how important relationships are onall levels. You have probably thought along these lines yourself after watching the latestT. V. news. Just imagine, a world that defined culture not in terms of money and powerbut in the quality of relationships... That could mean that some so-called primitivecultures could be considered more advanced than some so-called advanced cultures!And yet, biology depends on a harmonious quality of relationships all the time. Thinkwhat would happen if your white blood cells decided they didn't like the \"ethnic profile\"of your red blood cells. You might call that an attitude (or worse). You might think howunscientific (to put it mildly). And yes, you'd be right on both counts. On the otherhand, what sometimes qualifies as science can harbor cultural attitudes that are almostthat ridiculous. Like Behe above, Goodwin complains that a good deal of bad sciencehas been shaped by social conventions that affect our way of seeing. (Our wag chimeshere with the comment that this amounts to \"insidious design.\") We have, for example,the authoritarian attitude that infiltrates so much of western civilization with the notionthat someone or something has to be in control. This is the attitude, he goes on to say,that has colored our thinking with ideas of genetic determinism, genes in control or genesas the \"authority\" that guides the rest of the body just as a autocratic parent or religion\"guides\" the unquestioning mind with dehumanizing authority. He and many others aresaying that such concepts have little to do with science and a lot to do with culturalmyths. The reality is that nature is not \"red in tooth and claw\"\u2014a 19th century phrase thatsaid more about human attitudes during the Industrial Revolution and growth of empirethan about nature. Instead it has been found that the contrary is true\u2014that naturedepends on levels of cooperation that extend from the molecular to the cellular to the way90eco-systems nourish a wide variety of species. We played with this notion above withreference to taking \"the solo from the goho\" but such notions have become seriousscience. Fostered by the work of James Lovelock and Lynn Margulis and their Gaiahypothesis,15 ideas of cooperation have gathered a great deal of momentum sinceLovelock wrote his seminal book Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth in 1979. Goodwinadvances this stream of awareness to a new level with his concepts of the morphogeneticfield and collective relationships that foster survival. But if the quality of theserelationships is impaired for some reason, be it natural or manmade, new forms orsystems must evolve to meet the crisis. A science of qualities as Goodwin proposes, willhelp understand the dynamics of how this can happen.Which begs the question, \"Where does this lead evolution?\" To answer this onewe need to go back into the past again and work forward. Back to the wonderful sixties,so full of evolutionary fervor of a different kind. Not everyone was smoking things andlistening to the Beatles, however. It turns out that a small group of biologists were keenon attaining a complete description of the tiny roundworm with a big name ofCaenorhabditus elegans or c. elegans for short. Twenty years later the task was done:every cell, every neuron, every step in its growth process through its tumultuous teenageyears and toward a not so orderly adulthood was carefully described and accounted for.All similarities to human evolution aside, the results were rather astounding. One of theresearchers who led this effort (who, incidentally, locked himself in a room for two yearsto count cells) reported that \"neurons are produced neither clonally nor from an orderlyseries of repeated cell divisions. Rather, they are generated by patterns that are'unpredictably complex.16\" The same researcher also commented on how \"celldetermination is autonomous; in most cases a cell is what it is principally because of itshistory rather than as a result of interaction with other cells.17\" And the most astoundingthing of all: \"about twenty percent die almost as soon as they are formed: these deathsappear to be intrinsically programmed suicides.18\" Now wait a minute. Is this a sensibleway to run a business? What if you were running a business and 20 (twenty!) percent ofyour employees suddenly up and committed suicide? For no apparent reason! Why, notto mention what you'd feel, you'd have every lawyer in the country on your back! Butwith c. elegans, this is business as usual and typifies cell growth in general. One of theexplanations given by the researchers was that such suicides often happen after sistercells that are really needed by an organism spit off. So we read on and find where in thecase of neurons \"cells of a different type can be produced by entirely different lineages inseemingly illogical ways.19\" The researchers were confronted with what they referred toas a \"bizarre symmetry.\" Maybe, as one researcher observed with blithe admiration,\"it's just the way the cookie crumbles.20\" Concluding comments by the leader of theresearch team recognized that neural \"development is unlikely to be the result of adiscrete, sequential developmental 'program' but instead is the outcome of a moreholistic logic of molecular assembly.21\" Well, you say, so much for how the cookiecrumbles. But listen to another parting comment. Asked if knowing everything about C.elegans reveals anything about the rest of the biological world, one of the researchersreplied that \"although certain detailed aspects of molecular genetics have turned out todiffer, many basic principles have proved to be universal.22\" So there you have it, asknot for whom the fortune cookie crumbles, it crumbles for you... However, before youblame the chaos or \"bizarre symmetry\" of your cells for not getting your work in on time,91we need to ask how the crumbs get to be a cookie. After all, there might be a higherordering power than your poor overworked cells. And here's your chance to prove it: ifyou've been an attentive reader the answer to what that higher ordering power might beshould be rolling off your tongue. Need a hint? It has something to do withmorphogenetic fields, right? Right! That's at least a big part of the answer. But you'llalso be glad to hear that Goodwin adds another dimension or two. Along with emergentorder we have life at the edge of chaos. (Yes, Matilda, you've got it! Emergent order!After the grand old age of 18...) So let's hear it for the basic urge, the primal impulse atthe edge of chaos. Something to think of the next time you and your skateboard take theplunge off the edge of that six-foot embankment. If you don't land so well, relax. LetMother Nature show you how it's done. Something similar happens when an organismevolves big time. One of the big problems with evolution as it's now understood is thatsmall scale changes that have been verified don't add up to big changes in species. Birdsand butterflies, for example, can change color to better suit their environment, but theyremain birds and butterflies. No matter how good the wag, once a dog always a dog.Sharks don't turn into amphibious salamanders, no matter how much they want to take astroll. Or, as Goodwin declares, to compete with existing organisms:Competition has no special status in biological dynamics where what is important is the pattern of relationships and interactions that exist and how they contribute to the behavior of the system as an integrated whole. The problem of origins requires an understanding of how new levels of order emerge from complex patterns of interaction and what the properties of these emergent structures are in terms of their robustness to perturbation and their capacity for self-maintenance.23In other words, we need what is called higher levels of emergence to turn chaos into anevolutionary door of opportunity (if you don't believe me, read your fortune cookie).This is true all the way to the genetic level. The role of genes in the emergence issecondary. In doing the adaptive thing, \"they cooperate with the generic forms of the(morphogenetic) field to give robust morphologies to organisms.24\" As Goodwindemonstrates many times over, genes don't wag the whole organism; it's the other wayaround. In keeping with our metaphors, genes are partners in the dance of life; they don'tcreate the dance. Regardless how you shake it, the need to shake things up and resort thecells is what gets a new form to emerge, a new species to evolve. Based on observationsof current life systems, Goodwin and others are coming to see life as existing at the edgeof chaos, \"moving from chaos into order and back again in perpetual exploration ofemergent order.25\" The researchers of c. elegans did not, to be sure, observe theemergence of a new species. They only observe a normal process of growth thatperpetuated the same old show. But this same old show revealed an emergence of orderout of chaos. They called it a \"holistic logic of molecular assembly.\" What a quaintway to describe a morphogenetic field! But that was in 1984, some ten years ahead ofGoodwin. The research group that explored c. elegans only reported what they saw(which is what they should report). Goodwin adds to this out of his own research on theevolution of form and finds how the pattern is still fit. The old pattern of emergingorder, given the right novelty of the moment, creates a new pattern in the field of formand evolution takes one more step along the way. It is important to note, however, that92no one can say what this new novelty will be, or what its specific causes are. This isdetermined by the dynamics of the organism and a complex array of other factors.Consequently, the science of evolution must necessarily proceed after the fact. But wehave a new way of interpreting the appearances. We have a new pattern on our jar that isstarting to go places. And from this we can gain some fresh perspective on where it's allgoing. From inside the jar...26 What this whole story from beginning to end is about, it seems to me, is inlearning to see. And to do this we need questions that break the spell of old patterns,ideas that lead us on a quest for new ways of connecting with what we observe. Ideasthat break away from the old myths of survival of the fittest, struggle after the fall, etc.Ideas that focus on the quality of life instead of the quantity of what we sometimes calllife. And participate in the play of emerging new order. To illustrate what this mightmean to chemistry, Seyhan Ege, professor of organic chemistry at the University ofMichigan, tells the story of a colleague who was becoming very frustrated with herexperiments with corn DNA. Nothing crystallized right, the electron microscope mightas well have been a Kodak camera, and if it were it probably wouldn't have workedeither. So the woman just said in so many scientific words to hell with it and went out tospend the summer working on a farm that belonged to a friend\u2014friends with farms arealways in need of a few extra hands. So on the farm it was. Science out of mind andlife in her hands, she went among the vegetables and yes, the corn and the tomatoes andthe broccoli; she worked the soil, hoed weeds and in the dirt of it all got to know a cornshe never knew. When she returned she discovered that everything fell into place. Shegot her paper written and I'm only sorry I don't have a copy of it. But the story behind itwas better. One that that has a handle on it\u2014a hoe handle, to be exact\u2014right there in thestill point at heart of the jar.25 I wonder if she sang while she hoed.If she did, it might have been some ditty about how chemistry and biology cansing a tune of exceptional quality. We might even sing along if we head out to our owngarden, check out the sunflowers and try our own luck at finding some new ideas. Andwhy not? Why keep our bumper crop of helianthus argophyllus waiting? Hi ho to thegarden we go. With a little looking we find once again how the leaves spiral around thecentral stem with Fibonacci ratios of five leaves to two turns around the stalk, etc. We'vebeen there and done that and you probably recall that we wrote down our leaf around thestalk observations under the rubric of phyllotactic patterns. You might even recall howwe found different phyllotactic patterns in the same species, with some plants stayingwith the 5/2 leaf to turn ratio all along the main stem while others have a 3/2 toward thetop. And sure enough, on this trip to the garden we find the same variation on a theme byFibonacci. And we remember that over 80% of the 250,000 or so of the higher plantsplay a similar variation. So what's going on? Too many patterns on the same theme tobe random. So is natural selection stuck in a rut? Or could another factor be involved indeciding the growth patterns? To find out we read a bit and find where Goodwinascribes this to the non-genetic activity of (you guessed it) a \"robust morphogeneticprocess.\" To demonstrate how this works he refers to an experiment ran by two Frenchscientists, St\u00e9phane Douady and Yves Couder, who used a magnetic field to essentiallyduplicate the effects of a morphogenetic field.28 The results of the experiment showedthat all phyllotactic patterns could be generated by the magnetic field, the differentpatterns being a function of speed of plant and leaf growth. The faster the growth of new93leaves the more likely a spiral pattern will occur. Apparently, not all of our sunflowersgrew at the same rate. To be sure a more stringent test of this would be necessary beforedrawing any firm conclusions but it certainly suggests that more than geneticdeterminants are responsible for the growth patterns. Goodwin concludes from theresearch of Douady and Couder that whereas natural selection \"may be involved intesting the stability of form it is in no sense a generator of biological form.27\" In thecontext of evolution he and Behe seem to be riding the same wave; he states withparticular reference to the context of evolution that \"there is an inherent rationality to lifethat makes it intelligible at a much deeper level than functional utility and historicalaccident.30\"Historical accident... Thinking back a bit, it may seem strange in the light of thisand all we have said above that science would confine evolution to the realm of historicalaccident and random mutation while the evolution of science has been anything butrandom. We have seen how the growth of science and the mentality of empiricalthought have shared a cultural as well as a natural foundation. It was said above thatscience did not happen in a vacuum and we have seen how it developed in the wake ofsocial trends that affected the world as a whole. Weaving in and out of this whole wehave seen the intellectual strains of bygone ages alongside those of our modern periodlike the strains of a vast symphony. As we learn to hear these strains with eyes that see,we can begin to appreciate the many relationships that make all music, all life and allnature possible. In the meantime, the orchestra plays on; the Chinese jar keeps turning.Among its many patterns we might recall the three gifts of Hermes Trismegistus and theattitude toward nature that cultivated a vision of how human beings are part of a greaterwhole. And if all this talk about qualities and relationships sounds like Aristotle'srevenge, well, so be it. There was nothing keeping Aristotle from taking a dip inHeraclitus's river and coming out feeling, and looking, like a new man with that newGoethean look. After he dries himself off he might join us as we think back to howMaxwell spoke of the \"mind's eye\" with which Faraday saw a vision of holistic patternsregarding electro-magnetic fields. Till now such examples of the \"mind's eye\" inscience have been largely dismissed by those who hold to the old Cartesian way ofseparating subject and object, human mind and nature, in a static framework offragmented \"realities.\" Perhaps it is this \"attitude\" of separating man from nature thathas led scientists to make of nature a lucky accident while they fill their cups of successand drink to the orderly march of science. Wait a minute! What was that I just wrote?Full cups? So that's what she meant! Remember our melodious caller? What she saidabout the jar being on empty because it was so full? Guess that goes to show that if youlive in a Chinese jar, your own beginnings will come back to find you... But before allour beginnings come to a happy end, we need to add a little more. We need to take noteof how the on full on empty attitude is changing. Ways of improving our quality ofthinking demand a view of how relationships, both natural and human, include the everchanging and interconnected patterns of existence. The need is for greater vision. Asour wag once put it, \"Baby, you've come a long way from the titanium view.\" And asevolution passes from reproduction to cultural and individual enlightenment, he mightadd that, \"Baby, you've got a long way to go...\" But the scientific vista promises insmall but momentous ways to be a happier one. It introduces processes in our thinkingthat are inclusive rather exclusive and in so doing allows for inner growth to complement94the natural processes in nature. Try that one on and we can wear that jar where the fulland the empty are all the same size. And strum those patterns with a new kind of songthat lives a new spin with a hum in the mind that sees where it ends with the trend on themend... A little something to play upon as we take on the hard work to see this thingthrough... To work our play and play our work we can pluck our luck by laying downthe view with a few sober lines...lines that turn on the mind as we step out of the caveand discover how the nature of emergent order\u2014otherwise known as the step fromchaos\u2014can be experienced in the attitude of play that leads to creative thinking.Goodwin speaks of \"creation out of chaos\" in this light:It is in playing and only in play that the individual child or adult is able to be creative and to use the whole personality, and it is only in being creative that the individual discovers the self.31I only wonder if he has ever been to a Waldorf Kindergarten! Rudolf Steiner waskeenly aware of the need for what he called creative play in the educational process. Agrowing mind needs rhythm and structure that breathe in and out of one another. Suchbreath is necessary for a mind in motion as feet and thought keep time with the feelingrealm. When this happens the whole body responds in a way that allows it to become avehicle and a recipient of a greater consciousness of a healthy and loving mind. In hisPhilosophy of Freedom, Steiner shows how the intuitive activity of thinking builds avision of relationships that connect us with what we observe. I'm sure he would verycheerfully recognize a move toward the same awareness in the words Goodwin uses toclose his book: \"a science of qualities is necessarily a first person science that recognizesvalues as shared experiences, as states of participative awareness that link us to otherorganisms with bonds of sympathy, mutual recognition and respect.32\" That is not to saythat we can bid Descartes or the mechanistic paradigm good-bye. Old ideas die hard.33But a serious and viable alternative view has been made. It's a lead. One we mustfollow up on if we are to advance more consciously toward the more healing future.And we step into the jar, take a deep breath, deeper than usual, and with a longpause we can see why the beginning and the end return...1. The concept of a dance rings especially true regarding Kekul\u00e9's dreams and thediscovery of the benzene ring. In 1880, August von Stradonitz Kekul\u00e9, the fatherof structural chemistry, gave a speech during a celebration in his honor in whichhe stated that he owed his career to two visions. One, in 1854, occurred when hetook a nap in a London omnibus and dreamed of a ring of carbon atoms dancingin a ring. The other occurred when he dozed off while sitting in front of afireplace in Gant in 1861 and dreamed of a uroboros or serpent with its tail in itsmouth. (Histoire de la Chimie, p. 199.) In Kekul\u00e9's mind these dreamsconfirmed ongoing research that coincided with discoveries he and others weremaking in the field of organic molecular structure. Is it a curious coincidencethat the electrons in a benzene ring do indeed rotate about a ring of carbon atomslike the uroboros? Perhaps. But it bears noting that the resonance hybrid diagram95of a benzene ring takes this electron movement into account by symbolizing thebenzene ring with a circle inside a hexagon.2. For research on the effect of electricity on healing and growth see the BodyElectric: Electromagnetism and the Foundation of Life. The authors show thatelectricity affects cellular growth in bones all the way to the genetic level withwhat they call a \"circuit of awareness.\"3. I owe my interest in titanium to my dentist, Dr. Phillip McDonnell. It seems thattitanium is used in dental reconstructions and other places where major bonerepair is needed because of this unique quality. Subsequent research into thematter has made the element a matter of increasing interest. It is pertinent herebecause it offers and excellent example of how a qualitative grouping ofproperties complements a holistic organic process.4. Jar breaking is not to be confused with the paradigm shift made famous byThomas Kuhn's book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. His description ofparadigm shifts and how they are a natural part of science depicts a kind ofchanging of the guard as one set of authoritative theories replaces another. Hewrites thatparadigms are not corrigible by normal (we would say \"outside the jar\")science at all. Instead, as we have already seen, normal science ultimatelyleads only to the recognition of anomalies and to crises. And these areterminated, not by deliberation and interpretation, but by a relativelysudden and unstructured event like the gestalt switch. Scientists then oftenspeak of the \"scales falling from the eyes\" or of the \"lightning flash\" that\"inundates\" a previously obscure puzzle, enabling its components to beseen in a new way that for the first time permits a solution. (pp. 122-3)Like Plato's prisoner getting out of his cave, in fact. In Kuhn's setting of the cave story, the prisoner goes back into the cave as something of an authority as hepropounds another theory. Not any more, however. Jar breaking dispenses with paradigms and models altogether. Paradigms just aren't what they used to be\u2014they are fast becoming lost in the sauce of the post-modern world, a world largely created by the rapid exchange of ideas fostered by the computer age. This connectedness of science enables a fast track movement of ideas that grows organically and as such is independent of the academic tendencies that allow ideasto get stuck in an authoritative rut. In this way Behe is perhaps more of a jar-spinner than a jar-breaker as the natural run of ideas gets things flowing. But he committed one cardinal sin according to the Order of the Jar: he didn't publish by process of peer review. This means that he didn't submit his views to an established scientific journal that submits its articles to a reviewing of established scientists in the field. We can guess from the reviews his book did get from some of these established peers that if he had done so the book would have never made 96it to the printing house. In fact, some seemed to imply in no uncertain scientific terms that it would barely make it to the outhouse. The main complaint is that hedoes not accept a thoroughly materialist explanation for complexity. As one reviewer states, \"If our hypotheses about complexity are to be of any use, however, they will have to be materialist explanations grounded in material cause.\" (Robert Dorit, American Scientist online.) Another reviewer complains that any thing less brings science to a dead end. But it needs to be pointed out that materialism as a prerequisite for doing science is a philosophical attitude that has its roots in 19th century positivism. It is the basic tenet of positivism that any data not derived from experiment or formal logic cannot be regarded as valid: truth is that which can be objectively and experimentally verified. The problem with this statement, as R. G. Woolley points out, is that it cannot itself be experimentally verified. He writes that the proposition \"fails the test it proclaims, i.e., in its own terms in cannot be true. It is quite evident that this formula for \"truth\" is beyond the limits of both experimental investigation (what experiment could be invoked to verify it?) and formal logic.\" (Molecular Structure Conundrum, p. 1082.) In other words, positivism and the materialist restriction that goes with it, are based not on experimental \"truth\" at all but on a philosophical attitude. The irony of this is that Behe does indeed subscribe to the positivist paradigm by basing his conclusions on experimentally established and demonstrable results, on what he calls an \"open box.\" Quite the contrary, it was Darwin who based his theory on a \"black box\" of certain assumptions that could not be based on experiment because the science to do the experiments was lacking in his day. Behe and other proponents of complexity are pointing out how this in many ways has not changed and that neo-Darwinism, with its selfish genes (Richard Dawkins) and Anglo Saxon metaphor (survival of the fittest, genes in control, etc.) becomes more philosophy than science. It is precisely for this reason that Lynn Margulis calls neo-Darwinism a \"minor twentieth century religious sect.\" (See note five below.) And what does this mean for us? Well, some good drama full of vital issues for one thing. And some rather spicy patterns on our jar. Keep turning.5. Darwin's Black Box, p. 2506. In a section entitled \"The Natives Are Restless\" Behe quotes Lynn Margulis'*comment on the matter (Lynn Margulis is Distinguished University Professor ofBiology at the University of Massechussetts). She expresses the view that historywill ultimately judge neo-Darwinism as \"a minor twentieth-century religious sectwithin the sprawling religious persuasion of Anglo-Saxon biology.\" Ibid, p. 26.7. How the Leopard Changed Its Spots, p. x8. I'm not being as original here as it might sound. In fact, it was all done withmirrors. I was reflecting on your smile and Behe's mousetrap. He uses it as thequintessential example of an irreducible machine before he graduates to RubeGoldberg devices and the complexity of molecular systems. I just somehow97connected the two. So perhaps I am being a bit original after all. At the veryleast it's just a little something you can think of the next time the camera man orwoman tells you to say cheese. Or when you reflect upon the reflection of youroriginal self in the mirror.9. How the Leopard Changed its Spots , p. 136.10. Ibid.11. Not to say that Goodwin is alone in asking this question. In fact he makes it veryclear that biology is rather alone in still adhering to the mechanical model.Quantum mechanics has long since dispelled itself of the classical understandingof the word mechanical and has brought in such very non-mechancalunderstandings of nature as nonlocal causes, etc. (which Goodwin mentions).Scientists in other fields have long questioned and criticized the application of themechanical model in biology and neo-Darwinism. To mention a few: PaulWeiss, Professor Emeritus of Rockefeller University (System of Nature andNature of Systems, in Toward a Man-Centered Medical Science, pp. 17-63 andWhither the Human Brain? Harper's Magazine, 211:66-70, 1955)and of course the philosopher and physical chemist Michael Polanyi (LifeTranscending Physics and Chemistry, C & N, August 21, 1967). ThoughGoodwin sounds new, the dates on these articles attest to the fact that his viewsecho a long standing wave in the recent history of science.12. How the Leopard Changed its Spots, p, 19713. Seven years after James Lovelock came out with his book Gaia: A New Look atLife on Earth in 1979, Lynn Margulis and Dorion Sagan co-authoredMicrocosmos: Four Billion Years of Microbial Evolution. Both books caught anew wave of thinking that looked at nature as a cooperative endeavor and offeredfresh ideas to counter the competitive paradigm inherited from the 19th century(see note 14 below).14. For more on the relation of music to holistic thinking, see Goethe's NaturalScience, Ronald Brady in Toward a Man-Centered Medical Science, p. 157.15. Lovelock, still ascribing to the mechanical model, likens the earth to a holisticcybernetic system (which he compares to an oven with a thermostat). Margulisalso has a mechanistic view of how micro-organisms cooperate in mutual supportsystems to create complex organic machines. Be that as it is, both scientistsmade a major contribution by substituting a holistic paradigm for evolution thatseriously countered the typical notion of survival of the fittest.16.

The Pythagoreantake of creation draws on ancient myths that tell how Chaos creates theCosmos\u2014which means the Perceived Universe and signifies Order. Inside thecave, in the darkness of the mind, there are only shadows, opinions and chaoticthought forms. Leaving this creates a condition of emergent order and theperceiving of the uni-verse as a whole. So in case you thought any of the aboveis new, well think again... (Le Nombre d'Or, vol. 2, p. 10)From inside the jar we can also see how we are a part of the turning world which is really more of a spiraling world where ideas and concepts return but are never quite the same. More and more it is this spiraling evolution of ideas that shapes the content of our lives and the identities we fashion from the connections we make. For this reason life is essentially nonlinear; it is circular. As we see how our identities depend on the relationships we make we become more in tune with the need to improve the quality of thinking that improves the quality of our interaction with a world that improves us as we improve it. And so the wheel turns, the jar spins and yet we see this from a still point inside ourselves. 27. I paraphrase Eliot's \"still point of the turning world.\" (Burnt Norton\u2014though the\"still point\" is a theme throughout the four parts of the poem.) And while was Igetting a little help from the poem, you'd never guess what happened. Our friendwith the melodious voice called and left her number on my answering service.Only it was in code\u2014said it was contained in the last part of the poem. OK, Iknow that sounds hokey but metaphorically yours, it's the God's truth. Anyway,it's probably better if I leave it up to you to figure it out. If you do, give her acall, and find out for yourself where it's all going... Here's how the poem ends:We shall not cease from exploration99And the end of all our exploringWill be to arrive where we startedAnd know the place for the first time.Through the unknown, remembered gateWhen the last of earth left to discoverIs that which was the beginning;At the source of the longest riverThe voice of the hidden waterfallAnd the children in the apple-treeNot known, because not looked forBut heard, half-heard, in the stillnessBetween two waves of the sea.Quick now, here, now, always\u2014A condition of complete simplicity(Costing not less than everything)And all shall be well andAll manner of thing shall be wellWhen the tongues of flame are in-foldedInto the crowned knot of fireAnd the fire and the rose are one.28. The experiment consists of dropping a ferrofluid (a liquid that can be magnetized)onto the center of a turning disc that is coated with a film of oil. The apparatus issubjected to a magnetic field that polarizes the drops as they fall, causing them torepel each other. As the drops fell onto the disc they are repelled equally fromfrom each other to create equal angle (logarithmic) spirals that intersect atFibonacci ratios like the spirals of a sunflower blossom. The patterns wouldchange depending on the rate of drops. Goodwin used the patterns to demonstratethe phyllotaxes of leaves up a stem. (See How the Leopard Changed Its Spots,pp. 127-133)29. p. 23733. One can generally rely on Scientific American or American Scientist to publishanything that advances the mechanical model. So it was not surprising to find inthe October 2004 of SA another article on junk DNA and how it might providethe mechanism for evolutionary change. The article is written by John Mattick,an eminent name in the field of molecular biology, and describes the growingevidence that nonprotein encoding RNAs (introns) and other repetitive DNAmaterial seem to have a regulatory function that controls the complexity of an100organism. Suspicions that this might be the case grew when it was discoveredthat simpler life forms have more DNA than more complex life forms. Someamphibians have as much as five times the DNA as mammals and some amoebaehave 1,000 times more! Mattick refers to our friend, c. elegans, in this light. C.elegans has 19,000 protein coding genes whereas humans have a mere 25,000.But it has also been discovered that the amount of nonprotein coding genes or so-called junk DNA in more complex animals is much higher and this has lead somescientists to suspect that the \"junk\" must have some function that contributes tothe complexity of higher life forms. This has resulted in upgrading junk DNAwith the name of \"introns.\" Old ideas that introns were just so much junk arethemselves getting junked as new ideas look for how introns create the orderingprinciple that controls complexity. In other words, in conformity to themechanical model, introns are supposed to be the hand that turns the crank.Though the metaphor might seem a bit crude, it nevertheless describes the bottomline. One of the basic tenets of the mechanical model is that organisms arecontrolled from the molecular level up. This presupposes an orderly pattern ofcell growth. It comes therefore as no surprise to read where Mattick states thefollowing as though he were reading right out of the guidebook for themechanical model: \"Throughout their evolution and development, organismsmust navigate precise developmental pathways that are sensible and competitive,or else they die.\" (The Hidden Genetic Program, John S. Mattick, ScientificAmerican, vol. 291, nr. 4, October 2004, p. 66) And yet, as we have seen fromthe researchers who analyzed the cell growth of c. elegans, this is definitely notthe case. There was nothing \"sensible and competitive\" not to mention \"precise\"in the way c. elegans grew, though it's arguable that the whole process achievedwhat might be termed sensible aims that made the organism a mature c. elegans.We of course have no way of knowing if c. elegans would consider itself\"competitive.\" But more to the point, the case of c. elegans indicates verystrongly that it was not the parts, be they DNA or introns, which achieved this\"sensible\" aim. Rather, it was the \"outcome of a more holistic logic of molecularassembly.\" It was the organism functioning as a whole. We are told by theresearchers who spent endless hours observing the growth of this little worm thatits cells were \"autonomous\" and acting out of their individual history and not \"asa result of interaction with other cells.\" And contrary to what Mattick seems toindicate, it didn't die. It grew up to be another faithful example of a full fledgedc. elegans! In light of what Goodwin said above about how certain culturalnorms slip into one's \"scientific\" thinking, the confusing context around thewords \"sensible\" and \"competitive\" falls just short of being humorous. It mightbe irrelevant that John Mattick hails from Sidney, Australia. But it isn'tirrelevant to recall that in accord with certain cultural ethics that trace at leastsome of their roots to our rich Anglo Saxon heritage, one must be \"sensible andcompetitive\" and, one might add, in control or else you die. Old ideas, it seems,do indeed die hard.101Bibliography of References1. A Hundred Years of Chemistry, Alexander Finley, London: Duckworth & Co.,1965.2. A Christian Rosenkreutz Anthology, Paul M.
