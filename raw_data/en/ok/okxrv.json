It may seem like you need additional help to reduce the pain, like prescription painkillers, but chiropractic treatment for pain relief is a safe option for you to choose. Dr. Woywood has 33 years of experience with chiropractic treatment and can help alleviate the pain you are experiencing through safe practices. His \"whole person\" approach to wellness will find the causes of your pain and make the adjustments necessary to restore your body to normal function, all without the use of opioids. The Risks of Opioids In cases of moderate to severe pain, doctors may prescribe opioids as painkillers. Opioids, when used as instructed by your doctor, can be effective in managing pain, but they are not without risk. Taking opioids in high doses can slow your breathing and heart rate. The feeling of being on a high dose of opioids can also lead to addiction. Treating pain with Dr. Woywood without the use of opioids will avoid the possibility of these negative effects. Is Chiropractic Treatment as Effective? Chiropractic treatment is an effective alternative to opioid use. The University of Cleveland School of Chiropractic and Health Sciences states that research shows patients who used chiropractic treatment as a form of pain relief had a 64% lower chance of receiving a prescription for opioids, with a 55% lower chance of those prescriptions actually being filled.
