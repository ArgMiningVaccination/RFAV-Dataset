In order for NLM to accept the guidelines, they need to be converted into XML first. We have a few things to do to package up the guidelines (we need to create a zip file of the materials, code the headings, make a pdf and a \"cover sheet\" of sorts, and then send that off to Beth's team). It looks like we paid about $5 per page for them to code our guidelines, and you'll probably need to set up a contract. The attached zip file is what we sent recently. - Ng, Kin (NIH/NLM/NCBI) [C] [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#12797b7c3c7c75527c7b7a3c757d64). Kin Ng is my contact at NLM. He will put up a preview on NLM before publishing, and will check back with either Beth or I with his questions prior to publication. Here is the [process that we go through for endorsements](https://med.umich.edu/pdf/Copy-of-Endorsement-Flow.pdf) (not all committees are required; Olivia or Natalie can help set up the endorsements in PolicyStat for you).
