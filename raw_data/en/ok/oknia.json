What's new Psychic from birth \"When Trina was a little girl she would to say to herself \"I just want to be normal\". Like her great grandmother, Trina was gifted with psychic ability from a young age but had no context for it. She saw shadows, felt 'ghostly presences', and saw vivid images of coloured light. She called the coloured light 'fairies', only to feel foolish about this as she grew older. She occasionally overheard her nana talk of mysterious experiences.

This series of workshops is really helpful in offering a set of tools and a structure by which an individual can maintain their spiritual, physical, and emotional wellbeing. It is very helpful in clarifying the different realities of you as a being. Knowing more about yourself through this framing helps to focus your attention to determine the source of disturbances, and to care for all aspects of yourself. I was a little unsure what to expect when I booked into Trina's Spiritual Hygiene course, having done many \"spiritual\" courses before and wondering how different it would be. I can honestly say I was absolutely blown away by the depth of knowledge that Trina offered and it far exceeded my expectations. Amongst many things, Trina provided exceptional insight and information on how we can work with the light of spirit to help us walk through this life in a more balanced, clear, and peaceful way. It has also certainly highlighted the significant importance of taking care of and nurturing my spiritual self. Trina delivered the information in such a wonderful and practical way that it has left me feeling a great sense of empowerment and confidence in implementing my newly gained knowledge and tools in my day to day life. What an amazing gift, to be offered tools to help deepen my connection to spirit and the embodiment of all that I am and all that I have the potential to be!! Thanks Trina! I "}
