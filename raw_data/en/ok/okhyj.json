Do you ever wonder if there are natural ways to support the healthy expression of emotions that may leave you feeling stuck or ungrounded? If so, you are not alone. Pure essential oils provide immense possibilities of profound healing for the physical body and energy body. As humans, our bodies are craving a connection with nature, and yet we have never been more disconnected from the natural world than we are now! Essential oils are a powerful way to bring your body, mind, and spirit into alignment for deeper healing to occur. Lindsey Fernandez, a master medicinal aromatherapist and intuitive healer, has worked with these powerful plant allies for close to two decades, sharing her passion for reconnection to earth medicine. In this 6-week live course, Lindsey talks about the power of these plant beings to bring a bioenergetic recharge to the body/emotions and energy. Students will receive: - A 2ml six-pack of essential oils to be covered in class, one oil per week - A guided meditation in each class to deeply connect with the energy and essence of each oil from the kit - Safety and dosage recommendations and application recommendations - Information on the healing properties and benefits of 6 different essential oils from a physical, emotional, and spiritual perspective - A deeper understanding and connection to the plant and tree kingdom and an expansion of your intuition Lindsey Fernandez's Essential Oil program guides you through arguably the most complete, accessible, and transformational essential oil framework available today. Lindsey is a renowned Aromatherapist and Practitioner as well as an Intuitive Healer and facilitator for the School of Intuitive Studies. Through this program, she intends to help participants reconnect with the power of plants. What makes Lindsey's approach to essential oils so different than anything else out there is her easy-to-follow and holistic approach. In each class over the 6 weeks, students will learn the physical, emotional, and spiritual aspects of each oil and experience that essence in meditation. You will learn some basic safety and application techniques around working with pure essential oils undiluted, unblended, and applied at the time of need: - How essential oils affect our limbic system, detox our body and shift our vibrational frequency (essential oils' role as a bridge to healing) - How essential oils support us in clearing blocked energy and unprocessed emotions - Important safety and dosage techniques that everyone who works with essential oils should know - How to tune into and work with e.o.'s intentionally and what that looks like for you as an individual - How to work with essential oil \"singles\" to deepen your connection to the Earth - How working with essential oils undiluted can be the most effective way to access their medicinal properties and some myths around what we have been told about dilution Lindsey Fernandez, Master Aromatherapist Educator and Practitioner Lindsey Fernandez is a Master Aromatherapist Educator and Practitioner as well as an Intuitive Healer and facilitator for the School of Intuitive Studies, who has studied and worked with the properties of plants and trees for over 15 years, where she has developed a passion for reconnecting humans to earth medicine for natural healing. Many years ago, as a massage therapist, Lindsey developed an interest in working with essential oils when she witnessed the profound healings and shifts her clients were experiencing in their sessions. Lindsey was inexplicably drawn to this potent medicine and found it shifting her own life in surprising ways. As she trained with Wendy, it brought her work with plants and trees deeper and she began to teach others how to intuitively tap into that as well. Since then, she has developed an intention to teach anyone willing to learn about these powerful plant allies and to provide aromatherapy consultations to those who feel drawn to this type of medicine for healing physically, emotionally, and spiritually. With her upcoming workshop, she aims to provide students with the required knowledge on how to work with essential oils safely, effectively, and in a way that is sustainable for the planet. Since essential oils provide users with a bridge to healing and a bioenergetic recharge that their bodies crave, this workshop will enlighten students on how this high-frequency plant medicine is a balm to their souls.
