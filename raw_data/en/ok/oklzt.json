Intestinal helminths are transmitted through contaminati on of soil with human feces and by subsequent accidental ingestion of soil with parasite eggs (Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura and occasionally Ancylostoma penetration of the worm larvae (hookworm) into the skin and body of the human host . Soil-transmitted helmin ths are responsible for the largest burden of neglected tropical disease s, with about 1.5 billion infected people worldwide. Although most infections are asymptomatic and of light intensity , heavier intensity infections can cause severe morbidity . Chronic high-intensity manifestations caused by STH infections can lead to physical and intellectual growth retardation, perpetuating a vicious c ycle of poor health and poverty. The World Health Organization (WHO) has advocated targeted preventive chemotherapy (PC), the periodic mass drug administration (MDA) of single dose benzimidazoles ( i.e., albendazole and mebendazole) to at -risk population groups, without prior diagnosis. The main goal of this strategy is to reduce morbidi ty by decreasing infection intensities and to ultimately eliminate STH infections as a public health problem . This is defined as the decrease of prevalence of moderate and heavy infection intensities to below 2% as assessed in preschool - and school - aged ch ildren by 2030 . However, several factors might jeopardiz e the success of PC , including the low efficacy of the currently used benzimidazoles, its inability to prevent reinfections and the potential emergence of anthelmintic resistance due to mounting drug pressure . On Pemba Island, Tanzania, STH infections were recognized as a major public health problem in the early 1990s. Since then, PC has been wide ly implemented (coverage rate > 80%), but STH prevalence remains high to date. Hence, development of n ew and safe broad -spectrum drugs, repurposing of available drugs or the use of drug combinations to expand the armamentarium of treatment options is of paramount importance to help control and eliminate STH infections. xiv Goal and specific objectives : The first objective of my PhD was to test the efficacy and safety of ascending doses of moxidectin alone or combined with albendazole (400 mg) against trichuriasis. The second objective was to evaluate the short -term and long-term outcomes 14-21 days, six and 12 months post -treatment of ivermectin -albendazole and albendazole alone in an expanded study population (6 -60 years) aiming to inform and update STH control guidelines and programs. The third objective was to compare the perfo rmance of the microscopic Kato -Katz method to the molecular polymerase chain reaction ( qPCR) and its impact on drug efficacy and day -to-day variation. The fourth objective was to test fecal calprotectin (FC) and fecal occult blood (FOB) as potential surrog ate marker s for STH attributable morbidity. Insights gained from the ivermectin -albendazole trial on trial methodology, trial procedures and mitigation strategies to overcome challenges faced during clinical research taking place in resource -limited environments is presented as fifth objective . Methods : This PhD work consisted of two clinical trials. The first was a phase II, randomized, placebo -controlled, dose -finding study on moxidectin in adolescents aged between 1 6 and 18 years on Pemba Island in 201 8. Screened individuals were asked to provide two stool samples at baseline to assess STH ova by the Kato -Katz method. Eligible adolescents were physically examined and questioned for clinical symptoms by a trial physician prior to treatment administration . Trichuris trichiura -infected adolescents were randomly assigned to seven treatment arms: 8, 16, or 24 mg of moxidectin monotherapy; 8, 16, or 24 mg of moxidectin plus 400 mg of albendazole combination therapy; or placebo. The primary outcome was cure rate (CR) against T. trichiura, analyzed 13 to 20 days post-treatment . Adverse events were asses sed 3h , 24h, 48h, 72h and 13 -20 days after treatment, graded on severity, relatedness and expectedness as specified in the trial protocol. The second study was a Phase III, multi - country, randomi zed, standard of care -controlled, blinded, parallel group, si ngle dose, superiority trial on ivermectin -albendazole in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, People's ) and on Pemba Island , Tanzania between 2018 and 2020. The study was conducted in communities aged 6 -60 years . Screened individuals provided two stool samples at baseline, 14-21 days , six and 12 months post-treatment . Similar to the first study , the Kato -Katz method xv was employed for STH diagnosis and , in addition, an aliquot of stool (~1 g) was mixed with 80% ethanol and preserved at 4\u00b0C and later shipped at room temperature to Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute in Basel, Switzerland for subsequent qPCR analyses . Furthermore , fecal rapid tests (FC and FOB), were used as potential proxy markers for STH attributable morbidity . He nce, a semi -quantitative chromatographic test /Actim\u00ae Biochemica, Finland) was applied for FC and FOB detection from p articipants diagnosed positive for T. trichiura and concomitant STH infections and identified STH negative participants as controls. Before treatment administration, all participants underwent a physical examination and a rapid diagnostic test for hemoglobin levels, pregnancy in all female participants (12 years), malaria (C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Lao was applied . Drug efficacies (in terms of egg reduction rates (ERR s) and CR s), reinfections and new infections were assessed 14 -21 days , six and 12 months post -treatment. Adverse events were captured 3h, 24h and 14 -21 days after treatment, graded on severity, relatedness and expectedness as specified in the trial protocol. Results : We found that 8 mg of moxidectin (the lowest tested dose) performed as well as 16 mg and 24 mg, and that the combination of moxidectin and albendazole was significantly more efficacious against T. trichiura than albendazole alone . Likewise, we revealed sup eriority of the ivermectin -albendazole combination therapy compared to albendazole alone against T. trichiura infections in Lao PDR and on Pemba Island . Similarly, the ivermectin -albendazole combination therapy led to a larger reduction of moderate and hea vy T. trichiura infections and successfully reduced the prevalence of these infections to b elow 1.5 % within 12 months. However, ivermectin -albendazole was not found to be superior to albendazole alone in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. Moreover , we observed a sensit ivity of qPCR compared to quadruple Kato -Katz, revealing significantly lower CRs for ivermectin -albendazole, when two qPCR samples were assessed pre- and post -treatment. In addition, we did not find an association between the presence of intestinal inflammation or mucosal bleeding, assessed with FC and FOB as respective proxy markers, and STH infection status or infection intensity. xvi Conclusion: Promising efficacies and sa fety for moxidectin -albendazole - albendazole against T. trichiura were found . Hence, both drug combinations might be valuable alternatives in PC programs. The combination of 8 mg moxidectin and 400 mg albendazole should be further investigate d in younger age groups, with longer follow -up periods and in different settings to help guiding recommendations for future STH control . Prior to MDA implementation with ivermectin -albendazole, careful decisions on the frequency of deworming adapted to the epidemiological pa rasite profile in each setting have to be made , while variations in treatment responses should be considered . In addition to that, standardized and accurate molecular diagnostic tools, which are appli cable in peripheral field settings for the assessment of drug efficacy and for future monitoring within STH control and/or elimination programs, should be developed. Further studies are needed to identify suitable, standardized, low-cost proxy markers of S TH attributable morbidity to monitor the clinical impact of STH control interventions. A strategic plan adapted to each setting with a distinct focus on community engagement and workforce is crucial for successful preparation, screening and implementation of randomized controlled trials. Gained knowledge on improvements of trial methodology, trial procedures and mitigation strategies to overcome challenges faced durin g clinical research in resource -constrained healthcare environments are valuable informatio n that should be made available to the related research network. Moreover, potential drug donors and preferably local anthelmintic drug production facilities will need to be identified to meet the demand for STH in es, die Kurz - und Langzeitergebnisse 14 -21 Tage, 6 und der molekularen zwischen 16 16 oder 24 mg plus - auf der Insel (ERR) und CR s), Reinfektionen und Neuinfektionen wurden wie 16 mg angepasst ist und ei nen au 24 mg ya moxidectini pamoja na 400 mg ya tiba mchanganyiko ya bila dawa. Matokeo ya msingi ilikuwa na ufanisi mg ya ya kudhibiti STH. Chapter 1 Introduction Neglected tropical diseases (NTD s) are a diverse group of 20 diseases generally marked by a high level of morbidity to gether with economic impairment [1, 2] . Hence, poverty is usually considered a root cause of NTDs and , thus, affect s disadvantaged population groups with limited access to preventive and curative health services [1]. Following that, these diseases do not occur in isolation; in most tropical and subtropical countries at least five to six diseases occur within the sam e region [3]. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), NTD s can be control led, prevented and possibly eliminated by the combination of effective solutions. Strategies for the control or elimination of individual diseases have been defined in several WHO documents, whilst the objectives for the control, elimination or eradication of the associated clinical conditions have been defined by the World Health Assembly (WHA) resolutions [4]. Among all 20 NTDs, h uman helminthiase s impose the largest burden [5-7] and cause the highest disease burden [8, 9] . Important contextual determinants for human helminth infection are poverty, lack of sanitation and i nadequate personal and domestic hygiene practices [10- 12]. Co-infections with more than one soil-transmitted are common in such socio systems [13], contributing to substantial morbidity . 11. Helminth infections Parasitic worms, also known as helminths, are multicellular parasites adapted to living most of their lives within vertebrate hosts. Accompanying diseases caused by these worms are known as helminthiase s. Helminth parasite species belong to two of the lowe r invertebrate phyla within the animal kingdom STHs, which are transmitted t hrough soil c ontaminated with f ecal matter and caused the dwarf threadworm (Strongyloides stercoralis ) that is usually considered separately and lacks inclusion in most STH control programs [14]. Nematode eggs (also called ova) and larvae contaminate soil by thriving in warm and moist soils [13]. Human infection with STHs is caused by skin penetration of larvae (A. duodenale and N. americanus ) or by accidental ingestion of embryonated eggs through either contaminated food , water or soil (A. lumbricoides , T. trichiura and occasionally A. duodenale ). Excreted h elminth ova are resistant to various environmental conditions and can remain viable in fresh wat er, soil and sewage for several months, waiting to infect a host [15-17]. The focus of this PhD work lies on A. lumbricoides , T. trichiura and hookworm , the three most STH species [13]. 1.1 Global burden of soil-transmitted helminths Intestinal helminths have afflicted humans throughout history; the earl iest findings of parasitic worm eggs were found in co prolites (fossilized feces) from mummified humans dating back to both Old World and New World archaeological sites [18, 19] . Within the la st century, STH infections were prevalent in parts of Europe, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the s outhern states of America but STH transmission has been successfully eliminated [20]. Today, STH infections are disproportionately more prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions, where favorable ecologies converge with poverty , over -crowded living conditions , poor san itation 2infrastructure and unsatisfactory educational coverage [21]. Globally, estimates of 1.45 billion affected individuals were reported in 2010 (Figure 1) [8]. Infections with A. lumbricoides are the most prevalent among STH infections , followed by T. trichiura and hookworm infections [22]. Soil-transmitted helminth prevalence decreased from 39 % in 1990 to 26% in 2010 [8], while more than one quarter of sub-Sahara n Africa 's population was infected with at least one STH species in 2003 [23, 24] . Figure 1 . The global prevalence of soil -transmitted helminths . Combined prevalence of any STH infection, based on geostatistical models for sub -Saharan Africa and available empirical information for all other areas by Pullan et al., 2014. Accurate estimates of the global di sease burden and the number of deaths caused by STH infections are complex, as the diseases are mostly asymptomatic or symptoms are non- specific to helminths. There is only limited and highly variable data on the frequency of complications or the number of deaths attributed to STH infections [25]. Most recent estimates from 2017 reported 3 '205 deaths worldwide attributed to ascariasis, while no estimates of death attributable to trichuriasis or hookworm infections were calc ulated [26]. Hence, no reliable estimates of mortality exist [27]. In general, STH infections cause disability rather than 3deaths; therefore , their global burden is commonly expressed in disability -adjusted life years (DALY s). Though there has been a reduction in DALYs attributed by intestinal helminth infection s (32.3% from 2007 -2017) the globa l burden of STH infections remains high with 1.92 million DALY's in 2017 [28]. From the A. lumbricoides , to hookworm and 11 % to T. trichiura [28]. However, t he economic burden has not been clearly esti mated for STHs, due to lack of precise detail about the nature of STH attributable morbidity [29]. 1.2 Life cycle of soil -transmitted helminths The life cycle of helminth infections is fundamentally different from that of all other infectious agents [30]. Each helminths life cycle involves a transition from an egg into an intermediate larva and then into an adult stage . With the exception of S. stercoralis , helminths cannot reproduce within the human host [31]. If an infected host defecates outside (in a fie ld, garden or near bushes) or if the feces of infected individual s are used as fertilizer, eggs are deposited on soil. These fertilized eggs of T. trichiura and A. lumbricoides and the larvae of hookworm develop in the soil to the infective stage [13]. In detail, a fter a human host accidentally ingests T. trichiura infective eggs, t hese will hatch in the small intestine [32] and release larvae that mature into adult worm s in the colon. Adult worms , with an approximate length of 4 cm , fix themselves in the cecum and ascending colon, with the ir anterior port ion embedded in the mucosa (Figure 2.1) [33]. The female worms start to oviposit within 60 to 70 days shedding between 3 '000 to 20'000 eggs per day and per worm over an average life span of one year. These fertilized but unembryonated eggs are released with the hosts' feces , becoming infective (embryonated) within 15 to 30 days in the soil [34]. 4 Figure 2.1. Diagrammatic representation of the life cycle of Trichuris trichiura . From CDC, Creative Commons (Center for Disease Control and Prevention , 2015. Parasites [Online]. Available at: http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/ ). In the case of ingestion of A. lumbricoides ova, first-stage larvae ha tch in the large intestine , release third stage larvae, covered by the second stage larvae cuticle [35]. These larvae penetrate the colon mucosa and undergo a hepato -tracheal migration. After shedding the second -stage cuticle in the liver, the larvae migrate to the pulmona ry circulation. In the lungs, larvae are further maturing (in between ten and 14 days) , penetrating the alveolar walls and ascending the b ronchial system to the throat. Mature l arvae are then swallowed again reaching the lumen of the small intestine where they develop into adult worms (Figure 2.2) [36]. The female worms, with a length up to 35 cm , start to oviposit within 60 to 90 days shedding 240'000 eggs per day and per worm over an average life span o f one to two years [13, 37] . The hepato - tracheal migration step is contributing to both liver and lung pathology in the infected host [38, 39]. 5 Figure 2.2. Diagrammatic representation of the life cycle of Ascaris lumbricoides . From CDC, Creative Commons (Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015. Parasites [Online]. Available at: http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/ ). In the case of A. duodenale and N. ameri canus infection s, eggs hatch and moult twice in soil under moist, warm and shady conditions until infective third-stage larva e emerge [40]. These larvae infect the human host either by penetrat ing the skin (N. americanus and A. duoden ale), of the typically bare feet human host, or via oral ingestion ( A. duodenale ). Following host entry, larvae are carried through blood vessels to the heart and further transported to the lungs. After invading the alveoli, the larvae ascend the bronchial system to the pharynx and are swallowed descending to the intestine . After reaching the jejunum , hookworm larvae mature and moult twice to develop into the final mature worms (Figure 2.3) [40]. Depending on the species, it takes between 28 -50 days until females start to oviposit. Each female A. duodenale produce s between 25'000 and 30'000 ova per day, while N. americanus lays between 9'000 and 10'000 6ova per day [13]. The adult worms can attach themselves to the intestinal wall for one to eight years [13, 40] . Figure 2.3. Diagrammatic representation of the life cycle of intestinal hookworm. From CDC, Creative Commons (Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015. Parasites [Online]. Available at: http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/ ). All STH species are dioecious ; therefore, reproductivity depends on the presence or absence of male worms in the intestine. Only fertilized eggs become infective after their rel ease into appropriate environmental conditions [34]. 1.3 STH attributable morbidity and clinical features Chronic infections with soil -transmitted helminths cause disorders that predominantly affect infants [41], pre-school aged children (pre -SAC) and school -aged children (SAC) and women of reproductive age (WRA) [13, 42] . Heavily infected individuals are both at highest risk of disease and the main source of environmental contamination [43]. Hen ce, the infection intensity is the key determinant of morbidity, although the association between presence and 7severity of disease and excreted eggs in feces is complex [44]. It is assumed that light intensity infections cause minimal harm, whereas moderate and heavy infecti ons cause substantial morbidity [45]. As STH attributable morbidity is related to the number of parasites harbor ed by the host [46], atte mpts have been made to classify infection intensities based on egg counts [47]. Both WHO [48] and the Global Burden of Disease Study [28] use infection intensity as the indicator to evaluate STH attributable morbidity. Peak worm burden of T. trichiura and A. lumbricoides occur in hosts aged between 10 and 14 years despite initial infection of most hosts in their first year of life , hence, exhibit convex epidemiological curves (Figure 3). The decline in frequ ency and intensity in adulthood might be due to acquired immunity, decreased exposure or the combination of these two factors [49]. In contrast to that, hookworm p revalence increases until it plateaus in adulthood (Figure 3) [42, 50] . Moreover, there is a small body of evidence for an increased susceptibility to T. trichiura infection in certain individuals, determined by behavioral, environmental, genetic and immunological factors . Individuals that were previously infected are more likely to become reinfected following treatment compared to uninfected individuals [51]. Likewise, heavily infected individuals tend to reacquire a heavy worm burden post -treatment [52]. 8 Figure 3. Age -prevalence and age -intensity curves for helminth infections in endemic populations . A) Age -distribution of T. trichiura infection in an endemic Caribbean community (adapted from [53]); B) Age -distribution of A. lumbricoides infection in a highly endemic Brazilian community (adapted from [54]); C) Age -distribution of N. americanus infection in a highly endemic Brazilian community (adapted from [54]). Solid lines (B, C) indicate prevalence (left y axis) and dashed lines indicate arithmeti c intensity of infection (right y axis). Maximum scale values vary between graphs. Around 4% of all T. trichiura infection s cause complications defined as heavy infestations [22]. As T. trichiura worms directly attach themselves to the mucosa to feed , a local inflammation of the large intestine and cecum and blood loss are common [26]. Moreover , T. trichiura can induce massive infantile trichuriasis, also known as Trichuris dysentery syndrome , that includ es bloody mucoid diarrhea, anemia, rectal prolapse , rectal bleeding and finger clubbing 9[52]. In the case of A. lumbricoides , about 7% of those infected suffer from ascariasis complications [22]. Clinical presentations are directly related to the parasites' life cycle as l arval migration through the lungs and the liv er induces various symptoms, such as lung infiltration, cough and intense eosinophilia, known as L\u00f6ffler syndrome [55]. Further symptoms are urticaria, dyspnea, hemoptysis, cough and abnormal breath [26]. In heavily infected individuals, morbidity is caused b y impairment of nutrition intake and absorption leading to impaired child growth . This might be due to intestinal obstruction, when a large number of worms are present in the small intestine , a common cause for emergency resection in young children in ende mic countries [56-59]. Around 13% of in dividuals infected by hookworm experience complications mostl y caused by mechanical damage on the intestinal mucosa induced by the parasite feeding . One bite into the intestinal mucosa by an adult worm is estimated to cause a blood loss of 0.03-0.26 mL per day, depending on the species [60-62]. Hookworm infections are assumed to be the causative factor of iron -deficiency an emia in more than 5% of cases in Africa and Asia [63]. Additional sequelae include inflammation and ulcers resulting from the mechanical damage on the intestinal mucosa [64]. Estimates on STH related effects on nu trition remain unclear, as this depends on the definition of worm burden, the status of co -infection, the drugs used for deworming and the downstream effect s on metabolism of nutrients [65]. Likewise, particularly non -specific symptoms, such as abdominal pain and diarrhea , are difficult to assign to a single cause, as individuals living in these regio ns are at risk of various intestinal protozoa n, bacterial and viral infections or are exposed to environmental hazards [26]. Children often suffer from co-infections with other helminths or malaria that lead to exacerbation of heavy infection s. Such polypara sitism remain typically underdiagnose d given the non -specific gastro intestinal symptoms [66-71]; however, they potentially contribute to impaired intellectual and cognitive development [72-75]. Moreover, helminth infection might increase morbidity of HIV/AIDS and malaria and potentially impair their vaccine efficacy [76]. Overall, STH infections tend to be long -lasting infections in nature with recurring infections [67] and have a negative impact on pregnanc y, birth outcomes and children's growth which are 10associated with impaired cognitive and motor development of infants and lowered educational achievements [77]. These manifestations , may in turn, have potential long -term consequences, hence, may interfere with productivity an d wage -earning capacity in adulthood [29, 78] . However, there is lack of precise detail about the nature of STH attributable morbidity, thus, adequate morbidity markers are need ed, which is tackled in objective 4 of this PhD thesis. 1.4. T ransmission dynamics and the environment Due to the maturation time until the parasite reaches its infective stage in the soil , there is no direct person -to-person transmission nor infection from fresh stool . Since multiplication within the host is not possible for these w orms, re infection occurs only from a new infection (contact with infective stages). Following that, e ach adult worm within a host is the result of a separate infection event. The intensity of infection (size of worm burden) is, thus, the main determinant of helminth transmission dynamics and the major determinant of morbidity [43]. The intensity of infection and the infection -related morbidity are functions of continuing exposure to contaminated enviro nment s, that leads to progressive accumulation of more intense infection [79]. Therefore, low worm burden typically leads to a reduction in transmission of infection because of the increased number of unfertilized eggs. Environmental conditions have generally a strong impact on the components of the species' transmission cycles, as parasite survival is majorly influenced by aridity, altitude and by land surface temperature. Experimental studies have demonstrated that the infective stages ideally develop at temperatures between 28 and 32 \u00b0C. The viability of A. lumbricoides and T. trichiu ra cease at temperatures below 5 \u00b0C and a bove 38 \u00b0C [80], while the of hookworm larvae halt at 40 \u00b0C [81]. Moreover, soil moisture and relative atmospheric humidity is needed for the development of STH ova [20, 82] . Interestingly, although seasonal dynamics in transmission may occur, such fluctuations are less likely to affect overall transmission success and STH patterns, as the life span of adult parasites is longer than the seasonal changes with hampering environmental factors [83]. 11The basic reproductive number, define d as the a verage number of successful offspring from a single mature female adult worm [46], is highest for T. trichiura (4-6) and lowest for hookworm (2-3) [83]. In addition, the distribution of worms amo ng the hosts is highly over dispersed ; most individuals are harbor ing light infections , whereas a few hosts have a disproportionally high worm burden [84, 85] . Individuals harbor ing a high worm population are at greater risk of disease, are more like ly to suffer from STH attributable morbidity and mortality, and account for the main driver of environmental contamination [86]. Moreover, socio -economically deprived communities living in field huts are at greater risk for STH infection. If open defecation is common practice , children may walk barefoot through contaminated environments, which increas es the risk for favorable STH transmission [87]. Other major transmission factor s for STH are the use of night soil as fertilizer [88], the absence of safely managed sanitation services [89, 90] and the lack of an effective protective immunity [91]. Hence, all aforementioned factors favor rapid reinfection post-treatment , obse rved in prevalence and intensity profiles bouncing back to pre -treatment levels [92], an important fact that will be further discussed in Chapter 10.2. 3. 1.5. Helminth immunology A host-parasite interaction has developed along with the evolvement of the life cycles of each species . This interaction includes mechanisms to limit pathology and to best balance immune pathogenesis, resistance a nd susceptibility of the parasites [93]. The capacity of parasite populations to reinfect hosts post -treatment is a remarkable feature of helminth immunology [94]. Most evidence on immune responses on STHs use rodent -specific STH species in a laboratory setting, as it remains challenging to study immunity to human helminthiases due to the difficulty to account for infection expo sure and history, polyparasitism and genetic heterogeneity [26]. The typical feature of the immune response to acute helminth invasion is the production and subsequent mobilization of various proteins (e.g., cytokines, immunoglobulin and eosinophils), 12a predominant T helper 2 (Th2) immune response [95]. When inhabiting different niches of their human host, helminth parasites cause damage to the host tissues. Adult T. trichiura worms embed their head part into a intracellular niche in the larg e intestine [96] causing petechial lesions, blotchy mucosal hemorrhage and oozing leading to both, and systemic immune responses [97-99]. Likewise , hookworm larvae use their cutting plates to attach to the mucosa to begin feedin g and molting into stage macrophages [101] . these cells into the intestinal mucosa and degranulation inside the intestinal lumen leads to increased secretion of FC as a response to local inflammation [102, 103] . Therefore, we investigated FC as a potential proxy marker for disease activity in individuals infected and non - infected wit h STHs, as specified in objective 4. However, with increasing levels of parasite antigens, when a chronic stage of infection is established, macrophages start to suppress T -cell proliferation and boost the development of modified Th2 cells. Hence, the auto nomous immune response is not fully triggered by the invasion of helminths into the human host and the elimination of parasites becomes difficult [104, 105] . These anti -parasite immune responses might have developed to limit parasite load and to promote wound healing, rather than rapidly expulsing the entire parasite burden [106] . In general , it seems that STH s are equipped with a battery of immunomodulatory mechanisms as they secrete and excrete various parasite -derived molecules that are antigenic and immunomodulatory in order manipulate, inhibit or acti vate host gene expression to best accommodate the host throughout their relatively long lifespan [107-112]. Indeed, the re is a fairly large body of evidence pointing to a c onsistent Th2 cell modification rather than a suppression of the host immune system, which includes parasite tolerance and dampening of bystander antigens, autoimmunity or allergy by direct secretion of anti -inflammatory molecules [113] . Moreover, t his immunomodulation is possibly also responsible for the lack of an immunological memory, thus enabling rapid reinfections in endemic countries post -treatment [114] . Currently , research on immunomodulation is underway to elucidate the potential use of 13helminths for therapy [111] , but it also paves the way for novel therapeutic approaches for helminthiases and the development of anti -parasite vaccines [111, 115] . 142. Soil-transmitted helminth c ontrol strategies Historically, t he fact that human helminths mainly cause non -specific and non -lethal acute symptoms, with morbidity slowly developing over years, limited the priority for contro l strategies, compared to other, more lethal diseases (e.g., HIV /AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis ) [116] . However, due to the burden on childhood development and economic productivity caused by human helminths [116] , contr ol of STH s has become a public health priority in the two last decade s [21]. The first global control strategy to combat STH infection was initiated in 2001, when t he WHA resolution urged member states to start periodic dewormi ng of at least 75% of at-risk SAC with benzimidazoles (i.e., albend azole, mebendazole) to continuously reduce the global disease burden [4]. As mention ed in Chapter 1.4, soil plays an important role in all of the STH life cycles, thus, any successful control approach must prevent fecal contamination with eggs and contact with contaminated soil and water sources. Hence, t he key public health policy for endemic countries should include the strategy to control morbidity by regular deworming , WASH interventions and health education [117] . 2.1 Large -scale deworming World Health Organization introduced the term preventive chemotherapy (PC) for their control strategy to empirically treat populations at -risk of human helminth diseases without prior individual diagnosis in a defined geographic region. This strategy repea tedly reduces worm burden with the aim of limiting the progressive damage of recurrent infections [118, 119] , with oral single -doses ich are both benzimidazoles carbamates . This approach entails active identification of population groups at risk, delivery of a monodose of anthelmintic drugs often by non -medical personnel (community drug distributors , teachers or volunteers ) and use of non -medical settings such as delivering t he medication on a door -to-door approach to target population groups [120] . Albendazole and mebendazole have been extensively used since the 1980 s and are still the most common 15anthelmintic drugs , both as monotherapies and, more recently, in combination with other drugs (e.g., albendazole -ivermectin against mebendazole itself, selectively bind to the colchicine - binding site of -tubulin of the helminth's microtubules to inhibit the microtubule polymerization. This subsequently leads to selective degeneration of cytoplasmic microtubules in intestinal and tegmental cells of intestinal nematodes and larvae [121-123]. Preventive Chemotherapy is recommended as a yearly public health intervention for all children above 12 months of age in areas where any STH baseline prevalence is between 20 and 50% . Bi-annual adminis tration is recommended where prevalence exceeds 50% in a specific area [65]. The p rogress of implemented PC programs is ideally monitored every 2 -3 years and re -evaluat ed 5-6 years after annual PC implementation to determine the upcoming steps (Figure 4 ) [120] . Figure 4. Decision tree by WHO for preventive chemotherapy for soil -transmitted helminthiasis. 16TAS, transmission assessment survey. Adapted from the WHO's 2030 targets [48]. The impact of PC is assessed by the change of infection intensities, which is known to be the indicator for STH attributable morbidity. Hence, the current goal of STH elimination as a publ ic health problem is a prevalence under 2% of moderate and heavy infection intensities in pre - SAC and SAC by 2030 [66]. According to recent estimates, 96 STH endemic countries were in need of PC in 2018 [124] . Mass drug administration (MDA) campaigns are usually organized by national health services that also undertake drug delivery . Such programs have been mainstays of STH control and their successful implementation on national scales have substanti ally reduced STH prevalence [125] . According to the WHO, more than 3.3 billi on benzimidazole tablets have been donated to helminth endemic countries since 2010 [126] . The estimated costs for each treatment administration is 0.012 -0.91 US$ [127, 128] . Funding for these MDA campaigns (also referred to as deworming ) is provided by various sources , such as bilateral donors, the endemic countries, international organization trust funds and non -governmental development organizations [129] . In 2012, WHO published its first roadmap for the elimination of several NTDs by 2020. Likewise, the London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases, a collaborative control program c onsisting of various players that committed to control, eliminate or eradicate NTDs by 2020, was created [130] . The goals put for th by WHO for 2020 was that (i) 75% of pre -SAC and SAC in need of chemotherapy are treated regularly and that a (ii) 75% coverage with PC is achieved in pre -SAC and SAC in 100% of countries [131] . This target was well on track i n 2018, with a coverage rate of 60% for SAC and 40% for pre -SAC [126] . These aims were recently adjusted by WHO for 2030 and include (i) the a chieve ment and maintenance of the elimination of STH morbidity in pre -SAC and SAC , (ii) the establishment of an efficient STH contr ol program for adolescents , WRA and pregnant women and (iii) the certainty to provide universal access to at least basic sanitation and hygiene in STH endemic areas [48]. Hence, three population groups are now recognized as at -risk group s (i) SAC, initial target; (ii) pre-SAC; and (iii) WRA . However, various countries have not yet started to 17implement strategies that also include th e latter target population. In 2019, the pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson announced to extend the current donations by providing one billion of the newly formulated chewable mebenda zole tablets to high -burden countries between 2021 which allow s extending treatment to pre-SAC [133] . The PC coverage rate is expected to increase, as more endemic countries planned to scale up their PC programs . Estimates by Montresor et al. show, that if PC implementation continues to scale up, the STH attributable morbidity in children might be reduced to almost zero by 2025 [126, 134]. However, the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic might hinder these developments due to postponed MDA campaigns. 2.1.1 Limitation of preventive chemotherapy The success story of PC of being a cost -effective approach [135] to reduce STH attributable morbidity, is hampered by four main challenges. First, the currently used anthelmintic drugs show limitations in their efficacy profile [136] . Therefore , better treatment options with r epeated and more frequent drug administration might be needed to further decrease local prevalence of helminth infections [137] . Second, t he strategy of periodic drug administration does not prevent reinfection in areas where environmental and human behavior al factors favor transmission [92]. Hence, t hese affected individuals and population groups continue to be at risk of chronic long -term manifestations. High reinfection rates were demonstrated for A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura in a meta -analysis by Jia et al. , showing that the prevalence 12 months post -treatment tend s to regress back to pre -treatment l evels [92]. Third, even though the aim is to include WRA in STH contr ol, delivering PC in adolescent girls and WRA remains a challenge; extra care is needed to ensure that girls and women are not pregnant. Moreover, this group may not be easily reached within the existing infrastructure and additional resources are potentially require d [65]. In response to that, WHO is currently developing a policy paper supporting PC for p regnant women to keep STH morbidity low within this risk group [126] . 18Fourth, because of extensive long -term use of th e same anthelmintic drugs for the control of roundworms in livestock, frequent and rapid resistance to all three major anthelmintic classes (benzimidazoles, imidothiazoles -tetrahydropyrimidines and macrocyclic lactones) h as developed. This should raise awareness for upcoming anthelmintic resistance in humans. Indeed, Moser et al. demonstrated a decrease in efficacy of albendazole against T. trichiura over the past two decades [136] . Despite the limitations of PC, MDA campaigns remain the cornerstone of STH control to attain elimination of helminthiases, therefore, future directions will be discussed in Chapter 10 of this PhD thesis . 2.2 Integrated control approach es Due to the aforementioned limitation s of PC , it is imperative to also develop more sustainable non-chemotherapeutic health interventions in order to make the control strategy more comprehensive. 2.2.1 Water, sanitation and h ygiene (WASH) The United Nation's General Assembly as well as the WHO adopted the aim to ensure universal access to basic sanitation and hygiene in STH endemic areas to be achieved by 2030. This includ es to end open defecation and to increas e access to safely managed sanitation services , safe disposal of child feces , shoe -wearing and hand -washing [126, 138] . As transmission of STHs occurs via soil contaminated with human feces , leading to rapid reinfection , sustainable long -term solutions require improveme nts in WASH. WASH refers to the collective term \"water, sanitation and hygiene\" and includes strategies to improve the ability to access safe water (quality, quantity and the distance to the water source), adequate sanitation ( e.g., ventilated -improved pit latrines including ways to separate human waste from human contact to prevent risk of contamination and exposure to feces harbor ing infectious STH eggs) and hygiene ( e.g., nurturing good hygiene practices, such as handwashing with 19soap) [89]. Improvements in WASH potentially lead to less soil and water contamination and therefore, reduce transmission [139] . Indeed, the risk of STH infection has been sho wn to be significantly decrease d if sanitary facilities are in place and used [11]. Moreover, a systematic review and meta -analysis by Strunz et al. found that WASH access and practices were generally associated with reduced odds of STH infection [89]. These researcher s indicated that improved WASH, including access to sanitation facilities, access to piped water, wearing shoes and handwashing with so ap, were associated with a 33 -70% lower odds of infection [89]. Nowadays, it is widely recognized that compl ementary control methods, in addition to the rather short -term effects of PC, are crucial to reduce the re -exposure to STHs and ultimately cut transmission. However, the magnitude of benefit, in terms of efficiency and cost - effectiveness, from WASH interventions for STH control remains unclear [140]. Hence , context -specific, complementary interventions to suppo rt WASH programs and deworming need to be identified in future research . Some of these interventions might be relatively cheap and simple [141] ; while piped water require s remarkable improvements in regional infrastructure, household and community scale water treatment using ultraviolet light emitting diodes to reduce exposure to helminth eggs and larvae might be a feasible and low -cost intervention [140] . Another strategy to reduce environmental contamination is the so-called \"community -led total sanitation\" (CLTS) , which has already been successfully implemented in various settings. The aim of CLTS is to induce a change in sanitati on behavior (e.g., end open defecation) stimulated by the community. Th e main strategy is to trigger local action that may lead to adoption, awareness and improvement of hygiene practices within the community [142] . Moreover , progress in WASH will not only reduce STH infections, but is likely to have a positive impact on other pathogens, including intesti nal protozoa, bacterial and viral infection that cause severe diarrhea [143] , society and the well -being of people living in resource -constraint countries [141] . 202.2.2 Health education Helminthias is is a preventable disease and , thus, a crucial factor for successful improvements in helminth control migh t be achieved with health educ ation. The primary goal of health education is to induc e individual behavior change s by improving knowledge , attitudes and practices to reduce the risk of infection [144] . Hence , health education together with con trol strategies , such as PC, might enhance the impact of control strategies by increasing acceptance for treatment , leading to optimized treatment coverage and by creating awareness for a disease within the community [86]. A cluster -randomized intervention study in China observed that the incidence of infection with STHs was 50% lower in children receiving a health -education package over a period of one yea r. Another study from the Peruvian Amazon reported similar results, as the implemented school -based health hygiene education intervention was effective in increasing STH knowledge as well as reducing A. lumbricoides infection . In addition, the effect of he alth education might be optimized, when parents and teachers are involved in education interventions [145] . Based on the rationale , that the risk of STH infection and reinfection could be reduced [86, 146] through adequate knowledge and sustained behavioral changes, the integration of health education strategies as a complementary measure in disease control is, therefore , recommended by WHO [45]. Such health education interventions may be delivered inexpensively by teachers in schools, by strengthening health -related behavior in children [147, 148] . Moreover, behavior al changes might be best achieved and sustained with simultaneous improvements in infrastructure (i.e. , increase of latrine and safe water use ) to facilitat e proper daily hygiene practices . However, to date, integration of such complementary interventions remain insufficiently funded [149] . 213. Anthelmintic drug efficacies The two indicators used to assess the efficacy of an anthelmintic drug in human medicine, are the cure rate (CR) and the egg reduction rate (ERR). Cure rate is a qualitative measure of the percentage of infected individuals at baseline that no longer excre te eggs post-treatment. The ERR is a quantitative indicator and describes the relative change in eggs per gram post- compared to pre -treatment. 3.1 Current treatment options Albendazole (dose of 400 mg) , ivermectin (dose of 200 \u00b5g kg-1), levamisole (dose o f 2.5 mg kg-1), mebendazole (dose of 500 mg) , niclosamide (dose of 500 mg) , praziquantel (dose of 40- 60mg kg-1) and pyrantel (dose of 10 mg kg-1) are currently on the Essential List of Medicines by WHO used against intestinal helminths [150] . Single doses of 400 mg of albendazole or 500 mg of mebendazole are used in most MDA campaigns, while a half dose of albendazole (200 mg) is suggested for children aged 1 -2 years [44]. Additionally , albendazole and mebendazole can also be administered to pregnant and lactating women, with exception of the first trimester in pregnancy. However, in practice, only Nepal and Sri Lanka have included anthelmintics in their antenatal care programs so far [151] . In 2013, WHO published reference efficacies of albendazole and mebendazole to reduce the influence of suboptimal drug regimens, when e valuating other anthelmintic drugs (Table 1) . Table 1. Reference efficacy for benzimidazoles, the standard of care (adapted from WHO, 2013 [152] ). STH species Reference efficacy (arithmetic mean -based egg reduction rate, %) albendazole (chewable tablet, 400 mg) mebendazole (500 mg) Trichuris trichiura 50 Ascaris lumbricoides 22A review and on albendazole, meben dazole, levamisole and pyrantel found that all of these drugs show high efficacy, both in terms of CRs and ERR s, against A. lumbricoides . Efficacy results for hookworm depend highly on the drug used , with only albendazole show ing acceptable results ( CR = 80%, ERR = 90%). However, none of the drugs show ed sufficient performance against T. trichiura , with mebendazole revealing the highest efficacy (CR = 42%, ERR = 66%) [136] . 3.2 Approaches to improve efficacy The present tiny pharmacopeia of available anthelmintic s, the low CR of the currently used drugs, particularly against T. trichiura [136] , the extensive and repeated use of these drugs in MDA programs [153] , and the contraindication in early pregnancy, depict the urgency for novel treatment options. However, d rug discovery and developm ent are hampered by high costs, long durations and an inherent risk of failure to develop new treatments. One strategy to improve the efficacy of the currently used drugs is to apply a multiple dose regimen: multiple doses on the same d ay, single doses over multiple days or multiple doses over multiple days . Indeed, several studies found considerably higher efficacy against hookworm when m ebendazole was administered once or twice over three consecutive days compared to a single dose regimen [154-157]. In addition, some studies reported considerably higher efficacy for a triple dose of albendazole (one dose over three consecutive days) compared to a monodose against hookworm and T. trichiura infections [157-159], while a multiple dose regimen with mebendazole did not substantially increase efficacy against T. trichiura [154, 160] . Another strategy might be the us e of higher doses of the standard medication. Recent studies by Patel et al. found higher efficacy with a single 800 mg dose of albendazole against hookworm, but not against T. trichiura [161, 162] . In any case , in anticipation of the development of potential drug resistance , due to high drug pressure, other strategies should be investigated. The use of d rug combination s might be one way forward to improve efficacy , due to dissimilar modes of action, and to potentially delay drug resistance. 23Several studies show that combinat ion of two or three anthelmintic drugs increase efficacy [163-168] and m athematical mo delling indicated that the likelihood of development of human resistance to anthelmintic s is significantly delayed when drug combinations are used [169] . In addition, drug repurpo sing might bypass some of the obstacles described above by investigating ex isting compounds or advanced clinical candidates for new therapeutic purposes [170] . Therefore, t he use of repurposed drugs in combination with the standard of care might emerge as promising broad -spectrum antiparasitic therapy approach by enhancing treatment efficacies . 3.3 Promising drug alternatives In 2016, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation hosted an expert panel to review existing data on potential drug candidates th at could be used in combination with the standard of care . The two repurposed drugs, m oxidectin and ivermectin , in combination with albendazole , were both on this list. Within the framework of this PhD work , efficacies and safety of moxidectin and ivermectin were assessed in two clinical trials; hence, I will briefly introduce these drugs . 3.3.1 Moxidectin Moxide ctin was developed in the 1980 s, first sold in 1990 and is, since then, widely used in veterinary medicine against heartworms, lungworms and whipworms the milbemycin class, which is a product from the actinomycete Streptomyces cyanogriseus [172] glutamate -gated chloride channels with high affinit y. The increase of chloride ion influx leads to hyperpolarization of t he targeted cells, resulting in paralysis of the body -wall muscles and the pharynx of nematodes [173] . The white tablet is available in 2 mg doses and is administered orally in a weight and height independent manner . Moxidectin is rapidly absorbed , but drug concentration declines only slowly in the plasma, resulting in a half -life time of 20 to 35 days [174] . Food intake can 24modestly slow the absorption and increases the b ioavailability, but these increases are not clinically relevant. Hence, moxidectin can be dosed regardless previous food intake [175] . Moxidectin is minimally metabolized in the liver by cytochromes P450 and is mostly excreted via the feces [176] . To date, no relevant effects of intrinsic factors (demography, hepatic function) nor extrinsic fa ctors (drug -drug interactions, effect of food) have been detected [174] , exhibiting an ideal profile for a global use in medicine. In 2018, the U nited States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved 8 mg of moxidectin for the human use against onchocerciasis in individuals aged 12 and older . A previous trial by Barda et al. using 8 mg of moxidectin in combination with albendazole showed promising efficacy against T. trichiura (CR = 51%, ERR = 98.5%) [177] . However, the optimal dos e of moxidect in to be used against T. trichiura and concomitant STH infections is yet to be determined. Therefore, we conducted a phase II randomized, plac ebo-controlled, dose -finding trial on Pemba Island in adolescents testing the efficacy and safety of 8, 16 and 24 mg of moxidectin alone and in combination with albendazole against T. trichiura and concomitant STH infections. 3.3.2 Ivermectin Ivermectin was discovered in 197 5 in Japan and was used first in animals in 1981 [178] . Hence, it was the first commercially available macrocyclic lactone endectocide [179] . Six year s later, ivermectin w as approved for human use after the conduct of several successful clinical trial s on onchocerciasis in Senegal [180-182]. Since then, ivermectin (Stromectol\u00ae, Scabo 6\u00ae) has been marketed by several pharmaceutical companies and is currently used successfully against discoverers shared the Nobel Prize in Medicine together with the discoverers of artemisinin in 2015 [184] . Ivermectin derives from the a vermectins, a c lass of broad -spectrum anti parasitic agents, which are isolated from the fermentation products of Streptomyces avermitilis . The primary target s are the glutamate -gated chloride ion channels that are present in inve rtebrate nerve and 25muscle cells . The mode of action is , thus, similar to moxidectin, as described above. Although ivermectin is active against several life cycle stages of many nematodes, it shows limited activity against some nematode stages ( e.g., adult form of Onchocerca volvulus ). Recent studi es describe potential additional targets (lipid metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation and acetylcholine receptor agonists) , which need further investigations [185, 186]. The white tablet is available in a 3 mg formulation and is administered orally in a weight - dependent manner. Plasma concentrations are approximately proportional to the dose and the plasma half -life in humans is around 18 ho urs after administration . Ivermectin is metabolized in the liver (mainly by cytochrome 450 enzymes) and its metabolites are almost completely excreted in the feces within 12 days post administration. A high -fat meal prior to administration resulted in an a pproximate 2.5 -fold i ncrease in bioavailability than the administration in the fasted state. Ivermectin has been extensively proven safe in huma ns treated in control programs for onchocerciasis . Hence, administration by non -medical staff with basic trainin g in remote communities can be applied and, thus, exhibit beneficial effect s for the most rural communities in need for treatment. Long -term studies with ivermectin , when used in MDA campaigns for reduc tions in STH prevalence [187] , which paved the way to also test its efficacy against STHs. Indeed, a recent m eta-analysis by Palmeirim et al., show ed higher efficacy of ivermectin combined with albendazole against T. trichiura compared to albendazole alone [188] . In 201 7, the use of iv ermectin was added to the WHO Lists of Essential Medicines [189] , preceding the application in deworming programs. The second and third objective of this PhD thesis was to evaluate th e ivermectin -albendazole combination in different transmission settings in a broad age range (6 -60 years ) and for a prolonged monitoring period of one year [190] in order to inform STH guidelines and programs on the potential benefit of the combined use of ivermectin an d albendazole against trichuriasis . 264. Diagnosis -transmitted helminths helminth are often asymptomati c or non -specific to helminths. Therefore, it is imperative to have reliable diagnostic tools for the accurate determination of the STH infection status and infection intensity. Adult female worms lay hundreds of eggs per day that are passed in feces, hence, d iverse diagnostic approaches including mic roscopy (detec tion of eggs or larvae) , serology (detection of antibodies and antigens), molecular techniques or radiology, have been employed and improved over the past decades [191] . The assessment of drug efficacy, community effectiveness of interventions, verification of local disease elimination and individual patient management strongly rely on the accuracy, defined by sensitivity and specificity, of the diagnostic tool [192-194]. However , the diagnosis of helminths has always been cumbersome and is hampered because of, but not limited to: (i) uneven distribution of eg gs within a single stool sample (within sample variations), (ii) day-to- day fluctuations of egg excretion (between sampl e variations), (iii ) egg count being t oo low for detection in stool, (iv ) amount of stool sample affecting the number of eggs present in the sample and (v) samples not being transported or stored properly [195, 196] . Additionally, polyparasitism is common and it remains a challenge to deve lop a reliable diagnostic tool that can provide an accurate diagnosis of all different helminth species. Despite considerable developments to control STH infections over several decades, consensus on a harmonized quality -assured diagnostic tool is still lacking. This might be mostly because of differing requirements for a diagnostic t ool, depending on the study purpose , such as the use in control programs (morbidity reduction ), elimination studies or drug efficacy trials. Guidelines by WHO for the selection of a diagnostic tool called ASSURED (affordable, sensitive, specific, user -friendly, rapid and robust, equipment -free, and deliverable to end - users) can be used as a benchmark for identifying the most appropriate tool for STH diagnosis [197, 198] . The burden of paras itic infections is highest in areas with limited resources, targeting morbidity reduction through MDA. The choice of diagnostic tools in control programs of res ource constrained settings thus mostly rely on simplicity (user -friendly and equipment - 27free), robustness and cost -effectiveness (i.e., time and resources required per test) [194] . Conventionally, the established metho ds to detect and quantify parasites ( i.e., eggs of a parasite) depend on light microscopy. Several copro micros copic methods have been developed ( such as the ether -concentration and McMaster technique s), of which the Kato -Katz thick smear remains the only technique recommended by WHO [152] . The duplicate Kato-Katz technique was developed more than half a century ago and is a non-invasive and relatively simple method for the detection of STH and other helminth eggs in fecal samples [152, 199, 200]. This copromiscroscopic method examines ~41.7 mg of a stained and sieved fecal sample to quantify stained eggs under the microscope (Figure 5). The preparation of a duplicate Kato- Katz thick smear (two smears of the same stool sa mple) requires around 2 7 minutes and costs about 2.1 US$ [201] . Figure 5 . Kato -Katz reading under a light micro scope on Pemba Island, Tanzania. Photos captured by Ladina Keller, 2019. Because a known amount of stool is analyzed , the egg counts can be expressed as infection intensity and classified into light, moderate and heavy, according to WHO recommendations, based on guidelines established by Montresor et al. (Table 2) [47]. 28 Table 2. Classes of infection intensity for soil -transmitted helminths (adapted from Montresor et al., 1998 [47]). STH species Light infections layer of hookworm eggs desiccates once the microscope slide is covered with a glycer ol-malachite green soaked cellophane paper [200] . The interval between the Kato - Katz slide preparation and examination under a microscope should ideally not exceed 30 -45 min to avoid underestimation of hookworm prevalence [202, 203] . However, the Kato -Katz technique is known to have low sensitivity for light STH infections [204, 205] . Because of that, the Kato -Katz method may lead to an underestimation of the actual preva lence, which in turn could result in an artificial inflation of CRs from undetected re sidual low-egg count infections post -treatment. As an effo rt to overcome this limitation, the performance of the Kato -Katz technique can be improved when multiple samples on different days and multiple examinations of the same sample are examined [204, 206, 207] . Other limitations include the limited possibility for sample storage [208] and the disintegration of hookworm eggs within one hour [209] . Of note, as co-infections with multiple STH species are common , well -trained laboratory technicians are necessary to accurately assess the different helminth species. Whereas the use of less sensitive tools seems to be sufficient for morbidity control in endemic areas, the use of highly sensitive methods is required to accurately assess the actual prevalence and infection intensity in low prevalence settings because of regular deworming [191, 194] . Evidence -based d ecision -making is warranted in countries with implemented MDA programs to measure the progress of regular deworming and to determine when programs can start to scale down [45]. Moreover, research and development of more sensitive tools are of 29importance for clinical trials studying drug efficacies and to detect the possible occurrence and spread of resistance against single dose anthelmintics [152, 210] . The FECPA KG2 is an online, complete remote -location diagnostic tool that was developed to detect helminth infections and to assess drug efficacies in cattle and sheep [211] . A device produces images of helminth eggs that have been accumulated into one microscopic field of view. I mages are stored by the associated software or on a cloud storage for (re -)evaluation [212, 213 ]. The major improvement compa red to the Kato -Katz technique is that FECPA KG2 bears the potential for standardized quality control and , hopefully in future, automatic detection and quantification of eggs by an egg recognition software [213, 214] . Thus, this method would not be in need for skilled technicians. However, i n 2018, Moser et al. found lower sens itivity to detect any STH infection when assessed by FECPAKG2 compared to Kato -Katz [215] . Therefore, sensitivity of FECPAKG2 needs to be further improved in order to become a reliable diagnostic tool for the coprological detection of STH infections. Another potential future diagnostic tool is the FLOTAC (including mini -FLOTAC) technique that has been adapted from veterinary medicine for the diagnosis of STH infections in humans. It is conceived to pe rform a fast, multivalent, qualitative and quantitative diagnosis for fecal egg count by combining flotation, centrifugation and translation using a single FLOTAC apparatus [57, 191, 200] . Compared to the Kato -Katz technique, the FLOTAC technique examines up to 1 g per fecal sample, which is 24-fold more than a single Kato -Katz thick smear [216] , leading to a theoretically higher analytic sensitivity [191] . Moreover, FLOTAC can be used on preserved stool samples after several days [208, 216] . In various studies, the FLOTAC method showed higher sensitivity compared to m ultiple Kato -Katz thick smears for STH diagnosis [205, 217-220]. The higher sensitivity derives f rom eggs being separated from f ecal material through centrifugation, thus , making it easier to analyz e compared to slides prepared with the Kato - Katz method [221-223]. However, the FLOTAC method remains more time -consuming and require more sophisticated resources, such as a centrifuge [223] . Further optimization of this technique, including the harmonization, validation and standardization of current protocol s, is 30needed to evaluate whether FLOTAC presents a viable alternative to the Kato -Katz technique in STH control programs or drug efficacy studies [223] . Nucleic acid -based detection is the most used molecular technique in microbiology and virology. Over the past decades, efforts have been made to also implement molecular technique s in clinical helminthology in order to increase sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of intestinal helminths. Different protocols for polymerase chain reaction assays have been developed and published [224-228] and vary from semi -quantitative to multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) , including a recently developed next -generation sequencing -based repeat analysis [228] . Most studies observe a generally higher specificity and sensitivity of molecular diagnostics (primarily qPCR) compared to the Kato -Katz thick smear stool examination , with rare exceptions [205, 229 -232]. However, the described method requires experienced laboratory personnel, expensive material and a well -equipped l aboratory and is, thus, unlikely to become the rout ine diagnostic tool in resource -constrained settings in the near future [233] . Furthermore, evaluation s on drug efficacy using molecular approaches are scarce, even though monitoring drug efficacy in the light of possible upcoming anthelmintic resistance is of high importance. Therefore, we compare d the performance of the microsc opic Kato-Katz method to qPCR and its impact on drug efficacy and day -to-day variation as specified in objective 3. Further , sensitivity is the most important factor when transmission control should be achieved. Therefore, DNA -based assays might be of inte rest to confirm that STHs have been elim inated as a public health problem and might also be considered in post - elimination surveillance phases [197] . Moreover, a lthough the use of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) has shown tremendous advances in improving diagnosis of other parasites (e.g., malaria), the develop ment of diagnostic approaches to detect antigens of intestinal helminths is hampered, mostly due to cross - reactivity between antigens of different STH species that can affect specificity of the test [191] . Another possibility would be the development of bio -inform atic tools to identify potential biomarkers of STH parasites that could be further developed into antigen/antibody tests [191, 234]. 315. Study site s 5.1 Pemba Island, Tanzania Both clinical trials, whi ch were part of this PhD project, took place on Pemb a Island that belongs to the Zanzibar Archipelago , United Republic of Tanzania, in East Africa. Pemba Island, also known as the \u00abGreen Island \u00bb, has a tropical climate with an average temperature of 25.5\u00b0C degrees. The wet season on Pemba has two periods : the heavier Masika rains from the south occurring from mid -March to May, and the Vuli rains from northeast during November and December. The hottest period occurs from December to end of March, marked by periods with insufficient access to water for domestic and recreational use. According to the latest census from 2012, Pemba Island was inhabited by around 400'000 people, with 80% living in small villages. The main econ omies of Zanzibar are subsistence agriculture, fishing and th e export of cloves and seaweed. In 2013, life expectancy at birth was 66 years for both sexes, with a total fertility rate of 4.9 children per woman. The infant mortality rate with data from the same year was with 38.4 infant deaths per 1 '000 live births , high [235] . Malaria prevalence has been successfully decreased by com bined interventions and is thus not considered a public health problem anymore . However, modern health care is lacking at village level, although several small hospital s are p resent in different parts of Pemba Island. The water in the villages is mostly piped, but water sources are not protected nor treated [236] . Pemba Island is divided into two regions , the North and the South , with two districts in each region . Our collaborating institute, the Public Health Insti tute - Ivo de Carneri (PHL -IdC) is based to the capital, Chake Chake in South Pemba . The first clinical study site (moxidectin dose finding trial) in 2018 took place in two secondary school s, in Kengeja and Chambani in South Pemba . The second clinical study (ivermectin -albendazole trial) was conducted in the Shehia (lowest administrative unit) of Pujini, in the sub -villages of Dodo and Pujini, also in South Pemba . The sampling area s were all located 10 -30 km away from the PHL-IdC (Figure 6 ). 32 Figure 6 . Study sites on Pemba Island, Tanzania. The surveyed schools of the first trial (objective 1) are colored in green; the surveyed communities (objectives 2 -5) are colored in blue. 5.2 Helminth control programs in Zanzibar , Tanzania Soil-transmitted helminth infections were perceived as a major public health problem in Zanzibar in the early 1990s . Two school survey s in 1988 and 1992 and one community survey in 1991 found that over 85% among all surveyed people (aged 1 -85 years) and 99% of SAC harbor ed at least one of the three major STH species [237-239]. Follow ing that, a national progra m for helminth and LF control started to be integrate d into the previously initiated schistosomiasis initiative by the Minist ry of Health and Social Welfare. In 1992, SAC started to be periodically treated with a single oral dose of mebendazole (500 mg) [237] . Control efforts were less consistent b etween 1999 and 2009 . However, in 2010, the Ministry of Health of Zanzibar revised its strategy for STH and schistosomiasis control, recommending increased 33treatment frequency, from annual to bi -annual treatment. Between 2001 and 2006, and between 2013 and 2015, ivermectin -albendazole was distributed community -wide against LF [240] . The Zanzibar education sys tem has adopted a 12 -year compulsory education cycle without school fees leading to a high school attendance rate (85% of eligible children finalized the last primary grade level) since 2015 [241] . However, d espite these successfully implemented control programs to reduce prevalence of STH, schistosomiasis and LF, the prevalence of STH remain s high [154, 166, 242, 243] . This constant high STH prevalence might not only be a result of worm -favorable environmental conditions and individual risk factors, but is potentially also influenced by a vast majority of people liv ing in poor hygienic conditions [236] . 5.3 Other study sites Objectives 2 -5 of this PhD project were conducted in the framework of a multi -country RCT including Pemba Island, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Lao PDR . The collaborating institutions were Suisse de Recherches Scientifiques (CSRS) en C\u00f4te d'Ivoire , based in Abidjan and the Lao Tropical and Public Health Institute (Lao TPHI), located in the capital Vientiane. Soil- transmitted helminth prevalence substantially decreased in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire during the past decades, as large -scale deworming with ivermectin against onchocerciasis started in the early 2000s, followed by the integration of albendazole against LF in 2010 [244] . According to WHO, coverage of implemented PC programs was 75% within the last five years [48]. In Lao PDR, bi-annual MDA with mebendazole in pre -SAC and SAC was implemented since 2006, however, several studies continued to report high STH prevalence [245-247]. Though, a high coverage ( 75%) was reached for more than five years [48]. A multi -country approach was chosen to strengthen the evidence of d rug efficacies in epidemiological distinct settings. 34References 1. Blas E, Sivasankara Kurup A . Equity, social EJ, et al.

This PhD project involved two clinical trials : the first RCT (objective 1) was a dose -finding study o n moxidectin, while the second RCT (objective s 2-5) was a study on ivermectin -albendazole versus the standard of care, albendazole. In more detail, t he following objective s were specified for the present PhD work : 1)To compare the efficacy and safety of ascending doses of moxidectin alone and in combination with albendazole against T. trichiura infections in adolescents 2)To evaluate the short and long-term outcomes 14-21 days, six and 12 months post - treatment of ivermectin -albendazole versus albendazole alone against T. trichiura infections in children and adults aged between 6 and 60 years 3)To compare the performance of the microscopic Kato -Katz method to the molecular qPCR and its impact on drug ef ficacy and day -to-day variation 4)To test FOB and FC as potential surrogate marker s for STH attributable morbidity 5)To report the insights gained from the ivermectin -albendazole trial on trial methodology, trial procedures and mitigation strategies to overcome challenges faced during clinical research taking place in resource -limited healthcare environments The results gained from these two clinical tri als and sub -studies will help to better plan future recommendations on large -scale helminth control programs . 52Chapter 3 Moxi dectin dose finding trial Efficacy and safety of ascending dosages of moxidectin and moxidectin -albendazole against Trichuris Jan Hattendorf1,2, Jennifer Keiser1,2 1 Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute 2 University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland 3 Public Health Laboratory Ivo de Carneri, Chake Chake, Republic of Tanzania 4 Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Division of Pharmaceutical Technology, and University of Basel, Basel, Switzerl and 5 Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, University of Basel, Switzerland Contributed equally to this manuscript Published in Clinical Infectious Diseases 2020 ;70(6):1193 -1201 53MAJOR ARTICLE Moxidectin-albendazole Against T. trichiura cid 2020:70 (15 Ma rch) 1193Clinical Infectious Diseases Received 4 March 2019; editorial decision 15 April 2019; accepted 22 April 2019; published online May 2, 2019. aL.

Prev entive chemotherapy is the main strategy to control soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections. Albendazole and mebendazole are ubiquitously used, are not sufficiently effective against Trichuris trichiura . Moxidectin might be a useful addition to the small drug armamentarium. However, the optimal dosage of moxidectin alone and in combination with albendazole against T. trichiura and other STHs has not yet been determined. Methods. A Phas e II, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-finding trial was conducted in 2 secondary schools on Pemba Island, Tanzania. Using a computer-generated list, T. trichiura- infected adolescents were randomly assigned to 7 treatment arms: 8, 16, or 24 mg of moxidectin monotherapy; 8, 16, or 24 mg of moxidectin plus 400 mg of albendazole combination therapy; or placebo. The primary outcome was cure rate (CR) against T. trichiura, analyzed 13 to 20 days after treatment by quadruple Kato-Katz thick smears. Results. A tota l of 290 adolescents were enrolled (41 or 42 per arm). CRs against T. trichiura were 43, 46, and 44% for 8, 16, and 24 mg of moxidectin alone, respectively; 60, 62, and 66% for the same moxidectin dosages plus 400 mg of albendazole, respectively; and 12% for placebo. The moxidectin-albendazole arms also revealed higher CRs and egg reduction rates against hookworm than the monotherapy arms. Moxidectin and its combination with albendazole were well tolerated. Conclusions. Moxidec tin-albendazole is superior to moxidectin. There is no benefit of using doses above 8 mg, which is the recommended dose for onchocerciasis. The moxidectin-albendazole combination of 8 mg plus 400 mg should be investigated fur - ther to develop recommendations for appropriate control of STH infections. clinical T rials 2 billion people worldwide, mostly in trop-ical and subtropical regions [1]. The global burden of STH infections was almost 2 million disability-adjusted life years in 2017 [2]. Children living in less-developed settings, with crowded living conditions, inadequate sanitation, and lack of access to clean water, harbor the most intense infections [3-6]. These diseases can cause considerable burdens, including dietary deficiencies, anemia, physical and cognitive retardation in children, and reduction in work performance in adulthood [3, 7-10]. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends an integrated approach for control, elimination, and eradication of STH infections that combines preventive chemotherapy with health education and access to clean water and improved san-itation. Preventive chemotherapy is the regular administration of a single dose of an anthelminthic drug to at-risk populations (annually or biannually, depending on the prevalence of STH) and its promoted by the WHO due to its simple implementa-tion and strong impact on morbidity by decreasing the worm burden. There are 4 drugs and 1 drug combination listed on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines against STH infections [11]. Albendazole and mebendazole are by far the most com-monly used, but their repeated administration increases the risk of drug resistance [12-14]. Moreover, both drugs show limited efficacy against T. trichiura infections and only albendazole is moderately effective against hookworm [13, 15]. Hence, re- search for the identification of new drugs and alternative treat-ment options is urgently needed [13, 16]. Moxidectin, a macrocyclic lactone, is licensed and marketed worldwide by a number of companies as a veterinary anthelminthic agent and was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration against onchocerciasis in humans Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/70/6/1193/5482455 by University of Basel user on 06 January 2021 541194 cid 2020:70 (15 M arch) Ke ller et al[17]. A recent trial by Barda et al [18] showed high efficacy of moxidectin in coadministration with albendazole against T. trichiura at the dose (8 mg) recommended for onchocerciasis. However, the optimal dosage for moxidectin against T. trichiura is yet to be determined. The aim of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy of ascending dosages of moxidectin alone and in combination with albendazole against T. trichiura . METHODS Study Design, Area, and Population This Phase II, parallel, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-finding trial was conducted on Pemba Island, Republic of Tanzania, from 4 July to 11 August 2018. Adolescents aged 16-18 years and attending secondary school (Kengeja and Chambani in the Mkoani District) were invited to participate in the study. Ethical Considerations Ethical clearance was granted by the Ministry of Health and the Zanzibar Medical Research and Ethics committee (refer - ence number ZAMREC/0002/Dec/2018) and by the Ethics Committee of Northern and Central Switzerland (reference number 2018-00053). This trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03501251). Permission for conducting this clinical trial in schools was obtained by the local Ministry of Education and accepted by the headmasters. Caregivers (of adolescents aged <18) or the adolescents themselves (if 18 years old) were invited to an in-formation session. These sessions included a description of the study's purpose, procedures, benefits and of the potential risks of participation, followed by an open discussion. Illiterate caregivers gave a thumbprint and an impartial witness signed to guarantee all the information in the informed consent was properly explained; there was no illiterate adolescent. Eligibility Criteria Adolescents (16-18 years old) were eligible if they provided 2 stool samples and were positive for T. trichiura . Adolescents were excluded if they fulfilled any of the following criteria: pregnant or breastfeeding; severely anemic (hemoglobin < 8.0 g/dl); had any known chronic or systemic illness; had received anthelminthic treatment or any other investigational drugs within the past 4 weeks; or had a known or suspected allergy to moxidectin or albendazole. In the protocol, adolescents with less than 2 positive slides or 100 eggs per gram of stool (EPG) were supposed to be excluded. This exclusion criterion was dropped, due to unexpect-edly low infection intensities. Randomization and Treatment A computer-generated randomization code (block size of 7) was provided by the trial statistician (J. Ha.). The randomiza-tion list was stratified according to baseline infection intensity into light and moderate or heavy infections based on the of-ficial WHO cut-offs [19]. Eligible participants were enrolled (by L. K. and M. S. P .) and randomly assigned 1:1:1:1:1:1:1 to 1 of the 7 treatment arms: (1) 8 mg of moxidectin, (2) 16 mg of moxidectin, (3) 24 mg of moxidectin, (4) 8 mg of moxidectin plus 400 mg of albendazole, (5) 16 mg of moxidectin plus 400 mg of albendazole, (6) 24 mg of moxidectin plus 400 mg of albendazole, or (7) placebo. Because it is known that albendazole has low efficacy against T. trichiura, we did not consider a treat- ment arm with albendazole alone. Moxidectin tablets were manufactured at the University of Basel. Albendazole (Zentel; 400 mg) was the product of GlaxoSmithKline (UK) and pla-cebo tablets were purchased from Fagron (Germany). Each drugs' quality was approved by the Zanzibar Food and Drug Board (reference number MMBLZ/16/2018). Treatment allo-cation was concealed: prior to the trial, 2 people independent to the study prepared sealed, opaque, and sequentially num-bered envelopes containing the treatment arm for each partici-pant. Outcome assessors and the trial statistician were blinded. Participants were not blinded, as they received different num-bers of tablets depending on their treatment arm. Study Procedures Participants received a plastic container marked with their unique identification numbers and were asked to provide a fresh stool sample on the next day. After returning the first con-tainer, they received a second container for the collection of the second sample within 5 days, when possible. Fecal samples were transported to the Public Health Laboratory Ivo de Carneri for examination using duplicate Kato-Katz thick smears [20]. Within 1 hour after preparation, to avoid over-clearing of hookworm eggs, the slides were quantitatively analyzed for helminth eggs under a light microscope by experienced technicians [21]. An in-dependent quality control was conducted for 10% of the samples. Results were considered correct if the following tolerance margins were not exceeded: (1) no difference in the presence/ab-sence of A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura , and (2) egg counts were \u00b110 eggs for counts 100 eggs or \u00b120% for counts >100 eggs (for each species separately) [21]. When a control result was above the tolerance margin, the slide was reread. In the case of discordant results, the slide was reevaluated to reach consensus. Quality con-trol for hookworm was slightly different: 10% of samples were divided into 2 containers, and 1 container kept the original par - ticipant identification number while the other was labeled by the coinvestigator with a new identification number. Therefore, lab-oratory technicians read 3 slides from the same sample without knowing to which sample the third slide belonged to. Before treatment, physicians performed a clinical and physical examination to each eligible adolescent for any acute or chronic illness. The medical history was assessed using a standardized questionnaire. Height was measured with a standard meter (to the nearest 0.1 cm), weight with an electronic balance (to the Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/70/6/1193/5482455 by University of Basel user on 06 January 2021 55Moxidectin-albendazole Against T. trichiura cid 2020:70 (15 M arch) 1195nearest 0.1 kg), and girls provided a urine sample to check for pregnancy (Occidem Biotech, UK). Participants were kept for observation for 3 hours. Adolescents were interviewed by the study physicians 3, 24, 48, and 72 hours and 13 to 20 days after treatment about the occurrence of adverse events. There were 2 additional stool samples collected at follow-up, between 13 and 20 days posttreatment. Participants who remained positive for T. trichiura received albendazole, the current recommended drug against T. trichiura [1]. Outcomes The primary outcome was cure rate (CR) against T. trichiura . Secondary outcomes were efficacy against T. trichiura in terms of egg reduction rate (ERR), CR and ERR against A. lumbricoides and hookworm, and drug safety, which was examined at 5 time points (3, 24, 48, and 72 hours and 13 to 20 days after treatment) using a short questionnaire. Sample Size Based on an earlier study [18], we assumed true CRs of 2.5% for placebo; 15, 30, and 50% for the moxidectin monotherapy arms (8, 16, and 24 mg, respectively); and 50, 70, and 90% for the moxidectin/albendazole combination chemotherapy arms (8, 16, and 24 mg, respectively). The main aim was to investigate the nature of the dose-response relationships. Simulations showed that with 40 participants enrolled in each arm, the dose response prediction model had a median pre-cision (1 half-length of the 95% confidence intervals) of 10% points, assuming a loss to follow-up of 10%. This sample size per arm is in line with the recommendations of Klingenberg et al [22] and has been used in previous anthelminthic dose-finding studies [23, 24]. Statistical Analysis Data were captured on paper and subsequently double entered using EpiInfo version 3.5.4 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA) by 3 people. Both entries were compared for correctness by a data entry clerk using the Data Compare tool of EpiInfo. Any discrepancies were corrected by consulting the hard copy. An available case analysis was performed, including all adolescents with follow-up data. To es-timate the dose-response curve, models of the hyperbolic max-imum responses achievable from the drugs were fitted to CR and ERR using the DoseFinding package (version 0.9-16) of the statistical software environment R. An additional statistical analysis was done using Stata version 15 (StataCorp; College Station, TX). For the primary and secondary endpoints, CRs were calcu- lated as the percentage of egg-positive adolescents at baseline who became egg-negative after treatment. EPG were calculated by adding up the egg counts from the quadruplicate Kato-Katz thick smears and multiplying this number by a factor of 6. The ERR, using both the geometric mean and arithmetic mean of EPG, was calculated with 000 replicates was used to esti-mate 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for ERRs. The performance of the moxidectin-albendazole combina- tion therapy, compared to the moxidectin monotherapy, was analysed by using logistic regression. Treatment approach (moxidectin alone versus moxidectin plus albendazole) and moxidectin dose where both included as fixed effects in the model to assess if the combination therapy outperforms monotherapy. The placebo arm was excluded from this analysis. In a subsequent model, we included the drug \u00d7 dose interaction effect. Adverse events were evaluated descriptively by reporting the number of subjects reporting adverse events and the number of adverse events reported at at each assessment time point. RESULTS Between 6 July and 23 July 2018, a total of 379 participants were recruited and screened for T. trichiura infections. There were 294 infected adolescents who were invited for treatment. Of these, 2 were absent, 1 refused to receive treatment, and 1 was excluded due to anemia. A total of 290 adolescents were randomly assigned to the 7 treatment groups (Figure 1). At follow-up, 9 adolescents did not provide any stool sample and were not included in the available case analysis. Data of 9 and 4 participants, who only provided 1 stool sample at baseline and follow-up, respectively, were considered for the analysis. With the exception of the stool samples of 4 participants at baseline and 1 participant at follow-up, both samples from each partici-pant were collected within 5 days. Baseline parasitological and demographic characteristics of the 290 adolescents are summarized in Table 1. Treatment groups were well balanced in terms of age, sex, weight, height, and T. trichiura baseline infection intensity. Trichuris trichiura infections were mostly light, with only 28 (10%) participants having moderate infections. The estimated dose-response curve models of the maximum responses achievable from the drugs are shown in Figure 2. CRs against T. trichiura did not increase with an increased dose of moxidectin. We observed a slight increase of CR and ERR at higher moxidectin dosages, when moxidectin was combined with albendazole (Table 2). In more detail, CRs against T. trichiura ranged from 43.9 to 50.0% in the monotherapy arm and from 61.9 to 69.2% in the combination chemotherapy arms. The combination therapy performed significantly better, compared to monotherapy (odds ratio 0.48, 95% CI 0.29-0.81). There was no evidence of Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/70/6/1193/5482455 by University of Basel user on 06 January 2021 561196 cid 2020:70 (15 M arch) Ke ller et ala drug \u00d7 dose interaction effect. The same was true for ERRs, which were very similar among the 3 monotherapy arms (94.3-95.7%, based on the geometric mean) and the 3 combi-nation arms (97.4-98.6%, based on the geometric mean). The placebo group had a 12% CR and a 43.6% ERR. The moxidectin-albendazole combination arms were also more effective against hookworm than the monotherapy arms, both in terms of CR and ERR. The highest dose of moxidectin, together with albendazole, performed best (CR = 90% and ERR = 99.6%; Table 2). No serious adverse events were reported during the study. All reported adverse events were mild and did not require any in-tervention. At the baseline physical and clinical examinations, 50 (17.3%) participants reported symptoms. Headache (5%) and abdominal pain (5%) were the most prevalent symptoms. After treatment, the proportions of participants reporting any adverse event were 18, 13, 8, and 5% at the 3, 24, 48, and 72 hour time points, respectively, and 12% on the visit we made 13 to 20 days posttreatment. Due to the absence of subjects during adverse event assessments, data of 6, 9, 3, 16, and 12 participants were missing at 3, 24, 48, and 72 hours and 13 to 20 days posttreatment, respectively. After treatment, the most commonly reported adverse events were headache and abdom-inal pain. Table 3 presents the number of subjects reporting each adverse event at each assessment time point (3, 24, 48, or 72 hours and 13 to 20 days posttreatment). The numbers of ad-verse events and subjects reporting adverse events are similar among treatment arms (Table 4). DISCUSSION Given the recent registration of moxidectin for onchocerci-asis, it is important to evaluate the drug's efficacy against other helminth diseases. Our study confirmed that the moxidectin-albendazole combination is more effective than moxidectin alone against T. trichiura and hookworm infections in adolescents aged 16-18 years. A recent trial by Barda et al [18] on Pemba Island also compared the tolerability and efficacy of moxidectin monotherapy (8 mg) to the combination therapy of moxidectin (8 mg) plus albendazole (400 mg) against T. trichiura in adolescents aged 12-18 years. Similar to our findings, Barda et al showed that the combination chemotherapy was more ef-fective than the monotherapy. Their results on the efficacy of the albendazole-moxidectin combination against T. trichiura were in full agreement with ours. However, whereas in our study the 8 mg of moxidectin monotherapy cured 43% of participants, in Barda and colleagues' trial, only 14% were cured. This discrep-ancy might be explained by the lower mean T. trichiura EPG at baseline in our study. Figure 1.

Of note, the recommended dose of albendazole for STH infections, 400 mg, is still a simple extrapolation from the dose found to be most effective in ani-mals [ 25]. A dose-finding study of albendazole has not yet been carried out. Given the promising results of Barda and colleagues and the fact that a pharmacokinetic analysis of moxidectin in healthy volunteers showed a proportional increase in blood concentra-tion with ascending doses [26], we hypothesized that increasing doses of moxidectin, both in monotherapy and in combination therapy, would result in higher efficacy. However, in our study, higher doses of moxidectin did not translate into higher efficacy, regardless of whether monotherapy or combination chemo-therapy was applied. An explanation for this might be related to the mode of action of moxidectin. The primary molecular target of moxidectin is the glutamate-gated chloride channel, which is present in the nematode's nervous system. When moxidectin binds to these channels, it disrupts neurotransmission, leading to the paralysis and death of the parasite [27]. It is possible that 8 mg of moxidectin are sufficient to saturate these channels. Of note, 8 mg is the dose marketed for onchocerciasis; hence, a substantial amount of safety data was collected in Phase II and III trials and will become available in postmarketing studies. Applying the same dose will facilitate the use of moxidectin against other indications. Though the numbers of coinfections were low, our study confirms that moxidectin has a good treatment effect against A. lumbricoides, while the activity against hookworm is low. The latter finding might be explained with N. americanus being the main hookworm species in the study setting [28]. Although species sensitivity for human hookworms has not been investigated for moxidectin, ivermectin is known to be much more effective against Ancylostoma ceylanicum, than to N. americanus, and therefore has not been used as monotherapy for STH infections [29]. Moxidectin has revealed a high activity against Ancylostoma caninum in veterinary studies [30]. All doses of moxidectin were safe, with only a few mild ad- verse events recorded. This is in line with the safety assessments from Cotreau and colleagues [27] testing single doses up to 36 mg of moxidectin in healthy volunteers. The good tolerability of moxidectin has also been described in other helminthiases studies [18, 31, 32] as well as for its use against onchocerciasis [33]. We have to acknowledge a few limitations in our study. The baseline intensity of T. trichiura infections found in this study setting was low and this affects the proportion of cured participants. Moreover, the efficacy and safety were only assessed up to 13-20 days posttreatment. However, moxidectin has a long half-life [26] and studies with extended follow-up periods should be conducted. Also, study participants and re-search staff were not blinded. In conclusion, this study allowed us to identify 8 mg of moxidectin as the optimum dosage, in combination with albendazole, for use against T. trichiura and concomitant STH coinfections. A single dose of moxidectin cannot be recommended, given its low efficacy against hookworm and T. trichiura infections. The coadministration of moxidectin and albendazole is a valuable alternative in preventive chemotherapy programs; it is effective, causes only a low rate of mild adverse events, and, because it is age and weight independent, it is easy to administer.

Preventive chemotherapy, using the benzimidazoles (albendazole and mebendazole) is the current main recommended control strategy. Nevertheless, there is limited efficacy of these drugs against hookworm infection and, to a greater extent, against trichuriasis. We describe a protocol for a trial investigating the efficacy and safety of the co-administration of ivermectin and albendazole against trichuriasis. Methods: A double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial will be conducted in three countries (C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Tanzania and Lao PDR) with the aim to determine the efficacy, safety and extended effects of co-administered ivermectin and albendazole compared to standard albe ndazole monotherapy. We will enroll 600 participants aged 6 -60 years in each setting. The primary outcome is cure rate (CR) against Trichuris trichiura infection as assessed by Kato-Katz 14 -21 days after treatment. Secondary outcomes incl ude CRs against reduction rates (ERRs) against STH at 14 -21 days, 180 days and 360 days. Tolerability of treatment, infection status assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and potential benefits of deworming on nutritional and morbidity indicato rs will be assessed. The primary analysis will include an available-case set and use logi stic regression models adjusted for age, sex and weight. Discussion: This trial will provide robust results on the efficacy and safety of co-administration of ivermectin and albendazole with the aim to better inform WHO recommendations on control of STHs. Furthermore, secondary and explanatory outcomes will provide direct evidence on the extended effects of combination therapy and insight on the relationship between nutrition and morbidity parameters and infection status and intensity.

BMC Infectious Diseases (2019) 19:262 https://doi.org/10.118 6/s12879-019-3882-x 64Background Almost illion people are infected with soil-transmitted helminths (STHs), the majority being preschool and school-aged children living in Asia and common STHs, account for an annual burden of 1.9 million disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) related to infection [ 1,3]. Infection can be the result of the ingestion o fT. trichiura orA. lumbricoides eggs or the penetration of skin by hookworm larvae [ 4]. Inadequate access to clean water, poor hygiene and unimproved sanitation lead to an increase in risk of STH infection, thus particularly affecting populations in low- and middle-income countries [ 4]. Morbidity due to STHs are related mostly to high intensity infections and may include acute symptoms such as diarrhea, dysentery, abdominal pain or obstruction; if left untreated, STH infections can lead to inflammation, nutrition and im- mune system impairment and, finally, can cause phys- ical and mental development retardation in children and limited working capacity in adults [ 1,4]. Todate, pre ventive chemotherapy (PC) that is the periodic administration of anthelminthic drugs to at-risk populations without prior diagnosis, is the cornerstone of helminth control put forth by the World Health Organization (WHO) to reduce the burden of STHs. PC is implemented in the form of annual mass drug adminis- tration (MDA) campaigns and the recommended target populations have been expanded from only school-aged children to include younger children (1 -5 years of age), adolescent (10 -19 years) girls, women of reproductive age (15-49 years) and pregnant women after the first trimester in areas with an STH prevalence of 20% [ 5]. A biannual freque ncy of MDA is recommended in case of high preva- lence (> 50%). Albendazole, one of the two main drugs used for MDA, is considered safe and well tolerated; how- ever, it is not efficient in clearing infection and redu- cing worm loads in all three types of STHs [ 2,6]. While it show s satisfyingly high cure rates (CRs) (96%) and egg reduction rates (ERRs) (> 98%) against A. lumbri- coides , efficacy against hookworm is lower (CR = 80% and ERR = 90%) and against Trichuris trichiura is dis- turbingly low with CRs of 31% and ERRs of 50% [ 6]. Furthermor e, this drug has been used for more than three decades and comparison of efficacy measures over time indicates a decreasing trend over time; although resistance has so far not been documented in its use in humans [ 5]. In view of insufficient efficacy, especially against T. trichiura , coupled with the poten- tial for resistance emergence from long-term use, there is not only a pressing need for the development of new treatments against STH infections, but also a need to optimize current treatment schemes [ 7].The co-adm inistrat ion of standard drugs together with other anthelminthics, such as ivermectin, could be a way to achieve universal impact on all STH species [ 8]. Moreover , the combined use of ivermectin and albenda- zole against STH infection has been added recently to the WHO Model Lists of Essential Medicines paving the way for application in control programs [ 9]. A recent meta-analysis indeed shows a lower risk (risk ratio (RR) =0.44) of still being positive for T. trichiura post-treatment for ivermectin and alben- dazole when compared to albendazole alone; however, these findings are based on a very limited amount of quali- fying studies ( n= 3) conducted in various settings, limited to school-aged children and/or adolescents with consider- able variation among the reported efficacy measures [ 10]. Intere stingly, two studies also highlight potential extended effects on follow-up infection status or intensity (18 weeks and 1 year) compared to single or other combined drug regimens [ 11,12]. To better inform and guide ongoing helmin th control programs on optimization and imple- mentation of ivermectin-albendazole integrated treatment schemes, a deeper understanding of its impact across a range of different transmission settings, including a broader age range and a prolonged monitoring period, is needed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large, multi-country trial assessing the safety and efficacy of the combination of ivermectin and albendazole and the extended effects of treatment against T. trichiura . Methods/design Trial design This is a multi-country, parallel group, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trial (RCT). It will be implemented as a community-based study target- ing children, adolescents and adults aged 6 to 60 years. In each of the three countries, 600 T. trichiura -positive community members will be randomly assigned to either receive the current standard treatment (albendazole/pla- cebo) or the combination therapy (ivermectin/albenda- zole). All participating communities will be followed-up over a period of one year including four assessment time points at baseline, 3 weeks, 6 months and 12 months after treatment (see Fig. 1). The WHO Trial Registration Data Set su mmarizes the most important trial information and is given in Additional file 1. The study adheres to the Standa rd Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interven- tional Trials (SPIRIT) statement [ 13] and a checklist is provi ded as supplementary file (see Additional file 2). Study area and participants The trial will be conducted in two African settings, namely C\u00f4te d 'Ivoire and Pemba Island, Tanzania, and one Asian setting, Lao People 's Democratic RepublicPatel et al. BMC Infectious Diseases (2019) 19:262 Page 2 of 10 65(PDR). Potential study areas will be selected based on earlier findings and insights from local collaborators onT. trichiura endemicity. In C\u00f4te d 'Ivoire, the Agn\u00e9by-Tiassa region in the southeast of the country has been identified with high STH infection prevalence (particularly for T. trichiura ) in previous community-based s t u d i e so rR C T s[ 14,15]. Pemba Island is still highly en- demic to STH infections [ 16]. Potential study communities on Pemba will be selected based on accessibility besides T. trichiura endemicity. An area fulfilling these criteria is considered the Shehia of Pujini, 9 km south-east of Chake Chake, Pemba. In Lao PDR recent data suggests highest in- fection rates for T. trichiura to be found in the northern zone of the country including the province of Luang Pra- bang [ 17]. In each study location community members from 6 t o 60 years of age will be invited for participation. Recruitment In order to recruit participants from a broad age range (6-60 years), entire communities with less than 1000 in- habitants (smaller communities are easier to be mobi- lized and monitored) will be pre-screened and a census conducted to identify T. trichiura cases and eligible indi- viduals in each household, respectively. All adult community members will be invited to par- ticipate in an informational meeting explaining the pur- poses and procedures of the study, including potentialbenefits and risks. In this open discussion forum, par- ents/caregivers/potential participants will be encouraged to ask questions and be informed of actions to prevent acquiring STH infections in the future. Individuals (including parents/caregivers of children) interested in participating in the trial will be invited to complete the process of informed consent; thereafter, in- dividuals will be assessed for study eligibility during screening procedures. Eligibility criteria Participants will be eligible to be included in the trial if they fulfill all of the following criteria: 1. Provide written informed consent signed by either theparticipant him/herself ( 18 years of age in Lao PDR and Pemba, Tanzania or 21 years of age in C\u00f4te d 'Ivoire) or by parents and/or caregivers for children/adolescents; and oral assent by child/ adolescent (aged 6 -17 years Lao PDR and Pemba, Tanzania or aged 6 -20 years in C\u00f4te d' Ivoire). 2. Agree to comply with study procedures, including provision of two stool samples at the beginning (baseline) and on three follow-up assessments ( a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3w e e k s , 6m o n t h s , a n d 1 2m o n t h s later). 3. Aged 6t o60 years and weighing at least 15 kg. Fig. 1 Design and timeline of the randomized controlled trial to be implemented in each of three settings. The study is designed as a two-armed trial including one arm with a single drug administration (arm A; albendazole) and one arm with combined treatment through co-administration of separate tablets (arm B; ivermectin and albendazole). The trial will be conducted as a multi-country study with two settings in Africa and one in Asia, namely C\u00f4te d 'Ivoire, Pemba (Zanzibar, Tanzania) and Lao PDRPatel et al. BMC Infectious Diseases (2019) 19:262 Page 3 of 10 664. Positive for T. tri chiura infection in at least two slides of the quadruple Kato-Katz thick smears and infection intensity of at least 100 eggs per gram (EPG) of stool. Participants will be ineligible to be included in the trial if they fulfill any of the following criteria: 1. Presence of major systemic illnesses, e.g. severe anemia (below 80 g/l Hemoglobin (Hb) according to WHO [ 18]), clinical malaria as assessed by a medical doctor (positive Plasmodium rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and 38 \u00b0C ear temperature), upon initial clinical assessment. 2. History of acute or severe chronic disease (e.g. cancer, diabetes, chronic heart, liver or renal disease). 3. Recent use of anthelmintic drug (within past 4 weeks). 4. Attendance in other clinical trials. 5. Known allergy to study medications (i.e. ivermectin and albendazole). 6. Pregnancy or lactating in the 1st week after birth (according to WHO guidelines within lymphatic filariasis control programs [ 19]). 7.Current use of medication with known interaction (e.g. for ivermectin: ra-infected, consenting, and participating community members will be treated with the respective single or combination treatment regimen at day 0. Re-treat- ment with the intervention assigned at randomization will occur at 6 months in all participants found to be positive for any STH .400 mg albendazole tablets will be the prod- uct of Glaxo Smith Kline, UK (Zentel\u00ae) and a single tablet will be administered. 3 mg tablets of ivermectin (Stromec- tol\u00ae) will be obtained from Merck, France and administered a tad o s eo f2 0 0 g/kg body weight recorded for each par- ticipant. Matching ivermectin placebo tablets (in terms of appearance) will be produced and a certificate of manufac- ture and analysis be provided by the University of Basel. Since ivermectin and albendazole are known to be better absorbed in humans after a high-fat meal is consumed, par- ticipants will receive a local high-fat breakfast prior to treat- ment [ 20,21]. After ingestion of the medication, the subje ct s will be observed for 3 h to ensure retention of the drug. Vomiting within 1-h post-dosing will require re- dosing. The subjects will not be allowed more than one repeated dose. No re-administration will be needed for sub- jects vomiting after one hour. Outcomes Primary outcome The primary outcome is T. trichiura infection status as assessed by Kato-Katz 14- 21 days after treatment measuredas CR, calculated as the percent of infected individuals at b a s e l i n ef r e ef r o mi n f e c t i o na f t e rt r e a t m e n t . Secondary outcomes Secondary outcomes include the ERR against T. trichiura , CRs and ERRs against other concomitant STH infections (A. lumbricoides ,h o o k w o r ma n d Strongyloides stercoralis ), reinfection rates, tolerability of treatment and infection status assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Outcomes will be assessed at 14 -21 days, 180 days and 360 days post-treatment. Exploratory outcomes Exploratory outcomes include the molecular characterization ofT. trichiura strains from different settings and investiga- tion of potential resistance mar kers through deep sequencing as well as the evaluation of the potential benefits of deworm- ing on nutrition status and morbidity indicators. Sample size calculation Based on a recent systematic review and the published literature, we assume that the CR of albendazole against T. trichiura is 30% compared to 50% in the ivermectin- albendazole treatment regimen [ 6]. To achieve a power of 90% at a significance level of 5%, 121 participants per study arm are needed to detect a statistically significant difference. With an estimated loss to follo w-up of 15%, 143 participants will be required in each study arm. Furthermore, we assume the same treatment efficacy and a reinfection risk of 10% at 6 months. Consequently we expect a proportion of negative patients after 12 months of 44% in the albendazole arm and of 65% in the ivermectin-albendazole arm resulting in a re- quired sample size of 111 participants per arm. To account for a loss to follow-up of 30% after 6 months and 40% at final assessment (12 months), we aim to recruit 300 partici- pants in each treatment group (600 in total) in each country for a total of 1800 participants. Randomisation Study participants eligible for treatment will be ran- domly assigned in a 1:1 allocation to one of the treat- ment arms using sealed, opaque sequentially-numbered envelopes prepared by persons independent of the trial. Since treatment success is influenced by infection inten- sity, stratified block randomization will be used (baseline infection intensity: light infections and moderate/heavy infections) to ensure balanced treatment groups in terms of infection intensity. The computer-generated stratified randomization sequence, provided by a statistician, will vary randomly in blocks of four, six and eight and will be stratified by 2 levels of baseline infection intensity (light: < 1000 EPG, and moderate and heavy: 1000 EPG T. trichiura infections).Patel et al. BMC Infectious Diseases (2019) 19:262 Page 4 of 10 67Blinding The trial will be double-blinded (i.e. study participants and the trial team/researchers conducting the treatment and assessing the outcomes will be blinded). One 400 mg albendazole tablet will be given to each participant. The ivermectin (or corresponding placebo) tablets used for each treatment arm will be repacked into neutral separate plastic bags each containing the maximum num- ber of ivermectin tablets with regard to weight and dose or the corresponding number of appearance-matched placebo tablets produced by the University of Basel. If at any point during the trial an unanticipated need to unblind a partici- pant 's treatment allocation arises for reasons of safety, the principal investigator, site investigators, and ethics commit- tee will be notified and the instance will be documented. Trial timeline The trial will last for fourteen months. The screening for the baseline will start three weeks prior to the treatment. Follow-up screening will take place 14 -21 days, 180 days and 360 days post-treatment and each will last for about three weeks. Schedules of visits are summarized in Table 1. Data collection All data besides a household questionnaire will be col- lected during scheduled visits and recorded on paper case report forms (CRFs), laboratory reporting forms or logs. Subsequently, data will be double-entered into adatabase using EpiInfo (v3.5.4). Access will be limited to study investigators and study personnel entering data; both working independently from the project funder. Data reported in the household questionnaire will be collected using paper forms in Pemba Island and using Open Data Kit (ODK) on mobile tablet computer de- vices in C\u00f4te d 'Ivoire and Lao PDR where electronic data collection has already been applied in earlier stud- ies. Data entered via ODK collect will be uploaded to a server hosted by the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute (Swiss TPH; Basel, Switzerland). For quality as- surance in-built error, range and consistency checks will be programmed for the data entry masks (i.e., in EpiInfo and ODK). The obtained data will be handled strictly confidentially. Personal data will be coded for data ana- lysis. No names will be published at any time, and pub- lished reports will not allow for identification of single subjects.

Blood pressure will be measured using a sphygmomanometer (OMRON M6, Omron Healthcare CO., LTD, Kyoto, Japan). Body weight will be measured using a mobile, digital scale (SECA Model 803, Seca Gmbh Co, Hamburg, Germany) with a precision t ot h en e a r e s t0 . 1k g ,w h i l eh e i g h tw i l lb em e a s u r e du s i n ga measuring stick in centimetres. Mid-upper arm circumfer- ence will be measured to the nearest 0.1 cm using a MUAC tape; and a caliper (Harpenden Skinfold Caliper, HaB Inter- national Ltd., Warwickshire, England) will be used to meas- ure tricep and subscapular skinfold thicknesses to the nearest 0.2 mm. All anthropom etric measurements will be taken twice, recorded and the average value then used. A licensed physician will conduc t a physical examination on each participant before treat ment at baseline, 6 months and 12 months. Biospecimen collection and testing Stool samples Community members providing informed consent will be asked to provide two stool samples of at least 15 g each within a maximum of 5 days at baseline. From every stool specimen, duplicate Kato-Katz thick smears (41.7 mg each) will be prepared and read under a microscope for eggs of T. trichiura ,A. lumbricoides and hookworm by ex- perienced technicians [ 22]. A subsequent independent qualit y control of sample results (approximately 10%) will be conducted. All microscopically analyzed quadruplicate Kato-Katz thick smears will be destroyed within one day (after passing the quality control). A portion of 2 -3 g of stool from each specimen will be preserved in 70% ethanol and shipped to the Swiss TPH, Basel, Switzerland for PCR analysis which will allow fur- ther classification of hookworm infection into the three species N. americanus ,A. duodenale and A. ceylanicum [23]. A subsample of 10 participants with high intensity infections following treatment from each of the settings (30 in total) will be subjected to deep sequencing for characterization of T. trichiura strains and investigation of potential resistance markers [ 24]. Additionally, a small amount of feces (less than 1 mg) from the second stool sample of participants identified as positive for T. trichiura in the first sample will further be tested for fecal occult blood and fecal calprotectin (Actim Fecal Blood and Calprotectin, Oy Medix Biochemica Ab, Espoo, Finland) as proxies for gut morbidity and inflammation using a rapid diagnostic immunoassay test [ 25]. In Lao PDR, the remains of each stool sample (ideall y 10 to 20 g) will be processed by the Baermann technique for identification of S. stercoralis infections and be recorded qualitatively as larva-positive or nega- tive [ 26].Blood samples Enro lled participants undergoing a clinical examination at baseline, 6 months and 12 months will be asked to provide a finger-prick blood sample to evaluate Hb levels using a HemoCue analyzer (Hemocue Hb C\u00f4te d 'Ivoire and Lao PDR will be asked to provide a finger-prick blood sample for an RDT (i.e. Humasis Pf/Pan and Humasis Pf/ Pv) for Plasmodium participants in C\u00f4te d 'Ivoire and Pemba will be asked to provide a finger-prick blood sample for an RDT (i.e. ENCODE Filar- iasis IgG/IgM) detecting antibodies in the blood to iden- tify potential co-infection with Wuchereria bancrofti ,a s patients with filariasis have shown a significantly higher frequency of adverse events after combined treatment with ivermectin and albendazole [ 27,28]. Ino ne African (i.e., C\u00f4te d 'Ivoire) and the Asian set- ting (i.e., Lao PDR), participants will be asked to give approximately 8 ml of venous blood at baseline, 6 months and 12 months to assess potential improve- ment on nutritional indicators for micronutrient (i.e. (pro-) vitamins, inflammation markers, and iron/fer- ritin) and macronutrient (i.e. albumin) deficiencies.

Ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor, retinol-binding protein, 1-acid glycoprotein and will be measured Sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) techniques [ 29]. Transferrin will be measured using immunoturbidimetry; iron will be measured using spectrophotometry; hepcidin will be measured using a solid phase ELISA; and vitamin A will be measured using high performance liquid chromatography. Urine samples Female participants over the age of ten years will be asked to give a urine sample of at least 10 ml for a preg- nancy RDT at baseline, 6 months and 12 months before (re-)treatment is administered to avoid accidental treat- ment of pregnant girls/women.Patel et al. BMC Infectious Diseases (2019) 19:262 Page 6 of 10 69Questionnaire Household questionnaire A household questionnaire will be administered to all participating households between screening and 3 weeks follow-up to assess socioeconomic factors (e.g. structure, condition, amenities), presence of sanitation/water facil- ities (e.g. shower, latrine/toilet, water sources), and hy- giene attitudes/practices (e.g. defecation, hand-washing, water use). Collected information will be used to assess the relationship between reinfection rates and household characteristics/behaviors; moreover, an evaluation of the potential associations of high intensity and persistent in- fections with sociodemographic characteristics will be conducted. Treatment satisfaction Subjective treatment satisfaction will be assessed at 3 h, 3 weeks and 6 months after treatment to investigate rela- tionship with treatment compliance and observed effi- cacy in reducing egg output and morbidity. Participants will be asked to provide short-term treatment satisfac- tion (e.g. convenience of treatment) at 3 h and 3 weeks post-treatment, while long-term treatment satisfaction (e.g. effectiveness in reducing symptoms) will be asked at 6 months follow-up. Physical functioning and well-being Children 6 to 16 years of age will be administered a patient-rated physical functioning and well-being ques- tionnaire during clinical examination before treatment and at 6 months and 12 months follow-up using tools already applied and evaluated in school-aged children from rural settings in C\u00f4te d 'Ivoire and pre-tested in a comparable school-aged population not otherwise in- volved in this trial [ 30]. Adverse events Very few adverse events (AEs) are expected after ivermectin-albendazole co-administration in STH-infected individuals. The most common AEs reported were ab- dominal cramps, headache, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, fever and vertigo [ 31-33]. Subje cts will be kept for observation for at least 3 h following treatment for any acute AEs. In addition, pa- tients will also be interviewed 3 h, 24 h, and 3 weeks after treatment about the occurrence of AEs. If there is any abnormal finding, the local study physician will per- form a full clinical, physical and biochemical examin- ation and findings will be recorded. An emergency kit will be available on site to treat any medical conditions that warrant urgent medical intervention. Information on all AEs (onset, duration, intensity, seriousness and causality) will be immediately entered in the appropriate AE module of the CRF that serves as source document.For all AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs), sufficient information will be pursued and/or obtained so as to be graded on severity, relatedness and expectedness. These data will be recorded on the appropriate CRF sections, re- gardless of whether they are thought to be associated with the study or the drug under investigation. Any study-related unanticipated problem posing risk of harm to subjects or others (including all unexpected adverse drug reactions) and any type of SAE will be immedi- ately (within a maximum of 24 h after becoming aware of the event) notified to the study sponsor-investigator and co-PIs. Statistical methods The primary available-case analysis will include all par- ticipants with primary endpoint data. In addition, an intention-to-treat analysis for the primary endpoint assessed at 3 weeks will be conducted considering all participants with missing endpoint data as treatment failure or all as treatment success to ensure that the re- sults are not sensitive to potential loss to follow-up bias. CRs will be calculated as the percentage of egg-positive participants at baseline who become egg-negative after treatment. Infection intensity expressed as the arithmetic and geometric mean EPG will be calculated for each treatment arm. EPG will be assessed by adding up the egg counts from the quadruplicate Kato-Katz thick smears and multiplying this number by a factor of six. The ERR will be calculated as: ERR\u00bc11 \u00f0\u00de1 In the primary model we estimate the difference among CR s by using unadjusted logistic regressions. In a subsequent analysis an adjusted logistic regression (ad- justment for age, sex and weight) will be performed. Geometric mean egg counts will be calculated for the different treatment arms before and after treatment to assess the corresponding ERRs. Bootstrap resampling method with 5000 replicates will be used to calculate 95% confidence intervals for ERRs and the difference be- tween the ERRs. Results from the stool RDT for fecal occult blood will be categorized as negative, trace and positive. For cal- protectin, the semiquantitative RDT allows classifying in- dividuals by concentration into negative (levels below 50g/g of feces), low (50 -200g/g) or high ( 200g/g) intensities. Anthropometric measurements such as height and weight of school-aged children will be translated into weight-for-age, height-for-age and weight-for-height re- lated z-scores using readily commandsPatel et al. BMC Infectious Diseases (2019) 19:262 Page 7 of 10 70calculating growth indicators for children/adolescents 5-19 years [ 34]. Body mass index and indicators for muscle and fat tissue, such as MUAC and skinfold thick- ness, will serve as additional indicators of nutritional sta- tus for adults [ 35]. Questio nnaires on physical functioning and treatment satisfaction will be evaluated by creating summary scores by summing up and transforming the single question scores according to the following formula: [(actual raw score-lowest possible raw score)/(possible raw score range)]*100 [ 30]. Nutri tional and morbidity indicators will be analyzed using logistic and linear regression as appropriate. To compare individual 's changes in nutrition/morbidity cat- egories as an effect from treatment, McNemar 'st e s tw i l l be applied. The analysis after 6 and 12 months of follow-up will be complemented by generalized estimating equation models with independent correlation structure and empirical estimators to account for missing data. AEs will be evaluated descriptively as the difference of proportion reporting AEs before and after treatment. Discussion Soil-transmitted helminthiasis remains a public health burden in many low- and middle-income countries [ 4]. Since the passing of the resolution WHA 54.19 by the World Health Assembly in 2001, great strides have been taken to reduce the morbidity and mortality of STH infec- tions [ 36]. With the changing epidemiological landscape ofsoil- transmitted helminthiasis moving from control to elimination, MDA implementation is shifting from school-based to community-based [ 37,38]. This trial marks t he first multi-country, longitudinal, randomized double-blind controlled trial assessing the safety and ef- ficacy of a combination therapy at the community level. With the scaling up of PC programs, mounting drug pressure increases the risk for drug resistance against the benzimidazoles in populations infected by STHs. None- theless, combination treatment of two or more drugs can provide heightened efficacy and protection against drug resistance [ 39]. Our data will provide robust evidence on the po ssible increased efficacy and extended effects of combined albendazole and ivermectin treatment when compared to albendazole alone to pave the way of the former as recommended treatment for soil-transmitted helminthiasis for use in control programs. We will report not only on efficacy and safety outcomes of combination ivermectin and albendazole therapy, but also the effects of drug administration on morbidity in a broad age range. In the midst of controversy on the im- pact of PC through mass deworming campaigns, this trial provides direct evidence in determining the relationship between deworming campaigns and clinical morbidity and nutritional indicators [ 5,40-44]. The role of vitamin A asaprot ective factor against re-infection will be assessed, as well as the long-term (6 and 12 months) effects of STH therapy on anemia. Moreover, serum hepcidin levels will be quantified to determine the dynamics between iron-deficiency anemia, anemia of chronic disease and in- fection status/intensity. The use of fecal rapid diagnostics tests as surrogates for gut morbidity will provide a novel proof of concept between STH infection status intensity. These nutritional and gut parameters will be measured in various settings (Asia and Africa) using standardized methods at 6 and 12 months in the hopes of providing clarity to the potential impact of mass deworming in communities. We will also report on the differences in CRs and sensi- tivity between the current diagnostic method recom- mended by the WHO (Kato-Katz smear) and DNA-based methods (qPCR). A major drawback of the Kato-Katz method is the low sensitivity for infections of low intensity [45]. As countries shift from STH control to elimination, more se nsitive methods of diagnosis are needed as infec- tion intensities lower. PCR methods offer the advantage that only single samples need to be taken and multiple in- fections can be detected in one reading; however, esti- mates of sensitivity vary and standardization of technique is needed [ 46,47]. This trial will provide an opportunity to collec t samples from various settings where co-infections may vary and refine the current qPCR technique. In conclusion, this trial will aim to generate evidence to inform future WHO guidelines of STH therapy and its impact on morbidity. Currently, the combination of iver- mectin and albendazole is a safe and effective treatment that is currently given to more than 500 million individ- uals yearly as part of the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis; and there may be opportunities to transition the program to control and elimination of soil-transmitted helminthiasis [ 48,49]. However, evidence on the efficacy of the co-administration of ivermectin and albendazole against STHs from high quality RCTs is needed to confirm results and scale up combination ther- apy in endemic areas.

However, these drugs are less effective against Trichuris trichiura. Combined ivermectin-albendazole is a promising treatment alternative, yet robust evidence is lacking. We aimed to demonstrate superiority of co-administered ivermectin-albendazole over albendazole monotherapy in three distinct epidemiological settings. Methods We conducted a double-blind, parallel-group, phase 3, randomised controlled trial in community members aged 6-60 years infected with T trichiura in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Laos, and Pemba Island, Tanzania, between Sept 26, 2018, and June 29, 2020. Participants with at least 100 T trichiura eggs per g of stool at baseline were randomly assigned (1:1) using computer-generated randomisation sequences in varying blocks of four, six, and eight, stratified by baseline T trichiura infection intensity, to orally receive either a single dose of ivermectin (200 \u00b5g/kg) plus albendazole (400 mg) or albendazole (400 mg) plus placebo. Patients, field staff, and outcome assessors were masked to treatment assignment. The primary outcome was cure rate against T trichiura, defined as the proportion of participants with no eggs in their faeces 14-21 days after treatment, assessed by Kato-Katz thick smears, and analysed in the available-case population according to intention-to-treat principles. Safety was a secondary outcome and was assessed 3 h and 24 h after drug administration. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03527732. Findings Between Sept 13 and Dec 18, 2019, Jan 12 and April 5, 2019, and Sept 26 and Nov 5, 2018, 3737, 3694, and 1435 community members were screened for trial eligibility in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Laos, and Pemba Island, respectively. In C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Laos, and Pemba Island, 256, 274, and 305 participants, respectively, were randomly assigned to the albendazole group, and 255, 275, and 308, respectively, to the ivermectin-albendazole group. Primary outcome data were available for 722 participants treated with albendazole and 733 treated with ivermectin-albendazole. Ivermectin-albendazole showed significantly higher cure rates against T trichiura than albendazole in Laos (66% [140 of 213] [16 of 194]; difference 58 percentage points, 95% CI 50 to 65, p<0\u00b70001) and Pemba of 288] vs 6% 43 percentage points, 36 to 49, p<0 \u00b70001) but had similar efficacy 232] vs 10% 4 percentage points, -2 to 10, p=0\u00b724). No serious adverse events were reported; observed events were mostly classified as mild (95% [266 of 279] in the albendazole group and 91% [288 of 317] in the ivermectin-albendazole group), and all were transient in nature. Interpretation Treatment with ivermectin-albendazole resulted in higher efficacy against trichuriasis than albendazole alone in Laos and Pemba Island but not in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. We recommend implementation of this combination therapy for soil-transmitted helminth control in countries with high T trichiura prevalence and proven enhanced efficacy of this treatment, particularly where ivermectin is beneficial against other endemic helminthiases.

Introduction Soil-transmitted helminthiasis affects approximately one in five people in the world and disproportionally affects the most neglected populations. 1 It is caused by infections with the nematodes Trichuris trichiura, helminth (STH) control is preventive chemotherapy as periodic mass drug administration with a single dose of either albendazole or mebendazole to at-risk populations without prior diagnosis, besides 82Articles124 www.thelancet.com/infection Vol 22 January 2022other strategies tackling exposure (eg, by improving sanitation and providing access to safe water).3 The main goal of preventive chemotherapy is to reduce morbidity by decreasing infection intensities and to ultimately eliminate soil-transmitted helminthiasis as a public health problem. Elimination as a public health problem is defined as the prevalence reduction of moderate and heavy intensities to below 2%, as assessed in preschool-aged and school-aged children, by 2030. 4 Single-dose albendazole treatment shows high and moderate efficacy against A lumbricoides and hook - worm infections, respectively.5 Yet, performance against T trichiura is unsatisfactory, with egg reduction rates (ERRs) and cure rates below 50%.5 Furthermore, albendazole has been used for many decades, and several hundred million doses are donated yearly to endemic areas for STH control. 5 Its consistent use makes it prone to drug resistance, a phenomenon common in veterinary medicine but not yet proven for human soil-transmitted helminthiases. 5,6 In view of the empty pipeline of new potent anthelmintic drugs, the evaluation of drug combinations of already registered products has been identified as a research priority. 7 The use of drug combinations with different mechanisms of action might not only enhance efficacy but also delay the onset of resistance. 8 Ivermectin- albendazole is one of the most promising drug combination candidates and was recently added to the WHO List of Essential Medicines, which paves the road for its use in deworming programmes. 9 Since 2000, ivermectin-albendazole has been successfully used for the control of lymphatic filariasis, showing an excellent safety profile. 10 However, robust evidence on the poten - tially enhanced efficacy from co-administered ivermectin-albendazole against STHs in varying age groups and endemicity settings is lacking. 11-15 The primary objective of this trial was to assess the efficacy and safety of co-administered ivermectin-albendazole 14-21 days after treatment in community members aged 6-60 years infected with T trichiura in different transmission settings. This trial has the ultimate goal to inform STH preventive chemotherapy schemes put forth by WHO, and hence includes long-term follow-up outcomes that are presented elsewhere. 16 Methods Study design and participants We did a phase 3, randomised, controlled, double-blind, parallel group, superiority trial in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Laos, and Pemba Island, Tanzania, between Sept 26, 2018, and June 29, 2020. Details on trial design and methodology were published elsewhere. 17 All community members aged 6-60 years who were positive for T trichiura in at least two slides of quadruplicate Kato-Katz smears, with an infection intensity of at least 100 eggs per g of stool (EPG), were eligible for trial inclusion. Excluded from Research in context Evidence before this study We searched PubMed, ISI Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and ClinicalTrials.gov from Jan 1, 1960, to April 15, for PubMed, ISI Web of Science, and ScienceDirect, and the keywords \"ivermectin\" and \"albendazole\" for CENTRAL and ClinicalTrials.gov. The latest evidence on the efficacy and safety of co-administered ivermectin plus albendazole against soil-transmitted helminths is presented in our systematic review, meta-analysis, and individual-patient data analysis, which was published in 2018. In that study, we identified four randomised controlled trials that investigated the standard dose of combined ivermectin (200 \u00b5g/kg) and albendazole (400 mg). All four trials exclusively assessed efficacy and safety in school-aged children and adolescents (aged 6-20 years), yet adult populations are also targeted in preventive chemotherapy interventions against soil-transmitted helminths. Generalisability of the four trials to other endemic settings is limited. Two studies were done on the Zanzibar archipelago (Pemba and Unguja Islands), Tanzania; one in the Philippines; and one in Sri Lanka. The trials in the Philippines and Sri Lanka were done before 2000 and used a weak diagnostic approach, with only one stool sample analysed before and after treatment.Added value of this studyWe conducted a randomised controlled trial in three settings with distinct epidemiological profiles and treatment history with anthelmintic drugs. We targeted whole communities and recruited approximately 600 participants aged 6-60 years in each of the three settings to provide robust data and to allow for subgroup analysis. Our study showed higher efficacy against Trichuris trichiura if ivermectin-albendazole was used for treatment than if albendazole monotherapy was used in two settings. Both treatment regimens showed excellent safety profiles with mostly mild and transient adverse events. The trial results from C\u00f4te d'Ivoire highlight the existence of settings in which combination treatment does not show enhanced efficacy over albendazole alone, warranting the need for further investigation of emerging drug resistance, parasite genetics, and host-parasite interactions affecting drug efficacy. Implications of all the available evidence The availability of efficacious drugs to treat all types of soil-transmitted helminth infections is a requirement for progress in morbidity control. Our findings support the integration of combination therapy as recommended treatment in preventive chemotherapy schemes against soil-transmitted helminthiasis, although the efficacy needs to be confirmed in a pilot study. 83Articleswww.thelancet.com/infection Vol 22 January 2022 125the trial were individuals presenting with severe chronic or acute systemic illness (eg, severe anaemia with haemoglobin levels below 80 g/L, clinical malaria [positive rapid diagnostic test plus body temperature 38\u00b0C], reported or suspected diabetes, HIV, AIDS, or tuberculosis), pregnant women, lactating women in the first week after birth, and children who weighed less than 15 kg, as assessed upon baseline clinical examination. This trial was done in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The protocol was approved by independent ethics committees in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire (reference numbers 088-18/MSHP/CNESVS-km Nr Req-2018-00494). Participating adults, or parents or guardians of participating children, provided written informed consent. Children provided written (C\u00f4te d'Ivoire) or oral (Laos and Pemba) assent. All authors take responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the data and the fidelity of the trial to the protocol, which is available together with the statistical analysis plan in appendix 1. Randomisation and masking Computer-generated randomisation sequences in varying blocks of four, six, and eight participants, stratified by two levels of baseline T trichiura infection intensity (light = <1000 EPG; moderate to heavy = 1000 EPG), were provided by the trial statistician. Enrolled participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a single dose of albendazole (400 mg; Zentel; Glaxo - SmithKline, London, UK) plus appearance-matched placebo (produced by the University of Basel) or albendazole (400 mg) plus ivermectin (200 \u00b5g/kg; Stromectol; Merck Sharp & Dohme, Readington, NJ, USA) using sealed, opaque, sequentially numbered envelopes containing the treatment assignment (A or B) and six ivermectin or corresponding placebo tablets (sufficient to dose participants weighing up to 97 kg). The envelopes were prepared in Basel, Switzerland, by people who were independent of the trial. Participants were randomly assigned in the order they presented to the administrating investigators on the day of treatment. Investigators verified whether participants had baseline light or moderate-to-heavy infection intensity, chose the treatment envelope from the respective pile based on treatment allocation, and opened the sealed envelopes. Albendazole tablets were kept in bottles of 100 pieces as provided by WHO, and a single tablet was administered to every patient together with the necessary number of ivermectin or placebo tablets according to the patient's weight. Through the use of pre-packed treatment group labels, together with ivermectin appearance-matched placebos, field staff, including investigators, participants, and outcome assessors, were masked to treatment assignment.Procedures At baseline, participants were asked to provide two stool samples from different days (ideally within a 5 day interval), from which duplicate Kato-Katz thick smears using 41\u00b77 mg of stool were prepared and assessed under a light microscope for the identification of T trichiura, A lumbricoides, and hookworm ova by laboratory technicians. 18 In Laos, both stool samples of T trichiura- infected participants were also assessed for Strongyloides stercoralis larvae using the Baermann technique.19 For participants who were identified as T trichiura positive after the second sample only, one S stercoralis examination of that sample was done. 10% of all Kato-Katz slides were randomly chosen for subsequent quality control by picking every tenth slide of all slides read by each laboratory technician on the respective day. Before treatment, participants underwent a physical examination to ensure recruitment criteria were met. These examinations included rapid diagnostic testing for haemoglobin levels and malaria (in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Laos) and lymphatic filariasis (in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Pemba Island) parasites, as well as pregnancy tests in girls and women aged 10 years and older in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Pemba Island and aged 12 years and older in Laos. Participants were further examined physically, and a medical anamnesis was done by trial physicians to assess baseline conditions. On Pemba Island, treatment was administered on the same day as the clinical examination, whereas in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Laos, treatment took place approximately 1 week after baseline due to the preceding analysis of blood parameters to evaluate liver and kidney functions as a required safety measure put forth by the responsible ethical or drug safety boards. Adverse events were assessed actively at 3 h and 24 h after treatment and graded into light, moderate, and severe using adapted Common Toxicity Criteria version 2.0 put forth by the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program. Study physicians were asked to evaluate relatedness of the most common adverse events to drug administration. If causality could not be ruled out by other conditions or reasons, the adverse events were considered as possibly related. Newly emerging, as well as persistent, adverse events after 24 h and within 14-21 days of treatment were followed up using a passive monitoring scheme, as specified in the protocol. Treatment efficacy was determined 14-21 days after treatment by collecting another two stool samples per participant. At study termination, all participants positive for STH were offered the combination therapy, if found to be more efficacious, or standard therapy. Outcomes The primary outcome was the cure rate of T trichiura, defined as the proportion of participants with no eggs in their faeces 14-21 days after treatment. Secondary outcomes were the ERR against T trichiura; cure rates and ERRs against A lumbricoides, hookworm, and See Online for appendix 1 84Articles126 www.thelancet.com/infection Vol 22 January 2022S stercoralis ; and infection status assessed by qPCR. Safety outcomes included adverse events assessed 3 h and 24 h after treatment, serious adverse events, and adverse events potentially related to treatment. In this manuscript we do not present the cure rates determined by qPCR analysis or related methods and results. At the time of writing, this analysis had been done only for samples from Pemba Island, and thus qPCR-based cure rates cannot be compared between countries. Further - more, detailed results of this analysis have been published elsewhere. 20 Statistical analysis For the sample size calculation, we used the formula n = (Z/2 + Z)\u00b2 \u00d7 [1 \u00d7 (1 1) / (2 1)\u00b2, where Z/2 and Z denote the critical values of the normal distribution for significance level and type 2 error, respectively, and 1 and 2 denote the proportion of cured individuals in the two treatment groups. For each location, the trial was powered to detect a significant difference in cure rates between the two treatment groups with 90% power at a two-sided 5% significance level, assuming that the cure rate of albendazole for T trichiura was 30% and of ivermectin-albendazole was 50%. 5,15 We calculated that 121 participants per group would be sufficient to test the primary hypothesis that ivermectin-albendazole has a higher efficacy against T trichiura infection than albendazole alone. Taking a potential loss to follow-up of 15% into account, we anticipated that we needed to enrol 143 participants per treatment group. In view of the prolonged follow-up period to assess the long-term secondary outcomes (up to 12 months), we aimed to include 600 community members in each trial setting. For subgroup analysis, the data from all locations were pooled to ensure sufficient power to assess a potential difference in efficacy by baseline infection intensity (ie, light vs moderate to heavy) and age group (ie, 6-12 years vs 13-60 years). The primary analysis estimated the cure rate of T trichiura using the available-case population according to intention-to-treat principles. The available-case popu - lation was defined as all randomly assigned participants, excluding those who entered the study despite not satisfying the entry criterion of positive at baseline, with at least one follow-up stool sample at 14-21 days post-treatment. To check the robustness of the primary analysis, the results were confirmed using the per-protocol population. Exact definitions of the different analysis populations are provided in the statistical analysis plan in appendix 1. As outlined in the statistical analysis plan, the available-case analysis was further comple - mented by an intention-to-treat analysis using multiple imputation if the proportion of missing data exceeded 10%. Major protocol deviations, leading to exclusion from the per-protocol analysis, included negative infection status for T trichiura at baseline, not satisfying the enrolment criteria, meeting withdrawal criteria, or receiving no treatment, the wrong treatment, or concomitant treatment with anthelmintics in the past 4 weeks or drugs with known interaction with the study drugs. The mean egg counts from the quadruplicate Kato-Katz thick smears were multiplied by 24 to be expressed as EPG. Helminth infection intensity was classified as light or moderate to heavy depending on the species following cutoffs put forth by WHO. 21 We calculated the proportion of individuals with moderate-to-heavy infection intensities at baseline who had light infection intensities or no infection at follow-up. This indicator is used to assess progress within control programmes to eliminate morbidity due to STHs. 21 A melded binomial test with mid-p correction was used to calculate differences in cure rates between the two treatment groups and to estimate the corresponding confidence intervals. The prespecified analytical code is provided in appendix 1 (p 171). Geometric mean and arithmetic mean egg counts were calculated for the two treatment groups before and after treatment to assess the corresponding ERRs. Geometric mean-based and arithmetic mean-based ERRs were calculated as: A bootstrap resampling method with 5000 replicates was used to calculate 95% CIs for geometric mean-based ERRs and the difference between them. The code for implementing the bootstrap routine is provided in the statistical analysis plan (appendix 1 p 171). All estimates presented are unadjusted estimates. Multiple imputations were done using the mi package in R. The missing outcomes were predicted using the variables sex, age, height, weight, treatment group, and baseline infection intensity. The imputation used six chains with 30 iterations each. Imputation performance was assessed via the R-hat statistics, and convergence was visually inspected. No statistical testing was done on safety outcomes; adverse events are presented in frequency tables. Data were analysed using R software version 4.0.3 and Stata 16.

The recruitment phase to assess the eligibility of community members finished after 133 days in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, 83 days in Laos, and 40 days in Pemba Island. In C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Laos, and Pemba Island, 256, 274, and 305 participants, respectively, were randomly assigned to and received albendazole co-administered with placebo, whereas 255, 275, and 308 participants, respectively, were randomly assigned to and received ivermectin-albendazole. Demographic, baseline anthropometric, and hel - minth infection characteristics of the 1673 randomised parti cipants are summarised in table 1. Co-infections with other STH species were common and found in 951 (57%) of 1673 participants, but endemicity profiles differed between countries. In Laos, hookworm was the pre dominant co-infection, whereas A lumbricoides co- infection was most common in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Figure 1: Trial profile *Low T trichiura infection intensities not qualifying for trial inclusion were egg counts below 100 eggs per g of stool, fewer than two of four Kato-Katz slides found to be positive, or both.

S stercoralis infection was assessed qualitatively only (positive vs negative) in stool samples collected in Laos; 406 participants (193 in the albendazole group and 213 in the ivermectin-albendazole group) in Laos had at least one stool sample examined for S stercoralis at baseline and follow-up.

Similarly, ERRs were significantly higher in the combination therapy group than in the monotherapy group in Laos (geometric mean ERR 99% vs 69%, difference 30 percentage points, 95% CI 24 to 38) and Pemba Island (98% vs 57%, 41 percentage points, 34 to 50). In C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, ivermectin-albendazole showed similarly low efficacy to albendazole in terms of cure rates (14% [32 of 232] vs 10% [24 of 235], difference 4 percentage points, 95% CI -2 to 10, p=0\u00b724) and ERRs (geometric mean ERR 70% vs 64%, difference 6 percentage points, 95% CI -6 to 18). Adjusting for age category, sex, and weight did not notably change point or interval estimates (data not shown). T trichiura egg distributions before and after treatment by treatment group, for each country, are shown in a violin plot (figure 2A-C). Of participants who received ivermectin-albendazole with moderate-intensity or heavy-intensity infections, 52% (95% CI 39 to 65; 31 of 60), 97% (92 to 103; 36 of 37), and 94% (89 to 100; 65 of 69) showed no or only light intensity infections after treatment in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Laos, and Pemba Island, respectively (table 2). In C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, no major protocol deviations were observed and therefore the per-protocol population is identical to the available-case population. On Pemba Island, one participant in the ivermectin-albendazole group with a baseline infection intensity of 18 EPG was inappropriately randomised. Excluding this participant from the per-protocol analysis did not notably change the estimates (cure rate 48% in the ivermectin-albendazole group vs 6% in the albendazole group, difference 42 percentage points, 95% CI 36-49, p<0\u00b70001). In Laos, one of the two participants older than 60 years who was erroneously randomised to the albendazole group provided a follow-up stool sample and was included in the available-case population. The per-protocol analysis excluding this participant showed similar estimates to the available-case analysis (66% vs 8%, 57 percentage points, 50-64, p<0\u00b70001). The proportion of missing data in Laos was higher than expected. Missing data for the intention-to-treat analysis were imputed by multiple imputation but neither point nor interval estimates changed substantially from the available-case analysis (appendix 2 p 2). Subgroup analysis showed higher cure rates against T trichiura in participants with light infection intensities (45% [156 of in the [37 of 339] in the albendazole group) than in participants with moderate or heavy infection intensities (16% [16 of 97] and 3% [three of 90]) at baseline, but the conclusions with respect to superiority of the ivermectin-albendazole combination did not change (appendix 2 p 3). The cure rate for ivermectin-albendazole in the 6-12 years age group (26%; 64 of 243) was lower than the cure rate in the 13-60 years age group (53%; 108 of 202), but we also observed higher baseline infection intensities irrespective of treatment group in the younger than in the older age group (median EPG at baseline was 444 [IQR 204-1236] vs 264 [159-525]; appendix 2 p 3).

We found the highest cure rate against hookworm in C\u00f4te and 72% [28 of 39]), where infections were primarily of light intensity. In Laos, we found moderate efficacy in terms of cure rates for both treatment groups (56% [100 of 180] and 59% [115 of 194]). Hookworm infections were well reduced in terms of ERRs (geometric mean ERR 97%) in all settings. Of 22 participants in Laos infected with S stercoralis in each treatment group, four were still infected after treatment in the albendazole group (cure rate 82%) and one in the ivermectin-albendazole group (96%). Safety was assessed in 508, 546, and 613 trial participants in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Laos, and Pemba Island, respectively. Not all participants were available at each timepoint (table 3). We did not observe any serious adverse events in any of the three countries. Adverse event reporting was similar between treatment groups. Before treatment, any symptom or condition was reported by 392 (77%) of 508, 177 (32%) of 546, and 106 (18%) of 607 examined participants from C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Laos, and Pemba Island, respectively. All reported baseline symptoms and adverse events assessed 3 h and 24 h after treatment are illustrated in figure 3. Details on country-specific adverse events are provided in appendix 2 (pp 4-6). 232 (14%) of 1663 participants reported any adverse event 3 h after treatment, and 213 (14%) of 1565 reported any adverse event 24 h after treatment. The most frequently reported adverse events in both groups were headache, abdominal pain, and itching. Adverse events were mostly transient and resolved within 24 h. Few participants experienced moderate (23 of 1663, 1%) and severe (six of 1663, <1%) adverse events. 61% (146 of 239) and 59% (125 of 211) of all assessed adverse events were classified as possibly treatment-related in the ivermectin-albendazole and albendazole groups, respectively. More moderate-to-severe adverse events were observed 24 h than 3 h after treatment (27 vs 15 events), with higher numbers in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire (21 events) than in Laos (18 events) and Pemba Island (three events). At 24 h after treatment, more moderate-to-severe adverse events were reported in the ivermectin-albendazole group (21 events) than in the albendazole group (six events). These mostly included allergy-like symptoms involving itching, rash, and disorders of the digestive tract, but also diarrhoea as a separate clinical symptom, that were resolved without intervention or with antihistamines and glucocorticoid treatment. Adverse events as a result of ivermectin acting on lymphatic filariasis parasites were negligible.

Mainly includes participants who were missed out at, or had persisting symptoms from, the 24-h assessment and symptoms occurring after 24 h but within 14-21 days after treatment that were mentioned by participants during monitoring visits. \u00a7We aimed to visit all trial participants to ask about symptoms occurring after 24 h; symptoms mentioned after 24 h could include persisting symptoms from the 24-h assessment or symptoms occurring after 24 h but within 14-21 days after treatment that were possibly related to drug administration.

Discussion We did a randomised controlled trial in three distinct epidemiological settings in people aged 6-60 years with the overarching goal to inform STH control guidelines and programmes on the potential benefit of using ivermectin in combination with albendazole against trichuriasis. Our findings revealed superiority in terms of cure rate and ERR of the combination therapy over albendazole monotherapy against T trichiura infections in Laos and Pemba Island. Yet, in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, ivermectin-albendazole showed unsatisfactory efficacy. The trial results further highlight the need for a change in treatment for mass drug administration campaigns, since we found low efficacy of albendazole according to the WHO reference efficacy (arithmetic mean-based ERR <50%) in all three settings. 22 The observed cure rates were even lower than the initially assumed cure rate for albendazole of 30%, which might be explained by a more rigid eligibility criterion (minimal egg count of 100 EPG) and diagnostic approach (four Kato-Katz slides analysed per timepoint) than used in earlier studies. Ivermectin-albendazole showed a good safety profile, with mostly mild and transient adverse events. More moderate and severe adverse events were observed 24 h after treatment than 3 h after treatment and in the ivermectin-albendazole group than in the albendazole monotherapy group. This finding might in part be explained by the half-life of ivermectin (ie, approximately 18-28 h in humans). 23 Nevertheless, trials like this one are not powered to assess statistical differences in safety outcomes. The efficacy of ivermectin-albendazole on Pemba Island was slightly higher in our study (cure rate 49%) than in earlier studies in Zanzibari school-aged children (cure rates 38% and 28%); 13,14 however, in a subgroup analysis in which we considered only school-aged children (6-12 years), the cure rate was similar to the earlier studies (26%). Previous trials done in Asian settings showed similar or higher cure rates for combination therapy in T trichiura-infected children from the Philippines (65%) and Sri Lanka (79%) compared with children from Laos (52%), 11,12 yet these data were collected around 20 years ago and the diagnostic approaches used in those studies were less rigid than the diagnostic approach we applied. While the two African trial cohorts were relatively comparable with regard to age composition and baseline infection intensity of T trichiura, the mean age in Laos was much older and in turn baseline EPGs were lower. Subgroup analysis has shown that baseline infection intensities have an important role in treatment efficacy and thus might in part explain why the highest cure rates for ivermectin-albendazole were found in Laos.The low efficacy of ivermectin-albendazole against T trichiura in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire warrants further investigation. Several patient factors might influence treatment outcome. Metabolisation and drug absorption are universally accepted to play a role in drug efficacy, but in the case of intestinal parasites, direct drug exposure in the lumen might be as important to kill them. To date, the influence of changes in drug disposition of albendazole and ivermectin on efficacy have not been described. Moreover, the nutritional and immunological status, as well as the intestinal microbiome, of patients are believed to have a potential impact on pharma - cokinetics or how effectively parasitic infections are cleared. 24,25 Acquired drug resistance might be another explanation for treatment failure. However, there is no evidence for resistance in human STH infections, and potential mechanisms of ivermectin resistance in T trichiura are yet to be fully understood. 23 Nonetheless, drug pressure might trigger anthelmintic resistance and should not be 200 150 50 50 0 100 100 150 200AlbendazoleIvermectin-albendazole Number of 60 40 20 20 40 60AlbendazoleIvermectin-albendazole Number grade (ivermectin-albendazole) Grade 2 (ivermectin-albendazole) Figure 3: Baseline symptoms and adverse events at each timepoint by group and grade *Not applicable at this timepoint. 92Articles134 www.thelancet.com/infection Vol 22 January 2022under estimated. C\u00f4te d'Ivoire has the longest history of community-wide use of ivermectin to fight filarial diseases, compared with Laos, where to date ivermectin has not been used in any programme. 26,27 In Laos, mainly mebendazole is provided for STH control. On Pemba Island, mass drug administration against lymphatic filariasis was stopped in 2015 after six rounds. 28 We observed no typical patterns of acquired resistance in the data, such as geographical heterogeneity in efficacy, as efficacy was similarly low in villages situated within a perimeter of up to 40 km distance. Moreover, a surprisingly low efficacy of ivermectin was observed in dose-finding studies in another study area in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. 29 Differences in parasite genetics, causing variance in parasite defense systems (eg, drug efflux pumps and detoxification enzymes), among T trichiura strains might have a role in reduced treatment efficacy. 7,30 Whole- genome and amplicon sequencing of local T trichiura parasites or eggs might provide further insight into potential adaptations of the C\u00f4te d'Ivoire strain. 31 The biggest limitation of our study was the reduced sensitivity of the Kato-Katz diagnosis technique compared with PCR-based diagnosis. However, to minimise potential overestimation of efficacy measures, we applied rigorous inclusion criteria for positive individuals (ie, 100 EPG and two out of four Kato-Katz slides positive). Furthermore, we performed qPCR diagnosis on samples from Pemba Island and compared efficacy measures. These findings revealed lower cure rates in PCR-based diagnosis than in diagnosis with the Kato-Katz technique, but ivermectin-albendazole still showed significantly higher cure rates against T trichiura than albendazole. 8 Our safety outcomes were descriptive and did not explore for multiple events nor account for differential follow-up between settings. Comparison of safety outcomes between settings should thus be interpreted with caution. Countries affected by trichuriasis, strongyloidiasis, and scabies would clearly benefit from introduction or broader application of ivermectin-albendazole, which is currently exclusively used for onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis. 28 These efforts would go hand in hand with the recommendations put forth by WHO in the 2021-30 roadmap for neglected tropical diseases. 4 A current obstacle for use of ivermectin-albendazole in STH programmes is the prohibitive costs of good-quality ivermectin and the absence of donations for this purpose; the Mectizan Donation Program covers only lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis. 4 Challenges for community- wide ivermectin-albendazole implementation include administration to identified at-risk groups (preschool-aged children and pregnant and lactating women). 3 Ivermectin is not recommended for children shorter than 90 cm or weighing less than 15 kg, pregnant women, or lactating women in the first week after birth. 9 New evidence on ivermectin safety and field-applicable solutions for dosing are needed. Simultaneously, efforts should be made to identify and test alternative treatment options to effectively treat infections in areas with low ivermectin-albendazole efficacy against T trichiura. Alternative drug combination candidates could be oxantel pamoate or moxidectin with albendazole against T trichiura infections. 8 In conclusion, ivermectin-albendazole, the only approved and available combination anthelmintic therapy, is a valuable and safe alternative treatment to albendazole monotherapy, which showed low efficacy against T trichiura in all settings. Future trials might look at effectiveness rather than efficacy using cluster-randomised designs, allowing for inclusion of bigger sample sizes and more conclusive safety comparisons. Current diagnosis to assess STH efficacy in trials should be complemented by molecular techniques (eg, qPCR) in at least a subsample from each trial site to better depict the real-life performance.

However, assessments on treatment ecacy comparing traditional microscopic to newly emerging molecular approaches such as quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) are scarce and hampered partly by lack of an established diagnostic gold standard. Methods: We compared the performance of the copromicroscopic Kato-Katz method to qPCR in the framework of a randomized controlled trial on Pemba Island, Tanzania, evaluating treatment ecacy based on cure rates of albenda- zole monotherapy infections. Day-to- day variability of both diagnostic methods was assessed to elucidate reproducibility of test results by analysing two stool samples before and two stool samples after treatment of 160 T. trichiura Kato-Katz positive participants, partially co-infected with Ascaris lumbricoides and hookworm, per treatment arm (n = 320). As negative controls, two faecal samples of 180 Kato-Katz helminth negative participants were analysed. Results: Fair to moderate correlation between microscopic egg count and DNA copy number for the dierent STH species was observed at baseline and follow-up. Results indicated higher sensitivity of qPCR for all three STH species across all time points; however, we found lower test result reproducibility compared to Kato-Katz. When assessed with two samples from consecutive days by qPCR, cure rates were signicantly lower for T. trichiura (23.2 treatment arm, when compared to Kato-Katz. Conclusions: qPCR diagnosis showed lower reproducibility of test results compared to Kato-Katz, hence multiple samples per participant should be analysed to achieve a reliable diagnosis of STH infection.

Par asites Vectors (2020) 13:517 Background With an estimated 1.5 billion duodenale, are of enormous pub- lic health importance in subtropical and tropical regions, particularly amongst the most marginalized populations [1]. Diseases accompanying these infections can cause considerable bur den manifested as malnutrition [ 2, 3], impair ment in physical and cognitive development in children [ 4], reduction in work performance in adulthood [5] and adverse pregnancy outcomes [ 3, 6]. Preventive chemothera py, the periodic large-scale administration of anthelminthic medicines to at-risk populations with - out prior diagnosis is the cornerstone of helminth con- trol recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). It is considered simple and cost-effective in its implementation and to have a strong impact on morbid - ity by decreasing the worm burden [ 7]. Accurate, scal- able and sensitive di agnostic tools are crucial to assess and monitor treatment efficacy, prevalence and intensity of infection to guide future interventions, including the early detection of possible resistance development [ 8- 13]. Cost-effective, sensitive techniques are paramount espe cially in areas of low endemicity, where a robust surveillance system is needed to approach and monitor elimination [ 13]. The micro scopic Kato-Katz technique is a relatively simple and low-cost method recommended by the WHO for the detection of STH and other helminth eggs in fae - cal samples [ 14-16]. Consequently, it is widely used in randomise d controlled trials (RCTs), epidemiological surveys and surveillance studies to determine the impact of STH interventions. Yet, the technique has considerable shortcomings. There is substantial variation in the read - ings, resulting from uneven distribution of eggs within a single stool sample (within sample variation), day-to-day fluctuations of egg excretion (between sample variations) and ultimately results depend on the readers' skills and experience [ 17-20]. Most importantly, the Kato-Katz metho d may particularly miss low-intensity infections leading to underestimation of the actual prevalence, but in the case of efficacy trials artificially inflate cure rates (CRs) from undetected residual low-egg count infections post-treatment [ 21]. Moreover, expertise in microscopy is inc r easingly rare [ 22, 23].Over t he past few decades, molecular diagnostic meth - ods have been developed for the use in human parasitol- ogy in order to increase sensitivity and specificity of the diagnosis of intestinal helminths. qPCR-based assays for the detection of helminth DNA or ribosomal RNA on faecal samples are the most widely used molecular meth - ods [ 11, 23-25]. In recent years, further improvements of the DNA is olation step were made, and multiplex approaches have been developed to detect different para - site targets in a single procedure [ 17, 26]. Higher specific- ity and sensitivity of mole cular diagnostics are generally observed in studies comparing the Kato-Katz thick smear stool examination to molecular methods (primarily qPCR), with rare exceptions [ 11, 20, 27-29]. The semi- quantit ative output of PCR also reflects the amount of parasite DNA present, which could be of further interest as parasite burden rather than absence or presence of a STH infection is a key determinant of morbidity [ 17, 30]. More over, nucleic acid amplification may improve the detection in infections with low parasitic burden and has the ability to differentiate between morphologically iden - tical species [ 31]. Evalu ations on drug efficacy using molecular approaches are scarce, even though monitoring drug efficacy is of utmost importance for making treatment recommendations for novel therapies and in the light of possible upcoming anthelminthic resistance [ 32, 33]. Given the higher s ensitivity and specificity of qPCR, the few available studies showed that treatment efficacy based on CRs is lower using qPRC detection compared to the microscopic Kato-Katz method. It is worth highlight - ing that STHs do not release eggs at a constant rate [ 34- 36] and therefore, we hypothesize multiple collection of faec al samples might increase the sensitivity of qPCR. The aim of the present study was to compare the per - formance of the microscopic Kato-Katz method and the molecular qPCR method for the diagnosis of soil-trans - mitted helminthiasis and its impact on treatment efficacy and day-to-day variation analysing two stool samples before and after treatment respectively. Stool samples were collected within the framework of a phase III, par - allel group, double blind RCT assessing the safety and efficacy of the current standard treatment (albendazole) versus combination therapy (ivermectin-albendazole).cure rates are overestimated using Kato-Katz alone. Our ndings emphasize that standardized and accurate molecular diagnostic tools are urgently needed for future monitoring within STH control and/or elimination programmes.

Par asites Vectors (2020) 13:517 Methods Trial design Trial details are summarized in the published trial pro- tocol [ 37] and in the trial registration (clinicaltrials.gov, refer ence: NCT03527732, date assigned: 17 May 2018). Participants were invited for clinical examination and treatment if found positive for T. trichiura infection in at least two slides of quadruple Kato-Katz thick smears with an infection intensity of at least 100 eggs per gram (EPG) of stool. The samples analysed in this work were collected at baseline and 14-21 days post-treatment between September 2018 and December 2018 in one of the three study settings, on Pemba Island, United Repub - lic of Tanzania. Laboratory procedures Two fresh morning stool samples were obtained from each participant within a maximum of 5 days using a door-to-door approach. Collected stool samples were kept in a cool box containing ice packs while being trans - ported to the laboratory. Samples were examined with quadruplicate Kato-Katz microscopy within 24 h after collection for the detection of STH ova by experienced laboratory technicians following the WHO standard pro - cedures [ 15]. An independent quality control of the Kato- Katz re adings for T. trichiura and A. lumbricoides was conducted for 10% of the slides. Stool samples of participants fulfilling eligibility cri - teria (minimal egg count for T. trichiura 100 EPG, 2 or more out of 4 Kato-Katz slides positive) and all identified STH egg negative participants (negative con - trols without any co-infection) were further processed. In total, 160 randomly selected T. trichiura Kato-Katz positive participants with complete aliquot pairs per treatment arm (n = 320) and 180 identified Kato-Katz helminth negative participants with two baseline ali - quots were analysed. An aliquot of stool (~ 1 g) was mixed with 80% ethanol and preserved at 4 \u00b0C and shipped at room temperature to the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute (Swiss TPH) in Basel, Switzer - land for subsequent qPCR analyses. DNA extraction was performed using the QIAamp DNA Mini kit (Qiagen; Hilden, Germany) with slight modifications from the standard protocol validated and described by Kaisar et al. [ 17]. A multiplex real-time qPCR w as used for simultaneous detection of A. lum - bricoides, T. trichiura , N. americanus, A. duodenale and Strongyloides stercoralis. However, the latter parasite was not expected in these samples [ 38] but was placed toge ther with the hookworm species in the same color channel, in case further specification would be of inter - est in a second round. Amplification consisted of 2 min at 50 \u00b0C, 10 min at 95 \u00b0C followed by 45 cycles of 15 s at 95 \u00b0C and 1 min at 58 \u00b0C. Testing was performed using CFX Maestro (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc, Hercules, CA, USA). qPCR plate planes were generated with a random distribution and balance; however, all samples of one participant were distributed within one plate to reduce between-plate variability and twelve worm- negative controls were placed in between. Four nega - tive controls containing double-distilled water were randomly placed on each plate to ensure detection of confounding factors. For subsequent standardization of each plate, nine positive controls with rising plasmid concentrations (101, 103 and 105 plasmids/\u00b5l) contain - ing an insert with the sequence of the STH qPCR prod - uct were included in each amplification run. Standard curves were generated by plotting cycle threshold (Ct) values against the logarithm of starting DNA quantities. The DNA amplification results of a serial 10-fold dilu - tion series of the plasmids from each specimen were compared in separate reactions. Each dilution series was tested both with and without the other target DNAs to assess the assay's ability to detect mixed infec - tions. The details of all primers and detection probes (Eurofin Genomics, Ebersberg, Germany) and the qPCR using TaqMan GeneExpression MasterMix (ThermoFischer, Switzerland) are presented in the supplementary data (Additional file 1: Tables S1, Additional file 2: Table S2). Extraction of DNA, prepa - ration of the ma ster mix and handling of qPCR prod - ucts were all performed in different rooms to prevent contamination. Data preparation All qPCR assays with an observed copy number above zero were considered positive. All qPCR assays for which no amplification curves were obtained, were con - sidered negative (equalling zero copy numbers). Kato- Katz results were calculated as mean egg counts of the two slides of each time point assessment (baseline day 1, baseline day 2, follow-up day 1 and follow-up day 2) and samples considered positive if at least 0.5 eggs per sample were identified. Data of the amplification curves were cleaned and standardised according to the standard curves with CFX Maestro Software and then uploaded to ELIMU-MDx, an open-source platform for storage, management and analysis of diagnostic qPCR data [ 39]. Subs equent statistical analyses were conducted using Stata IC15 (StataCorp., College Station, TX). The Ct value is defined as the number of qPCR cycles needed for the detection of fluorescence signal of the amplified products to pass the fixed threshold value. Accordingly, exceeding that threshold can be inter - preted as the earliest qPCR cycle at which point a sam- ple's amplification product is statistically different from 117Page 4 of 12 Keller et al. Parasit es Vectors (2020) 13:517 the background fluorescence [ 40]. Consequently, higher quantities of he lminth DNA are inversely proportional and thus, result in lower Ct values and vice versa [ 23]. Amplification c urves not following a sigmoidal shape were considered as negative results interpreting these signals as unspecific background noise. Samples below Ct value of 15 were excluded for that species, as the range of standards tested and detected was above Ct 15. Data of the amplification curves were then translated into cop - ies/\u00b5l DNA by inserting the average slopes and y-inter- cepts for each quantified target of the standard curves into a linear equation. Thus, the cycle cut-off points vary for each quencher, depending on the calibration curves obtained. This procedure was done to avoid choosing an arbitrary Ct cutoff which is known to not be ideal, by either being too low (eliminating valid results) or being too high (increasing false-positive results) [ 40]. Statistical analysis B ased on available summarised efficacy measures from a recent review [ 41] and the published literature, the CR of alb endazole against T. trichiura was assumed to be 30% compared to 50% in the ivermectin-albendazole treatment regimen according to Kato-Katz. Moreover, the correlation between the two diagnostic test results was assumed to be 0.6. A sample size of 320 Kato-Katz T.trichiura positives (160/treatment arm) was cho - sen to detect a 10% difference in CRs against T. trichi- ura between Kato Katz and qPCR with a power of 80% assuming a two-sided type 1 error of 5%. An additional subsample of 320 Kato-Katz negatives (1:1 ratio to the positives) was aimed for to determine the sensitivity of qPCR versus Kato-Katz. Since STH infections are stag - geringly prevalent on Pemba Island, we only found 180 helminth negative individuals within the screening phase. Correlation between microscopic egg count and DNA copy number Correlation between copy numbers/\u00b5l DNA according to qPCR and egg count numbers derived by the Kato-Katz thick smear method were assessed as a base for sensitiv - ity and specificity estimates. Spearman's rank correla- tion coefficients rS were calculated for each species and each time point among the samples, which were positive according to both diagnostic methods to assess potential correlation. The degree of agreement was categorised as \"poor\" (rS < 0.2), \"fair\" (0.2 rS < 0.4), moderate (0.4 rS < 0.6) good (0.6 rS < 0.8) and very good (rS 0.8) agree- ment [ 42]. Diagnostic method va riability between samples To assess the agreement of test results between base - line day 1 and day 2 and follow-up day 1 and day 2, for qPCR and Kato-Katz, Spearman's rank correlation of copy numbers and egg counts, respectively, was per - formed among all samples, which were found positive according to both techniques. An alternative assess - ment was based on Cohen's Kappa, comparing positiv - ity of qPCR and Kato-Katz between baseline day 1 and day 2 and between follow-up day 1 and 2, including negative and positive test results. The -statistics cat - egorised in the same way as the rank correlation coef - ficients rS. Overall sensitivity of KatoKatz and qPCR The sensitivity was determined assuming a 100% sen - sitivity and specificity of each diagnostic method, as disclosed by the morphology of the eggs or by the species-specific qPCR assays. Sensitivities of qPCR relative to Kato-Katz and vice versa were calculated for baseline and follow-up separately and for both time points combined. A qPCR test at baseline or follow-up was considered positive if at least one of the two sam - ples taken on the respective consecutive days provided a positive result. The 95% confidence intervals for sen - sitivities across both time points were computed using a logistic regression model with robust standard errors adjusting for longitudinal correlations of test results within individuals. Cure rates according to KatoKatz and qPCR CRs were calculated as the proportion of participants negative for infection (EPG or transformed DNA copy equalling zero) in both follow-up stool samples among those who were positive at baseline in any sample. Moreover, CRs assessed by qPCR were also calculated considering only the first follow-up sample to assess if test result reliability affects CRs. Logistic regres - sion models were used to compare CRs between dif - ferent treatment arms. Comparisons of CRs between the qPCR and the Kato-Katz method also required the use of robust standard errors adjusting for correlations of outcomes within subjects. Statistical significance of observed differences or associations was defined as a two-sided P-value smaller than 0.05. Results Two stool samples of 320 T. trichiura positive partici- pants, partially co-infected with A. lumbricoides and hookworm at baseline and two stool samples 14-21 days post-treatment were processed by both, Kato- Katz and qPCR method. As negative controls, two fae - cal samples of 180 individuals negative for STH eggs as assessed by Kato-Katz were analysed (Fig. 1). 118Page 5 of 12 Keller et al. Par asites Vectors (2020) 13:517 Overall positivity agreement according to KatoKatz and qPCR for all four examination time points pooled In total, 1020 samples were positive for T. trichiura according to Kato-Katz and 1134 were positive for T. trichiura according to qPCR. There were 394 samples with discordant results, 254 where only the qPCR-result was positive and 140 where only the Kato-Katz result was positive. Results for A. lumbricoides and hookworm showed even more pronounced differences, with most discordant tests being positive for qPCR and negative for Kato-Katz (Table 1). Correla tion between microscopic egg count and DNA copy number For T. trichiura, correlation of positive parasite loads assessed by the two diagnostic methods was moderate (rS = 0.47, 0.45, 0.47, 0.51) for all four time points (base- line day 1, baseline day 2, follow-up day 1, follow-up day 2). For A. lumbricoides, correlation was moderate (rS = 0.55) for the first and fair (rS = 0.36) for the second baseline examination time point. It was not possible to apply the Spearman's rank correlation test for the follow- up examination time points, due to only a few Kato-Katz positive samples. For hookworm, correlation was moder - ate ( rS = 0.48, 0.47) for both baseline examination time points and the first follow-up examination time point (rS = 0.49), whereas the second follow-up time point showed fair agreement (rS = 0.26) (Table 2). Both correla- tions had P-value s > 0.2 and them being chance results can therefore not be ruled out. Diagnostic method variability between samples To assess the variability within one diagnostic method, the agreements between baseline day 1 and day 2 as well as between follow-up day 1 and day 2 were calculated using Spearman's rank correlation, including all positive test results according to both techniques. qPCR showed moderate agreement for T. trichiura (rS = 0.51) and good agreement for A. lumbricoides (rS = 0.62) and hookworm (rS = 0.64) at baseline. At follow-up, moderate agreement for T. trichiura (rS = 0. 45) and hookworm (rS = 0.49) and good agreement for A. lumbricoides (rS = 0.71) was found. Kato-Katz results showed moderate agreement for T. trichiura (rS = 0.49) and good agreement for A. lumbri- coides (rS = 0.65) and hookworm (rS = 0.70) between the two baseline samples. Moderate agreement between the follow-up samples was shown for T. trichiura (rS = 0.60) and poor agreement for hookworm (rS = 0.55) was observed. Agreement could not be assessed for A. lum - bricoides at follow-up as no samples were positive by both methods (Table 3).Additionally , Cohen 's Kappa was used to assess reproducibility including positive and negative test results between baseline day 1 and day 2 and between follow-up day 1 and day 2. qPCR test results between baseline and between follow-up samples showed mod - erate agreement for T. qPCR showed good agreement between baseline ( = 0.63), but only poor agreement ( = 0.1) between follow-up samples. Kato-Katz showed very good agreement for T. trichiura ( = 0.92) and A. lumbricoides ( good agreement for hookworm ( = 0.72) between baseline samples. The agreement between follow-up samples was moderate for T. trichiura ( = 0.56) and hookworm ( = 0.56). However, there was poor agree - ment ( = 0.004) for A. lumbricoides, possibly because only a few positive samples were found by the Kato-Katz technique (Table 4). Overall, qP CR results showed greater variability between both baseline and follow-up samples compared to Kato-Katz, especially when looking only at the posi - tivity and negativity of samples and using Cohen's kappa coefficient. Overall sensitivity of KatoKatz and qPCR Across all comparisons between the two methods, the sensitivity of qPCR in detecting positive samples accord - ing to Kato-Katz was higher than the respective sensitiv- ity of Kato-Katz in detecting positive samples according to qPCR (Table 5). When pooling baseline and follow-up result s, the pooled sensitivity of qPCR relative to Kato- Katz was 93.7% for T. lumbri - and 88.4% hookworm, while the sensitivity Kato-Katz relative to was 30.4% respec tively. Interestingly, the sensitivity of Kato-Katz relative to qPCR significantly dropped from 38.5% (31.6-45.8) at baseline to 3.4% (0.4-11.9) at follow-up in the case of A. lumbricoides. Cure rates according to KatoKatz and qPCR Cure rates for T. trichiura were significantly lower with albendazole monotherapy than with combination ther - apy (ivermectin-albendazole) with both diagnostic meth- ods, while CRs were comparable for A. lumbricoides and hookworm. CRs of the combination therapy according to Kato-Katz were slightly higher (46.8 vs 36.4%, 100 vs 85.7%, 78.3 vs 71.4%) for T. trichiura , A. hookworm, respectively, when only the first qPCR stool sample was considered. However, CRs according to 119Page 6 of 12 Keller et al. Par asites Vectors (2020) 13:517 Kato-Katz were significantly higher than CRs based on qPCR (46.8 vs 23.2%, 100 vs 75.3%, 78.3 T. trichiura , A. lumbricoides hookworm, respectively, when considering an additional second qPCR stool sam - ple for the combination therapy. This was also the case for A. lumbricoides (95.0 vs 77.5%) with albendazole, while the CRs were comparable for T. trichiura (6.3 vs 5.3%) and hookworm (73.3 vs 66.7%).Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for the combination therapy (ivermectin-albendazole) compared to alben - dazole. The odds of being cured was significantly higher under combination therapy as compared to monotherapy in T. trichiura positives irrespective of the diagnostic approach and the amount of qPCR follow-up stool sam - ples. CRs and ORs according to Kato-Katz and qPCR are listed in Table 6. Fig. 1 7 of 12 Keller et al. Par asites Vectors (2020) 13:517 Discussion We evaluated the diagnostic performance of qPCR com- pared to standard Kato-Katz microscopy for the diagno- sis of STHs and the resulting treatment efficacies by both methods. This study was done within the framework of a phase III, parallel group, double blind RCT assessing the efficacy and safety of the current standard treatment (albendazole) versus a combination therapy of ivermec - tin-albendazole. This was the first study analysing two stool samples before and two stool samples after treat - ment of each participant to assess diagnostic method variability between samples to elucidate reproducibility of test results of both diagnostic methods. Moreover, we present data on the efficacy of the most promising therapy to date for treating STH infections, ivermectin- albendazole, based on molecular diagnosis. An interesting finding from the comparison of these two diagnostic methods is that an additional 41.2% of microscopy-negative samples were found T. trichiura- positive when assessed by qPCR. We hypothesise that lower DNA loads found in Kato-Katz-negative samples reflect higher detection rates by qPCR due to a higher sensitivity rather than lower specificity of the qPCR assays as remaining DNA of already dead worms or eggs can still act as a template DNA during qPCR [ 43]. We found t hat qPCR results indicate higher sensitivity for all species across all examination days compared to Kato-Katz, which substantiates previous findings [ 17, 27, 30, 34, 44-46]. Interestingly, follow-up Kato-Katz results differ signific antly compared to the baseline results in the case of A. lumbricoides, indicating a time-dependent dif - ference. The very low number of Kato-Katz positive test results post-treatment show the difficulty of detecting low A. lumbricoides worm burden by use of Kato-Katz, while qPCR was able to detect a considerable number of treatment failures. Of note, the eligibility criteria (minimal T. trichiura egg count 100 EPG, 2 or more out of 4 Kato-Katz slides positive) for trial inclusion did not consider low T. trichi - ura infection intensities. Interestingly we observed that qPCR positivity of Kato-Katz-negative samples (EPG = 0) at baseline was lower compared to follow-up, implying higher sensitivity for qPCR when assessing low infection intensities. However, interpretation requires caution, as it is unclear how long residual DNA persists after parasite clearance leading to false-positive qPCR results [ 18, 47]. Our re sults highlight, that the combination therapy (ivermectin-albendazole) shows a significantly better effi - cacy compared to the monotherapy for T. trichiura with both diagnostic methods, while CRs were comparable for A. lumbricoides and hookworm. However, the observed low to moderate CRs for ivermectin-albendazole with qPCR (23.2% for T. lumbricoides and 52.4% for hookworm) are far from benchmark target product profiles for anthelminthic drug candidates and combinations and highlight the need to develop novel efficacious treatments. A particularly striking difference in CRs of the combination chemotherapy (and for A. lumbricoides after albendazole treatment) between Kato- Katz and qPCR was observed when two qPCR samples Table 1 Positivity agreement according to Kato-Katz and qPCR for all four-examination time points pooled (n = 1636) for T.

Parasit es Vectors (2020) 13:517 were considered post-treatment. These results also stress to analyse two qPCR samples post-treatment in clinical trials to elucidate the true efficacy of treatments. Although hypothesised, we only observed a fair to moderate agreement between microscopic egg count and DNA copy, which is in agreement with findings from Barda et al. [ 33]. Our results do not corroborate the observ ation of Mejia et al. [ 18], who found a significant good cor relation (r = 0.7) between egg counts measured by the coprological Kato-Katz method and the DNA quantified by qPCR for A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura . The reason for this discrepancy is not entirely clear, but one partial explanation could be that only a few A. lum - bricoides- or hookworm-positive samples were found post-treatment according to Kato-Katz in our study and that infection intensities were relatively low in these par - ticipants. As there is no strong correlation between egg counts and DNA copy number, finding a real gold stand - ard for practical use remains a profound challenge, ham- pering the comparison of STH diagnostic tools.As egg excretion is highly variable over time, there is considerable variation in EPG of faecal samples collected on consecutive days [ 34-36]. It is well known that Kato- Katz shows im proved sensitivity when performed on sev - eral samples on different days [ 48, 49]. We observed that Kato-Katz s howed very good agreement for T. trichiura and A. lumbricoides and good agreement for hookworm at baseline between day 1 and day 2, whereas qPCR only showed good agreement between day 1 and day 2 for A. lumbricoides, but not for T. trichiura and hookworm, indicating lower test result reproducibility of the qPCR method. This apparent high correlation of Kato-Katz test results might be explained by the laboratory techni - cian's skills, as the same well-trained microscopists were reading the stool samples every day, in addition to rather high T. trichiura parasite load (EPG 100 as inclusion criterion). The reason for the surprisingly low qPCR test reproducibility is not entirely clear; however, Pilotte et al. [50] found that common qPCR make use of sub- optimal targe t s equences limiting detection and species- specificity. Another explanation could be that, in contrastTable 6 Comparison of ecacy in terms of Cure Rates (CRs) and Odds Ratio (OR) for being cured between treatment arms (albendazole vs ivermectin-albendazole), by diagnostic approach (Kato-Katz on samples of day 1 and 2 vs qPCR on rst day sample only and qPCR on samples of day 1 and 2) a P-values of the odds ratio (OR) for being cured between albendazole monotherapy (ALB) and ivermectin-albendazole (IVM-ALB) derived from logistic regression models Note: CRs in bold highlight significant differences (P < 0.05) between CRs assessed by Kato-Katz and two qPCR samples in the respective treatment arm (i.e. ALB or (0.4-1.9) 0.184 123Page 10 of 12 Keller et al. Par asites Vectors (2020) 13:517 to bacteria and viruses, isolation of parasite DNA out of faecal samples is a challenging process as the wall of hel - minth eggs is difficult to lyse and thus several additional steps are needed to achieve release of nucleic acids [ 12, 51, 52]. Moreover, we based our analyses on DNA cop - ies/\u00b5l as qP CR parameter for infection intensity, while consensus has not been reached on the optimal qPCR parameter with regard to reliability and reproducibility assessment. We are aware that a number of limitations might have influenced the results obtained. The sample input vol - umes of the Kato-Katz assays are considerably larger than those of the qPCR assays, which might substantially increase sensitivity for Kato-Katz given the stochastic distribution of eggs in stool samples. On the other hand, increasing the stool volume for DNA extraction would not be possible, as faecal specimens contain various sub - stances acting in a qPCR inhibitory manner [ 53]. Another limitation i s that, in contrast to Kato-Katz, qPCR samples were not analysed in duplicates. Further research needs to be performed to elucidate if and for how long residual DNA may persist after parasite clearance as this might lead to false-positive qPCR results post-treatment [ 18, 29, 47]. Furthermore, we fully agree with Levecke et al. [54], that an agreement on an absolute universal unit for qPCR i s needed to establish best comparison parameters for these two diagnostic methods. Lastly, it is impor - tant to note, that the standardisation and adherence to one approved protocol would help to achieve more readily comparable results between different research laboratories. Conclusions The sensitive and scalable nature of qPCR makes its usage in large-scale diagnosis of intestinal helminths appealing over the rather operator-dependent micro - scopic method. DNA samples can be stored for further use, such as genetic characterisation and molecular typ - ing, which might be of interest in surveillance studies to detect sporadic and focal infections or to monitor disease recrudescence. The evidence from this study implies sta - tistically lower CRs (the primary outcome of this trial) for the combination therapy (ivermectin-albendazole) for all three species when assessed with two qPCR samples compared to Kato-Katz. Thus, it underlines the impor - tance of the need for standardised and accurate molec- ular diagnostic tools, which are applicable in peripheral field settings, for future monitoring within STH control and/or elimination programmes and for developing novel efficacious treatments. This study has revealed for the first time, that qPCR test results show greater between day variability for baseline as well as post-treatment samples compared to Kato-Katz calling for a multi-sam - ple analysis approach in order to improve qPCR-based diagnosis. This is of particular importance for studies aiming at assessing accurate disease prevalence as well as treatment efficacy. However, it needs to be carefully evaluated if the obtained higher sensitivity comes at the cost of the lower test reproducibility and how important this finding is in the context of preventive chemotherapy and the surveillance of low prevalence settings. Daily stool sample analyses to monitor dynamics of DNA copy numbers over a longer period post-treatment using the qPCR method might be one way forward to answer this question.

The objective of this study was to evaluate Fecal Calprotectin (FC) and Fecal Occult Blood (FOB) in individuals infected and non-infected with STHs to identify potential intestinal morbidity markers. Methods: Stool from participants diagnosed positive for Trichuris trichiura and concomitant STH infections from three countries was used to perform FC and FOB point-of-care assays. Simultaneously, identi ed STH negative participants underwent FC and FOB testing as controls. Potential associations between test results and determinants were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression. Findings: In total, 1034 T. trichiura infected cases (mostly light infections) and 157 STH negative controls were tested for FC and FOB. Among all participants tested, 18 \u00a25% had /C2150mg/g FC concentration, while 14 (1 \u00a22%) were positive for FOB. No statistically signi cant association was found between T. trichiura infection or Asca- ris lumbricoides co-infection and FC concentration, while an inverse association (odds ratio (OR): 0 \u00a245, 95% credible intervals (CrI): hookworm co-infection and FC concentration. In Lao PDR, the proportion of participants in the /C2150mg/g FC category was signi cantly higher in the oldest age category compared to the 5 /C011 years group (OR: 3 \u00a231, 95% CrI: 1 \u00a262, 7\u00a224). Too few participants were found positive for FOB to derive any conclusions. Interpretation: Studies are needed to better understand the relationship between intestinal morbidity and STH infections. Suitable, standardized, low-cost markers of STH attributable morbidity to better monitor the impact of STH control interventions are necessary. Funding: BMGF ( OPP1153928 ) \u00a92021 The Author(s).

Introduction More than 1 \u00a25 billion people worldwide are infected marginal- ized populat ions, particularly in trop ical and subtropical regions, where access to water, sanitation, and hygiene is inadequate [ 2,3]. STH infec- tions manifest, if left untreated, as generally asymptomatic chronic infections causing both concurrent and delayed-onset pathologies affecting the human host [4]. Chronic infections and/or infections of heavy intensitie s can result in malnutrition, malabsorption, reduced growth rate, intestinal obstruction, poor iron status, and iron de ciency* Corresponding author.

Embryonated T. trichiura eggs hatch in the small intestine and potentially attach to the mucosa in the large intestine, whereas larvae penetrate the epithelial cells for subsequent growing and molting into adult stages [15]. Adult worms embed their head part into a intracellular niche in the large intestine [16] causing petechial lesions, blotchy mucosal hemorrhage, and oozing leading to both mucosal and systemic immune responses [17/C019]. Similarly, hook- worm larvae use their cutting plates to attach to the mucosa to begin feeding and molting into adult worms, attributing to intestinal mor- bidity [20]. In contrast, A. lumbricoides feeds passively and never attaches directly to the mucosa [ 4,21]. The present goal of global control programs recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), is to reduce morbidity with pre- ventive chemotherapy (i.e. administration of albendazole or meben- dazole without prior diagnosis) to at-risk populations (i.e. school- aged children and women of reproductive age) with accompanying improvements in access to clean water and sanitation to reduce worm burden associated morbidity [22]. Inherent with such control interventions is the necessity to de ne and validate indicators of hel- minth attributable morbidity. Even though in most cases morbidity is associated with infecton intensity [23], assessed by classic micro- scopic diagnosis detecting eggs in the feces, appropriate morbidity parameters are of pivotal importance as they provide additional information on the degree to which the STH infection affects the patient. This is particularly important after anthelmintic treatment, when intensity of infection has reduced markedly, but morbidity stillis present [24]. A better clinical understanding of measurable reduc- tions in STH attributable morbidity in response to anthelmintics is needed to appropriately shape and evaluate ongoing or future STH control programs [25]. Fecal biomarkers are promising non-invasive indicators possibly reflecting mucosal in flammation or damage, as molecules from the intestinal mucosa are transported in passing with the feces [26].I ti s a well-known phenomenon that the occurrence of blood in feces can be indicative of pathologic changes, especially in the context of malignancies or in [27]. macrophages these cells into and degranulation inside the intes- tinal lumen leads to increased secretion of FC as a response to local inflammation [ 30,31]. Given the fact that FC levels are stable in feces andnot i nfluenced by systemic infections, FC is an interesting biomarker for understanding the association between intestinal infection and inflammation by measuring the localized intestinal in flammation [19,32/C034]. Therefore, FC is widely used across gastroenterology practi- ces as a non-invasive surrogate marker for disease activity and response to treatment [ 35,36]. In the past years, its use in enteric infections is increasing, particularly as a correlative marker for clinical severity and in evaluating bacterial and viral pathogens [37]. Fecal blood is a late symptom of in flammatory tissue damage [30]. For example , blood loss due to T. trichiura infections has been estimated to be 5 mL per adult worm per day [38]. Thus, fecal occult blood (FOB) might be another candidate for a morbidity marker of helminthiasis. FOB tests have been previously used for identifying blood loss in hook- worm infection, trichuriasis, and intestinal schistosomiasis [39/C042]. However, most s tudies used guaiac-based FOB tests that are known to be less sensitive immunochemical assays [43]. Rapid immunological FC and FOB dipstick tests are non-invasive, easily preserved, and reliable diagnostic tools allowing immediate detection of FC for diagnosing intestinal in flammation and FOB for occult blood in the feces indicating intestinal morbidity [44]. Charac- teristics and applicability ofeld-appropriate diagnostic tools using proxy markers for STH morbidity are not well investigated to date [42]. Moreover, previous work on morbidity indicators is mostly lim- itedto research on schistosomiasis causing gastrointestinal morbidity [41/C043,45/C047]. Although, some case reports suggest mucosal dam- age as a consequence of STH infections [ 48,49], evidence on the asso- ciation between infection and intestinal in flammation is lacking [8]. The objective of the current study was to investigate FC and FOB as potential STH gut morbidity markers as a tool to monitor the impact of community-level deworming. Using FC and FOB as bio- markers, we aimed at assessing the potential association between the presence of intestinal in flammation and STH infection status. 2. Methods 2.1. Study design The presented data derive from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) assessing ef cacies of ivermectin-albendazole and albendazole alone against T. trichiura and concomitant STH infections in partici- pants aged 6 /C060 years. The study was conducted in communities in the Lagunes region in C ^ote d 'Ivoire, in the Luang Prabang Province in Lao PDR, and in South Pemba on Pemba Island, Tanzania during the screening period (Nov 2018 to Dec 2019) of the trial. Prior to study initiation, ethical clearance was granted by the Ethics Committee of Northwestern and Central Switzerland (EKNZ; reference no: BASEC Nr Req-2018 /C000494), no.: ZAMREC/0003/Feb/2018), the Comit la le SIDA (reference no.: 088 /C018/MSHP/CNESVS-Research in context Evidence before this study Long-term infections with soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) con- tribute to substantial morbidity; however, evidence on appropri- ate point-of-care indicators of STH attributable morbidity is scarce. We searched in PubMed for all articles published before Nov 2, 2020 which mentioned \"helminth\" without language restrictions. Contradictory ndings result from a small body of evidence (nine studies) on the association between STH infection status, infection intensity and intestinal morbidity, using Fecal Calprotectin (FC) or Fecal Occult Blood (FOB) as indicators. Only one study used novel rapid diagnostic immunoassay tests for FOB detection, while none had a suf cient sample size to derive meaningful conclusions. Added value of this study This is the rst large scale study testing FC and FOB as potential proxy markers for STH attributable intestinal morbidity in three different countries. No association between the presence of intestinal in flammation or mucosal bleeding, assessed with FC and FOB, and T. trichiura and A. lumbricoides infection status was found, while a negative association between FC concentra- tion and hookworm infection was found. Implications of all the available evidence Further research should focus on the development and evalua- tion of potential morbidity markers, as the appropriate moni- toring of STH attributable morbidity might become as important as diagnosing the infection itself. Thus, appropriate indicators of helminth attributable morbidity are still lacking.2 C. Patel et al. / EClinicalMedicine 32 (2021) 100724 131km), the Direction de la Pharmacie, M /C19edicament et des Labora- toires (reference no. ECCI00918) in C ^ote d 'Ivoire, and the National Ethics Committee for Health Research, Ministry of Health in Lao PDR (reference no. 093/NECHR). Trial and study details are summarized in the published trial protocol [50] and in the trial registration (clinical- trials.gov, reference: NCT03527732, date assigned: 17 May 2018). Prior to study enrollment, all inhabitants of the chosen villages were invited to information sessions at local places, during which the research staff explained the purpose and procedures of this study, as well as the potential bene ts and risks of participation. Written informed consent was obtained from adults and parents or legal guardians of children below the age of adulthood (21 years in C ^ote d'Ivoire and 18 years in Lao PDR and Pemba Island). Children aged below the age of adulthood gave written assent (C ^ote d 'Ivoire) or oral assent (Lao PDR and Pemba Island). 2.2. Study procedures A short census was conducted at the start of screening, during which the name, sex, age, and village name were recorded for all par- ticipants. Consenting and eligible participants (aged 6 /C060, as the only inclusion criteria for screening) were asked to provide two fresh morning stool samples (as per inclusion criteria), preferably on con- secutive days, in containers labelled with their assigned unique ID. Collected stool samples were kept in a cool box containing ice packs while being transported to the eld laboratory. Duplicate Kato-Katz thick smears (2 \u00a341\u00a27 mg of stool) were pre- pared and examined under a microscope by experienced laboratory technicians for species-speci c diagnosis of STH ova (i.e. T. trichiura, A. lumbricoides, and hookworm) within 60 min after preparation to avoid over-clearing of hookworm eggs [51] following the World Health Organization (WHO) standard procedures [52]. Additionally, in Lao PDR, Kato-Katz thick smear slides were examined for and infections of Strongyloides stercoraliswere classi as larvae-positive or negative using the Baermann technique [53]. To assure high quality of the microscopic evaluation, 10% of all Kato-Katz slides were randomly chosen, re-labeled, and re- examined for A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura . In brief, microscopic results were considered inconsistent if there was a difference in pres- ence/absence of a speci c helminth species, or if differences in egg counts exceeded (i) 10 eggs for Kato-Katz thick smears with /C20100 eggs, or (ii) exceeded 20% for Kato-Katz thick smears with >100 eggs. In case of discrepancies between the original and the quality control read, slides were read by a third independent microscopist and results were discussed until consensus was reached [54]. Ofthose found positive for T. trichiura ,ar a n d o ms u b s a m p l eo f unique ID numbers (generated by a co-investigator not involved in the laboratory work) were chosen to undergo FC and FOB testing the same day. At the same time, of those participants found nega- tive for T. trichiura, A. lumbricoides,a n dh o o k w o r m ,as u b s a m p l eo f approximately 50 participants were chosen at random (using a list generated in the same manner as described above) in each setting to undergo FC and FOB testing. Participants who were found not to be infected with T. trichiura , but were infected with A. lumbricoides and/or hookworm infections were not included in this study. All included participants donated two fecal samples in order to increase the precision of the STH infection result. On Pemba Island, therst of the two fecal sample was used for subsequent rapid diagnostic testing (RDT). Due to the low prevalence of T. trichiura infections in the communities chosen in Lao PDR and C ^ote d 'Ivoire, it was decided to use the second donated stool sample to ensure participants in this study would also be included in the larger trial, which had a minimum infection intensity cut-off of 100 T. trichiura eggs per gram of stool. Cases that were subsequently enrolled in the clinical trial, were clinically examined by a physician and their height, weight, and hemoglobin levels recorded. However, negative controls, whom were not eligible for trial inclusion, did not undergo clinical examination. Fig. 1. Study design.

Patel et al. / EClinicalMedicine 32 (2021) FC detec- tion according to the manufacturer 's instructions. In brief, the partici- pant number was rst written on the Specimen Dilution Buffer tube (3 mL) before unscrewing. The sampling stick, attached to the cap, was rst twisted into different places of the fecal sample in order to make sure that both slits at the head of the stick contained stool. The sampling stick was put back in the tube and shaken to suspend the feces in thebuffer. A dipstick was then inserted into the perforation area of the buffer tube before inverting the tube by 90\u00b0 for two seconds. The tube was then placed on a flat surface in an upright position. Results were read after ten minutes with one test line indicating a valid test result with a FC level <50mg/g, two lines indicating a level of 50 /C0200mg/g, and three lines indicating a level >200mg/g of FC concentration in the test specimen based on reference values provided by the manufacturer. FC levels <50mg/g were interpreted as no in flammation, 50 /C0200mg/g of FC as possible infl ammation and >200mg/g of FC as likely active inflammation, similar to suggestions by Bressler et al [55].

Unlike traditional guaiac tests, this test is based on highly speci c monoclonal antibodies that only detect human hemoglobin, thus, food substances containing hemoglobin or peroxidase activity do not in fluence test results. Test procedure was similar to the aforementioned FC test, however; positive results were readable immediately as soon as two blue lines appeared, negative samples remained with only one blue line after ten minutes. Detailed test characteristics (e.g. sensitivity and speci city) are summarized by the manufacturer and published online [56]. Fecal ra pid tests were conducted by laboratory personnel not involved in assessing parasitological data and masked to the iden- tity of participants providing samples. The results from each test were then recorded on a personal log form by the technician involved in the fecal rapid diagnostic testing. If no control line appeared, the result was recorded as invalid and was repeated with a new dipstick. 2.4. Outcomes The objective of this study was to evaluate FC and FOB as potential STH gut morbidity markers. Adjusted odds ratios of FC and FOB val- ues were calculated for STH infected participants compared to STH negative controls.2.5. Sample size We aimed for a total sample size of 1050: 300 T. trichiura positive individuals and 50 individuals negative for all STH infections per coun- try. This study was conducted within the framework of a RCT; therefore, no separate sample size calculation has been conducted. Since preva- lence of FC and FOB is unlikely very rare and varies drastically by setting, a sample size of above 1000 was deemed to be suf cient. Moreover, experience has shown that the study would be suf ciently powered unless the outcome or the exposure is rare. We estimated we would be able to detect a halving of risk with at least 80% power if the prevalence in the non-exposed group is at least 10% or higher. 2.6. Statistical analysis Data were double entered into EpiInfo 3.5.4 by two independent data clerks and crosschecked using the data compare tool of EpiInfo 3.5.4 Any discrepancies between the two datasets were resolved by consulting the original hardcopy. Descriptive analysis was done in Stata IC 15 (StataCorp.; College Station, TX), whereas all statistical estimations were performed in R 3.5.1 (RStudio, PBC, Boston, MA). Proportions of infection with T. trichiura and co-infections with A. lumbricoides and/or hookworm were assessed for all participants in all three settings, while for Lao PDR O. viverrini and S. stercoralis co- infections were additionally assessed. Results from the duplicate Kato-Katz smears from each of the two stool samples were summed and multiplied by a factor of six to be expressed as mean egg count per gram (EPG) of feces. Associations between FC with participant 's age, sex, country, and parasitic infec- tions was assessed using Bayesian logistic regression with logit link to estimate odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% credible inter- vals (CrI). The Bayesian framework - as implemented in the R package 'rstanarm' (v 2.19.3) - was preferred to avoid potential quasi separa- tion problems. We used the default weakly informative prior distri- butions for all parameters, i.e. normal priors with mean 0 and standard deviation 2 \u00a25. The Markov chain Monte Carlo alogorithm drew 1000 samples from 4 chains after a warm-up of additional 1000 samples per chain. Convergence was assessed by the R-hat statistic. Smoothing lines in gures were predicted via generalized additive models for binomial data. Due to the low number of individuals (n= 14/1189) testing positive for FOB, it was decided to forego formal statistical testing and present the results descriptively. 2.7.

The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and hadnal responsibility for the decision to submit for publication. 3. Results 3.1. Participants characteristics Fig. 1 shows the study design by setting. Out of the 6567 partici- pants screened, 2983 (45\u00a24%) were positive for T. trichiura infection and 3584 (54\u00a2 6%) were negative for all STH infections. From these, 1034 of the 2983 T. trichiura positive cases and 157 of the STH nega- tive cases were randomly selected for FC and FOB testing. Baseline parasitological and demographic characteristics of partic- ipants surveyed for FC and FOB are summarized in Table 1 . Of those participants infected with T. trichiura (n= 1034), 51 \u00a25% were female, while the mean age of those was 18 \u00a27(\u00a715\u00a20) years. The identi ed STH negative participants (n = 157) were slightly older with a mean age of 30 \u00a21(\u00a716\u00a22), while 66 \u00a22% of those participants were female.Table 1 Baseline characteristics of T. trichiura positive cases and STH negative controls.

(1998). dO. viverrini and S. stercoralis co-infections were only assessed in Lao PDR. 134In addition to T. trichiura infection, 345 (33\u00a23%) participants were co-infected with A. lumbricoides , while 338 (32 \u00a27%) participants har- bored a hookworm co-infection. Among those participants in Lao PDR, 18 \u00a20% were found to be co-infected with O. viverrini and 17 \u00a27% with S. stercoralis . Mean body mass index (BMI) and mean hemoglo- bin concentration were 18 \u00a21(\u00a74\u00a26) and hookworm co-infections, respectively ( Table 2 ). Table 3 shows that the EPG distribution differs among settings with Pemb a I sland, having a higher median EPG (558, IQR 330 /C01224) C^ote d PDR (median EPG: 252, IQR 150/C0 543) those with T. trichiura infection. A. coides co-infection was found in of d 'Ivoire, Lao PDR, and Pemba Island, respectively; though the proportion of T. trichiura infected participants with hookworm co- infection was higher in Lao PDR (91 \u00a27%) compared to C ^ote d 'Ivoire (7\u00a26%) and Pemba Island (9 \u00a29%). 3.2. Fecal rapid diagnostic test results As shown in Table 2 , of those diagnosed with T. tri chiura (n= 1034), most participants (842 (86 \u00a27%)) were found to have a normal FC concen- tration of <50mg/g, while 149 (12 \u00a25%) were found to have elevated FC concentrations of 50 /C0200mg/g. Only a few participants (43 (3 \u00a26%)) were identi ed with high (> 200mg/g) FC levels. Most participants har- boring a co-infection with A. lumbricoides (78\u00a29%) or hookworm (79 \u00a20%) were found to have a normal FC concentration of <50mg/g. Negative controls showed a similar distribution of FC levels; the majority 129 (82 \u00a22%) had a normal FC concentration of <50mg/g, while 18 (11 \u00a24%) were identi ed with FC concentrations of 50/C0200mg/g and 10 (6 \u00a24%) with high FC concentrations of >200mg/g. Age, Sex, BMI, and hemoglobin level were similar among the different FC levels. During the study, 1189 participants were surveyed for FOB, while only a minority of 14 (1 \u00a22%) participants were found to be positive. Most of the participants (78 \u00a26%) tested positive for FOB were found in the Asian setting. Country speci c study results are summarized in Table 3. Fig. 2 shows the proportion of /C2150mg/gconcentration of FC by EPG for each STH and, additionally, by country and age group. For T. trichiura infections and hookworm co-infections, FC proportion of/C2150mg/g remains flat as EPG increases; while there is an increase in percentage of /C2150mg/g starting at 100 EPG for A. lum- bricoides co-infections. Results of multivariable logistic regression models are summarized inTable 4 , while country-speci c resu lts are shown in S1 Table (Sup- plementary Table 1). When results from all three countries were com- bined, no association was found between FC and infection with T. trichiura and co-infection with A. lumbricoides , while hookworm co- infection was associated with (OR: 0 \u00a245, 95% CrI: 0 \u00a226, 0\u00a275). Country was the greatest overall predictor of FC concentration with Lao PDR having a higher odds \u00a214, 0\u00a237) of com- pared, respectively, to C ^ote d 'Ivoire. Older participants (ages 36 /C064 years) had a statistically signi cant higher odds of /C2150mg/g FC con- centration when compared to participants ages (OR: \u00a249, 95% CrI: 1 odds of /C2150mg/g FC con- centration amongst older participants was also \u00a231, 95% CrI: 1 \u00a262, 7 \u00a224 for 36/C064 age group). The raw data suggests a country \u00a3T. trichiura interaction. Therefore, an additional model including the interaction terms was tted, which can be found in S2 Table (Supplementary Table 2). However, the estimated odds ratios for age categories, sex, and co-infections changed only slightly.Table 2 Test results of fecal calprotectin and fecal occult blood in T. trichiura positive and STH negative participants.

Discussion We applie d FC and FOB tests to assess the relationship between STH infections and intestinal infl ammation or mucosal bleeding in three dif- ferent countries. It is of pivotal importance to nd an affordable, stan- dardized and simple point-of-care test to assess STH attributable morbidity to better survey control interventions. Evidence on the associ- ation between local in flammation and STH infections is scarce; how- ever, key problems with much of the literature are the generally small sample sizes [ 40,57,58] and the use of different biomarkers [19] for intestinal inflammation leading to contradictory results. We found no associations of FC and FOB with T. trichiura infection and A. lumbricoides co-infection status and intensity in each of the three settings tested, demonstrating that FC and FOB are not good proxy markers for STH attributable gut morbidity. Known immuno- regulatory properties of STHs have shown a down-regulation of host response to limit in flammation and tissue damage, which may explain our ndings [ 59,60]. Albeit our results show a slight protec- tive effect of hookworm co-infection, this might be attributed to the hypothesis that hookworm infection causes a dampening effect on FC levels by inhibiting neutrophils, the main calprotectin-producing cell type [61]. Of note, N.americanus is expected to be the predominant hookworm species in our settings, ingesting around 0 \u00a2001 mL blood per day [62/C065]Our results suggest age and setting are greater pre- dictors of FC concentration than the presence of helminth infection. Though age has been thoroughly established as a predictor for inflammation in the body [ 66,67], the root cause of why setting is predictive of high calprotectin is yet to be determined although dif- ferent diets and exercise might play a role [68]. Ourndings add to the small body of evidence currently available on FC concentration and helminth infections. The results we found substantiate on a larger scale the previous ndings of de Gier and col- leagues, who reported no association between FC concentration and STH infection in 2018 [19]. Additionally, de Gier et al. reported no association between hookworm and FC concentration at baseline or at seven months follow-up [69]. Cepon-Robins et al. similarly observed ina small sample size among the Shuar of AmazonianEcuador that the relationship between infection and intestinal inflammation were age- and species-speci c. These researchers found children singly infected with T. trichiura to have signi cantly lower FC levels, regardless their infection intensity, while no signi - cant relationships were found among adults [57]. Surprisingly, weonly found 12 FOB positive results among all STH infected participants. Though we did not formally apply a statistical test for FOB, due to the low number of positive test results, our nd- ings correlate fairly well with Raj et al. as they also did not nd a sig- nicant difference in the rate of FOB between T. trichiura orA. lumbricoides positive and negative children [70]. These ndings are supported by Wakid who did not detect signi cant evidence on intes- tinal parasitic infections, including STHs, and positive FOB tests [71]. In contrast, the ndings of Kanzaria et al. and Wanachiwanawin et al. support a relationship between FOB and moderate and heavy T. tri- chiura infections only [ 40,43]. Different ndings were documented for schistosomiasis, a strong association between prevalence and intensity of Schistosoma mansoni infection and FOB was observed after repeated treatment over a period of one year in a cohort of young children [41]. These ndings seem to be supported by Bustinduy et al. who found a signi cant cor- relation between FOB and moderate and heavy egg intensities of S. mansoni infection [46]. Moreover, Kanzaria et al. found a positive cor- relation between FOB and Schistosoma japonicum [43]. However, comparison to these studies on schistosomiasis needs to be inter- preted with caution, as the host-parasite interaction differs compared to STHs. In the case of intestinal schistosomiasis, the disease is pro- gressed by the chronic and downregulated granulomatous response to entrapped eggs causing polypsosis and pseudopolypsosis leading to rectal bleeding [72]. According to our ndings, we suggest that intestinal in flammation and mucosal bleeding caused by STH infections potentially are very low-grade. There might be an age attributable reduction in the rate of parasite establishment, survival, and fecundity due to acquired immunity [73]. Moreover, immune system response to presence of STH ovamight differ between the chosen settings. Additionally, blood loss in STH infected individuals might particularly result from theTable 3 Age, sex, and co-infection for participants surveyed for fecal calprotectin and fecal occult blood by country.

Therefore, it remains challenging measuring morbidity in the context of STH infection and treatment, which is in agreement with Bogoch et al., who conducted a detailed clinical examination to determine whether STH cause mea- surable morbidity [75], which was not the case. It is plausible that a number of limitations might have in fluenced the results obtained. Some controversy remains on the optimal cut- off values. Historical data on FC levels derive from delevoped coun- tries and evidence on normal FC levels in populations equivalent to our study population is still limited, hampering interpretation of our data. Little evidence suggests to consider FC levels of 50 /C0200mg/g as normal in people of African-Caribbean descent; however, repeated tests at different time points in several settings would need to be done to strengthen this nding [76]. Similar to most point-of-care RDTs, precision can be limited to ease interpretation and dissemina- tion of results. A meta-analysis by Lin et al. found that in regular FC RDTs, sensitivity is decreasing with higher FC levels, while speci city is increasing [77]. Moreover, the limit of detection of the FC test used in this study was>200mg/g, however, especially values >500mg/g seem to highly predict pathological ndings [76]. As most STH infec- tions of our study population were of light infection intensities, we might have missed an association between heavy infections and intestinal in flammation (FC) or mucosal bleeding (FOB). Furthermore, our study design was restricted to cases of T. trichiura, which limits the interpretation for A. lumbricoides and hookworm infections to co- infections rather than single infections, which may affect the inter- pretation of the results. As FC and FOB tests are not disease-speci c, we were not able to control for chronic gastrointestinal diseases, malaria, schistosomiasis, and other confounding infective agents, such as bacterial pathogens. In addition, due to monetary constraints, we only analysed one fecal sample for FC/FOB per participant and a sufcient internal quality control method for FC/FOB testing could not be established. Future studies should establish such controls, whenever possible, by partially re-labeling and re-examining resultsof tests. Moreover, as in many multicountry research, various chal- lenges arose across multiple settings. Differences in diet, culture, and social norms were unable to be accounted for and could potentially bias results. In addition, varying seasonality, host susceptibility, and parasite strains would have an uncontrollable impact on the ndings of this study. In spite of these challenges, the results of this study add to the expanding body of literature of STH attributable morbidity. Lastly, the generalizability of our ndings are limited to populations in resource-limited settings with recurring and chronic STH infections. In conclusion, we were not able to detect intestinal morbidity in our study population using FC and FOB as proxy markers. Other potential markers of intestinal in flammation including antitrypsin, eosinophilic protein X, TNF a, or lysozyme have been suggested for diagnosing in flammatory bowel disease, which may be expanded to test for STH attributable intestinal morbidity. However, these test suffer from low diagnostic performance or have not been investi- gated well enough [78]. Furthermore, markers assessing other facets ofSTH attributable intestinal morbidity, such as mucosal changes, are needed. Thus, eld applicable morbidity markers for STH infections need to be further explored to appropriately monitor and evaluate current global control strategies as monitoring levels of morbidity might become as important as diagnosing the infection itself. 5.

Organisational, cultural, infrastructuraland ethical challenges may vary between settings although conduct of clinical trialsfor the same disease (in our case soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections) share similar risks for implementation. We use the example of a phase III randomised controlled trial, conducted between 2018 and 2020 in C ^ote d 'Ivoire, Lao PDR and Pemba Island (Tanzania), to share challenges faced and mitigation strategies to guide future planningof studies in similar settings. We describe the planning, screening, enrolment and imple-mentation phases in each of the three settings. Our findings indicate that involvementof local staff and close collaboration are essential factors for successful trial preparationand implementation. A strategic plan adapted to each setting with a distinct focus oncommunity engagement and workforce is crucial to proceed efficiently. Mutual trustbetween the trial population and the trial team is of utmost importance and allowsfor early reaction and adaption to emerging issues. 1. Introduction Soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) are the most common and wide- spread poverty-driven parasites in humans worldwide affecting nearly 1.5 billion people mostly living in tropical and subtropical regions ( Amazigo et al., 2012 ;Pullan et al., 2014; WHO, 2017 ). Preventive chemotherapy (PC), which is the regular administration of a single dose of an anthelminthic drug to at-risk populations, is the main strategy to reduce STH burden rec- ommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) (2017) . Although the mass dr ug administration (MDA) of anthelminthic drugs has shown benefits in reducing prevalence and intensity of STHs in various populations, its sus-tainability and choice of appropriate implementation strategies (e.g. school-based vs. community-wide treatment schemes, enhanced minimal coverage rates) are under debate ( Anderson et al., 2017 ;Farrell et al., 2018 ;Lo et al., 2017).Mor eover, currently used standard drugs (i.e. the benzimidazoles albe- ndazole and mebendazole) do not show satisfactory efficacy against all STH species and potentially emerging drug resistance is more pressing than ever,yet only few other drugs have been tested for anthelminthic activity in humans or are currently in the pipeline ( Schulz et al., 2018 ). Cond uc ting and implementing randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are important steps in determining the safety and efficacy of various treat- ments, and are also crucial for comparing and improving the use of drugs, vaccines, medical devices and diagnostics to reduce the risk posed by a dis-ease ( Institute of Medicine, 2009 ). The scope of clinical trials is growing2 Ladina Keller et al.ARTICLE IN PRESS 144rapidly, although RCTs on neglected tropical diseases are underrepresented in clinical research ( Kappagoda and Ioannidis, 2014 ;Mbuagbaw et al., 2011 ). Howev er , the lack of high quality evidence from different STH endemicity profiles on best treatment choice (e.g. the use of drug combinations) has led to an increasing number of RCTs ( Asbjornsdottir et al., 2018 ;Pullan et al., 2019 ; Vlaminck et al., 2018 ) and is also the rationale behind the multi-country trial to be de scribed in this critical analysis ( Patel et al., 2019 ). Theco nduct of clinical studies applying Good Clinical Practice (GCP), from trial design to dissemination of results, is complex and bears many chal-lenges. This is particularly evident when conducting clinical research in resource-limited settings that are the target areas for RCTs on STH infec- tions. There may be a lack of proper infrastructure and human resources call-ing for the build-up of field laboratories and/or health centres as well ascapacity building with additional training efforts for trial staff. In order to keep recruitment rates high, STH trials target the most affected populations, which are mostly poor, rural and marginalized populations living in areas difficult toaccess often exacerbated by unstable environmental situations, such as heavy,seasonal rains. Moreover, an over-dispersed frequency distribution of STH infections is observed ( Croll and Ghadirian, 1981 ), with most individuals harbou ring light infections and few with heavy infections. The transmission patterns may be highly focal ( Halliday et al., 2019 ). Hence, RCTs on STHs often in volve screening of large numbers of populations in remote areas for recruitment of qualifying cases ( Moser et al., 2017 ;Vercruysse et al., 2011 ). There is only scarce scientific literature on trial methodology, trial pro- cedures and mitigation strategies to overcome challenges faced during clin- ical research taking place in less developed healthcare environments. Thus,our main aim is to fill this knowledge gap and discuss the issues faced during the implementation of an ivermectin-albendazole co-administration phase III trial against Trichuris trichiura in three resource-constrained settings. The gained insights may inform investigators working in the described orsimilar settings in future clinical and epidemiological research on parasitic worms. Lastly, we will reflect on lessons learned and propose strategies to address real-world hurdles. 2.

The ratio- nale of this trial was to generate new evidence on the efficacy (in terms ofcure rates) and safety of co-administered ivermectin-albendazole comparedto albendazole monotherapy (standard of care) against T. trichiura infections in community members aged 6 -60years in different transmission settings and geographies. Secondary outcomes included cure rates against hookworm,Ascaris lumbricoides andStrongyloides stercoralis infections, egg reduction rates, adverse events and potential extended effects (re-infection rates 6 and12 months post-treatment) against all STH species, and comparison of efficacy measures by different diagnostic approaches (microscopy vs. qPCR). The trial included one baseline and three follow-up assessments at 14 -21days, 6 months, and 12 months post-treatment. Eligible for trial inclusion wereallT. trichiura positive members aged 6 -60years that had a minimal faecal egg count of 100 eggs per gram (EPG), at least 2 out of 4 Kato-Katz slidespositive, no recent (within last 4 weeks) use of anthelminthic drug and notpresenting any health condition putting the individuals at risk for any conse-quences from treatment. 2.2 Trial management team The Swiss-based Principal Investigator (PI) and Co-PI were responsible forthe international oversight of all three trials, while additional local Co-PIswere responsible for the individual country requirements. Swiss-based PhD students worked as trial site coordinators during trial screening, enrol- ment, treatment and follow-up with the help of the respective local Co-PI,who was responsible for recruiting and coordinating local staff (e.g. labora-tory technicians). We collaborated with the following three institutions: the Centre Suisse de Recherches Scientifiques (CSRS) en C ^ote d'Ivoire based in Abidjan, the Lao Tropical and Public Health Institute (Lao TPHI), located in the capital Vientiane and the Public Health Laboratory-Ivo deCarneri (PHL-IdC) in Chake Chake, Pemba. 2.3 Reviewing process and ethical approvals Essential study documents (i.e. protocol, case report form (CRF), informedconsent form (ICF)) for each country were developed in collaboration withthe local Co-PIs and first reviewed by the health research desk of Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute. Ethical approval was sought in each study country and in Switzerland. In C ^ote d'Ivoire and Lao PDR, essential4 Ladina Keller et al.ARTICLE IN PRESS 146clinical trial documents (e.g. ICF) needed to be submitted in both English and the respective national languages (i.e. French and Lao, respectively). Moreover, in C ^ote d'Ivoire all clinical trials have to be approved by a drug regulatory authority, the Direction de la Pharmacie, du M /C19edicament et des Laboratoires (DPML, meanwhile Ivoirienne de R /C19egulation Pharmaceutique (AIRP)). The ethical approval period of each study country was one year and needed prolongation to account forthe long follow-up period of this trial. 2.4 Study area and population 2.4.1 Pemba Island, TanzaniaPemba Island, part of the Zanzibar Archipelago, is located in Tanzania in East Africa. As Pemba Island is still highly endemic for STH infections, study communities were selected based on prevalence and accessibility ( Palmeirim et al., 2018). The trial was conducted in the Shehia (lowest administrative unit) of Pujini and Dodo, Chake Chake district, South Pemba ( Fig. 1 A). The study area was located 10km away from the trial field coordination office and the laboratory at the PHL-IdC. School-based MDA in2001 and successfully stopped in 2015. The STH control programmein Pemba foresees that inhabitants receive MDA two times a year (in schools during spring, in communities during fall) since 1994. Due to the compar- atively high STH prevalence in Pemba, participant recruitment was donewithout any pre-selection, except of the appointed villages by the twoShehas (community leader). Oral permission to perform the survey in the village was obtained by the two Shehas , before the formal community infor- mation session and before any households were visited. 2.4.2 C ^ote d 'Ivoire T. trichiura infection has been found to be very focally distributed in C ^ote d'Ivoire and STH infections, in general, have decreased substantially over the past decade mostly attributed to ongoing MDA since 2012, which hasrecently been integrated into a national neglected tropical diseases targeted through preventive chemotherapy control programme ( Yapi et al., 2016 ). MDA a t school level is usually done with benzimidazoles (i.e. albendazole or mebendazole) against STH infec albendazole co-administered with iv ermectin against LF. High infection rates for T. trichiura were expected to be found in the Dabou and Jacqueville districts, Lagunes region, southern C ^ote d'Ivoire as identified5 Clinical trial conduct: Anticipation PRESS 147from previous epidemiological surveys ( Karagiannis-Voules et al., 2015 ; Yapi et al., 2016 )(Fig. 1 B). In view of high focality of T. trichiura distri- bution in this setting, a pre-screening among a subsample of 40 -60 school- aged children of each locality not exceeding a total population of 2400 people in each of the two districts was conducted to identify eligible study communities. The field laboratory for processing of all biological samples(i.e. stool and blood) was at the Methodist hospital in Dabou. The trialareas were up to 90km away from the field laboratory and, in some instances, involved crossing small bodies of water. 2.4.3 Lao PDR Since 2006, the national programme for STH control in Lao PDR foreseesbi-annual MDA with mebendazole in school- and preschool-aged children Fig. 1 Map of each trial setting, showing all (pre-) screening areas with at least 100 eggs per gram of stool (EPG) (red pie chart sectors).6 Ladina Keller et al.ARTICLE IN PRESS 148in the months of March and October. Considering earlier studies that have shown higher STH infection rates in the northern part of Lao PDR (Laymanivong et al., 2014 ) and earlier collaboration with local health insti- tutions of the area, the Nam Bak district in Luang Prabang Province was selected as study site ( Fig. 1 C). All of the included villages were within a range of approx. 30km around the field laboratory base at Nam Bak district hospital; however, four of the most northern villages were only accessibleduring dry weather periods due to poor road conditions. The epidemiolog-ical dynamics for each STH species in the area was not known prior to trialimplementation. Therefore, we applied a parallel pre-screening and screen- ing approach, where screening would immediately commence if a village met a minimal infection rate of 10% for T. trichiura . 2.5 Community information and mobilisation Before trial initiation, district health authorities and local village authoritieswere informed about the aims of the trial and approval was sought to work inthe respective health system institutions and communities. Inhabitants of the villages were invited to attend information sessions held in a central place of each community (e.g. community centre, school, health dispensary) toexplain risks and benefits of the study and to reply to questions and concernsof the local population. Local staff, i.e. community health workers (CHWs)in C ^ote d'Ivoire, community authority members in Lao PDR and field workers from PHL-IdC closely related to the local population in Pemba,assisted in identification of household members for the census andmobilisation of the study population with regard to stool sample collectionas well as attendance of clinical exam and treatment days. Written informed consent was collected from all participants ( /C2121 years in C^ote d'Ivoire, /C2118 years in Lao PDR and Pemba Island) or guardians for children and adolescents ( <21 years in C ^ote d'Ivoire and <18 in Lao PDR/ Pemba Island respectively) before enrolment. Children gave either verbal (Lao PDR and Pemba Island) or written assent (C ^ote d'Ivoire). A unique study identification number was issued and a duplicate consent form was given to the participants. The concept of providing financial compensation for participation is controversial and a challenging balancing act. A major concern is that this practice could hinder future research with less funding possibilities (Mbuagbaw et al., 2011 ). Indeed, one planned trial country had to be exclud ed from the current project due to unaffordable expected partici- pant compensations most likely related to prior conduct of RCTs by7 Clinical trial conduct: Anticipation and preparednessARTICLE IN PRESS 149industrial entities providing high monetary compensation in the respec- tive country. We provided an altern ative form of incentive by offering food on treatment days and small gifts (pencils, pens, school kits, soap or oil) after the 24 hour adverse events (AEs) capturing. These gifts weremainly sponsored by Swiss companies or paid through project funds. Alltrial participants could further profit from a clinical examination and all people screened (even if not included in the trial) found positive for any helminth infection received anthelminthic treatment free of charge. 2.6 Data collection Census data, enrolment data, parasitological data and rapid test data wereentered manually in EpiInfo 3.5.4 or Microsoft Excel 2016 during screening by two members of the trial team. All paper-based data was scanned and sent to Switzerland where data of the two entries was matched and cross-checkedby a PhD student after every time point (baseline, 14/C0 21 days, 6 months, 12 months). The only exception being the household questionnaire admin- istered in C ^ote d'Ivoire and Lao PDR, which was conducted in Open Data Kit (ODK) on tablets and subsequently transferred and saved on a server while connected to the internet. All original data was scanned and thenstored safely in the collaborating Institute. 3. Results and discussion 3.1 Planning Intense planning is particularly crucial in resource-limited settings and responsibilities should be shared between collaborators from the beginningof protocol development to identify available resources and team strengths aswell as to anticipate potential risks. The trial management team developed all forms, logs, master files, the handling of the intervention product, the staff training, database develop-ment and the schedule. Developing and validating essential study documentsacross all study sites to harmonize procedures are of major importance as noted in Becker et al. (2016) . Ethical andregulatory approval are mandatory for trial initiation and are thus critical components of trial project plans and schedules. We have faced several issues leading to delay in trial implementation. The ethical board of Lao PDR had to shift their meetings for several months due to nationwide flooding in 2018. In C ^ote d'Ivoire, initial ethical approval was quickly8 Ladina Keller et al.ARTICLE IN PRESS 150obtained, while regulatory approval was delayed for a year due to requested major protocol revisions requiring resubmission of all trial documents again to both institutions. While ethical and regulatory approval delays are not uncommon during the planning phase of clinical trials, delays during trial implementation can beavoided with proper planning and should not be overlooked. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, only remote supervision and limited field activities were possible for the 12 months follow-up in Lao PDR. We recommend arisk mitigation plan that includes uncontrollable risks such as accidents, nat-ural disasters, insecurity, political unrest or pandemics as well as those that are controllable to identify the essential tasks for trial success. Data collection tools, especially electronic ones, should be considered at an early planning stage to allow for timely preparation of files and devices needed for implementation. In Lao PDR, limited preparation time led to failure in setting up a tablet-based collection system. This led to delays in data access due to limited availability of staff and computers for manual dataentry. Electronic data collection in resource-limited settings must meet alltrial regulatory guidelines and should be low cost, operational with poor internet connection and have an easily understandable interface allowing for language adaptation. Finally, we strongly advise to consider the local lan-guages and dialects during the planning phase and to employ trial staff able tocommunicate with community members. 3.2 Human resources and trial staff training Finding qualified research personnel, who are knowledgeable and familiarwith stool and/or blood sampling and diagnosis as well as clinical trial management, was a challenge within the limited recruitment pool. Most members of the team in each country had a primary role and set of respon-sibilities, but usually had at least a secondary or tertiary role as well throughthe different phases of the trial; therefore, refresher trainings to harmonize procedures with an emphasis on flexibility and cross-training proved to be of high importance. Additionally, it remained an ambitious goal to fullycomply with GCP and Good Clinical Laboratory Practice (GLP) which wasalso reported by Becker et al. (2016) , suggesting the implementation of a quality assurance system consisting of internal and external quality control activities across all settings ( Becker et al., 2016). New members needed to be trained and incorporated into the scheme, which was an internal chal- lenge. Staff were often hired temporarily and could be potentially hired9 Clinical trial conduct: Anticipation and preparednessARTICLE IN PRESS 151for another overlapping project. In C ^ote d'Ivoire, institutional guidelines limit contracted employment to one month adding additional administrative work for re-contracting the same team staff and more opportunities forturnover leading to a lengthened trial schedule. 3.3 Communication, community sensitisation and consenting Information sessions were organised with the help of community leaders andthus critical to the compliance of study participants. Information and dissem-ination sessions, the latter targeting village heads and district authorities, were held at several time points prior to essential trial phases, such as clinical exam and treatment days, to keep participation motivation high and to con-front misinformation about the trial conduct and sample processing. Theimportance of a proactive mobilisation approach for successful recruitment has already been emphasised ( N'Goran et al., 2019 ). Yet, in Lao PDR infor- mation sessions addressed to the whole population prior to screening was not an option and communication followed a hierarchical approach via the village heads. Consequently, we faced the biggest issues in terms of mobilisation in Lao PDR; during the screening phase as well as during sub- sequent clinical examination, treatment and follow-up assessments. In thissetting, exchange between the trial management team and the study pop-ulation was complicated as most members of the community were unableto speak with any member of the trial staff due to differing dialects. In turn, few members of the trial staff spoke English which hampered communica- tion with the trial management team. To mitigate the language barriers,bilingual documentation in English and Lao were developed and local staffwere employed for information sessions and community mobilisation. Trial participants in all settings were not familiar with the concepts of clinical research making it challenging for participants to fully understandthe purpose of the clinical trial before signing the ICF. The option of feed-back (i.e. dispersion of medical results) to the population should be foreseen in the protocol and ICF and thus be communicated to the study population before enrolment. Meeting GCP conditions for impartial witnesses for illiterates and guaranteeing voluntary participation of children remained challenging. N'Goran et al. (2019) indicated similar challenges consenting potential par- ticipants; especially obtaining consent and assent in paediatric participants and finding an independent witness to co-sign the ICF in rural communities have shown to be difficult and hamper the quality and success of the consent10 Ladina Keller et al.ARTICLE IN PRESS 152process al., 2019 ). In C ^ote d'Ivoire, the relatively high age of legal majority (21years) sometimes did not reflect the population's concept of majority and the perceived ability of young adults to consent indepen- dently. However, in mid-2019 the country adapted and decreased the legalage of majority to 18 years ( Ouattara, 2019). 3.4 Participant recruitment adapted to each setting Successful and timely recruitment of the intended number of eligible studyparticipants has been reported to be the most common challenge in RCTs (Kasenda et al., 2014) affected by numerous factors, such as insufficient engagement with the community, the complexity of consent procedures (Adams et al., 2015; Bell-Syer et al., 2011 ) and the local endemicity. For infectious diseases, the type of recruitment depends on the target path- ogen or parasite. Non-hospital but community-based screening, as in our case, in an area with a sufficiently large number of potential participants iscrucial for timely fulfilment of recruitment criteria. Recruitment strategydepends on both the prevalence of the disease and the complexity of the eligibility requirements of the clinical trial. For this trial, eligibility criteria were more inclusive with regard to age range (outside of school-aged chil-dren), yet more strict in terms of minimal infection intensities (i.e. 100EPGs of T. trichiura ). The 100 EPG cut-off was chosen to avoid including participants with very light infections as they are more likely to yield false- negative test results in particular by microscopy. The effect of the minimal EPG criterion on recruitment is depicted in Fig. 2. Successful recruitment ofstudy p articipants showed substantial heterogeneity across countries, which concurs well with a multi-country study by Becker et al. (2016). Recruitment was completed within six, 12 and 19 weeks on Pemba Island, Lao PDR and C ^ote d'Ivoire respectively. The recruitment proce- dure in C ^ote d'Ivoire was stopped after 19 weeks having identified 567 individuals based on infection and age recruitment criteria. Moreover, slow pace of inclusion of eligible participants cause considerably higher costs including the need for trial extensions which has also been mentioned inar e v i e wb y Watson and Torgerson (2006). Weconducted three different screening approaches in the three settings, which best matched local prevalence rates and study site accessibility. Screening and treatment should be timed to avoid yearly school exam periods and rainy seasons in each setting. All three approaches and investedsampling efforts are further summarized in Table 1 .11 Clinical trial conduct: Anticipation and preparednessARTICLE IN PRESS 153Fig. 2 Cumulative recruitment rates by country.

Empty houses or households with missing family members werefollowed up for one week to collect complete datasets within one participant(two faecal samples) or within one household (including adult male partic- ipants, which were more often absent during sampling hours). Compliance was generally high, with an exception of some remote villages with generalreluctance towards modern medicine including diagnosis and treatment ofhealth conditions for which local beliefs and practices existed. Some of the villages were already familiar with research having had previous collabora- tions with the PHL-IdC laboratory, which was an advantage for the success-ful mobilisation of the communities. The trial management team made thedecision to offer further information sessions with people who missed the previous sessions. Using this approach, all 683 eligible participants were enroled within 40 days. 3.4.2 C ^ote d 'Ivoire (low T. trichiura endemicity with sporadic hotspots) As stated before, due to the expected low prevalence, a pre-screening was conducted, including a simplified consenting (for pre-screening activities only) in two districts prior to enrolment. Separation of consenting into pre-screening (facilitated consent only involving single stool sample analysis)and actual trial participation was indispensable in view of the sheer amountof places to visit and subjects to pre-screen. Data was collected from 42 vil-lages in the Jacqueville health district and 39 villages of the Dabou health district for pre-screening ( Fig. 1 B). In order to save time, pre-screening should be done geographically from the most remote villages to the closest ones. After pre-screening efforts were completed, a census was conducted in 21 villages. Out of these 21 villages, 15 villages had a minimum preva- lence of /C2410% 100 EPG T.trichiura infections, 13 of which were included in the trial. Estimates of prevalence tended to be 5 -10% higher during pre- screening than observed during baseline screening most likely due to aver- age age of pre-screened individuals being lower than the trial population. About 20 -40% of individuals in the census refused to donate samples. Furthermore, the numbers of effectively included cases were 50 -70% lower than predicted estimates of eligible cases largely due to a lack of mobilisation. As screening progressed, it became apparent that the less engaged a CHW would be in the project, the more likely community members were to refuse participation in the trial.15 Clinical trial conduct: Anticipation and preparednessARTICLE IN PRESS 157Recruitment in specific villages was hindered by unexpected events such as an ambush of a trial vehicle on route back to the field laboratory, political conflicts within villages leading to temporarily blocked access, or intentionalomission of screening activities in whole neighbourhoods by CHWs. Thefield team reacted accordingly to guarantee security of the team by adaptingtravel times/routes and regularly communicating with local community representatives. 3.4.3 Lao PDR (focal T. trichiura endemicity) In Lao PDR the prevalence for T. trichiura was low and its precise geographic distribution unknown; therefore, it was decided to conduct a pre-screening step before including the villages in the trial. Consenting and census regis- tration was done with approximately 50- 100 people per village who were then asked to provide a first stool sample. The number of detected T. trichiura positive pre-screening samples was used as an estimate for the actual overall prevalence. The pre-screened village was included if approximately 10% or more of sampled inhabitants had a T. trichiura egg count of at least 100 EPG. In the case of village inclusion, second stool samples were collected from the people who had already provided a sample at pre-screening. Furthermore, consenting and census registration were expanded to the remaining commu-nity members and two stool samples requested. This procedure was done in parallel to ongoing recruitment and screening of individuals from villages already qualifying for inclusion. Compliance was, depending on the village, relatively low and collecting samples was time-intensive. Possible reasons for this could be that there was no information session held at the beginning of screening and most villages were very remote and not easily accessible due to poor road conditions.Furthermore, most community members were farm-workers who left forthe forest or the fields very early in the morning and only returned late in the afternoon, making consenting, census recording and especially sample collection almost impossible. As a strategy to increase the number of samplescollected, samples were aggregated in large deposit bags available to commu-nity members in convenient places and then collected by a community rep- resentative to either be dropped off to or picked up by a team member. This lack of direct access to community members, coupled with previouslydescribed language barriers, made responding to poor compliance exceed-ingly challenging and time-intensive.16 Ladina Keller et al.ARTICLE IN PRESS 1583.5 Biological sample collection Proper labelling and listing procedures for processing was of great importance and begins with the distribution of stool collection containers. From the beginning of sample collection, clear labelling, coloured stickers, and markedcontainers can prevent mix-ups and low sample volumes by ensuring thatparticipants understand the sample collection process. We advise recording unique patient identification numbers for samples once in the field upon col- lection and again upon the sample's arrival in the laboratory to minimize anymistakes during the subsequent stool analysis. Sample storage and transport needs to be part of the logistic and financial planning of the trial, as we learned when frozen stool samples needed to be stored and transported to Switzerland. Reluctance to provide stool due to existing taboos or shame in the study population, can present a problem(Akpabio and Takara, 2014). For discretion, opaque paper or plastic bags and non-transparent stool containers were used to ensure participant comfort. Blood collection raised concerns in both Ivorian and Lao communities, and needed enhanced sensitisation to limit participant attrition. In C ^ote d'Ivoire, where the analysis of blood parameters prior to treatment is a required safety measure put forth by the DPML, we had anticipated potential fears of the population from earlier experiences and other RCTs conductedin the country ( N'Goran et al., 2019 ). Nevertheless, we faced issues such as theoc currence of rumours about the usage of blood samples for other than scientific reasons and health problems causing inability to work for a pro-longed time after blood collection. This led to some participants staying awayfrom clinical examination days or follow-up assessments. The rumours werethoroughly examined and addressed in collaboration with local healthworkers and authorities. Providing interim results on analysed blood param- eters in C ^ote d'Ivoire and Lao PDR to trial participants who gave venous blood proved to be acknowledged by the study population and may partially enhance motivation to provide samples and remain in the trial. Furthermore,providing feedback on medical results to the trial participants may decrease misinformation about sample processing and use as faced in both countries. 3.6 Treatment procedure Overall, treatment procedures should be tailored to each setting. Invitation of trial participants for enrolment can be done using a written invitation/card17 Clinical trial conduct: Anticipation and preparednessARTICLE IN PRESS 159(Pemba/C ^ote d'Ivoire) or verbally with the help of a community leader (Lao PDR). Clinical examination and treatment day schedules can also vary. A straightforward approach (having been successful in previous trials)was done on Pemba, where clinical examination and treatment was done onthe same day. In contrast, clinical examination and treatment days were sep-arate in C ^ote d'Ivoire and Lao PDR. The major drivers of choice in treat- ment schedule are the composition of tests to be completed and analysedbefore treatment day and the proximity of villages to each other and tothe field laboratory. Treatment procedures must also meet the requirements of participants. A central location with suitable, covered spaces and ample seating should bechosen and transportation assistance offered to those living in the mostremote areas. A small snack and materials for entertainment during waitingperiods should be offered to participants to enhance compliance. Cultural sensitivity should be respected during all treatment procedures; for example, subscapular skinfold thickness during our trial was measured only by womensince clothing had to be partially removed. Furthermore, individuals whoare excluded (e.g. pregnant women) should not only be given and/or referred to appropriate care, but have their exclusion discussed with discre- tion with qualified physicians. To prevent mix-ups and mistakes, similar to laboratory procedures, extensive training of personnel and proper labelling and listing should beused. A system of checks and balances (either built into the CRF or through personnel) can help reduce mistakes during the most critical part of any clin- ical trial: treatment administration. A successful treatment procedure is not only the critical moment in the trial schedule for outcomes, but can also have lasting effects on subsequent follow-up time points, as this is the f irst prolonged shared experience between the trial team and participants. 4. Conclusion and recommendations After more than three years of planning and implementing a RCT that involved more than 150 team members (not counting all local helpers from the communities) from four countries, we have constructed the most usefulstrategies to mitigate identified risks ( Table 2 ). Case recruitment is key for trial success and the main cost driver. Involvement and training of local assistance directly in the communities is18 Ladina Keller et al.ARTICLE IN PRESS 160Table 2 Major risks faced, strategies put forth and lessons learned during the conduct of the multi-country ivermectin-albendazole co-administration phase III trial.

A major challenge was the communication between the various players involved, which is in line with the findings of Allotey et al. (2010). Roles and respon- sibilities of every trial member may differ between each country, due to the existing systems that are in place locally (e.g. polyvalent students in Lao PDRvs highly specialised field technicians in C ^ote d'Ivoire) should be defined prior to trial initiation. GCP guidelines provide an essential standard for data quality and protec- tion of participants within RCTs. Conformity of GCP with real world con-ditions in developing countries is demanding, yet investment in capacity building of collaborating teams and institutions together with repeated train- ing and insisting on most important principles (e.g. consenting) pays off.GCP guidelines are under constant improvement; however, we call formore flexible interpretation and adaption to low resource environments for practical guidance in the conduct of clinical research in these settings.

Vectors 9, 162.24 Ladina Keller et al.ARTICLE IN PRESS 166Chapter 10 General discussion 10.1 Rationale and objectives More than half of the world's population lives in areas endemic for soil -transmitted helminths (STHs) and 447, 289 and 229 million individuals with A. lumbricoides , T. trichiura and hookworm , respectively, in 2017 Preventive chemotherapy dose benzimidazoles (i.e., albendazole and meben dazole ) is the cornerstone of STH control put forth by the World Health Organization (WHO) to reduce the burden associated with moderate and heavy STH infections [2]. However, t he success of PC is hampered by (i) the low efficacy profile, particularly against T. trichiura , (ii) rapid reinfection s post-treatment , (iii) the difficulty delivering PC to all individuals at-risk of infection (pre-school aged children (pre-SAC) and women of reproductive age (WRA) ) and (iv) pote ntial anthelmintic resistance (AR) that all together hinder sustainable STH control towards elimination . Therefore, discovery and development of improved treatment options (e.g., drug combinations) against s oil-trans mitted helminthiasis is of pivotal importance to further tackle the vicious cycle of recurring and long - lasting STH infections, poverty and low quality of life . The core of this PhD project consists of two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the efficacy (in terms of cure rates (CRs) and egg reduction rate s (ERRs) ) and safety of the drugs moxidectin and ivermectin in combination with albendazole. Both trials were conducted on Pemba Island , the smaller of the two major I slands of Zanz ibar, belonging to the United Republic of Tanzania . Although all three major STHs are still hig hly prevalent on Pemba Island, we placed particular emphasis on T. trichiura infections, as none of the currently used anthelmintic drugs show s sufficient effica cy against th is helminth species [3]. Moxidectin is an anthelmi ntic drug widely used in companion and production animals that was recently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for human use against onchocerciasis. Hence, t he first objective of this PhD project was to investigate potential trichuricidal activity using ascending doses of moxidectin alone and in combination with albendazole in adolescents (chapter 3) . 167Another broad -spectrum antiparasitic drug used in veterinary medicine is ivermectin, which was r ecently included in the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines for treating intestinal helminths [4]. Howev er, when combined with albendazole, findings report ed inconsistent efficacy results that are based on a limited number of studies [5]. Therefore , the second objective of this PhD was to evaluate the short and long-term outcomes 14-21 days, six and 12 months post -treatment of ivermectin -albendazole versus albendazole alone against T. trichiura infections in children and adults in three endemic countries (chapter 4-6). Sensitive, reliable and field -applicable diagnostic methods have become indispensable for successful STH control. The duplicate Kato-Katz technique was developed more than half a decade ago and remains the sole technique recommended by WHO for the detection of STH eggs in fecal samples [6]. However, this method is limited by its low se nsitivity for light STH infections [7-9], making it less valuable in efficacy studies or in low transmission settings when control efforts move towards elimination. Promising molecular diagnostic tools hav e been developed for diagnosis in helminthology within the past years . The third objective included the comparison of the performance of the Kato -Katz technique versus the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) method . We assess ed the impact of the diagnostic technique on treatment efficacy and day -to-day variation by analy zing two stool samp les before and after treatm ent (chapter 7). Even though the present goal of global control programs recommended by WHO is to reduce worm burden associated morbidity with PC in at-risk populations [2], point -of care -tools to directly quantify the burden of disease , in particular aft er anthelmintic treatment, have not been focused on so far . Therefore , the fourth objective was to test Fecal Calprotectin (FC) and Fecal Occult Blood (FOB) as potential surrogate markers for STH attributable morbidity as a tool to monitor the impact of community -level deworming (chapter 8). Finally, as there is limited scientific literature on trial methodology, trial procedures and mitigation strategies on clinical re search taking place in resource -constrained healthcare environments, the fifth objective was to report on the lessons learned and to propose 168strategies to overcome challenges we faced during the multi -country study on ivermectin - albendazole (chapter 9). In this last section of the thesis, I aim to address specific issues and future research needs I have not discu ssed in detail before and to place them in a broader context to advance helminth control and elimination. 10.2 Future large -scale deworming in a broader context Preventive chemotherapy has been the core intervention for reducing morbidity and transmission of STH infections since the World Health Assembly (WHA) pass ed the landmark WHA 54.19 resolution 20 years ago [10]. Likewise, within the past decade , an increase of PC implementation, mainly due to extensive political and financial support , has occurred [11]. The primary goal of this control approach is to reduce morbidity by decreasing infection intensities and to ultimately eliminate STH infections as a public health problem . This is defined as the decrease of prevalence of moderate and heavy infection intensities to below 2% as assessed in pre-SAC and school -aged children (SAC) by 2030 [2]. In theory, the aim is to lower the worm burden to a level below the threshold, under which sexual reproduction becomes limited [12]. This is based on the fact that a female worm needs to be fertilized by a male partner in order to produce viable infective stages [13]. Ecological analyses of STH elimination strategies expect a transmission breakpoint at very low prevalence, below which transmission will stagnate and human cases will go down to zero [14]. However, the success of morbidity control using large -scale deworming depends on several factors such as (i) drug efficacy, (ii) the proportion of contaminated environment (i.e., soil) including the lifespan of infectious stages in the environment, (iii) the rate of introduc ing new infective stages into a transmission milieu , (iv) coverage and compliance (proportion of total population ingesting the medicines) and (v) the quality and quantity of sanitation facilities [15]. Thus , improvement s of all the aforementioned factors are needed to further advance STH control towards elimination . The results of this PhD thesis may have considerable impact on future PC recommendations; therefore, I am eager to look ahead and to discuss potential considerations for successful 169continuation of mass drug administration ( MDA ) campaigns based on results obtained during this PhD projec t. 10.2.1 Next steps for moxidectin and ivermectin Mathematical modelling by Turner et al. projected the elimination of T. trichiura to be infeasible in many endemic areas when using the curre nt standalone treatments . The low efficacy of albendazole and mebendazole against T. trichiura generally limits the success of STH elimination programs, as residual T. trichiura infection may remain after A. lumbricoides and hookworm has been eliminated. Therefore, if the goal is t o shift from morbidity control to transmission interruption , improved treatment options, particularly against T. trichiura infections, are urgently needed [16]. In 2018, the FDA appro ved an 8 mg monodose of moxidectin for the human use against onchocerciasis in individuals aged 12 years and older . To date, moxidectin has been proven effective and safe in at least ten clinical studies in patients suffering from onchocerciasis [17]. At the dose recommended for onchocerciasis, o ther trials found mo xidectin to be efficacious and s afe against strongyloidiasis [18] and when combined with albendaz ole, to be efficacious against T. trichiura [19]. Hence, the first objective of this P hD project was to implement a regulatory compliant Phase II study to identify optimum dosage of moxidectin alone and in combination with albendazole against T. trichiura and concomitant STH infections, to add to the small body of evidence of moxidectin as an alternative anthelmintic drug . The combination of 8 mg moxidectin (the smallest dose tested) with 400 mg albendazole showed promising efficacy against T. trichiura (CR = 62.5%, ERR = 97.4%), paving the way for future studies. Below, I have identified seven steps that I believe need to take place to ultimately render moxidectin -albendazole as an attractive treatment alternative for future large -scale deworming. First, the use of moxidectin is currently only approved in individuals aged 12 years and above. Thus, there is no evidence on the safety and efficacy of moxidectin in pre-SAC and SAC , as well as pregnant or lactating women. As all these groups belong to the at -risk population , pediatric pharmacokinetic s, dose -finding and safety studies are needed to expand labelling of 170moxidectin . Recent model -based pharmacokinetic simulations of ivermectin in children showed that the pediatric dose should be increased to achieve the same equivalent exposure coverage as in adults [20]. This could also be the case for moxidectin and, therefore, similar simulations should be implemented to estimate the pharmacokinetic properties of moxidectin in children . Moreover, given the long half -life of moxidectin, w omen that could become pregnant might be at high risk of exposure after treatment. Therefore, adverse events associated with moxidectin exposure in pregnancy need to be carefully monitored and if possible, reported in a global pharmacovigilance system. To generally collect more safety data of moxidectin -albendazole , results from all upcoming studies could be pooled to estimate if moxidectin -albendazole cause more adverse events compared to monotherapies with benzimidazoles or the ivermectin -albendazole comb ination therapy. Second , the use of moxidectin against STH infections has only been tested on Pemba Island, Tanzania, so far. Therefore, studies on moxidectin against STHs should be implemented in distinct epidemiological contexts in order to test i ts efficacy in settings with potentially different worm strains than those that exist on Pemba Island . Third, it is known that moxidecti n exhibits a long half-life (20-35 days [21]) but, to date, no study has followed up long-term post-treatment prevalence and infect ion intensities . Such efficacy studies, both short - and long-term, are currently implemented in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and should be conducted or at least be complimented by a more sensitive diagnostic tool than Kato -Katz. Our findings from the ivermectin - albendazole t rial indicated significantly lower CRs for ivermectin -albendazole, when two fecal samples were assessed by qPCR post-treatment instead of Kato -Katz. This is likely to be the same for moxidectin . Hence, the most sensitive diagnostic methods at hand should be employed when assessing true efficacy of moxidectin -albendazole . Fourth , due to moxidectin's long half -life, there might be a longer lasting treatment effect that may positively impact transmissi on inten sity. Therefore, optimal f requency of regular or repeated moxidectin treatment should be evaluated in relation to the transmission profile in distinct epidemiological settings . This might require regulatory compliant Phase IIIb studies comparing the efficacy of annual versus biannual moxidectin treatment or even include a treatment arm with a repeated 171dose of moxidectin. Fifth, given moxidectin's microfilaricidal effect , it is likely t o induce serious adverse events in individu als with high microfilarial densities of Loa l oa, to a oa microfilarial density -escalating safety study is neede d. Sixth, cost effectiveness studies that evaluate the potential added benefit of moxidectin in large -scale deworming campaigns including the cost -effectiveness of annual and biannual trea tment must be determined. Seventh , potential drug donors and preferably local anthelmint ic drug production facilities manufacturing single 8 mg moxidectin tablets should be identified. If all upcoming studies consistently demonstrate a promising performance of moxidectin - albendazole , an expansion of the indication should follow . This would include drug authority approval (e.g., FDA, EMA ), the addition to the WHO Model List of Essential Medicine s and its registration i n STH endemic countries . Should moxidectin be registered and donated, it should be distributed progressively and data should be reported within a national pharmacovigilance system that effectively monitor and report the safety of moxidectin -albendazole . In 2017 , ivermectin was included in the WHO Model List of Essential Medicine s for treating intestinal helminths [4]. A recent meta -analysis on the efficacy and safety of ivermectin - albendazole combination therapy indicated higher efficacy against T. trichiura than either drug separately. However, the effect of this combination requires further testing in different epidem iological contexts [5]. In the multi -country study conducted as part of this PhD project , ivermectin -albendazole revealed superiority in terms of CRs and ERR s against T. trichiura infection s in Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) and on Pemba Island , Tanzania . Likewise, long-term effects against T. trichiura based on extended CRs and ERRs of ivermectin -albendazole compared to albendazole -placebo were also significantly higher at six and at 12 months, when positive cases were re treated 6 months after initial treatment in both countries . Therefore, implementation of c ombined ivermectin -albendazole is a valuable and safe alternative treatment option , which could be key to overcome the drawback s of the standard medications. However, five challenges need to be addressed before and partially during the ivermectin -albendazole implementation in large -scale deworming programs . 172First, ivermectin is not recommended to be administered to chil dren under 15 kg in weight or 90 cm in height meaning pre-SAC are mostly ineligible for treatment with ivermectin. Likewise, pregnant or breastfeeding (in the first week after delivery ) women are excluded from ivermectin treatment [4]. Therefore, n ew evidence on field -applicable solutions for safely dosing ivermectin to different populations are needed. Second, the optimal frequency of regular single dose treatment (annual versus bi-annual) or the repeated administration of ivermectin - albendazole treatment needs to be evaluated in relation to the transmission profile in distinct epidemiological settings. Based on our long -term results, bi -annual treatment might be necessary to sustainably decrease transmission of STH infections, partic ularly in highly endemic settings. Third, individuals with concurrent high levels of Loa loa microfilar emia (>30'000 microfilariae/mL blood) are at risk of severe adverse events from ivermectin that may lead to permanent disability or death within a short period of time [22]. Therefore, potential settings for large -scale deworming need to b e carefully evaluated to minimiz e the risk of adverse events due to heavy loiasis co -infection . Fourth , careful decisions on the costs (several MDA rounds a year), adapted to the epidemiological parasite profile in each setting, have to be made when planning and impleme nting future control strategies. Fifth, n ew manufacturers will need to be won to produce low cost ivermectin to meet the demand s for STH control prog rams. A study by Turner et al. calculated that ivermectin -albendazole co - administration is likely to shorten the timeframe of PC required for STH elimination, which could potentially lead to lower overall campaign expenses [16]. In addition, a recent Phase I clinical trial reported a fixed dose of ivermectin and albendazole co -formulation to be as safe as the standard dosage [23]. This merits further investigation, as the use of a single tablet is likely to simplify MDA processes and to reduce procurement costs remarkably. Further, upcoming guidelines by WHO on the use of ivermectin -albendazol e against STH infections should, prior to implementation, consider each countries' NTD landscape to elaborate potential collateral benefits from using ivermectin -albendazole. Because NTDs often share epidemiological characteristics, affect overlapping population groups and are treated by the same medication s, regions affected by or a broader application of combined ivermectin -albendazole [18, 24 -27]. Likewise, recent eviden ce suggests that the endectocidic effect of ivermectin increase s the mortality of Anopheles sp. mosquitoes that feed on people treated with a single oral dose , however, substantially higher doses of ivermectin are required to achieve this effect [28-30]. The integration of several disease s in one program may benefit from joint disease mapping and potentially yield a more efficient allocation of resources in order to effectively progress towards disease elimination as a public health problem [31]. Nevertheless , since ivermectin -albendazole combination therapy was not found to be superior to albendazole monotherapy in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire (CRs 14%, arithmetic mean based ERRs 22%) , adequate monitoring is needed to evaluate potential variation in treatment responses by geographical setting. In conclusion, both drug combination s show a promising efficac y against all three major STH species, a good safety pro file and are easy to administer. Therefore, they bear great potential for future use in large -scale deworming campaigns . A Phase III trial is currently ongoing on Pemba Island to directly compare the efficacy and safety of these two macrocyclic lactones in combination with albendazole . Regardless of this outcome, to delay potential resistance development to these substances, an alternating approach administering the se two drug combinations will possibly be advantageous. 10.2. 2 Alternative d rug candidat es in the pipeline The scarce efforts in drug discovery and subsequent drug development of human anthelmintics within the last decades reflect the limited economic interest in commercial investments. A n attractive and cost -effective fast track alternative to a target -based approach, which require extensive screening of different compounds , is the repurposing of available drugs, similar to the discovery of moxidectin and ivermectin. A viable alternative to the currently used drugs is oxantel pamoate, which is a pyrimidine derivative with trichuricidal activity ubiquitously used in veterinary medicine. The drug 174selectively bind s to acetylcholine receptor ion channels on ne rve and muscle cells , which leads to subsequent paralysis of the nematode and, thus, belongs to the fast acting anthelmintics [32, 33] . Available studies report considerable variations of treatment efficacy against T. trichiura , with results reachi ng up to 100% (in terms of CR and ERR) [34]. However, oxantel pamoate is not efficacious against hookworm and, hence, a combination with a drug exhibiting anti-hookworm activity, such as pyrantel pamoate, would be necessary [35, 36] . Additionally, oxantel pamoat e is only approved and mar keted for human use in some South America n and Asian countries. Therefore, registration of oxantel pamoate for STH infections at a stringent regulatory authority is desirable to expand its use to other endemic countries . Tribendimidine, another drug alternative, was the only drug that received approval for STH infection for human use in the past 30 years. H owever, it has so far only been ap proved in China in 2004 [37]. It is a nicotinic acetylcholine r eceptor agonist and its mechanism of action is similar to that of pyrantel, oxantel and levamisole [38]. Tribendimidine is considered a safe anthelmintic drug with activity against A. lumbricoides , hookworm and several liver l ow trichuricidal [39, 42] and, thus, a combination therapy (e.g., tribendimidine plus ivermectin ) should be considered when tackling infections from all three STHs [36]. Moreover, d ue to its similar efficacy profile to albendazole, tribendimidine might be a good alternative treatment in long -term preven tive chemotherapy - based settings to reduce drug pressure and potential emerge nce of benzimidazole resistance [36]. Particular interest is on emodepside, a semi -synthetic compound and a derivative of the fermentation product obtained from the fungus Mycelia sterilia . Emodepside belongs to the group of cyclooctadepsipeptides , a new class of anthelmintics that has not been used before , which is effective against isolates that are resistant to benzimidazoles, levamisole and ivermectin [43]. Emodepside demonstrated promising results in vitro against larval and adult stages of Trichuris muris , N. americanus confirmed in vivo [44]. Efficacy (in combination with praziquantel) was shown against a wide range of nematodes in rodents [45], canine wh horses The f irst in man clinical trial of emodepside testing safety, tolerability, and pharmacokin etics was successfully completed in 2017. Another Phase I study testing ascending single doses and a repeat dose regimen, including the comparison of different drug formulations was completed . Regulatory compliant Phase II clinical trials on the most efficacious and safe dose of emodepside against STH are currently under investigation to strengthen its potential as a human anthelmintic. 10.2.3 The reinfection dilemma Together with the lack of effective protective immunity and the absence of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) improvements, reinfection occurs rapidly after treatment. A meta -analysis by Jia et al. found that reinfections occur quickly after treatment, i n particular for A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura . Six month s post -treatment, the prevalence reached or exceeded half of the initial prevalence for all three STHs, w ith the prevalence of A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura return ing close to initial pre -treatment levels 12 mo nths post -treatment . Evidence suggest that the risk of new infections is highest for pre -treatment positive individuals, while the initial infection intensity is also positively correlated with the rate and intensity of reinfection [48]. This might derive from the fact that h eteroge neities in human susceptibility (i.e., genetic and immunologically mediated) and exposure to infection allow the worms to cluster in specific individuals [49]. Of note, the term reinfection might be misleading as only apparent reinfections can be measured to date. Trichuris trichiura , for instance, resides in the cecum and the ascending colon with its posterior e nd protruding into the lumen, while the head is embedded in host epithelial cells. This could mean that drugs cannot reach parasites directly and might only paralyze some parts of the female worm that might recover over time. Nonetheless, if morbidity con trol should advance to transmission control (i.e. , interrupt transmission of STH infections), several factors that may delay and ultimately avert rapid reinfection in specific individuals or areas, need to be considered. 176The systemic exclusion of parts of the population from PC programs potentially undermine morbidity reduction in the short -term a nd elimination in the long -term. Pre-school aged children and WRA have been mostly excluded from MDA so far ; however, both groups contribute to the persistence of STH transmission [50, 51] . As mentioned before, the WHO roadmap for 2030 was adapted and, therefore, a higher PC coverage of these two groups is expected [2]. Once this is put in place , heavy infections will probably decrease which, in turn, will lead to less fecal contamination and STH transmission . In addition , the tendency of some individuals to repeatedly refuse or miss MDA (also known as systematic non -compliance) possibly leads to perpetuate transmission [52]. Hence, untreated highly infected community members may provide important reservoirs that sustain reinfection within the population [53, 54] . Therefore, it might become an essential task to tackle such micro -geographical transmission hotspots by micro -targeting specific interventions [54]. Another strategy worth considering to reduce the rate of reinfections might be to plan MDA campaigns more effectively in terms of timing. Prevalence of STHs is affected by seasonal and climatic changes, particularly when these are crucial determinants of S TH transmission [55, 56]. Warm temperatures and moist weather are essential for the development of eggs and larvae in the soil. Higher humidity is associated with faster development of A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura eggs and rainfall generally supports egg and lar val development as it facilitates the scattering of eggs and helps to maintain soil moisture [57, 58] . In contrast, eg gs will rather desiccate than embryonate at low humidity and dry climatic conditions, resulting in a decline of transmission dynamics [55, 59 -61]. Long -term studies are needed to further investigate seasonal effects on STH reinfection rates in order to appropriately plan and time deworming campaigns and to maximize cost -effectiveness of large -scale deworming programs. Further, shortening the time between deworming rounds may considerable limit the reestablishment of STH species [62]. Optimal treatment intervals should be calculated depend ing on coverage level, transmission setting, age groups and STH species [12]. Even though intervals of retreatment between six a nd 12 months are the most widely applied compromise between high impact and logistic feasibility, sh orter treatment intervals might be 177necessary to sustainably decrease the worm burden that ultimately leads to less environmental contamination, and hence, lower reinfection rates [63]. Several rounds of anthelmintic treatment a year might be needed when targeting A. lumbricoides or T. trichiura infections, while a nnual treatment might be app ropriate when hookworm is the sole endemic species [64, 65]. An additional strategy to reduce fecal contamination is to consider the soil, which is the main environmental reservoir for STH eggs. Its contamination with STH eggs can considerably limit the ability of MDA campaigns and WAS H improvements to interrupt the STH transmission cycle. Particularly areas where wastewater and sludge are commonly r eused for agricultural purposes leave i ndividuals at risk for STH infections and reinfections . In contrast to other microorganisms, STHs are difficult to inactivate in soil and wastewater as eggs are surrounded by a series of layers to protect the ova against harsh environmental conditions and strong chemicals [66]. However, little is known to date about the ecological determinants of STH transmission including the amount and distribution of viable hel minth eggs in soil, raw wastewater , on hands, or in drinking water [67]. Newly developing environmental DNA systems (eDNA) that determine if a particular habitat contains a parasite or their ecological footprints , might be helpful to effectively detect STH s in specific ecotopes. Moreover, e nvironmentally acting agents target ing the egg stage of STH specie s in the soil would be desirable to decrease the level of fecal contamination . Therefore, field-applicable techniques to measure STH ova in the environment and cost-effective tools or chemica ls that inactivate STH eggs merit further development as they might become valuabl e adjunct environmental strategies to current MDA programs to help break transmission and reduce reinfections post -treatment . Due to the fact t hat STH infection are n ot a public health problem in settings with adequate hygiene and access to sound sanitation infrastructure , improvements of hygiene and sanitation standards are inevitabl y necessary to lower infection and reinfection levels [68, 69] . The 2030 roadmap by WHO include s the aim of ensuring universal access to basic sanitation and hygiene by 2030 in STH endemic areas. This aim also comprises ending open defecation, increasing access to safely managed sanita tion, safe disposal of child feces, sho e-wearing 178and hand -washing [2]. Other simple and affordable complementary interventions normally not included in WASH campaigns should be considered as well; i mproved food hygiene, flooring and nail clipping in SAC have been shown to reduce transmission risk from soil contaminated with infective STH ova [70, 71] . However, d evelopment of a vaccine or a pan -anthelmint ic vaccine against soil-transmitted helminthiasis might be the sole long-term control strategy that is not threatened by perpetuat ed reinfection risks. Nonetheless , vaccine development is hampered by the multiple lifecycle stages each presen ting specific antigens , the complex genomes and proteomes, and the lack of sophisticated immunological knowledge of the host -parasite interactions that complicate the identification of potential protective antigen candidates [72-74]. Despite increased research in STH vaccine development within the last decade, testing various potential candidates, no anti- STH vaccine currently exists [74]. Controlled human infection model s, as already successfully applied for other diseases (e.g., malaria), might not only speed up STH vaccine development, but also remarkably reduce the number of subjects required for testing [75]. In summary, reinfections occur rapidly where favorable ecological conditions converge with over-crowded living conditions, poor sanitation infrastructure, poverty and insufficient health education. Holi stic, multifactorial and transdisciplinary STH interventions are needed to sustainably reduce environmental components that facilitate transmission and thus to ultimately avert rapid r einfections. Mathematical modelling will become necessary to determine the most effective interventions and to investigate their impact on the sustainable reduction of fecal contamination. 10.2 .4 Anthelmintic resistance - does it exist ? Anthelmintic resistance is defined , according to Geary, as \u00abthe ability of parasites to survive drug doses that would normally kill parasites of the same species and stage \u00bb [76]. It generally arises due to extensive and repeated exposure of a pathogen to the selective pressure of a drug. 179In livestock, frequent and rapid resistance to all three major classes (benzimidazoles, macrocyclic lactones and imidothi azoles -tetrahydropyrimidines ) is widespread mostly due to large -scale use of the same anthelmintic drugs for decades [77]. Following that, possible development of AR in humans is of considerable interest due to upscaling of PC with albendazole and mebendazole s ince the 1990 s. Resistance in human STHs would thereby majorly limit the ability to control soil-transmitted helminthiasi s, as surviving parasites may pass on genetic variants making their offspring more resistant to the chemotherapeutic agent . Decreased drug efficacy is c onsidered the first sig n of AR development by veterinary parasitologists [78]. In fact, drug efficacy of both albendazole and mebendazole has decreased in the last two decades in human medicine [3]. On Pemba Island, several studies have assessed the efficac ies of albendazole and mebendazole within the last 30 years; however, results vary considerably between st udies and between STH species (Table 3) . This discrepancy might be due to the diffe rent diagnostic methods applied , varying drug quality, the wide age spectrum of the included population or the different time points at which post -treatment samples were col lected . Nonetheless, there seems to be a slight decrease of CRs and ERRs of both benzimidazoles against T. trichiura over time , hence, suggesting a potential emerge nce of albendazole and mebendazole -resistant T. trichiura strains on Pemba Island . Several other studies in different settings have observed reduc ed efficacies of benzimidazoles, raising suspicions of AR emergence [79-84]. 180Table 3a Cure rates (CR s) and egg reduction rates (ERR s) of albendazole from clinical trials implemented on Pemba Island , Tanzania .

The same SNPs were investigated in human STH and SNPs in each species were the Phe200Tyr SNP in -tubulin has been shown to be present at increased frequencies in T. trichiura post- treatment with albendazole in two distinct settings . However, no clear association with reduced benzimidazole efficacy was found yet [103] . The low efficacy of iverme ctin-albendazole against T. trichiura found in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire within the scope of our multi -country RCT (chapter 5) might be due to several population -based factors. Although evidence for resistant ivermectin strains in human nematodes is lacking to date , emerging AR to ivermectin needs to be considered too. Evidence from the veterinary field suggests that ivermectin pressure selects for changes in expression levels of ABC transporters, such as P -glycoproteins , GluCl or GABA receptor s and potentially also fo r - tubulin subunits [104-109]. In most animals, resistance was first detected to the avermectins (e.g., ivermectin) and subsequently to moxidectin , hence, the extent of resistance is potentially greater to ivermectin than moxidectin [99, 110] . Notwithstanding the lacking evidence sustained anthelmintic drug resistance against benzimidazoles or macrocyclic lactones developing in human populations to date , AR monitoring and surveillance has been greatly insufficient so far . The studies c onducted a re based on low sample size, do not include important confounding factors such as the quality of the drug, lack standardized AR thre sholds, protocols and diagnostic methods [77], and thus , may explain the paucity of available evidence on AR in humans. Nonetheless, early detection of resistant strains is crucial to retain efficacy of current treatment options , to observe resistance as it emerges and to plan and implement alternative treatment strategies [77]. Vercruysse et al. identified the four following factors that contribute to AR in humans : (i) treatment frequency, ( ii) refugia (proportion of the parasite that is not exposed to 182the drug) (iii ) underdosing and (iv) initial resistance allele frequency [77]. While (i v) frequency of putative resistance alleles cannot to be directly influenced by the design of future MDA campaigns, the first three factors are directly impacted by their design strategies . Frequent MDA campaigns targeting who le communities are advocated in high transmission settings to sustainably lower worm burden . However, more frequent deworming potentially leads to greater drug pressure that in return leads to a faster selection of resistant nematode strains . Even though treatment frequencies are considerably higher in livest ock, it is assumed that even one to three treatments per year in humans might be enough for resistance to emerge [77]. Therefore, the aim of AR prevention must be to reduce the speed at which resistance alleles accumulate . This might be best achieved by ensuring an adequate level of refugia as it is generally believed that worms in refugia conserve a pool of alleles susceptible to anthelmintics, which dilutes the frequency of resistant genes [111] . Moreover, u nderdosing has been shown to enable the survival of heterozygous resistant worms in veterinary medicine [112] . The most dangerous dose is the one that kills all susceptible homozyg ous genotypes, but none of the homozygous or heterozygous resistant genes [77]. Following that , the wide distrib ution of suboptimal doses over a prolonged period may further promot e development of AR in human soil -transmitted helminthiasis . This might become a serious threat, since the currently administered anthelmintic drugs are likely to be underdosed [98]. In addition, population groups with a long history of deworming harboring low parasite burdens , without reaching the transmission break points, are expected to be at the greatest risk fo r the development of resistant nematode strains [113] . Therefore, c urrent control s trategies should consider their potential of delaying the emergence of drug re sistance, for example , by (i) substituting albendazole and meb endazole with second - line drugs (e.g., tribendimidine) , (ii) administ ering drug combination s with different mode s of action or (iii) alternating available drug combinations . Likewise, a standard ized approach on how to regularly monitor potential emergence of AR needs to be established. This is of particular importance in high drug pressure settings with a long history of single drug deworming, in order to not only track drug efficacy, but to also detect worms carrying mutations 183bestowing drug resistance [98, 114, 115] . Therefore, d evelopment of reliable , standardized and affordable resistance indicators (e.g., validated molecular resistance markers ) are needed to effectively identify and monitor the spread of these phenotypes and to understand d ifferent dynamics in various parasite species [116] . Pyrosequencing and deep amplicon sequencing approaches are currently under investigation to assess the presence of genetic markers associated with resistance to benzimidazoles [101, 103, 117] . However, those are costly and need sophisticated laboratory infrastructure, which is majorly limited in resource -constrained countries. The SmartAmp technology , a unique genotyping technology that det ects a mutation under isothermal conditions, might present a valuable and less expensive method applicable in peripheral field settings . Rapid SNP genotyping assays, based on the SmartAmp method, were recently developed to target -tubulin polymorphisms in A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura , however, further A project called STARWORMS ( Stop Anthelmintic Resistant WOR MS), aiming at strengthening the monitoring and surveillance of drug efficacy and AR in human STH , is under way and hopefully provides some answers to outstanding questions in the near future [115, 119]. 10.2. 5 Future directions for STH diagnostics Appropriate d iagnost ic methods have become indispensable for successful STH control. Sensitive and specific tools are needed for determin ing STH prevalence and associated morbidity, assessing drug ef ficacy, monitoring potential AR , evaluating community effectiveness of intervention programs and for the verification of local disease elimination , as well as indivi dual patient management. Within this PhD , drug efficacy was evaluated by analysis of two samples before and two samples after treatment using microscopic Kato -Katz and molecular qPCR. Moreover, rapid immunological FC and FOB dipsticks were assessed as prox y markers for intestinal morbidity. In this chapter, I describe the improvements I believe are required to accurately diagnose STH 184infections and to, subsequently, assess drug efficacy. I also discuss what further investigations I think are needed in order to determine STH attributable morbidity. 10.2.5.1 Coprological egg -count based diagnostic methods We found that qPCR results not only indicate d higher sensitivity, which is line with a large body of evidence [9, 120 -123], but that a striking difference in CRs between Kato -Katz and qPCR was observed when two qPCR samples instead of one were considered both pre- and post- treatment (chapter 7 ). Hence, these findings stress a multi -sample analysis approach to reveal accurate prevalence and true efficacies of treatment option s. However, a lthough several studies used qPCR based diagnostic s in parasitology wi thin the last decade, DNA extraction and qPCR protocols including methods to preserve stool vary considerably , affecting the relative consistency and transferability of their diagnostic performance [124] . Only few studies use bead -beating before DNA extraction to increase the detection of T. trichiura DNA in stool and reagents seem to vastly be non -standardized [125] . Likewise, questions remain about the quantitative output of qPCR. S ome studies use arbitrary cycle threshold (C t) values as cut -off for the presence or absence of STH infections [126] , while others try to convert Ct values into DNA copy nu mbers per volume [127] , number of eggs per gram of stool [128] or genome equivalent per mL DNA extract [129] . Hence, laboratory protocols need to be standardized in order t o enable interlaboratory comparison and a proof - of-concept for qPCR to assess infection intensities and drug efficac ies is urgently nee ded in order to validate and implement qPCR in future program decision algorithms [129]. However, using qPCR as the main diagnostic tool is currently not feasible in resource - constrained settings. Consumable materials, such as probes, primers, bead -beating tubes and DNA extraction kits are costly a nd require stable electricity and freezers. Additionally, laboratory equipment, such as centrifuges, fume hoods and the qPCR machine itself, is expensive and difficult to transport to remote areas. E ven though most countries are still far away from elimina ting STHs , if transmission interruption is anticipated - likely to occur when the true prevalence is below 2% - qPCR will become imperative to confirm that this threshold 185has been achieved [130]. Collaborations between governments, research institutions and industrial partners will be needed to lower costs of consumables an d equipment and to train local laboratory technicians appropriately to implement qPCR as a validation tool for monitoring and surveillance of STH prevalence. Development of other highly sensitive but p otentially cheaper diagnostic tools is desirable. A potential copromolecular diagnostic method is the loop mediated isothe rmal amplification (LAMP ) that rapidly amplifies large amount s of DNA with high specificity under isothermal conditions. It is already in use for diagnosing s everal other parasitic diseases and has recently been developed for the detection of A. lumbricoides , N. americanus and T. trichiura in stool samples targeting internal transcribed spacer regions of the nuclear ribosomal DNA. Due to the simple equipment needed (i.e. , heat block or water bath for isothermal amplification), the LAMP method is inexpensive and field deployable. However, some issues need further development, such as a simple DNA extraction method and the need of pre-mixed LAMP reagents . Once validated under field conditions and compared to a duplicate Kato-Katz thick smear and qPCR, LAMP may become a valuable tool in STH diagnostics [131, 132] . A potential copromicroscopic method is the FECPAKG2 that has been developed as a remote - location tool for veterinary use to assess efficacy of administered drugs and to monitor infection intensities . Given the morphological similarities between human and animal helminths and the study design to assess drug efficacies, it represen ts a promising tool for use in human parasitology. The customized capture of images and the possibility to upload results on cloud systems facilitates central ized data analysis and storage [133] . The diagnostic performance (i.e., sensitivity and specificity) and the ability to estimate drug e fficacies of the newly launched FECPAKG2 will need to be compared to a duplicate Kato-Katz thick smear and qPCR . Fortunately, a fellow PhD student of our research group will, for the first time, apply this device in an upcoming efficacy trial this year. Fu rther studies are necessary to develop a system for quality control of egg counting and to assess cost -effectiveness. Alt hough the development of automatic detection and quantification of eggs in the images produced by the FECPAKG2 is at 186a very early stage , using AI might further reduce variation in egg counts between technicians and/or laboratories [134] . Although the use of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) has been successful in improving diagnosis of other parasites such as malaria, dia gnostic methods to detect antigens of intestinal helminths do not exist so far. A RDT, similar to the point -of-care circulating cathodic -antigen test (POC -CCA) for Schistosoma mansoni , would be desirable, given that all four STH species are somewhat in contact with blood within their life cycles in their human host [135] . However, so far only few attempts were made to develop similar assays for STH infect ions as cross - reactivity between ant igens of different STH species affects specificity of such tests [136] . In the meantime, the performance of the Kato -Katz technique can be improved by considering several samples on consecutive days per individual and with multiple examinations of the same fecal sa mple [137, 138] . Likewise, a recent study showe d that, to increase sensitivity of the Kato-Katz technique, samples should be read on the day of collection and may be stored in a refrigerator for a maximum of 110 minutes before hookworm egg counts start to significantly decrease [139] . 10.2.5.2 Intestin al morbidity markers Chronic infections with s oil-transmitted helminths may result in inflammatory dis abilitie s affecting the human host. The morbidity associated with such infections represent a considerable burden of disease [140] . Even though the WHO sets the aim of large -scale deworming based on quantifiable morbidity reduction , little is known about the effect of parasitic eggs, larva and adult worms on the host's intestine. To date, morbidity can only be measured indirect ly based on egg counts in feces, however, such diagnostic methods only capture non -hatching eggs . Hence, t he true number of worms in the human host cannot be assessed precisely , curbing the accurate m onitoring of morbidity control. A better clinical understanding of quantifiable STH attributable morbidity is particularly important after deworming, when infection intensities decline, but morbidity remains [141] . However , previous research on potential morbidity markers is limited to schistosomiasis causing gut morbidity 187[142-145]. Therefore, i dentifying potential surrogate markers to determine STH attributable intestinal morbidity was part of this PhD project (chapter 8 ). The results obtained in each of the three settings demonstrate d that FC and FOB are not appropriate proxy markers for intestinal morbidity. Findings support that STH actively mod ulate host immunity by eliciting regulatory and type 2 responses, which are important for host defense, tissue homeostasis and wound healing [146-148]. Thus, l ocal inflammation due to STH infections is presumably either very low-grade or driven by other immunoregulatory cell types that do not produce calprotectin [149] . If the latter hypothesis can be accepted , other appropriate markers would need to be identified. C-react ive protein (CRP) is a commonly used biomarker for inflammation and infection . However, a trend towards inverse association between CRP concentration and STH infections has already been found in a previous study [149] . Fecal alpha -1 antitrypsin clearance has been a well described marker for inflammat ory bowel disease and might bears potential as a marker for helminth induced intestinal inflammation [150] . Moreover, IL-22 facilitates tissue repair and mucosal barrier formation and may fun ction as a cytokine mediator between the microbiome and intestinal tissue [151, 152] . However, these biomarkers might be too generic and , thus, not of value when measuring STH attributable morbidity. Recent fin dings suggest alterations of the microbiota post -treatment with anthelmintics, suggesti ng important interactions between intestinal bacterial communities and helminth infections [153] . Further studies on the interplay between microbial communities , STH infections and anthelmintic drugs might advance the search for appropriate point -of-care markers . Moreover, f uture research focusing on the in -depth investigation of host -parasite interactions and immuno logy may serve as a basis for implementation studies examining potential morbidity markers. 18810.3 The necessity for a more effective STH control strategy on Pemba Island Pemba Island, the setting where the two clinical trials of this PhD project were cond ucted , has been receiving MDA for almost three decades and is , therefore, an example for long -term PC- based helminth control programs . Although prevalence and infection intensities dropped since the 1990s , we found STH infections to still be endemic based on the screening in two seco ndary schools and ten villages . Trichuris trichiura was with a prevalence of 78% the predominant STH species , followed by hookworm and A. lumbricoides . Moreover, we found worryingly high reinfections rate s at six and 12 months after treatment with albend azole or ivermectin -albendazole. Since helminth eggs can remain viable and infective for several months [154] , individuals remain at risk of becoming reinfected post-treatment through eggs lasting in the environment without the need for the deposition of new infective stages [155, 156]. In addition, persistent high prevalence may reflect inadequate sanitation and waste management facilities . Indeed, 33% of the screened households reported to no t own a latrine . Of those who had access to a latrine (private or shared), 28% did not have a si mple hand washing facility (jar or bucket). Likewise, reported open defecat ion practices was high at 71 %, which potentially contributes to persisting STH transmission. Moreover, 40% of the screened households reported to drink water collected from unsafe sources without boiling, filtering or any other treatment. Hence, environmental contamination with eggs and larvae and individuals' exposures hereto are assumed to be high , abetti ng the vicious cycle of reinfection as observed in our study communit ies. However, other parasitic disease control programs on both Islands of the Zanzibar Archipelago have been successful within the past two decades. The Programme to Eli minating Lymphatic Filariasis , aiming to interrupt LF transmission, annually administered ivermectin -albendazole to communities for six consecutive years (2000 -2005) [157] . Crucial factors for the successful implementation included a high-level of political commitment, the involvement of co mmunities to distribute t he drugs and social mobilization strategies [158] . Local drug distributors were identified to , not only deliver the drugs using a door -to-door approach, but also to build awareness and community support. In addition, information sheets about the MDA campaigns 189were distributed in schools and depicted in the local newspaper and television and radio programs were also designed to raise awareness of the campaign . These concerted efforts paid off with high coverage rates (100% geographic coverage, 65% treatment coverage) and a substantial reduction of LF cases , particular ly on Unguja Island [158, 159] . Likewise, i n 2011, a five-year project was implemented to monitor and evaluate multifaceted efforts of PC, snail control and beh avioral c hange for the elimination of urogenital schistosomiasis in Zanzibar. Recent findings from Knopp et al. confirm that prevalence of urogenital schistosomiasis was significantly reduced and that it has been eliminated as a public health problem from most sites on Pemba Island [160] . These two successful long-term parasitic control program s demonstrate that diseases can be sustainably fought with a comprehensive and integrated control approach on Pemba Island . Follo wing that, further progress of STH control on Pemba Island requires thinking and acting beyond PC. The 2030 WHO roadmap identified three pillars for integrated STH control : MDA, WASH and health education interventions [2]. Improvements in WASH would not only help to control STH on Pemba Island , but would also decrease intestinal protozoa, bacterial and vira l infection s, which often cause diarrhea [161] . However, investment in sound hygienic infrastructure is expensive; highlighting once more that poverty obstructs effective STH control strategies. Therefore, funding and support from government al and non-governmental organiz ations to build latrines and septic tanks , grant access to safe water and to motivate people to improv e their hygiene behaviors need to be requested. Indeed, a long -term national development plan was created in 2000 , while t he Zanzibar Vision 2020 included speci fic targets to eradicate poverty [162, 163] . Within the last 20 years, the economy has been growing constantly, with an annual growth rate of 7% in 2019. However, the aim to abject poverty was not achieved. A new Zanzibar Devel opment Vision 2050 is currently being developed to continuo usly tackle poverty [163] . However, since poverty alleviation goes beyond the reach of STH control programs, I identified six mitigation strategies that may be feasible to implement in the near future to sus tainably reduce infection reservoirs on Pemba Island . 190First, drugs that are more potent need to be administered in deworming campaigns and smaller treatment intervals need to be attained for sustainable morbidity control . The low efficacy of albendazole , the drug of choice in recent MDA rounds, majorly explain the persistent high prevalence of T. trichiura . Until more potent drugs are approved for the use against STH infections , either the combined use of ivermectin -albendazole or a multiple d ose regimen of benzimidazoles should be administered several times a year [95, 164] . Additionally, an alternating treatment scheme of the currently available drugs should be considered to maximize treatment outcomes against either species. Second , MDA campaigns a re currently implemented once per year in schools and once per year in communities. However, wit h such an approach, highly infected community members are more likely to endure and , thus, increase environmental contamination and risk of infections for treated individuals. Smaller treatment (e.g. , triannual) intervals for whole communities should be advocated and pregnant women in their second and third trimester s as well as lactating women should be informed and treated with, at least, a single dose of albendazole or mebendazole. Third , the seasonal peak of egg shedding should be identified in order to plan specific time point s when deworming programs are most needed . Higher humidity is associated with faster development of A. lumbricoides and T. trichi ura eggs and rain foster s egg and larval development [57, 58] . Although the evidence on seasonal transmission patterns is scarce, treating inhabitants immediately before the two rainy seasons might be an inexpensive strategy to lower environmental contamination . Fourth, t he most cost -effective and feasible intervention to complement regular large -scale PC in schools and communities might comprise comprehensive information, educat ion and commu nication strategies . Effective health information meetings to explain the burden and prevention of STH infections should regularly take place in whole communities, schools or in madrasas (religious schools) . Practices on how to prevent STH infections could , for example, be added to the national curricula in schools . Likewise , multimedia campaigns including announcement s in the local radio channel as well as simple leaflets and posters that can widely 191be disseminated will likely help raising awareness, promoting improved personal and domestic hygiene practices (e.g., prevention of open defecation, geophagia in children or food hygiene) . Successful communication strategies from other control activities (e.g., LF campaigns) might be helpful and should be incorporated into STH control. Fifth, in the mean time, with limited funding from the government, improvements in sanitation and safe management of fecal waste to prevent STH transmission, might be best achieved by \"community -led total sanitation \" (CLTS ), that has already been successfully implemented in other settings [165] . The integration of perspicuous CLTS might be a relativ ely inexpens ive approach to reduce soil contamination with infective STH eggs on Pemba Island . Sixth , risky factors and behaviors (e.g., soil and vegetation composition, consumption of raw vegetables, travel history, cultural beliefs and practices ) should be explored to break the ongoing transmission cycle. Once widely applicable, eDNA methods could be applied in large scale to detec t STH ova in contaminated environments. Identified t ransmission hot spots should be treated and mapped accordingly [166] . In summary , time is passing , and STH infections remain a major struggle for communities on Pemba Island. A multifaceted and transdisciplinary approach involving the three main strategies for STH control (i.e. , MDA, WASH and health edu cation interventions) should be adopted promptly to sustainably change the STH landscape . The risk of drug resistance and contamination of the environment remain high and Pemba communities are threatened to stay trapped in a vicious cycle of poverty, long -lasting STH infections and low quality of life. 192Chapter 1 1 Conclusion and future directions Since the remarkable public ation of This Wormy World by Norman Stoll in 1947 [167] , several global effo rts have been made to understand the biology and epidemiology of helminth ic infection s and to implement large -scale control strategies . Extensive MDA campaigns had great impact on preventing and relieving STH attributable morbidity and ultimately in improv ing global health [168] . However, at present, some obstacles continuously remain and new challenges are arising on how to best tackle these resilient parasites that have evaded simple control solutions . The large -scale application of donated supplies of the benzimidazole anthelmintics albendazole and mebendazole remains the mainstay of STH control programs . However, the success of PC is threatened by the limited drug efficacy , particularly against T. trichiura , rapid reinfections post -treatment, the difficulty delivering PC to all people living at -risk of infection and the high drug pressure in endemic count ries. While continuing research on alternative broad -spectr um anthelmintic drug candidates, reassessment of potentially anthelmintic drugs (e.g., drug repurposing), improved drug regimens of existing drugs and the use of drug (triple) combinations will rem ain of primal importance. Within this PhD project , the two drug combinations moxidectin -albendazole and ivermectin -albendazole were identified as promising candidates for future MDA campaigns . However, further progress of STH control requires thinking and acting beyond PC. A more comprehensive approach to complement and synergiz e with PC is needed to sus tainably lower worm burden and to finally escape the vicious cycle of reinfection and long lasting morbidity . In order to sustainably reduce infection prevalence and infection intensities, large -scale helminth control programs need to (i) assess the epide miological profile using field-applicable and sensitive diagnostic tools, (ii) continu e research to identify alternative broad -spectr um anthelmintic drug candidates preferably against all three STH species, (iii) foster the design of control strategies that includ e comprehensive information, educati on and communication strategies, (iv) encourage sanitation improvements that include access to safe water, sewage system and convenient latrine construction , (iv) identify STH transmission hot spots and 193subsequent ly treat them adequately , (v) set in place a surveillance system to monitor the emergence and spread of anthelmintic resistance and most importantly, (v i) be regularly revised and context -specifically adapted to country's epidemiological parasite situation . Neglected tropical disease control programs may integ rate such approaches for different diseases to benefit from joint disease mapping , use of multiplex diagnostics and joint drug procurement and distribution. Moreover, the reduction of poverty and economic development remain inevitable to control and eliminate STH infections, as seen in other countries that have successfully eliminated soil- transmitted helminthiasis as a public health problem (i.e., Japan, Repu blic of Korea) [169, 170] . Therefore, political commitment to ensure sustainable domestic investments for STH control programs need to be increased on Pemba Island and elsewhere. 194References 1.
