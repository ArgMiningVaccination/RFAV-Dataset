Optimal health can only be achieved when the root cause of problems is addressed rather than putting a band-aid on symptoms and hoping the problem goes away. One technique that is immensely powerful is Naturopathic Manipulative Therapy (NMT). Naturopathic Manipulative Therapy is a physical medicine technique that uses a combination of different types of touch for soft tissue mobilization, spinal adjustment, and more to treat a wide array of injuries, chronic diseases/illnesses, and other pain. NMT is, in short, a combination of spinal manipulation, touch, massage, physical therapy, and kinesiology to assist a naturopath in physical healing. Below are the 4 essential tools used in NMT and how they can achieve holistic healing and therapeutic treatment. - Touch - - - Touch may not sound particularly useful for healing but it can actually be immensely beneficial. The tone of a physician's touch helps develop a successful and trusting relationship with patients. And, beyond developing a successful relationship, the act of light touch can be used to naturally realign the body internally. Through gentle touch, the brain and nervous system are encouraged to have more effective communication which rebalances the body. When the body is in balance the immune system is better supported, chronic health conditions are more easily managed, pain is more easily managed, etc. - - Massage - - - Everyone loves a good massage but a massage as part of NMT is not only relaxing but healing as well. It is used to target specific areas of injury, pain or general concern to assist the body in natural healing and pain management. - - Physical Therapy - - - If you have experienced an injury from sports, an automotive accident, or any other reason, you may need physical therapy to recover. Strategic and targeted stretching and other physical therapy exercises can rebuild strength, manage pain, and assist and encourage the body to heal. - - Spinal Manipulation - - - The spine is one of the most important areas of the body and when it is out of alignment or injured in some way the whole body may suffer as a result. The spine impacts the muscular, nervous, and circulatory systems of the body and so it is a critical component of natural healing. Through spinal manipulation, your body may experience a triggered physical release that restores various pathways, improves metabolic function, and has positive effects on the various systems of the body to assist in healing and pain management. - "}
