{"title": "Non-toxic Megacolon Secondary to High-Grade Large-Bowel Obstruction", "author": "Nathan D Mullen; Hunter Thurn; Eric Karr; Kathryn M Burtson", "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": "A 92-year-old male presented from an outside hospital for treatment of a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation (COPD) and subsequently developed worsening abdominal distention with pain during the course of his hospitalization. He was found to have a high-grade large-bowel obstruction with a dilated colon of 20 cm measuring upward. The patient ultimately underwent a hemicolectomy to prevent bowel ischemia and reformation of another volvulus. We present this case to elucidate the need for vigilant monitoring in patients with chronic bowel obstruction due to lack of typical symptoms, to demonstrate a successful management approach, and to exhibit an extreme example of the resulting megacolon.", "sitename": "Cureus", "date": "2022-01-25", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
