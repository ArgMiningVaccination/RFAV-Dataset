It is also can be used to simple bless someone. We anoint and perform unction, to call upon divine influence, a holy emanation, spirit, the power of God. Anointing of the sick and dying is also called the Sacred Mystery of Unction. The word Unction implies the action of anointing and blessing someone with a medical herbal, aromatic ointment/oil that has both Spiritual (1st) and human (2nd) bodily healing qualities. The mystery of unction includes praying before, during and after the anointing. May grace be bestowed upon this spirit and body and let us evoke the Love and will of God in our hearts. Unction not only unites us to the Spirit, but creates in us a new/renewed Spirit; a sanctuary. \"and let them make for me a sanctuary and I will dwell in thee.\" (Ex. 25:8) \"And it shall come to pass on that day, that his burden shall be removed from upon your shoulder, and his yoke from upon your neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of oil.\" (Isaiah 10:27) Who to anoint: - Adults (and children old enough to understand what is taking place) suffering a serious illness, involved in a serious accident, facing surgery or major medical tests; - The elderly, especially when frailty is pronounced - even without serious illness; - Those suffering chronic infirmity (such as arthritis or diabetes) or serious mental illness. - Animals that are in need of healing, comfort and love.

Beyond all gifts there is the Spirit - whose proper name is theGift. In Greek the word ' gift' is synonymous with the word ' Spirit,' and/or ' grace.' Grace is also a very common word, and in both Biblical and secular ... In the first place, as in (e) above, ' charis' may mean \"a gift. ...Evidently in this sense \"grace\" is almost a synonym for the Spirit. Chrisma, the ritual of anointing, is the efficacious sign of the invisible spiritual unction - God' s grace and ' seal,' a branding of that grace. (Gal. 6:17) God' s healing love is poured out into the hearts of men and woman, which is spiritual, yet can be physical as well, if it be the will of God, our prayers and love (a face of God), and our healing medicines, which include the humble plants we apply and bath of cells with, which is another face of God. Nature/Gaia provides for us the healing plants, but they are humble. Optional prayer to be recited or sung: \"Praise be you my Lord, for our sister Mother Earth, who nourishes and sustains us all, and brings forth divers fruits, with many - colored flowers And herbs.\"- St. Francis of Assisi This seal (God' s Grace) closes off everything that opposes, or alienates from God, which purity of heart - Agape Love. This mystical aspect of unction depends solely on Grace, which may transform our natural senses into spiritual ones: \"Behold I make all things new\" (Rev. 21.5) And from the ' Song of Songs' \"Because of the savior of thy good ointments thy name is as ointment poured forth\"(1:3)...\"A bundle of myrrh is my well beloved unto me.\" (1:13) Now, the fruit (seal) of the Spirit is upon you, and \"the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.\" (Gal. 5:22, 23) In Buddhism, the Buddha was also known as the Great Physician. He was able to diagnose, and administer instruction in a spiritual dimension, which would best bring about the fundamental change and progress. Similar to Christianity and Judaism, according to Buddha \"One should unceasingly radiate loving kindness\" when anointing the sick, perform auction with great humility. Let us be still and listen for the whisper, that is Wisdom - which is connected to the Gift, which is the Spirit, which has been sealed with our prayers, anointing, and God' s Grace. Optional Prayer \"May the Lord bless you and keep you, May the Lord cause His favor to shine upon you and be gracious unto you, May the Lord lift His favor unto you and give you peace\" (Numbers 6:24-26) and healing. \"My beloved is mine and I am His\" (Song of Songs 2.16) \"Lord, you are the vine and we are the branches\" (John 15:4) May the Lord, who is the Prince of peace, bring peace, as well as goodness, blessing, compassion, and healing to each of us and all of the people of the world. May the Lord ease our suffering and give us the courage and love to be transformed in Agape Love. Amen! My the Lord gives you strength and through it all happiness - Happiness isn' t the absent, or avoidance of pain and suffering, but the mastery within pain and suffering, to know and feel, in your heart - peace, joy, beauty and love.
