Both have their uses in managing pain, but sometimes heat is best, sometimes ice is best, and sometimes you may get the best results by combining them. Odilon Dimie / Getty Images If you're trying to figure out which one to use, it helps to know what types of pain each approach is best for. Heat for Managing Pain Before using heat to help with your pain, ask yourself the following questions: Has your injury healed or is it fresh?Are your muscles tight and tender?Is the pain located in your joints or muscles? The answers to these questions are relevant because of how heat works to relieve certain types of pain. Heat can be an effective form of pain relief in three main circumstances: If the pain is caused by muscle tensionIf you need to \"loosen\" stiff jointsWhen pain is chronic, due to either disease or injuries that have healed This makes heat an appropriate choice for musculoskeletal conditions, such as: Arthritis Chronic back pain Fibromyalgia Trigger points/myofascial pain syndrome Old muscle strains or sprains Should You Use Moist Heat? When Not to Use Heat In other cases, heat is not effective and may even be detrimental. These situations include: New injuries, such as a sudden sprain or strain, because heat increases inflammationWhen skin is broken or damaged People with certain medical conditions shouldn't use heat therapy because heat can be detrimental to them or because they have an increased risk of burns. These conditions include: Deep vein thrombosis Dermatitis Diabetes Multiple sclerosis Vascular diseases Any problems with sensation, including neuropathy Ask your healthcare provider before using heat therapy if you:Are pregnantHave heart diseaseHave high blood pressure Ice for Managing Pain The benefits of ice therapy are that it can help reduce inflammation and lower sensitivity. If your injury is new, ice may be the answer. It can help to decrease swelling and bleeding and can reduce bruising caused by trauma. Ice isn't only for new injuries, however: it can numb sensitive areas and decrease pain sensations caused by chronic conditions as well. In fact, ice can be an effective pain reliever for many chronic pain conditions, including: Arthritis Back pain Migraine headaches Trigeminal neuralgia Some of those overlap with the ailments that can be helped by heat. If you have one of those conditions, you may benefit from either or from both at different times. It all depends on what feels best to you. The Right Way to Ice an Injury When Not to Use Ice Ice is generally a bad choice for stiffness and old muscle aches because it has the opposite effect of heat\u2014it can make muscles tense up. People with certain chronic conditions should be cautious about using ice. These include: FibromyalgiaTrigger pointsMyofascial pain syndrome Ice increases pain for some (but not all) people with these conditions. Additionally, fibromyalgia can include problems with body-temperature regulation, which can make it difficult to warm up after being exposed to cold. Ice may also be too intense for the sensitized nervous system. In the end, though, use what works for you. Use Heat For: Muscle tension Stiff joints Chronic pain Use Ice For: New injuries Chronic pain Combining Ice and Heat for Pain Many treatments for pain include the use of both heat and ice, with recommended exercise or stretching in the middle. For certain types of pain and injuries, you can apply heat to a muscle to warm it up, stretch and strengthen it, and then finish it off with a little ice to cool it down. It's not exactly a spa treatment, but it helps many people tolerate the exercises used in therapy that will benefit them. A Word From Verywell If you're unsure of whether to use heat or ice on your aches and pains, consult your healthcare provider or physical therapist. Your treatment recommendation should be based on the cause and source of your pain and where you are in treatment or the healing process.
