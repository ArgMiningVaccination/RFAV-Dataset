Many experiments are designed to include a control group and one or more experimental groups; in fact, some scholars reserve the term experiment for study designs that include a control group. Ideally, the control group and the experimental groups are identical in every way except that the experimental groups are subjected to treatments or interventions believed to have an effect on the outcome of interest while the control group is not. Inclusion of a control group greatly strengthens researchers' ability to draw conclusions from a study. Indeed, only in the presence of a control group can a researcher determine whether a treatment under investigation truly has a significant effect on an experimental group, and the possibility of making an [erroneous](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/erroneous) conclusion is reduced. See also [scientific method](https://www.britannica.com/science/scientific-method). A typical use of a control group is in an experiment in which the effect of a treatment is unknown and comparisons between the control group and the experimental group are used to measure the effect of the treatment. For instance, in a pharmaceutical study to determine the effectiveness of a new [drug](https://www.britannica.com/science/drug-chemical-agent) on the treatment of [migraines](https://www.britannica.com/science/migraine-pathology), the experimental group will be administered the new drug and the control group will be administered a [placebo](https://www.britannica.com/science/placebo) (a drug that is inert, or assumed to have no effect). Each group is then given the same questionnaire and asked to rate the effectiveness of the drug in relieving [symptoms](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/symptoms). If the new drug is effective, the experimental group is expected to have a significantly better response to it than the control group. Another possible design is to include several experimental groups, each of which is given a different dosage of the new drug, plus one control group. In this design, the analyst will compare results from each of the experimental groups to the control group. This type of experiment allows the researcher to determine not only if the drug is effective but also the effectiveness of different dosages. In the absence of a control group, the researcher's ability to draw conclusions about the new drug is greatly weakened, due to the [placebo effect](https://www.britannica.com/science/placebo-effect) and other threats to validity. Comparisons between the experimental groups with different dosages can be made without including a control group, but there is no way to know if any of the dosages of the new drug are more or less effective than the placebo. It is important that every aspect of the experimental [environment](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/environment) be as alike as possible for all subjects in the experiment. If conditions are different for the experimental and control groups, it is impossible to know whether differences between groups are actually due to the difference in treatments or to the difference in environment. For example, in the new migraine drug study, it would be a poor study design to administer the questionnaire to the experimental group in a [hospital](https://www.britannica.com/science/hospital) setting while asking the control group to complete it at home. Such a study could lead to a misleading conclusion, because differences in responses between the experimental and control groups could have been due to the effect of the drug or could have been due to the conditions under which the [data](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/data) were collected. For instance, perhaps the experimental group received better instructions or was more motivated by being in the hospital setting to give accurate responses than the control group. In non-laboratory and nonclinical experiments, such as field experiments in [ecology](https://www.britannica.com/science/ecology) or [economics](https://www.britannica.com/topic/economics), even well-designed experiments are subject to numerous and complex variables that cannot always be managed across the control group and experimental groups. Randomization, in which individuals or groups of individuals are randomly assigned to the treatment and control groups, is an important tool to eliminate selection [bias](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/bias) and can aid in disentangling the effects of the experimental treatment from other confounding factors. Appropriate sample sizes are also important. A control group study can be managed in two different ways. In a single-blind study, the researcher will know whether a particular subject is in the control group, but the subject will not know. In a [double-blind study](https://www.britannica.com/science/double-blind-trial), neither the subject nor the researcher will know which treatment the subject is receiving. In many cases, a double-blind study is preferable to a single-blind study, since the researcher cannot inadvertently affect the results or their interpretation by treating a control subject differently from an experimental "}
