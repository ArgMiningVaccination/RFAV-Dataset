Because of the popularity of complementary therapies in Australia, the [NICM Health Research Institute](http://nicm.edu.au/) at Western Sydney University was established to promote research in this area of health care. Some health professionals, universities and hospitals are also involved in research and clinical trials. Your hospital or support group may provide opportunities for you to take part in clinical trials and research involving the use of complementary therapies. Before deciding whether to join a clinical trial, [discuss the questions about joining a clinical trial](https://www.cancercouncil.com.au/cancer-information/living-well/complementary-therapies/#questions) with the clinical trials team and your cancer specialists. If you join a clinical trial for conventional cancer treatment, it is important to check whether using any complementary therapies could impact on the trial results. Speak to your doctor and/or the trial coordinator for information. You may find it helpful to talk to your specialist, cancer care team or GP, or to get a second opinion. If you decide to take part in a clinical trial, you can withdraw at any time. For more information, call Cancer Council 13 11 20 or see our general section on [Clinical trials and research](https://www.cancercouncil.com.au/cancer-information/cancer-treatment/clinical-trials/).
