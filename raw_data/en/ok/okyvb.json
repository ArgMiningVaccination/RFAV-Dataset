This decade must be the turning point where we recognize the value of nature, place it on the path to recovery and transform our world to one where people, economies and nature thrive. The global goal for nature defines what is needed to halt and reverse today's [catastrophic loss of nature](https://ipbes.net/news/Media-Release-Global-Assessment). It is supported by a number of organizations that ask governments to adopt the goal at the international level, which each country, the private sector, communities and others can contribute to achieving. A global goal for nature embraced at the highest levels must drive ambition in governments, business and society. It will work alongside the UN Convention on Biological Diversity 's [Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework](https://www.cbd.int/article/cop15-final-text-kunming-montreal-gbf-221222), and overarching mission to halt and reverse nature loss. This agreement and a global goal for nature also creates the opportunity for links between biodiversity and other conventions/agreements such as climate, ocean and land degradation. A Global Goal for Nature - in parallel to the UN Climate Convention's \"net zero\" emissions goal - is our guiding light in securing a nature-positive world by 2030, by taking urgent action to halt nature loss now. We need to halt and reverse nature loss measured from a baseline of 2020, through increasing the health, abundance, diversity and resilience of species, populations and ecosystems so that by 2030 nature is visibly and measurably on the path of recovery. By 2050, nature must recover so that thriving ecosystems and nature-based solutions continue to support future generations. Human activities are destroying nature at a rate much faster than it can replenish itself. The COVID-19 pandemic is a warning sign that the decline of nature is destabilizing society. A continued loss of nature threatens not only over half the global GDP, but more importantly human lives and wellbeing, with the poorest and most vulnerable hit first and hardest. As the climate crisis is deeply linked to the nature crisis, both need to be addressed simultaneously to drive a swift transition to a nature-positive, carbon-neutral future. With climate, we have the clear goal of carbon neutrality, articulated in the target of net zero emissions by 2050, with the objective of keeping global warming below 1.5C. A similar time bound goal for nature, ensures that we halt and reverse biodiversity loss at the pace necessary, in support of climate action and the Sustainable Development Goals. The Initiative launched on 6 September 2023, to promote the integrity and implementation of the Global Goal for Nature. 27 of the world's largest nature conservation organizations, institutes, business and finance coalitions came together together to launch a new initiative aimed at driving alignment around the definition, integrity and use of the term 'nature positive' and supporting broader, longer-term efforts to deliver nature-positive outcomes. \"Key natural ecosystems are heading towards irreversible tipping points with dangerous consequences for the stability of our planet. This is why we need to set our global compass to halt and reverse nature loss to safeguard human and planetary health. A global goal for nature aiming at achieving a net positive outcome by 2030 is crucial to secure a nature-positive future for humanity within our planetary boundaries.\" Professor Johan Rockstrom Director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research "}
