No. 61/597,708, filed Feb. 10, 2012; U.S. application Ser. No. 13/270,207, filed Oct. 10, 2011, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Applica \u00ad tion Ser. No. 61/391,558 filed \u00ad tional Application Number PCT/US20 11/055656 filed Oct. 10, 2011, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. BACKGROUND [0002] Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are used in a num \u00ad ber of therapeutic, diagnostic, and research applications. Therapeutic and diagnostic areas include cancer, antiviral treatment, autoimmune and inflammatory disease, allergy, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and rheumatology. [0003] Protein engineering and other efforts have generated mAbs with improved efficacy and targeting (e.g., bispecific mAbs), improved localization, tissue penetration, and blood clearance (e.g., single chain Fab variable fragments (scFvs), diabodies, minibodies, and other fragments), and altered immuno stimulatory, safety, toxicity, and/or pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamics properties, such as those containing modified Fe regions (e.g., through mutation or glycosyla- tion). mAbs have been reengineered to permit site-specific conjugation of small molecules for improved delivery (e.g., ThioMABs) or to irreversibly bind to their antigen (e.g., infinite affinity mAbs). mAbs have also been developed to improve the circulation and presentation of bioactive peptides and other biologies (e.g., CovX-bodies). Conjugationto vari\u00ad ous agents has tic methods. Hetero-multimeric scFvs and scFvs mAbs fused to avidin have been developed for pre-targeted therapy and to improve the detection limits for tumor imaging. [0004] Although mAbs can be effective and have advan \u00ad tages over small molecule approaches, existing antibodies and methods have various limitations. These can include adverse side effects resulting from off-taiget interactions, and/or collateral damage due to, among other things, long circulation times of antibody-drug conjugates). There is a need for improved antibodies and associated compounds, including those providing improved efficacy, synergy, speci \u00ad ficity, and safety, and methods and uses of the same. Provided are antibodies, compounds and compositions including pep\u00ad tides and other molecules, and related methods that address such needs.

In some aspects, such methods include effecting one or more amino acid substitutions in a template antibody or fragment thereof. In one example, the substitu \u00ad tions include a substitution at position 40, 41, or 85 of the VL region, and/or position 40 or position 89 of the VH region, according to Rabat numbering. [0094] In some aspects, the methods generate a meditope- enabled antibody or fragment thereof which binds to a medi \u00ad tope that is a peptide having an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of the sequences set forth in SEQ US 2012/0301400 Al 6Nov. 29, 2012 ID NO: I, 2, 16-18, 23, 29, 31, 32, 36, 39, 42, 43, 45, 46, 51, 52, 54, and 55, or a cyclic peptide derived therefrom. [0095] In some aspects, the template antibody or fragment is selected from the group consisting the hybridoma 10B5, oris B6H12.2. [0096] In some aspects, the meditope-enabled antibody binds to one or more meditopes (e.g., one of SEQ ID NO: I, 2, or cyclic peptide derived therefrom), e.g., those described above, with a particular affinity, such as with a dissociation constant of less than 10, 5, or 2 (or other number specified above) , as measured by SPR, or other method described above. [0097] In some aspects, each of the one or more amino acid substitutions is at a position selected from the group consist \u00ad ing of: position 8, 9, 10, 38, 39, 40, 41 42, 43, 44, 45, 82, 83, 84,85,86,87,99,100,101,102,103,104,105,142,162,163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, and 173 of the light chain, and/or 6, 9,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45, 84,86, 87, 88, 89, 90,91,103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, HO, 147, 150, 151, 152, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 185, 186, and 187 of the heavy chain, according to Rabat numbering.

In some cases, the selection is based on a binding affinity, pH tolerance, pH dependence, toxicity, PR, or PD of the selected antibody or fragment thereof, and/or is effected by contacting the antibodies or fragments thereof with a meditope and detecting binding to one or more of the anti\u00ad bodies or fragments thereto. [0100] Also provided are methods for selecting a meditope analog or meditope variant, including those comprising: (a)combining a meditope and a meditope-enabled antibody or fragment thereof, whereby the meditope non-covalently binds to the antibody or fragment thereof; and (b) adding a candidate meditope variant or analog; and (c) measuring dis\u00ad placement of the meditope by the candidate meditope variant or analog, wherein displacement of the meditope by the can\u00ad didate variant or analog identifies it as the meditope variant or analog.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [0104] FIG. I shows meditope peptides binding to frame \u00ad work loops of cetuximab. FIG. 1A: The complex of cetux- imab Fab (light chain is denoted by Vi and Ci; heavy chain is denoted by Vh and Ch) and cyclic CQFDLSTRRLRC (de\u00ad picted within the shaded area and labeled with the word \"meditope \") (SEQ ID NO: I) indicates that the meditope binds to an interface of the Fab framework, which is distinct from the CDR loops of cetuximab. FIG. IB (top) shows the stick representation of the cQFD meditope and (bottom) the stick representation of the cQYN meditope. The N- and C-ter- minal cysteines are solvent exposed and display high thermal factors. [0105] FIG. 2 shows certain embodiments of the cetuximab Fab binding interface, cetuximab is a human-murine chimera and, therefore, has a mixture of murine Ig variable domains and human constant Ig domains. FIG. 2A shows residues of chi4.18 and the humanized trastuzumab, which correspond to those residues of cetuximab that make contact with the meditope. FIG. 2B shows a stereoview of Arg9 of the cQFD meditope that occupies a distinct pocket encoded by the murine sequence of cetuximab (foreground). There is a salt US 2012/0301400 Al 7Nov. 29, 2012 bridge from Asp85 of the cetuximab light chain to the guard - dinium group of the meditope Arg9 and the backbone amide of Leu 10. [0106] FIG. 3 shows surface plasmon resonance (SPR) traces of cQFD and cQYN with an immobilized Fab. The cetuximab Fab used for crystallographic studies was coupled to a CM5 chip at low densities. Traces at increasing concen \u00ad trations of 3B) medi- topes are shown. The series of traces are fit to a simple I: I Langmuir binding model. The residuals of the fit are shown below each. [0107] FIG. 4 illustrates that the cQFD and cQYN medi- topes do not bind as was previ \u00ad ously hypothesized. FIG. 4A shows an overlay of two crystal structures, one of a cetuximab Fab and its antigen, EGFR domain III, the other showing the cQFD meditope and cetux \u00ad imab Fab, in which the cQFD meditope binds to the central cavity of the cetuximab Fab. The antigen, EGFR domain III, binds at the complementarity determining regions at a signifi \u00ad cant distance from the meditope binding site. FIG. 4B shows SDS-PAGE results on the left-hand side and the correspond \u00ad ing size exclusion chromatography results on the right-hand side. Size exclusion experiments of the individual compo \u00ad nents, Fab, EGFR domain III, and SMT-cQFD meditope, as well as an admixture of all three, indicate the formation of a hetero-trimeric complex that coeluted. The non-reducing SDS-PAGE gel shows the fraction that eluted first, indicating the presence of all three components within the new peak (the left-most peak for \"complex,\" shaded light gray) observed from the admixture. FIG. 4C shows the results of a FACS analysis, indicating that the cQFD meditope bound to EGFR positive MD-MBA-468 cells only in the presence of cetux \u00ad imab (arrows). The meditope alone or the meditope in the presence of M425, a murine EGFR antibody, did not bind. FIG. 4D shows results of surface plasmon resonance experi \u00ad ments using a sensor chip coupled with a cetuximab scFv or Fab. The experiments indicate that saturation of the scFv could not be achieved at concentrations as high as 100 of the cQFD meditope. The same experiments using the cetux \u00ad imab Fab coupled sensor chip indicate full saturation. The dissociation constant from this experiment is 660 nM. Con\u00ad trol SPR experiments (bottom panel) show that the cetuximab scFv readily binds to the soluble EGFR domain III fragment, indicating that the CDR loops were functional. [0108] FIG. 5 is a graph of fluorescence intensity compared to cell count and shows fluorescently-labeled cetuximab binding to MDA-MB-468 cells in the presence of cQFD. Cetuximab binds to MDA-MB-468 cells without meditope, and in the presence of 6 and 60 meditope. As expected, the Figure shows that there was no binding of the isotype IgG control to EGFR on MDA-MB468 cells. [0109] FIG. 6 shows how meditope and EGFR bind to distinct sites. The top images show superposition of the cQFD-Fab complex and the EGFR-Fab complex (I YY8) in stereo. The bottom images show that residues 39-46 of the heavy chain are flexible and accommodate the meditope. [0110] FIG. 7 shows Fab frameworkbinders. Superposition of Fabs bound to meditope, Protein A, and Protein L indicate that each binds to a unique site on the cetuximab Fab. [0111] FIG. 8 illustrates a mechanism of action in one embodiment for enhancing tumor therapy. In the exemplified embodiment, bivalent antibodies bound to antigen (e.g., ErbB receptor family) overexpressed on tumor cells (left panel) and blocks receptor signaling, alters endocytosis and receptorrecycling and/or elicits an immune response. The addition of an antibody such as matuzumab which recognizes a different domain of EGFR in combination with cetuximab can, in some cases be more effective due to daisy chaining of the surface receptor (right panel I). A multivalent meditope (in this par\u00ad ticular example, trivalent) tethers/cross-links the therapeutic mAh and can enhance its therapeutic potential (right). In addition, the multivalent meditope (shown here as a trivalent version) can also carry an imaging agent, which can allow for both enhanced therapeutics as well as imaging. [0112] FIG. 9 shows an scFv-meditope linker. scFvs are created by fusing the light chain variable domain to the heavy chain variable domain (or vice versa) through a 12-20 amino acid linker (typically {GGGS} 3_5). In this example, a portion of the flexible linker sequence can be replaced with the medi \u00ad tope sequence. [0113] FIG. 10 shows results from an SDS-PAGE showing that the cQFD meditope coupled thoroughly washed, and equilibrated in PBS. Cetuximab was then added to the beads (lane I), washed (lanes 2-4), and then eluted (lane 5). The top band is the IgG heavy chain and bottom band is the IgG light chain. [0114] FIG. 11 is a depiction of an exemplary embodiment of a steric mask. In this exemplary embodiment, the meditope is fused to the N-terminus of the Fab light or heavy chain through a flexible linker containing a tumor associated pro\u00ad tease site, to sterically occlude the antigen binding site. [0115] FIG. 12 shows SPR-determined binding kinetics for monovalent (left panel) and tetravalent (right panel) medi- topes to cetuximab. The panel above the surface plasmon resonance traces depicts a cartoon of the monovalent medi- topes being passed over the bivalent IgG. As shown in the right panel, avidin was saturated with biotinylated meditope and passed over the same immobilized cetuximab IgG. The off-rate of the multivalent meditope was reduced by at least 36 fold. (Note the time scales between the two experiments are different.) [0116] FIG. 13 illustrates the synthesis of dimeric and tri- meric meditopes according topes containing lactam linkages. [0117] FIG. isothiocyanate FlPLC trace of final bivalent meditope and its mass spectrum. [0118] FIG. 15 shows the nucleic acid sequence (SEQ ID NO:3) and the corresponding amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO:4) for a meditope-Fc fusion protein according to some embodiments. [0119] FIG. 16 shows an exemplary bivalent meditope. The meditope is directly fused to the N-terminus of a peptide linker that is directly fused to the Fe Region of an IgG. In this example, as the Fe is naturally homodimerized during expres \u00ad sion, the end product from the meditope-Fc construct is biva\u00ad lent. [0120] FIG. 17 shows the results of a series of exemplary FACS analyses monitoring binding of monovalent and biva\u00ad lent treated with 10 nM of cetuximab for 30 minutes, rinsed, and then treated with either the meditope-Fc construct or the monomeric meditope at four concentrations. The bottom trace is a negative control (no antibody). The next four traces show that a monomeric meditope binds to cells pre-treated US 2012/0301400 Al 8Nov. 29, 2012 with cetuximab in a concentration dependent manner. The top four traces also show that the bivalent, meditope Fe binds to cells pre-treated with cetuximab in a concentration dependent manner, but with higher affinity (i.e., more shifted to the right). This is predicted and consistent with a multivalent interaction. [0121] FIG. 18 is a depiction of an alternative meditope-Fc linker, a coiled coil, which may be used in accordance with certain embodiments. [0122] FIG. 19: Fragment screening by NMR. Representa \u00ad tive NMR spectra of a fragment pool before (top trace) and after (bottom trace) cetuximab addition. Using this method, lead compounds (e.g., those shown herein) have been identi \u00ad fied and the binding site is being determined using diffraction studies. [0123] FIG. 20 illustrates exemplary steps to alter and/or enhance the binding affinity (or alter another property) of a mAh for a meditope or compound binding at the meditope site using a directed random library. Specifically, a gene library where codons for mAh residues that line the meditope bind \u00ad ing site are replaced with NNK (where N is any nucleotide and K is a thymidine or guanosine) can be selected using FACS sorting (where the meditope and the antigen are labeled with distinct fluorophores). In another embodiment, the codons are substituted with NNN, where N is any nucleotide. The GPI linker can ensure the selected mAh remains associ \u00ad ated with the cell transfected with vectors encoding the gene sequences. Sequencing the genes encoding the light and heavy chain from the selected cells will identify high affinity mAbs. The method can be repeated to select for higher affin \u00ad ity meditope or meditope analogs. [0124] FIG. 21 shows surface representation of sequence differences of cetuximab and trastuzumab. The dark grey regions in the top panel indicate amino acid differences between cetuximab and the fully humanized trastuzumab framework. Certain residues inside the box have been mutated onto the trastuzumab framework. The CDR loops of trastuzumab have been identified (dark regions; bottom panel) and grafted onto the cetuximab framework. [0125] FIG. 22 Illustrates that a meditope-enabled trastu \u00ad zumab binds to a meditope-Fc fusion protein. The meditope binding site was created on trastuzumab, a humanized mAh that binds to the tumor antigen, HER2. FACS analysis in the top panel shows that meditope-enabled trastuzumab binds to SKBR3 cells that overexpress HER2 (top two traces). In the bottom graph, the meditope-Fc binds to meditope-enabled trastuzumab (top two traces \u2014peak shifted right), but not to wild-type trastuzumab (second from bottom) or to the nega \u00ad tive control (bottom trace). [0126] FIG. 23A shows acid (SEQ ID NO:5) sequence of a meditope-enabled trastuzumab heavy chain sequence. Signal peptide sequence is shaded in grey. FIG. 23B shows the amino acid (SEQ ID NO: 6) sequence of a meditope-enabled trastuzumab heavy chain sequence as compared to the wild-type (SEQ ID NO:7). Differences are highlighted in grey. After the amino acids shown in FIG. 23B, there are no differences remaining in the human sequence of the heavy chain shown. FIG. 23C shows the nucleic acid (SEQ ID NO: 8) sequence of a meditope-enabled trastuzumab light chain sequence. Signal peptide sequence is shaded in grey. FIG. 23D shows the amino acid (SEQ ID NO:9) sequence of a meditope-enabled trastuzumab light chain sequence as compared to the wild-type (SEQ ID NO:10). Differences are highlighted in grey.[0127] FIG. 24 shows that an antibody containing HER2- binding CDR loops grafted on cetuximab-like framework binds to and a meditope-Fc. In FIG. FACS analy \u00ad shows that binds to SKBR3 cells, which overexpresses HER2 (top three traces at different concentrations). FIG. 24B shows that while the meditope-Fc bound to the HER2-CDR grafted, meditope- enabled mAh (top three traces \u2014peak shifted right in concen \u00ad tration dependent manner), it did not bind to wild-type tras\u00ad tuzumab (second from bottom) or to the negative control (bottom trace). [0128] FIG. 25A shows nucleic acid (SEQ ID NO: amino acid (SEQ ID NO: 12) sequences forthe heavy chain of a trastuzumab with secretion sequence and engineered restriction sites (underlined). FIG. 25B shows nucleic acid (SEQ ID NO: 13) and amino acid (SEQ ID NO: 14) sequences for a light chain of trastuzumab with secretion sequence and engineered restriction sites (underlined). Shaded areas indi\u00ad cate exemplary residues that in some aspects could be altered to enhance or alter the specificity of the meditope, or could participate in binding interactions with a modified epitope. [0129] FIG. 26 illustrates examples of sequence and struc \u00ad tural alignment of the IgG and IgE Fab domains, with shaded areas indicating certain residues corresponding to resiues near a meditope binding site. [0130] FIG. 27 is a graph showing surface plasmon reso\u00ad nance (SPR) studies. The determined from pH=4.0 to pH=8. 0. [0131] FIG. 28 illustrates the results of an MTT assay com\u00ad paring the efficacy of a bivalent meditope-Fc to that of a monomeric meditope to inhibit MDA-MB-468 cell growth. FIG. 28A shows results of a study in which a meditope-Fc, but not a monomeric meditope, inhibited cell growth when com\u00ad bined with cetuximab. FIG. 28B shows that the meditope-Fc enhances the cell-killing capacity of cetuximab, similar to the combination of M425 and cetuximab. [0132] FIG. 29 illustrates binding of a to a cetux \u00ad imab meditope binding site (\"Cetuximab Binding \" as shown in Figure), but not to a fully humanized framework (\"Trastu \u00ad zumab No binding \" as shown in Figure) or another murine- chimera framework (\"Rituximab No binding \" as shown in Figure). The cQFD meditope (meditope I, SEQ ID NO: I) was conjugated to a CM5 chip for surface plasmon resonance studies and cetuximab (meditope Fab), trastuzumab (fully humanized framework), and rituximab (murine-human chimeric framework) were tested at concentrations of 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5 and I . Only cetuximab bound to the medi- tope-conjugated chip. [0133] FIG. 30 shows biophysical data obtained for the meditopes. FIG. 30A NO:2) using a cetuximab Fab chip. FIG. 30B shows a representative binding isotherm of the meditope (SEQ ID NO: I) and cetuximab Fab (top) and integration (bottom). FIG. 30C shows superposition of both meditopes. Oval I indicates the Phe/Tyr position. The arrow indicates a shift of the backbone that leads to a favorable hydrogen bond network and may account for a favorable change in the enthalpy. The hydrophobic groups, F/Y3 L5, and LlO are nearly identically positioned, but the hydroxyl group ofY5 in the cQYN medi \u00ad tope prevents R8 from interacting with the Q105 backbone, as US 2012/0301400 Al 9Nov. 29, 2012 observed in the cQFD meditope (\"steric clash \"). This rear\u00ad rangement also results in a concomitant change in the back \u00ad bone residues of the -turn ('backbone rotation \"). FIG. 30D shows individual thermodynamic parameters determined by ITC of different meditope variants. The Phe3Tyr variant (meditope 2, SEQ ID NO: 2) shows a significant change in 1 though lower affinity. Based on the structure, Gln2 in the meditope of SEQ ID NO: I was replaced with the D-stere- omer. ITC analysis of this meditope, (SEQ ID NO: 15), revealed a significant increase in entropy and loss in enthalpy. [0134] FIG. 31 shows the chemical structure of a meditope according to some embodiments. The circles indicate posi\u00ad tions that can be modified, e.g., to improve meditope affinity for the Fab. The boxes indicate cyclization strategies. 'Click ' chemistry and olefin metathesis, top and bottom far right boxes, respectively, are additional routes to cyclize the medi \u00ad tope. [0135] FIG. 32 illustrates the synthesis of lactam SEQ ID NO: 32) and fluorescein-labeled lactam (3). [0136] FIG. 33 shows the sites of optimization according to some embodiments. Ovals indicate cavities in the Fab region of the mAh that may be exploited to optimize the affinity of a meditope. [0137] FIG. 34 shows a modified Arg8 residue that may be used to optimize meditope binding parameters, and may be used in accordance with the embodiments described herein (R=alkyl, substituted alkyl, aromatic or NHR'\", where R'\"=alkyl, substituted alkyl, or aromatic). [0138] FIG. 35 shows the hydrophilic interface in the vicin \u00ad ity of .Phe3 of a meditope. Halogens incorporated in the phenyl ring may form strong noncovalent bonds to the hydroxyl group of cetuximab Tyr87 or Tyr91, as well as to backbone carbonyls. [0139] FIG. 36 illustrates covalent interactions between a meditope and the backbone of cetuximab. A hydratable side chain may be incorporated at Arg8 (left) or LeulO (right) to form a covalent bond to the hydroxyl groups of Ser or Tyr of the Fab. [0140] FIG. 37 illustrates a fluorescence polarization assay of dose-dependent inhibition of the interaction between and a fluorescein-labeled peptide by unlabeled peptide. The assay identified small molecule compounds that could compete with the meditope for mAh binding and thus can be developed to function in a similar manner as a medi \u00ad tope. As a control, it was demonstrated that a non-labeled meditope could displace the fluorescently-labeled meditope. Equilibration of the displacement at three times points indi\u00ad cates that the assay is robust and amendable to high through \u00ad put screening. [0141] FIG. 38 shows five lead compounds identified from the fluorescence polarization screen. [0142] FIG. 39 shows stick structures for eighteen modified meditopes, corresponding to SEQ ID NO:22 (A), SEQ ID NO: (B), SEQ NO: (C), SEQ ID NO: 18 (D), ID 15 ID NO:55 (BB) . The sequence of these structures is shown in Tables 3 and 4.[0143] FIG. 40 is a table showing the X-ray diffraction data for the structures shown in FIG. 39 and additional meditopes in Tables 3 and 4. [0144] FIG. 41 shows representative surface plasmon reso\u00ad nance studies of meditope variants. Based on the structural information of the Phe3H is mutation in the cQFD meditope, a variant meditope was synthesized with ,'-diphenylala- nine at position 3 (top trace). A significant improvement in the binding affinity for cetuximab of -4 fold, was observed by surface plasmon resonance. Aminohexanoic acid was used to replace the disulfide bridge of the original meditope (bottom trace). While the binding affinity was decreased, these data indicate that modifications can be made to meditopes to address potential issues with pharmacokinetics, pharmaco \u00ad dynamics and toxicity in animal and human studies. It is noted that this combination can be combined with unnatural amino acids at other positions within a meditope. [0145] FIG. 42 illustrates structural information that can be useful, e.g., to improve meditope affinity. The top panel shows a crystal structure of a meditope bound cetuximab, showing Phe3 bound within the Fab cavity of cetuximab. Substitution of this position with histidine and subsequent structural analysis indicates the side chain (imidazole) takes on a new conformation (middle panel). Based on this obser \u00ad vation, ,'-diphenylalanine which could place one phenyl side chain at the original position and one phenyl side chain at the imidazole ring was substituted at position 3. The crystal structure indicates that this substitution mimics both side chain conformations. Surface plasmon resonance studies shows that this substitute binds with higher affinity (FIG. 41, top panel).

Control cells, not pre\u00ad bound with any antibody (MPL-5K only) also did not bind to MPL-5K. [0149] FIG. 46 shows results of a study described in Example 4, demonstrating that meditope binds to meditope- enabled trastuzumab to a similar degree whether the antibody is pre-bound to cells expressing antigen prior to incubation with the meditope (left panel), or meditope-Protein L- and antibody are pre-mixed and then incubated with cells express \u00ad ing antigen (right panel).

Definitions [0165] An \"antibody,\" as used herein, refers to an immuno \u00ad globulin molecule that specifically binds to, or is immuno- logically reactive with an antigen or epitope, and includes both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, as well as func \u00ad tional antibody fragments, including but not limited to frag\u00ad ment antigen binding (Fab) fragments, F(ab') 2 fragments, Fab' fragments, Fv fragments, recombinant IgG (rlgG) frag\u00ad ments, single chain variable (scFv) and single domain antibodies (e.g., sdAb, sdFv, nanobody) fragments. The term \"antibody \" includes suchas antibodies eroconjugate triabodies, tetrabodies, di-scFv, tandem tri-scFv). Unless otherwise stated, the term \"antibody \" should be understood to encompass functional antibody fragments thereof. [0166] The terms \"complementarity determining region, \" and \"CDR,\" are known in the art to refer to non-contiguous sequences of amino acids within antibody variable regions, which confer antigen specificity and binding affinity. In gen\u00ad eral, there are three CDRs in each heavy chain variable region (CDR-H1 , CDR-H2, CDR-H3) and three CDRs region (CDR-L1, CDR-L2, CDR-L3). \"Framework regions \" and \"FR\" are known in the art to refer to the non-CDR portions of the variable regions of the heavy and light chains. In general, there are four FRs in each heavy chain variable region (FR-H1, FR-H2, FR-H3, and FR-H4), and four FRs in variable region (FR-L1, FR-L2, FR-L3, and FR-L4). [0167] The precise amino acid sequence boundaries of a given CDR or FR can be readily determined using any of a number of well-known schemes, including those described by Rabat et al. (1991), \"Sequences of Proteins of Immuno \u00ad logical Interest, \" 5th Ed. Public Flealth Service, National Institutes of Flealth, Bethesda, Md. (\"Rabat \" numbering scheme), Al-Lazikani et al, (1997) JMB 273, 927-948 US 2012/0301400 Al 11Nov. 29, 2012 (\"Chothia numbering al., J. Mol. Biol. 262:732-745 (1996), \"Antibody-antigen J. Mol. Biol. 262,732-745 (Contact \" numbering scheme), Lefranc M P et ah, \"IMGT unique numbering for immunoglobulin and T cell receptor variable domains and Ig superfamily V-Iike domains, \" Dev Comp Immunol, 2003 January; 27(1):55-77 (\"IMGT \" numbering scheme), and Honegger A and Pliick- thun A, \"Yet another numbering scheme for immunoglobulin variable domains: an automatic modeling and analysis tool, \" J Mol Biol, 2001 June 8; 309(3):657-70, (AHo numbering scheme). [0168] The boundaries of a given CDR or FR may vary depending on the scheme used for identification. For example, the Rabat scheme is based structural alignments, while the Chothia scheme is based on structural information. Numbering for both the Rabat and Chothia schemes is based upon the most common antibody region sequence lengths, with insertions accommodated by insertion letters, for example, \"30a,\" and deletions appearing in some antibodies. The two schemes place certain insertions and deletions (\"in- dels\") at different positions, resulting in differential number \u00ad ing. The Contact scheme is based on analysis of complex crystal structures and is similar in many respects to the Chothia numbering scheme. [0169] Table I, below, lists the L2, Rabat, Chothia, and Contact schemes, respectively. For CDR-H I, residue numbering is given listed using both the Rabat and Chothia numbering schemes. It is noted that because the Rabat numbering scheme places insertions at H35A and H35B, the end of the Chothia CDR-Hl loop when numbered using the Rabat numbering convention varies between H32 and H34, depending on the length of the loop. of Proteins of Immunological Interest, \" 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 2Al-Lazilcani et al., (1997) JMB 273, 927-948 [0170] Thus, unless otherwise specified, a \"CDR \" or \"complementary determining region, \" or individual specified CDRs (e.g., \"CDR-H1, CDR-H2), of a given antibody or region thereof, such as a variable region thereof, should be understood to encompass a (or the specific) complementary determining region as defined by any of the known schemes Likewise, unless otherwise specified, a \"FR\" or \"framework region, \" or individual specified FRs (e.g., \"FR-H1, FR-H2), of a given antibody or region thereof, such as a variable region thereof, should be understood to encompass a (or the specific) framework region as defined by any of the known schemes. In some instances, the scheme for identification of a particular CDR, FR, or FRs or CDRs is specified, such as the CDR asdefined by the Rabat, Chothia, or Contact method. In other cases, the particular amino acid sequence of a CDR or FR is given. [0171] The term \"meditope-enabled \" antibody and \"meMAb \" refer to an antibody or functional fragment thereof that is able to bind to a meditope, via a meditope binding site. Examples of meditope-enabled antibodies include, but are not limited to, cetuximab and others described herein. A \"meditope binding site\" is a region of the meditope-enabled antibody containing the amino acid residues that interact with a bound meditope, which residues include framework region (FR) residues of the heavy and light chains. With reference to a Fab fragment or a Fab portion of an antibody, the meditope binding site is located within the central cavity of the Fab fragment or portion. [0172] The \"central cavity, \" with respect to the three-di \u00ad mensional structure of a Fab, refers to the internal cavity of the F ab, lined by portions of the heavy and light chain variable and constant regions. The central cavity thus is lined by residues of the VH, VL, CHI, and CL regions and does not include the antigen binding site. [0173] In some embodiments, the meditope binding site includes residues 40, 41, 83, and 85 of the light chain of a meditope-enabled antibody, according to Rabat numbering, and/or residues 39, 89, 105, and 108 of the heavy chain of the meditope-enabled antibody, according to Rabat numbering.

[0175] With respect to a Fab portion of a meditope-enabled antibody, the meditope binding site includes residues within the central cavity. The meditope-binding site typically further includes constant region residues. [0176] The terms \"meditope \", as used herein, refers to a peptide or peptides that binds to a meditope-binding site of a meditope-enabled antibody, which antibody has a threonine at position 40, an asparagine at position 41, and an aspartage at position 85 of its light chain, according to Rabat number \u00ad ing, or contains a meditope binding site containing residues that correspond to those within the meditope-binding site of but are not limited to, the cQFD and cQYN peptides and variants thereof (\"meditope variants \" \"variant medi \u00ad topes \"), as well as multivalent and labeled meditopes. Other molecules may also bind to meditope binding sites of medi \u00ad tope-enabled antibodies, with functional characteristics simi\u00ad lar to those of a meditope. Such molecules, meditope analogs, may include, but are not limited to, small molecules, aptam- ers, nucleic acid molecules, peptibodies and any other sub\u00ad stance able to bind to the same meditope binding site as a meditope. [0177] A \"therapeutic agent,\" as used herein, is an atom, molecule, or compound that is useful in treatment of a disease or condition. [0178] A \"therapeutically effective amount,\" \"therapeuti \u00ad cally effective concentration \" or \"therapeutically effective dose \" is the amount of a compound that produces a desired US 2012/0301400 Al 12Nov. 29, 2012 therapeutic effect in a subject, such as preventing or treating a taiget condition, alleviating symptoms associated with the condition, producing a desired physiological effect, or allow \u00ad ing imaging or diagnosis of a condition that leads to treatment of the disease or condition. The precise therapeutically effec \u00ad tive amount is the amount of the composition that will yield the most effective results in terms of efficacy of treatment in a given subject. This amount will vary depending upon a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the character \u00ad istics of the therapeutic compound (including activity, phar \u00ad macokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and bioavailability), the physiological condition of the subject (including age, sex, disease type and stage, general physical condition, respon \u00ad siveness to a given dosage, and type of medication), the nature of the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or carriers in the formulation, and the route of administration. One skilled in the clinical and pharmacological arts will be able to deter \u00ad mine a therapeutically effective amount through routine experimentation, namely by monitoring a subject 's response to administration of a compound and adjusting the dosage accordingly.

A \"pharmaceutically acceptable salt\" refers to a salt of a free acid or base of a compound described herein that is non-toxic, is physiologically tolerable, is compatible with the pharmaceutical composition in which it is formu \u00ad lated, and is otherwise suitable for formulation and/or admin \u00ad istration to a subject. Reference to a compound herein is understood to include reference to a pharmaceutically accept \u00ad able salt of said compound unless otherwise indicated.[0212] Compound salts include acidic salts formed with inorganic and/or organic acids, as well as basic salts formed with inoiganic and/or organic bases. In addition, where a given compound contains both a basic moiety, such as, but not limited to, a pyridine or imidazole, and an acidic moiety, such as, but not limited to, a carboxylic acid, one of skill in the art will recognize that the compound may exist as a zwitterion (\"inner salt\"); such salts are included within the term \"salt\" as used herein. Salts of the compounds of the invention may be prepared, for example, by reacting a compound with an amount of a suitable acid or base, such as an equivalent amount, in a medium such as one in which the salt precipitates or in an aqueous medium followed by lyophilization. [0213] Exemplary salts include, but are not A pharmaceutically acceptable salt may involve the inclusion of another molecule such as an acetate ion, a succinate ion or other counterion. The counterion may be any oiganic or inor\u00ad ganic moiety that stabilizes the charge on the parent com\u00ad pound. Furthermore, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt may have more than one charged atom in its structure. Instances where multiple charged atoms are part of the pharmaceuti \u00ad cally acceptable salt can have multiple counterions. Flence, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have one or more charged atoms and/or one or more counter ion. [0214] Exemplary acid like. [0215] Exemplary basic salts include ammonium salts, alkali metal salts such as sodium, lithium, and potassium salts, alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium and magne salts, salts as dicyclohexylamines, t-butyl amines, and salts with amino acids such as arginine, lysine and the like. Basic nitrogen-containing groups may be quarternized with agents such as lower alkyl halides and others. [0216] Additionally, acids and bases which are generally considered suitable for the formation of pharmaceutically useful salts from pharmaceutical compounds are discussed, for example, by P. Stahl et al, Camille G. (eds.) Flandbook of Pharmaceutical Salts. Properties, Selection and Use. (2002) Zurich: Wiley -VCFl; S. Berge et al, Journal of Pharmaceuti \u00ad cal Sciences (1977) 66(1) 1-19; P Gould, International J. of Pharmaceutics (1986) 33 201-217; Anderson et al, The Prac \u00ad tice of Medicinal Chemistry (1996), Academic Press, New York; and in The Orange Book (Food & DrugAdministration, US 2012/0301400 Al 15Nov. 29, 2012 MD, available from FDA). These disclosures are incorpo \u00ad rated herein by reference thereto. [0217] Additionally, any compound described herein is intended to refer also to any unsolvated form, or a hydrate, solvate, or polymorph of such a compound, and mixtures thereof, even if such forms are not listed explicitly. \"Solvate \" means a physical association of a compound of the invention with one or more solvent molecules. This physical associa \u00ad tion involves varying degrees of ionic and covalent bonding, including hydrogen bonding. In certain instances the solvate will be capable of isolation, for example when one or more solvent molecules are incorporated in the crystal lattice of a crystalline solid. \"Solvate \" encompasses both solution-phase and isolatable solvates. Suitable solvates include those formed with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like. In some embodiments, the sol\u00ad vent is water and the solvates are hydrates. [0218] Any formula given herein is also intended to repre \u00ad sent unlabeled forms as well as isotopically labeled forms of the compounds. Isotopically labeled compounds have struc \u00ad tures depicted by the formulas given herein except that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having a selected atomic mass or mass number. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include iso\u00ad topes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine, chlorine, labelled compounds are useful in metabolic studies (for example with 14C), reaction kinetic studies (with, for example 2Fl or 3Fl), detection or imaging techniques [such as tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)] including drug or substrate tissue distribution assays, or in radioactive treat \u00ad ment of patients. In particular, an 18F or 11C labeled com\u00ad pound may be particularly suitable for PET or SPECT stud\u00ad ies. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium (i.e., 2Fl) may afford certain therapeutic advan \u00ad tages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements. Isotopically labeled compounds of this invention and pro\u00ad drugs thereof can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the schemes or in the examples and preparations described below by substituting a readily avail \u00ad able isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent. B. Antibodies and Antibody-Binding [0219] are antibodies, including mono \u00ad clonal antibodies (mAbs), and fragments, e.g., functional fragments, thereof, and compounds and compositions, including peptides, such as meditopes, and meditope analogs, that bind to the antibodies. The substances, e.g., meditopes, generally bind to regions/binding sites of the antibodies and fragments other than (e.g., separate from) the complementa \u00ad rity determining regions (CDRs), typically to residues within the framework regions (FRs) and/or constant regions of the antibodies and fragments . Also provided are complexes, com\u00ad pounds, and compositions containing the antibodies and sub\u00ad stances, e.g., meditopes, as well as methods and uses of the same, including therapeutic, diagnostic, research, and other uses of the antibodies and substances, and methods for pro\u00ad ducing the same. [0220] In certain aspects, the provided embodiments are based on the discovery described herein that certain (cQFD; chimeric antibody, interacting with residues outside the complementa \u00ad rity determining regions (CDRs), including residues in the framework and constant region. Also as described herein, the ability to bind to these peptides was based on certain aspects specific to cetuximab and in the studies herein binding was not observed, for example, to fully human antibodies, murine antibodies, or other chimeric antibodies). As demonstrated herein, these meditopes are capable of binding the chimeric antibody simultaneously with its antigen. See FIG. 4. As demonstrated herein, the binding site for these meditopes on cetuximab also are distinct from the binding sites of other framework-binding antigens such as Pepto streptococcus magnus Protein L (PpL) (FIG. 7). In certain aspects, the provided embodiments build upon this discovery, for example, by modifying other mAbs to allow their binding to these and other meditopes (i.e., \"meditope-enabling \") and generating variant meditopes and/or altered meditope-enabled antibod \u00ad ies, for example, those having altered properties, including improved binding affinity, toxicity, PK/PD, and/or pH depen \u00ad dence. C. Meditope-EnabledAntibodies and Complexes [0221] Provided are meditope-enabled antibodies that are capable of binding to one or more meditopes via meditope- binding sites. In some cases, the meditope-enabled antibody binds to a cyclic peptide of SEQ ID NO: I or 2 (meditope I or 2) and/or to one or more variants thereof, such as meditopes I, 2, 16-18, 23, 29, 31, 32, 36, 39, 42, 43, 45, 46, 51, 52, 54, or 55 (meditopes based on peptides having the sequences set forth in SEQ ID NOs: I, 2, 16-18, 23, 29, 31, 32, 36, 39, 42, 43, 45, 46, 51, 52, 54, or 55), or in some cases, any of meditopes I, 2, or 15-55. Among the provided meditope- enabled antibodies are those that bind to a meditope or medi \u00ad topes with an affinity similar to that of cetuximab. For example, in certain aspects, the antibodies bind to the medi- tope(s) with a dissociation constant of less than at or about 10 , less than at or about 5 , or less than at or about 2 , less than at or about I , less than at or about 500,400, 300, 200.100 nM, or less, such as atorabout200picomolarorless. In some cases, the dissociation constant, such as any of those listed herein, is that measured using a particular technique, such as surface plasmon calorimetry, or other known method. For example, in some cases, the analog or meditope exhibits a binding constant of less than at or about 10 , less than at or about 5 , or less than at or about 2 , less than at or about I , less than at or about 500, 400, 300.200. 100 nm, or less, as measured by SPR or as measured by ITC or as measured by any of these methods. [0222] In some examples, the meditope-binding site is a structural feature of the monoclonal antibody, cetuximab, a human-murine chimeric antibody used for the treatment of EGFR-expressing metastatic colorectal cancer and head and neck cancers. Thus, in some cases, the meditope-binding site contains residues corresponding to those within the meditope binding site of cetuximab. In a study reported herein, x-ray crystallographic analysis has revealed that the peptides of SEQ ID NO: I binds to a meditope-binding site within the US 2012/0301400 Al 16Nov. 29, 2012 central cavity of the cetuximab Fab fragment, defined by various residues of the heavy and light chains (see FIGS. I and 4A), with a binding constant of -700 nM (see FIGS. 30A-30B). [0223] Several interactions between cetuximab meditope binding site and the cQFD (SEQ NO: 2, meditope 2) meditopes are based on particular structural features of cetuximab, particularly within the framework and constant regions of the central cavity of the Fab fragment. The regions of cetuximab that constitute the meditope binding site are unique and appear to be the result of the chimeric nature of this antibody. Specifi \u00ad cally, the Fab variable regions (Fvs) are murine and the Fab constant regions (CF! I and CL) are human. The engineering of this Fab produced a combination of residues not found in a sequence alignment of murine and human chimeric antibod \u00ad ies. For example, data herein show that the meditopes did not bind to fully human IgG framework (e.g., trastuzumab), to other chimeric antibodies such as rituximab (FIG. 29), or to mouse antibodies, confirming that the cetuximab meditope- binding site is highly specific. In addition to these results, superposition of the molecular structure of trastuzumab (1N8Z; Cho et al., Nature, \"Structure of the extracellular region of HER2 alone and in complex with the Fierceptin Fab,\" 2003 Feb. 13; 421(6924):756-60) and rituxumab (20SL; 2007 May 18; 282(20): 15073- 80. Epub 2007 Mar. 29) Fabs on to the meditope bound cetuximab Fab structure further highlighted the uniqueness of the framework. Superposition of multiple human and murine onto the cetuximab-cyclic peptide (meditope I) struc \u00ad ture indicated interactions between this peptide and murine-human chimeric Fab are absent in both human- only and murine-only IgG structures compared in this study. Point mutations of key residues within the cQFD cyclic pep\u00ad tide (meditope I) reduced its binding affinity for the cetux \u00ad imab Fab, further confirming the high specificity and struc \u00ad tural model. Thus, the interaction appears to be specific to the central cavity of this specific murine-human chimera Fab and the selected meditope. [0224] In certain embodiments, the unique interactions between the meditopes and the cetuximab binding site are exploited to generate additional meditope-enabled antibod \u00ad ies. Meditope-enabled antibodies are useful, for example, to improve antibody and cell purification methods, improving the therapeutic efficacy of mAbs, enhancing targeted delivery of imaging or therapeutic agents, including in pre-taigeted delivery and imaging, and improving mAb-based imaging methods, and in some aspects are broadly applicable to any monoclonal antibody. [0225] In some embodiments, the meditope-enabled anti\u00ad bodies are generated by modifying an antibody other than cetuximab (sometimes referred to as the template antibody), such as an antibody having one or more CDRs distinct from those of cetuximab, to confer the ability to bind to one or more of the provided meditopes, such as a meditope of SEQ ID NO: I or 2, or variant thereof. The template antibody can be a human or humanized antibody or a mouse antibody. In one aspect, the modifications include substituting residues within the central cavity of the Fab fragment, typically within the framework regions (FRs) of the heavy and light chain variable regions and/or the constant regions to render the template antibody meditope-enabled. For example, where the template antibody is a human or humanized antibody, the modifica \u00ad tions generally include substitutions at residues within theheavy and light chain variable region FRs. In some embodi \u00ad ments, such residues are replaced with the corresponding residue present in cetuximab, or comparable amino acid. Thus, in certain embodiments, residues within the FRs of a human or humanized antibody are replaced with correspond \u00ad ing murine residues; in certain embodiments, they are replaced by other residues, such as those having similar func \u00ad tional groups or moieties for interacting with the meditopes. Typically, the residues replaced by corresponding murine (or other) residues are found within the central Fab cavity, and thus are not exposed to the immune system. As such, in some embodiments, introducing these amino acid substitutions in a human or humanized antibody do not increase or do not substantially increase the antigenicity of the modified tem\u00ad plate antibody, in the context of delivery to a human subject. In addition, antigenicity prediction algorithms may be further used to indicate that the human sequence with the point muta \u00ad tions should not be antigenic. [0226] In some embodiments, the one or more residues that are replaced, are selected from light chain framework resi\u00ad dues 10, 39-43, 83, 85, 100 and 104, according to Rabat numbering (see Rabat E. A., et al. (1991) Sequences of Pro\u00ad teins of Immunological Interest, \u00ad tion No. 91-3242, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety), and/or heavy chain framework residue numbers 40, 89 and 105, according to Rabat numbering (see FIG. 2). In general, unless otherwise specified, amino acid positions in the heavy or light chain of an antibody refer to Rabat num \u00ad bering. Also encompassed within the present disclosure are residues in other antibodies corresponding to the residues of cetuximab described herein, such as those within the cetux \u00ad imab meditope-binding site. In some embodiments, residues in the template antibody corresponding to light chain residues 9,10,39,40,41,42,43,83, 85,100, and/or 104, and/or heavy chain residues 40, 89, and/or 105, are replaced, for example, with amino acids present at those positions within cetuximab. [0227] In one embodiment, the one or more residues replaced are light chain framework residues including, but not limited to, 40, 41, 83 and 85, according to Rabat numbering. In one embodiment, light chain residue 40 is replaced with threonine; light chain residue 41 is replaced with asparagine, light chain residue 83 is replaced with isoleucine or valine, and/or light chain residue 85 is replaced with aspartate. In a particular example, light chain framework Pro40 is replaced with Thr (P40T) or Ser (P40S), light chain framework Gly41 is replaced with Asn (G41N), light chain framework residue Phe83 is replaced with He (F83I) or Val (F83V) and light chain framework residue Thr85 is replaced with Asp (T85D) or Asn (T85N). [0228] Thus, among the provided meditope-enabled anti\u00ad bodies are antibodies having one or more modifications, typi\u00ad cally amino acid substitutions, at residues that correspond to positions within the meditope binding site of cetuximab or other meditope-enabled antibody, such as those described herein, including meditope-enabled trastuzumab and medi \u00ad tope-enabled M5A. Among the antibodies are those having a VL region with a threonine, serine, or aspartate at position 40, a residue other than glycine at position 41, and an aspartate or asparagine at position 85, according to Rabat numbering, for example, an antibody with a VL region having a threonine at position 40, an asparagine at position 41, and an aspartate at position 85. In some embodiments, the antibody has a VH region with a serine at position 40 and an isoleucine at posi\u00ad tion 89 and/or a VH region with a serine or proline at position US 2012/0301400 Al 17Nov. 29, 40 and an isoleucine, tyrosine, methionine, phenylalanine, or tryptophan at position 89, according to Kabat numbering. In some embodiments, the VL region has an isoleucine or leu\u00ad cine at position 10, and/or an isoleucine at position 83. In some embodiments, the VL region has a valine or isoleucine at position 9 and/or a residue other than glutamine at position 100 . [0229] In some examples, the VL region has a valine or isoleucine at position 9, an isoleucine or leucine at position 10, an arginine at position 39, a threonine at position 40, an asparagine at position 41, a glycine at position 42, a serine at position 43, an isoleucine at position 83, an aspartate at posi\u00ad tion 85, and an alanine at position 100; and the VHregionhas a serine at position 40 and an isoleucine at position 89, according to Kabat numbering. [0230] In some examples, the VL region does not contain a proline at position 40, a glycine at position 41, or a threonine at position 85, according to Kabat numbering, and/or the VH region does not contain an asparagine or alanine at position 40 or a valine at position 89, according to Kabat numbering. In some examples, the VL region does not contain an serine at position 10, a proline at position 40, a glycine at position 41, an phenylalanine at position 83, or a threonine at position 85, according to Kabat numbering, and/or the VH region does not contain an asparagine or alanine at position 40 or a valine at position 89, according to Kabat numbering. [0231] In some aspects, the antibody has a light chain hav\u00ad ing P8, V9 the meditope-enabled anti\u00ad bodies are generated via CDR grafting, typically by modify \u00ad ing one or more complementarity determining region (CDR) (e.g., one or more of CDRs 1-3) of the heavy and/or light chain of a meditope-enabled antibody, such as any of the meditope-enabled antibodies described herein, to replace them with other CDRs , such as CDRs of existing or new antibodies. CDR grafting is standard practice for producing humanized monoclonal antibodies, e.g., by grafting CDRs of an antibody generated in a non-human species, such as mouse, onto a human antibody framework. See U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,558,864 and 8,133,982; Kettleborough et ah, \"Humaniza \u00ad tion of a mouse monoclonal antibody by CDR-grafting: the importance of framework residues on loop conformation, \" Protein Eng., 4:773-783 (1991). Thus, in certain embodi \u00ad ments, the antigen specificity of a meditope-enabled antibody is altered by grafting the CDRs of preexisting or newly- generated antibodies of interest. Also among the provided meditope-enabled antibodies are such CDR-grafted medi \u00ad tope-enabled antibodies. [0233] In some embodiments, the meditope-enabled anti\u00ad bodies are generated, using one of the antibodies herein (e.g., cetuximab, meditope-enabled trastuzumab, or meditope-enabled M5A (anti-CEA) antibody) as a template sequence, and carrying out one or more known antibody engineering methods to alter it, for example, to alter its anti- gen-binding characteristics, producing a meditope-enabled antibody with distinct characteristics. Known antibody engi\u00adneering methods typically employed to alter antigen binding and other properties include various in vitro randomization, affinity maturation, and selection methods, including error- prone PCR, spiked PCR, site-directed mutagenesis, phage display and other selection methods. Also provided are con\u00ad structs, libraries, and expression systems, including GPI- linked expression systems, for carrying out such methods. [0234] Thus, in certain embodiments, the provided medi \u00ad tope-enabled antibody has a light chain and/or heavy chain variable region with the framework region or regions (FRs) of a meditope-enabled antibody, such as cetuximab, a meditope- enabled trastuzumab, or a meditope-enabled M5A (or FR(s) with at least at or about 75, 80, 85, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, or 99% identify to the FR(s) of such an antibody). In some aspects, such an antibody has one or more CDRs that are distinct from the CDRs of that meditope-enabled anti\u00ad body. [0235] For example, in some embodiments, the VL region has an amino acid sequence comprising a light chain frame \u00ad work region (FR) I (FR-L1), an FR-L2, an FR-L3, and/or an FR-L4 of the light chain sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 71 (or an FR-Ll , FR-L2, FR-L3, and/or FR-L4 that is at least at or about 75, 80, 85, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, or99% identical to the FR-Ll , FR-L2, FR-L3, and/or FR-L4 of SEQ ID NO: 71), and in some aspects at least one CDR that is distinct from the CDRs of the light chain sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 71; and/or a VH region with an amino acid sequence having a heavy chain FRl (FR-H1), an FR-H2, an FR-H3, and/or an FR-H4, of the heavy chain sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 72 (or an FR-Hl , FR-H2, FR-H3, and/or FR-H4 that is at least at or about 75, 80, 85, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, or 99% identical to the FR-Hl , FR-H2, FR-H3, and/or FR-H4 of SEQ ID NO: 72), and in some aspects at least one CDR that is distinct from the CDRs of the heavy chain sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 72. [0236] In some embodiments, the VL region has an amino acid sequence comprising a light chain framework region (FR) I (FR-L1), an FR-L2, an FR-L3, and/or an FR-L4 ofthe light chain sequence set forth in SEQ ID 9 (or an FR-Ll , FR-L2, FR-L3, and/or FR-L4 that is at least at or about 75,80, 85, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, or 99% identical to the FR-Ll , FR-L2, FR-L3, and/or FR-L4 of SEQ ID NO: 9), and in some aspects at least one CDR that is distinct from the CDRs of the light chain sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 9; and/or a VH region with an amino acid sequence having a heavy chain FRl (FR-H1), an FR-H2, an FR-H3, and/or an FR-H4, of the heavy chain sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 6 (or an FR-Hl , FR-H2, FR-H3, and/or FR-H4 SEQ ID NO: 6), and in some aspects at least one CDR that is distinct from the CDRs of the heavy chain sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 6. [0237] In some embodiments, the VL region has an amino acid sequence comprising a light chain framework region (FR) I (FR-L1), an FR-L2, an FR-L3, and/or an FR-L4 ofthe light chain sequence forth SEQ ID NO: 68 (oranFR-Ll, FR-L2, FR-L3, and/or FR-L4 that is at least at or about 75,80, 85, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, or 99% identical to the FR-Ll , FR-L2, FR-L3, and/or FR-L4 of SEQ ID NO: 68), and in some aspects at least one CDR that is distinct from the CDRs of the light chain sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 68; and/or a VH region with an amino acid sequence having a heavy chain FRl (FR-H1), an FR-H2, an FR-H3, and/or an US 2012/0301400 Al 18Nov. 29, 2012 FR-H4, of the heavy chain sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 70 (oranFR-Hl, FR-H2, FR-H3, and/or FR-H4 at at or about 75,80,85, 90,91,92,93, 94,95,96, 97, 98, or99% identical FR-H3, and/or FR-H4 of SEQ ID NO: 70), and in some aspects at least one CDR that is distinct from the CDRs of the heavy chain sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 70. [0238] In some embodiments, the VL region has an amino acid sequence comprising a light chain framework region (FR) I (FR-L1), anFR-L2, anFR-L3, and/or an FR-L4 ofthe light SEQ ID NO: 61 (oranFR-Ll, FR-L2, FR-L3, and/or FR-L4 that is at least at or about 75, 80, 85, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, or 99% identical to the FR-Ll , FR-L2, FR-L3, and/or FR-L4 of SEQ ID NO: 61), and in some aspects at least one CDR that is distinct from the CDRs of the light chain sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 61; and/or a VH region with an amino acid sequence having a heavy chain FRl (FR-H1), an FR-H2, an FR-H3, and/or an FR-H4, of the heavy chain sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 63 (or an FR-Hl , FR-H2, FR-H3, and/or FR-H4 is at or about 75,80,85, 90,91,92,93, 94,95,96, 97, 98, or99% identical FR-H3, and/or FR-H4 of SEQ ID NO: 63), and in some aspects at least one CDR that is distinct from the CDRs of the heavy chain sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 63. [0239] In some embodiments, the meditope-enabled anti\u00ad body has one or more CDRs distinct from the CDRs set forth in SEQ ID NO: 6,7,9,10,12,14,61,63,68, 69,70,71, and/or 72. [0240] In some embodiments, the meditope is an antibody other than cetuximab, does not specifically bind to an EGFR, binds to an antigen other than EGFR, and/or does not specifi \u00ad cally bind to the epitope on EGFR that is specifically bound by cetuximab. [0241] In some examples, the meditope-enabled antibody is generated based on a template antibody that is selected from antibodies having the CDRs and/or anti- gen-binding regions thereof, and/or antibodies that compete for binding with such antibodies; and/or antibodies having a sequence set forth in any of SEQ ID NOs: 78-124, and/or 125-170, fragments thereof antibodies having the CDRs and/or antigen-binding regions thereof, and/or antibodies that compete for binding with such antibodies. [0242] Table 2 lists CAS\u00ae Registry Numbers (see www. cas.org/expertise/cascontent/registry/regsys.html) for certain antibodies. TABLE 2 Antibody 10B5, and brodalumab, or tiuzetan. In some such examples, the one or more CDRs are CDRs present in these template antibodies, and/or the anti\u00ad bodies specifically bind to the same antigen or epitope as such antibodies, and/or compete for binding with such antibodies to their antigens. [0244] Thus, in some cases, the meditope-enabled antibod \u00ad ies (including fragments thereof) specifically binds to an anti\u00ad gen selected from the group consisting of: RANK ligand, a complement protein, e.g., C5, EpCAM, CDl la, e.g., human CDl la, an integrin, e.g., alpha-v beta-3 integrin, neu, CD3, CDl 5, CD20 (small IgE, e.g., IgE Fe region, an RSV antigen, e.g., fusion protein factor recep CD47, and CD137. In some examples, the meditope-enabled antigen binds to another antigen identified as a target in a disease or condition of interest, such as cancer or other disease. [0245] The meditope-enabled antibodies generally further include a constant region, typically a heavy and light chain constant region, which generally are human or partially human constant regions. In some aspects, the heavy chain constant region includes a CHl , or a portion thereof. In some aspects, the light chain constant region includes a CL, or a portion thereof. In some embodiments, the portion of the constant region is sufficient to render the antibody capable of binding to the meditope, e.g., with the requisite binding affin \u00ad ity. In some aspects, the constant regions are the constant regions of cetuximab or trastuzumab. Thus, in some aspects, the heavy chain constant regions are one or more human IgGl constant regions; in some aspects, the light chain constant regions are kappa constant chain regions. In other examples, the constant regions can include those of other isotypes, including human (or other organism, e.g., or IgM, and can include kappa or lambda constant regions. Thus, among the provided meditope-enabled antibodies are those gener \u00ad ated by mutation of residues in other IgGs, such as human, murine, or chicken, or other immunoglobulins. In other words, the meditope-enabling methods provided herein may be used for any antibody, including IgA, IgE, IgD, and IgM and from any organism that produces antibodies including but not limited to chicken, murine, rat, bovine, rabbit, primates, and goat. [0246] For example, the sequences of the first constant region (CHl) of a human IgGl, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4, are compared in FIG. 55A. FIG. 55B shows the sequence differ \u00ad ences in the IgG2-4 CHI, compared to the IgGl CHI, mapped onto the co-crystal structure of cetuximab and the cQFD meditope (meditope I, SEQ ID NO: I). As shown in the Figure, the residues that are different among these iso\u00ad types are not within the meditope-binding region of cetux \u00ad imab, confirming that the meditope-enabling technology is applicable to isotypes other than the IgGl of cetuximab. As another example, the sequence and structural alignment of an IgGl and an IgE Fab domain indicates residues on the IgE near the meditope binding site (FIG. 26). [0247] The provided methods for meditope-site grafting of the Fab cavity within monoclonal antibodies can be used to create a unique handle for meditope binding and used with the technology previously disclosed and for newly-generated antibodies . In certain embodiments, the meditope binding site can be created on pre-existing and all future monoclonal antibodies. [0248] As described below in section F, also provided are methods for modifying the meditope-enabled antibodies, for example, to alter various properties of the meditope-enabled antibodies, including aspects of the interaction with the medi- topes, including affinity, avidity, pH-dependence, as well pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharma \u00ad codynamics (PD) of the antibodies. Thus, also among the provided meditope-enabled antibodies are those modified antibodies generated according to those methods, e.g., by generating a pharmacophore binding model, including anti\u00ad bodies having any one or more of the modifications described in section F, below. [0249] Also among the antibodies used as template anti\u00ad bodies to generate the meditope-enabled antibodies are modi \u00ad US 2012/0301400 Al 20Nov. 29, 2012 fied antibodies and portions thereof, such as a CovX-Body. Thus, among the provided meditope-enabled antibodies are CovX -bodies, modified to allow their binding to one or more of the provided meditopes, e.g., with an affinity as described herein. [0250] Also provided are complexes containing one or more meditope bound to a meditope-enabled antibody, such as any of the antibodies described herein. [0251] Also provided are nucleic acids, such as cDNA and RNA molecules, encoding the meditope-enabled antibodies, and vectors and libraries containing the same, as well as methods for their use, including selection and expression methods and methods for generating transgenic animals using such constructs. D. Meditopes [0252] Also provided are meditopes, including variant, modified, and multivalent meditopes, that bind to meditope- enabled antibodies, and complexes and compositions con\u00ad taining the same, and methods and uses thereof. In certain embodiments, the meditopes include meditopes I and 2 NO: I) and cQYN (SEQ ID NO: 2)), which were originally identified as candidate peptides for binding to the CDR region of cetuximab, as described by Riemer, herein, and cQYN meditopes bind to sites within cetuximab distinct from the cetuximab CDRs, and thus were not likely candidates for specific cetuximab-like antibody immunogens for use as a vaccine. [0253] Nucleic encoding the meditopes, including meditopes, as well as vec\u00ad tors, cells, libraries, and other systems containing the same, also are provided. [0254] I. Variant Meditopes [0255] Among the provided meditopes are meditope vari\u00ad ants (also called variant meditopes), having one or more modifications, e.g., structural modifications, as compared to meditope I or 2 (meditope of SEQ ID NO: I or 2), and methods for producing the same. In some embodiments, cQFD and cQYN meditopes are used as starting points in the design of meditope variants. In some aspects, the meditope variants are designed to have altered properties, such as increased or altered affinity, altered pH dependence, or dif\u00ad ferent affinities under different physiological conditions for one or more of the provided meditope-enabled antibodies, including cetuximab and other antibodies described herein, e.g., as compared to the unmodified meditopes, cQFD and cQYN. Meditope variants are designed various chemical and biophysical methods. [0256] Meditope variants include, but are not limited to, variants incorporating modifications to meditopes, e.g.,cQFD and cQYN and others described herein. Suitable modi \u00ad fications include, are not limited to, any peptide modifi \u00ad cation known in the art, such as, but not limited to, modifica \u00ad tions to the manner and/or position of peptide cyclization, modifications to one or more amino acid components of the cyclic peptide, or adding or deleting one or more amino acid from the cyclic peptide. In a particular example, cQFD may be altered with one or more of the following modifications: a modification of Arg8, a modification of Phe3, a modification of Leu5, a modification of Leul 0, change to the mode of peptide cyclization, and/or an incorporation of hydratable carbonyl functionality at one or more positions, and one or more amino acid deletions or additions. In the case of cQYN, suitable modifications may include one or more of the fol\u00ad lowing: a modification of Arg8, a modification of Leu5, a modification of Leul 0, change to the mode of peptide cyclization, and/or an incorporation of hydratable carbonyl functionality at one or more positions, and one or more dele\u00ad tions or additions. Certain amino acid positions within the meditope may be deleted or replaced with a different natural amino acid or an unnatural amino acid, or the meditope may be chemically conjugated with a fragment. It is shown herein that a meditope in which Arg9 of SEQ ID NO: I has been mutated to citrulline binds to cetuximab. In addition, the amino and carboxy termini can be extended with further amino acids beyond (Te., in addition to) the cyclic portion of the meditope variant in order to make additional contact to the Fab. For example, Protein L has been added to the C-terminus of the cQFD meditope and preliminary data shows that this binds with much higher affinity. Such modifications are dis\u00ad cussed further in Examples 6 and 7. [0257] In some embodiments, the meditopes include those listed in Tables 3 and 4, as well as such meditopes with additional amino acids, such as those up to 16 amino acids in length. For example, in some aspects, the meditope is one of meditopes I, 2, or 15-55, further including a serine before the first residues, i.e., at position zero. The meditopes listed in Table 3 employ a disulfide linkage to connect the C and N termini (except that meditope 31 contained an additional tail, meaning that the disulfide linkage is not between the two terminal residues); for the peptides in Table 4, a lactam bridge, a linkage other than disulfide (such as [3+2] cycload \u00ad dition), or no linkage is used (e.g., an acyclic or linear vari\u00ad ant). Additional meditopes that may be used according to the embodiments described herein include any meditope as defined herein peptide that binds to an antibody framework binding interface (i.e., between the Fab light and heavy chains) of cetuximab or any other therapeutic antibody. For example, in addition to the cyclic peptides cQFD and cQYN, some embodiments include one or more variants of cQFD and cQYN. TABLE 3 SEQ ID Meditope NO Number Sequence Modification (red) Linkage method 1 I C-QFDLSTRRLK-C original I-Cys ID NOMeditope 3232Qi-QFDLSTRRLK-Qi G variants typically have an amino acid sequence length of between 5 and 16 amino acids, e.g., 5, 6, 7,8, 9,10, 11,12,13,14,15, or 16 amino acids in length, such as between 8 and 13 amino acids in length, e.g., between 9 and 12 amino acids in length. The meditope can additionally be conjugated to or associated with (e.g., as part of a fusion protein or peptide) with another molecule, such as another peptide, including a linker or agent. Thus, in this case, the compound containing the meditope may contain additional amino acid residues beyond the lengths described in this paragraph, where the meditope portion contains between 5 and 16 amino acids and the complex or compound contains additional amino acids. Examples are described herein, e.g., SEQ ID NO: 31 above. [0259] In some embodiments, the variant meditopes are cyclic peptides. In other embodiments, they are linear or acyclic peptides. [0260] The meditopes can include peptides, or cyclic pep\u00ad tides derived from such peptides, for example, where the peptides have the formula: X1-X2-X3-X4-X5-X6-X7-X8-X9-X10-X11-X12 (Formula I), [0261] isoaspartic or null. [0274] In some aspects, the modified Arg has a structure of the formula shown in FIG. 34. In some aspects, the modified Phe is a Phe with one or more halogen incorporated into the phenyl ring. In some aspects, formula I is not SEQ ID NO: I or SEQ ID NO: 2. US 2012/0301400 Al 23Nov. 29, 2012 [0275] In some embodiments, the meditopes are peptides having the structure of Formula (X): R>\u00b0 NH wherein: [0276] the center marked \"R\" or \"S\" configuration; [0277] R3 and R3 are each, independently, H or phenyl, optionally substituted with one, two, or three substituents with one or more substituents selected from the group consisting group substituted with: [0281] a) one or two phenyl groups, wherein each phenyl is optionally substituted with one, two, or three substituents independently selected from \u2014OH, fluoro, 1^alkyl optionally substituted with one or more substituents selected from con\u00ad alkyl, one or more substitu \u00ad from the one or more substitu \u00ad ents selected with one or more substituents selected from the group consisting a C1^alkyl group substituted with one or two phenyl groups, or one naphthyl, imidazole, or indole group, wherein each phenyl is optionally substituted with one, two, or three substituents selected from \u2014OH, fluoro, Oor I; [0303] X is C1^alkylene C2_8alkenylene, each with \u2014CO2H, \u2014NH2, or \u2014NHC(O)R y; [0304] wherein carbon of is optionally replaced with \u2014C(O)NH \u2014, a \u2014NH2; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. [0307] In some cases, such meditopes are not SEQ ID NO: I or 2, or are not cyclic peptides derived from such sequences, and/or are not meditope I or 2. [0308] In some embodiments of the meditope of Formula (X), m is 0, I, or 2. In other embodiments, R3 is H or phenyl and R 3 3-bromophenyl, \u2014B(OH) 2, \u2014CO2H, or \u2014CONH 2 group, or with one or two phenyl groups each optionally substituted with a bromo is H or methyl, Rrf is H or C1^alkyl, and Re is C1^alkyl, or \u2014NH (C1^alkyl). In other R9 is ethyl, Al optionally \u2014CONH 2, -CH 2, or Based on the structural and thermodynamic data, multiple positions within the meditopes I and 2 described herein have been identified as target sites for modification, e.g., with different natural or non-natural amino acids, to enhance the overall binding affinity and/or to alter another property as described herein. Suchmodifications include, but are not limited to, modification of cQFD or cQYN to generate a head-to-tail cyclic lactam peptide, modification of Arg8, modification of position 3 (e.g., Phe3 of cQFD or variant thereof), modification of Leu5, modification of LeulO, and/or incorporation of hydratable carbonyl functionality (see FIG. 31). As demonstrated herein, mutation of each of Phe3, Leu5, and Arg8 to alanine in the original meditope of cQFD reduced the affinity of the resulting compounds for the meditope- enabled antibody binding interface by IO-140-fold. In some aspects, the variant meditopes include those having modifi \u00ad cations at one or more of position 1,3,5,8,10, and 12 of the meditope of SEQ ID NO: I or 2, or other meditope listed in Table 3 or 4. [0311] Position 8 [0312] In some embodiments, the meditope variants con\u00ad tain a modification in the position corresponding to position 8 (Arg8) of meditope I or 2. In the unmodified meditope (cQFD; SEQ ID NO: I), Arg8 is extended, making a hydro \u00ad gen bond with the heavy chain carbonyl of Q105 of the meditope-enabled antibody heavy chain. The immediate area about this residue is hydrophobic yet solvent exposed (FIG. 33A). In some aspects, the meditopes contain a modified residue at this position (e.g., modified Arg8). In some examples, the modified residue maintains the iminium func \u00ad tionality of the Arg8 residue useful for and introduces a substituted or unsub \u00ad stituted hydrophobic arm to fill the cavity. Such modifications result in significant gains in binding, due to entropic increases, as supported by ligand docking calculations. Such modifications may be incorporated by using an N-alkyl guanidinium group, or an alkyl-amidine functionality. In either case, the substituted group of the terminal N-atom can be alkyl or aryl, wherein each position of the alkyl or aryl group may be optionally substituted with additional function \u00ad alities within the group including the terminal position. In one example, a modified Arginine (modified Arg8), having a structure as shown in FIG. 34, is substituted for Arg8 of the meditope, e.g., of SEQ ID NO: I or 2 with the butyl group on the NH2 (shown in FIG. 34 as NHR). In some aspects, the variant meditope contains an n-butyl-arginine or butylami- dine modification at position 8. [0313] Position [0314] In some embodiments, the meditope variants con\u00ad tain a modification in the position corresponding to position 3, such as Phe3 of meditope I. As shown herein with struc cQYN (SEQ ID NO: 2) has an alteration in the extended conformation of the Arg8 side chain as compared to cQFD (SEQ ID NO: I) (see FIGS. 30C and 35). Data herein suggest the formation of a favorable hydrogen bond network, with water bound to the Fab. Enthalpy-driven optimization has proven successful in many small-molecule approaches in drug design and there are opportunities in the provided medi \u00ad topes for engineering increases in entropy. In some embodi \u00ad ments, approaches resulting in enthalpic and/or entropic gains in meditope designs are used to generate the variant meditopes, e.g., to optimize binding. [0315] For example, when bound to a meditope-enabled antibody, the hydrophobic phenyl ring of Phe3 is surrounded by a fairly polar array of side chain residues of the meditope- enabled antibody Fab (FIG. 35). In some embodiments, one or more halogens is introduced on the phenyl ring of this residue, to allow for a halogen bonding interaction with the polar side chain residues. A halogen bond is a relatively strong non-covalent bond, similar to a hydrogen bond but involving the interaction of a halogen such as bromine or chlorine (or other halogen), with an oxygen atom. In some aspects, the residue at this position is modified to incorporate a halogen substituent. In some aspects, Phe3 is replaced with 2-bromo-, 3-bromo-, or 4-bromophenylalanine, in order to place a bromine atom in a position suitable for halogen bond \u00ad ing with a meditope-enabled antibody, e.g., at positions Tyr87 (light chain), Gln38, and/or Tyr91 (heavy chain) of a medi \u00ad tope-enabled antibody, respectively. Such phenylalanine derivatives are commercially available and in some aspects are incorporated into the cyclic peptide meditope variant by solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) Exemplary variant meditopes include those containing 2-bromo-L-phenylala- nine, 3-bromo-L-phenylalanine, or 4-bromo-L-phenylala- nine in the position corresponding to Phe3 of meditope I. [0316] In another example, the meditope incorporates an additional phenyl group at this position, for example, by replacing Phe3 with ,'-diphenylalanine. [0317] Positions 5 and 10 (e.g., Leu5, LeulO of Meditopes I or the meditope variants con\u00ad tain a modification in the position corresponding to position 5 or 10 (Leu5 or LeulO) of meditopes I or 2. As shown herein, the side chains of Leu5 and LeulO of meditope I make hydro- phobic contacts to the meditope-enabled Fab, cetuximab (see FIG. 36, right panel; LeulO). In certain embodiments, one or more properties of the meditopes, e.g., affinity, are altered by incorporating a different natural amino acid, or a non-natural amino acid at one or both of these positions, e.g., thereby changing the amount of surface area that can be extended. In one embodiment, natural amino acids (Phe/Tyr/Trp) and non\u00ad natural analogs (e.g., ,'-diphenyl-L-alanine, or amino acids incorporating side chains that include branched alkyl, extended aromatics such as napthyl, or other hydrophobic groups) are systematically introduced via SPPS at one or both positions. [0319] \"Hydratable \" Functionality [0320] In certain embodiments, one or more Fab hydroxyl \u00ad bearing side chains surrounding the meditope-binding site of a meditope-enabled antibody is/are exploited through selec \u00ad tive trapping, by formation of a covalent bond with a medi \u00ad tope that incorporates a hydratable functionality. Thus, in some embodiments, the meditope contains one or more resi\u00ad dues with hydratable substituents, e.g., in order to create a highly selective but irreversible interaction with a meditope- US 2012/0301400 Al 25Nov. 29, 2012 enabled antibody or other substance. For example, Arg8 of the meditope I extends in proximity to Ser43 of the light chain (3.5 A) and Tyr91 (3.8 A) of the meditope-enabled antibody heavy chain, according to Kabat numbering (FIG. 36, left panel). Incorporation of a hydratable functionality at the end of Arg8 or LeulO of the meditope would allow for selective formation of a serine or tyrosine hemi-acetal. Such a covalent adduct would essentially afford irreversible bind \u00ad ing. In addition, residues containing boronic acid may also be integrated into the meditope as a hydratable group. Boronic acid plays an important role in the structural activity of bortezamib (Velcade\u00ae), which is used to treat multiple myeloma. Further representative examples of hydratable resi\u00ad dues are also shown in FIG. 34, where R=\u2014CFi2CFiO or \u2014CFi2B(OFi) 2. In some examples, such variants are prepared by incorporating residues containing such groups using SPPS. [0321] Such hydratable strategies can be applied to engi\u00ad neering new amino acid residues within the antibody Fab- meditope binding site and introducing the requisite comple \u00ad mentary \"hydratable \" functionalities within different positions of the meditope. A similar strategy can be applied by introducing cysteine residues into the Fab region and use this functionality for nucleophilic attack on a \"hydratable \" functionality such as an electrophilic carbonyl group or derivative thereof contained within the meditope or for mak \u00ad ing selective disulfide bonds (\u2014S\u2014S\u2014) between the Fab region and the meditope containing the requisite thiol or thiol equivalent functionalities. Other embodiments of this idea would include introducing Michael acceptors contained in the meditope such as ,-unsaturated carbonyl functional \u00ad ities. These functionalities are well-known to selectively react with thiols to form stable covalent carbon-sulfur bonds. [0322] Alternative Cyclization Strategies and Replacement of Disulfide Bridge [0323] In certain embodiments, the variant meditopes include a disulfide bridge, as in cQFD and cQYN. Disulfide bridges may be formed by the reaction of the side chains of two cysteine residues. In certain embodiments, the disulfide bridge in a meditope, e.g., meditope I or 2, is replaced with an alternative linkage or is removed. Thus, among the variant meditopes are those having alternative linkages or lacking the disulfide bridge of the original meditopes. [0324] In some aspects, the linkage is made between one or more unnatural amino acids within the amino acid chain. Examples of linkages that may be made with unnatural amino acids include linkages comprising (i) stable hydrazone or oxime-based linkages made by reaction of a residue compris \u00ad ing an aldehyde or ketone with a residue comprising an amine group, where the amine nitrogen is substituted with \u2014NF12 or alkyloxy group (e.g., reaction of a p-acetylphenylalanine, m-acetylphenylalanine, or p-(3-oxobutanoyl)-L-phenylala- nine residue with a p-(2-amino-3-hydroxyethyl)-phenylala- nine residue), (ii) thiol reactive by incorporating phenylse- lenidylalanine, (iii) a p-isopropylthiocarbo- thiazole, thiazoli- dine, or oxazole linkage, made, for example, by reaction of a residue containing an azide group with a residue containing an alkyne group via Fluisgen cycloaddition (e.g., reaction of a p-propargyloxyphenylalanine residue with a p-azidopheny- lalanine residue); (v) an amide bond made by reaction of anacid group in one residue with an amine group in another residue; (vi) an ester bond made by reaction of an acid group in one residue with an alcohol in another residue, such as a serine; (vii) a double bond, made by reaction of two residues each containing a terminal olefin, e.g., by olefin metathesis (e.g., reaction of two allylglycine residues or two N-allyl substituted amino acids), or (viii) by reaction of any other pair of suitable residues known in the art. For a review, see, for example, Davies, J. S., \"The Cyclization of Peptides and Depsipeptides, \" J. Peptide Sci. 2003, 9, 471-501. In one embodiment, the meditope may direct a reactive group to an unnatural amino acid incorporated into the Fab, such as p-acetylphenylalanine. [0325] Various methods for cyclization of a meditope may be used, e.g., to address in vivo stability and to enable chemo selective control for subsequent conjugation chemis \u00ad try. In some embodiments, the cyclization strategy, including head-to-tail (head-tail) cyclization (between of the pep\u00ad tide) and/or lactam linkage between other residues. Lactam formation may also be effected by incorporating residues such as glycine, -Ala, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, and the like, into the acyclic meditope cyclization precursors to produce different lactam ring sizes and modes of connectivity. Addi \u00ad tional cyclization strategies such as \"click \" chemistry and olefin metathesis also can be used (see FIG. 31, right boxes). Such methods of peptide and peptidomimetic cyclization are well known in the art. [0326] In some embodiments, the meditopes containing lactam linkages are more stable, in vivo, e.g., have a linkage that is more stable in vivo compared to meditopes with other linkages. [0327] In some embodiments, the terminal residues of an acyclic peptide are reacted to form a cyclic meditope, meditope variant. In other embodiments, other posi\u00ad tions are amenable to cyclization, including between residues 3 and 11 and 4 and 11. Thus, in some aspects, the meditopes contain a linkage formed between residues other than the N-terminal and C-terminal residues, such as between resi\u00ad dues 3 and 11 and/or 4 and 11, e.g., of a 12-amino acid peptide. [0328] In some embodiments, the meditopes, meditopes, contain a reactive amine functionality (e.g., Lysl I), which can be used for subsequent conjugation of the meditope variant, e.g., to a scaffold or linker or to an agent, such as a diagnostic, e.g., imaging, agent or therapeutic agent as described herein. For example, FIG. 13 shows a procedure for conjugation of a meditope variant with fluorescein for FACS analysis; this strategy can be applied to other imaging and other agents, including DOTA for in vivo PET imaging. [0329] In some embodiments, thiol functionalities can be introduced in any suitable position on the meditope and can be selectively modified using a number of external reagents containing imagining agents, other proteins and peptides, metal chelators, siRNAs, nanoparticles, and cytotoxic drugs. embodiments, the meditopes, such as vari\u00ad ant meditopes, are characterized, for example, by ITC, SPR and/or diffraction and/or other methods, such as those described herein in the Examples. In one example, the syn\u00ad thesis of meditopes and characterization thereof is carried out in an iterative fashion, e.g., such that the meditope variant with the most desirable property, e.g., highest affinity for one US 2012/0301400 Al 26Nov. 29, 2012 or more meditope-enabled antibodies or other desired prop \u00ad erty, such as pH dependence, is subsequently modified to improve the desired property. [0332] In one example, for characterization of binding of meditopes to meditope-enabled antibodies, the meditope is purified to >95% homogeneity and structurally characterized by mass spectrometry. Peptides are dialyzed in water, their concentrations measured by UV-Vis and calibrated with elemental analysis, and diluted (>100 \u2014X) into the appro \u00ad priate buffer. Binding to meditope-enabled antibody is rig\u00ad orously characterized by ITC, SPR, X-ray diffraction, or a combination thereof. ITC measurements may be performed on a TA Instruments nanoITC, with only I -2 mg of peptide per measurement. In one example, for SPR measurements, low density and high density chips are conjugated with a meditope-enabled antibody, e.g., a Fab or a full IgG. In some cases, the chips are first characterized using an antigen, such as a soluble fragment of the entire extracellular domain of EGFR (residues 1-621) in the case of cetuximab. In a study reported herein, the cQFD meditope bound with similar enthalpy and entropy to the cetuximab Fab fragment as com\u00ad pared to the fully intact cetuximab IgG, e.g., as measured by SPR and ITC. Accordingly, binding measurements may be carried out using the full IgG or Fab fragment of cetuximab or other meditope-enabled antibody. In one example, fordiffrac- tion, the co-crystallization conditions of the cetuximab Fab fragment and the meditope of SEQ ID NO: I are well-estab \u00ad lished and diffraction quality crystals are typically obtained in I to 3 days, typically I day. Full data sets are collected in 8 to 12 hours with an in-house source (Rigaku 007-HF and an R-Axis IV++) and in 10 min at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource, which allows for rapid characteriza \u00ad tion of the interactions of the meditope variants with medi \u00ad tope-enabled antibodies. [0333] In some aspects, ITC, SPR and X-ray diffraction data, e.g., collectively, provide atomic detail to guide subse \u00ad quent chemical modifications and ultimately improve the affinity of the meditopes and/or make other alterations to the meditopes. A calculation based on AG==-RT In Ka shows that the difference between micromolar and nanomolar affin \u00ad ity of a meditope for cetuximab results from a change in free energy at 300 K of -4 kCal/mol, which is on the order of a strong hydrogen bond. Thus, the loss of an ordered water molecule from a protein binding pocket or the reorientation of an amino acid residue-chain may be sufficient to alter binding by orders of magnitude. [0334] In some examples, other approaches are used to alter properties of the meditopes, e.g., to improve the affinity of the meditope-Fab interaction. In one example, structural data, such as those obtained in the studies described above, may be used to replace residues in the Fab, by mutagenesis, for example, to add additional hydrogen bonds, substitute amino acids for unnatural amino acids or alter the hydrophobic interface, for example, in ways that might better complement meditope binding. In some examples, fluorescence polariza \u00ad tion assays are used to identify meditope that can displace a given meditope, such as SEQ ID NO: I. In other examples, the same technique is used to identify small mol\u00ad ecules that can displace the meditope and then use these small molecules as templates to further improve the binding affinity of the meditopes. [0335] In some examples, the meditope variants are designed based on pH dependence, e.g., to have differing affinities at different pH conditions. Thus, in certain embodi \u00adments, the meMAb-meditope interaction is tailored with respect to pH. Examples of such meditopes are described herein. In some aspects, the binding affinities of the meditope variants are measured as a function of buffer pH. For example, variant meditopes include meditopes with a binding affinity for one or more meditope-enabled antibody or frag\u00ad ment that is decreased at a lysosomal pH level or is increased in a hypoxic environment. For example, provided are variant meditopes that exhibit higher binding affinity for a meditope- enabled antibody at a neutral pH (e.g., pH 7-8, e.g., pH 7.3-7.5) and exhibit a relatively lower binding affinity for the antibody at a more acidic pH, such as a pH between at or about 4 and 6.5, e.g., at an endosomal pH (e.g., between at or about 5 and at or about 6.5) or at a lysosomal pH (e.g., between at or about 4.5 and at or about 5). See FIG. 27, showing several examples. In another example, the meditopes have increased binding affinity for the antibody in a hypoxic environment, such as a tumor environment, for example, as compared to the affinity observed under other physiological conditions, such as in the blood. In some embodiments, modification of medi \u00ad tope variants or meditope \"analogs \" for the specific release at low pHs (e.g., in lysosomes for drug delivery) is provided; and modification of meditopes so that they bind with higher affinity in a hypoxic environment (e.g., tumor stroma pH is often lower than normal tissues). Also provided are methods for generating such meditope variants. [0336] According to some embodiments, the meditope binding site may be exploited or optimized to enhance bind \u00ad ing of, purification of, and/or imaging or other method using the meditope-enabled antibodies and functional fragments thereof. In a separate embodiment, a meditope may contain one or more cysteine residue that binds to one or more engi\u00ad neered cysteine in the Fab at the meditope binding site (e.g., ThioMAbs). The meditope is thereby conjugated to any diag\u00ad nostic and/or therapeutic substance, molecule or compound. For example, the substance may be a small molecule diag\u00ad nostic molecule, such as a marker. The \"Cys meditope \" directs the conjugate to the antibody and binds via a covalent linkage. Alternatively, the meditope may be conjugated to the Fab to one or more unnatural amino acids that are incorpo \u00ad rated into the meditope binding site. [0337] II. [0338] Also among provided meditopes multivalent meditopes. In certain aspects, conjugation of a meditope, to a linker or scaffold (e.g., to form a multivalent tethering entity), significantly improves overall affinity for and targeting to a meditope-enabled mAb bound to an antigen, e.g., a tumor- associated antigen. [0339] Full-length monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and F(Ab)' 2 fragments include two Fab domains (in the case of full-length mAbs, coupled to a dimeric Fe). Such bivalent antibodies (e.g., IgGs) preferentially bind to cells expressing antigen at high densities. Combinations of monoclonal anti\u00ad bodies (mAbs) that recognize unique epitopes on the same antigen can produce synergistic effects, including enhance \u00ad ment of various antibody effector functions (e.g., ADCC, complement-dependent lysis, signaling inhibition), enhance \u00ad ment of cell death, and in the case of cancer-targeting anti\u00ad bodies, enhancement of tumor growth inhibition. See, for example, Dechant M et ah, \"Complement-dependent tumor cell lysis triggered by combinations of epidermal growth factor receptor antibodies, \" Cancer Res, 2008 Jul. I; 68(13): 4998-5003; Scheuer W et ah, \"Strongly and pertuzumab combination treat \u00ad US 2012/0301400 Al 27Nov. 29, 2012 ment on HER2-positive human xenograft tumor models, \" Cancer Res, 2009 Dec. 15; 69(24):9330-6; Cardarelli P M et al., \"Binding to CD20 by anti-Bl antibody or F(ab')(2) is 51(1):15-24. Epub 2001 Dec. 18. While the precise mechanism of this enhanced cell death remains debated, studies indicate that both mAbs should be multivalent (e.g., full antibodies or F(ab)' 2) to achieve enhanced effects, suggesting that the second bivalent mAh (which binds to a unique epitope on the same antigen) can cluster cell surface antigens and act more efficiently, e.g., more efficiently kill tumor cells. See FIGS. 8 and 16. [0340] In some embodiments herein, such clustering is meditopes. In some aspects, the multivalent meditope used instead of a second antibody, in some aspects to achieve synergy in combination with a medi- tope-enabled antibody. In some aspects, the multivalent meditopes provide advantages compared to use of a second antibody recognizing a separate epitope. For example, pro\u00ad duction of the multivalent meditopes can be more efficient, and cost-effective when compared to a second antibody. For example, although a number of preclinical/clinical trials are investigating the co-administration of two monoclonal anti\u00ad bodies, the costs of producing and marketing such a thera \u00ad peutic is likely to be prohibitive. In some aspects, the multi \u00ad valent meditopes also are comparatively more easily targeted to disease sites, such as tumors. Given the nature of the meditope binding site (within the meditope binding site, sepa \u00ad rate from the antibody CDRs), and the broadly applicable methods provided herein for meditope-enabling any antibody of choice, the multivalent meditopes also have the advantage of being readily applicable to a large range of therapeutic antibodies, without the need to identify a second antibody or epitope with therapeutically acceptable characteristics. Thus, in some aspects, use of a multivalent meditope avoids the need to identify a second mAh with acceptable characteris \u00ad tics, and the associated and significant cost of its development thereof. [0341] Specificity and affinity are often achieved through multivalency. For a bivalent ligand with a linker, this can be expressed AGftnfer . In other words, Krotoz=Ki *K2/Kftnfer . In the case where the linker makes no contribution to the free energy (Kftnfer-I), the apparent affin \u00ad ity of the bivalent ligand for the bivalent taiget is the product of the monomeric binding constants. Thus, significant gains in affinity can be achieved through multivalency in general (e.g., for a meditope with Kri=I the affinity of a 'theo \u00ad retical' bivalent meditope is I pM). Whilesuchlargegainsare rarely seen in general (primarily due to the geometry of biva- lent/trivalent/multivalent receptors), synergy is observed. The geometry of a cell surface-expressed antigen can place strict constraints on the linker of a multivalent meditope, but can also ensure specificity, which can be an important goal in some contexts, such as for targeted delivery, e.g., by mini \u00ad mizing the risk of off-target effects. [0342] In one example, the multivalent meditope contains an Fe region of an antibody or portion thereof, such as sub\u00ad stantially all of the Fe region. The use of the Fe region to 'dimerize ' ligands is established and described, for example, by Jazayeri J A & Carroll G J., \"Fc-based cytokines : prospects for engineering superior therapeutics, \" BioDrugs, 22(1):1 1- 26 (2008) In some examples, to generate a bivalent meditope, the meditope is fused to an Fe region (e.g., to the N-terminus of the Fe region of an IgG) through a linker, typically apeptide linker, e.g., a flexible peptide linker. In one example, the length of the linker is chosen to roughly match the dis\u00ad tance between the Fabs of an IgG, such as of 17 amino acids in length. In some aspects, the linker contains glycines, serines, and/or a combination thereof. Exemplary \"meditope- Fc\" fusions are shown in FIG. 15 (SEQ ID NO: 3 and 4, respectively). See also FIG. 16. [0343] In some embodiments, the composition of the linker and/or the distance between the Fe and the meditope is sys\u00ad tematically altered, e.g., to optimize affinity and specificity. In one embodiment, each natural or unnatural residue can be substituted at any position within the linker for optimization. In some aspects, the linker is between at or about 2 and 100 residues in length, e.g., at or about 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28, 29, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 125, 150, 175, or 200 residues (amino acids) in length, or more. In one example, such linkers are generated using cur\u00ad rent and future DNA synthesizers, and inserted between the meditope and the Fe regions. The linker may also be 'rigidi- fied ' to limit the radius of gyration and to enhance the affinity and specificity of the Fc-meditope. For example, a coiled coil domain may be placed between the meditope and the Fe (FIG. 18). In other examples, inert protein domains (e.g., immuno \u00ad globulin folds) are substituted for the linker. Multiple immu \u00ad noglobulin folds can be placed between the meditope and the Fe domain. In certain embodiments, the composition of the linker is of human origin to mitigate potential antigenicity. [0344] In some examples, the provided meditopes are teth\u00ad ered to a scaffold to create a multivalent meditope, e.g., for enhanced selectivity \u00ad bound to tumor asso\u00ad ciated antigen to enhance ligand antagonism, alter receptor endocytosis, and/or improve an immune response through ADCC/CDC (see FIG. 8). Thus, in some embodiments, the meditopes are used to tether two or more antibodies or func \u00ad tional fragments thereof. Such meditopes may be part of a multivalent tethering agent, for example, to enhance cancer or tumor therapy and imaging. A multivalent tethering agent may include two or more meditopes coupled through linker (s), such as through a long linker and biotin to streptavidin, to create a one aspect, the tetrameric tethering entity is shown by surface plasmon resonance to have enhanced binding to an antibody as compared to the monovalent peptide, which is consistent with a multivalent interaction. In one example, use of such multivalent meditopes (e.g., tetravalent meditope) produces enhanced binding affinity of the meditope-enabled antibody to the antigen (e.g., in the case of cetuximab, binding affinity for EGFR positive cells), compared to use of the antibody alone or monovalent meditope alone. Such binding affinities can be determined using well-known methods, e.g., by FACS analysis. See FIG. 12. [0346] In some embodiments, to address the receptor con\u00ad straints on the linker, unmodified or modified, e.g., variant, e.g., optimized, meditopes, such as those obtained as described in Example 6, are coupled to a multivalent scaffold, such as by optimizing the linker. In some aspects, the multi \u00ad valent meditope is able to \"latch-on \" to adjacent antibodies, e.g., IgGs, to form a \"daisy-chain \"-like array (see FIG. 8), which can be used, for example, in antibodies targeting tumor US 2012/0301400 Al 28Nov. 29, 2012 antigens, given the high antigen density of tumor cells. While an intramolecular association of a bivalent meditope and anti\u00ad body is possible, the C2 symmetry of the antibody, e.g., IgG, can place severe geometrical constraints on the linker for such an interaction. Thus, in some aspects, the meditope is based on a trivalent or higher valency scaffold, ensuring that more than one antibody would be \"daisy chained \". By including a third meditope arm, the lifetime of the initial encounter of a trivalent meditope to antigen-bound antibody can increase. This, in turn, can increase the probability that an additional arm will bind to a neighboring antigen-bound antibody, thus stabilizing the overall complex. In other embodiments, a mul\u00ad tifunctional meditope may be constructed to simultaneously bind a memab and other targets, such as other B and T-cell surface proteins, such as T cell receptor and costimulatory molecules. In some embodiments, multiple meditope-en- abled antibodies (for example, including one or more modi \u00ad fied meditope-enabled antibodies) having specificities for different meditopes are used together with such different meditopes in such multivalent embodiments. [0347] Various linkers and scaffolds are known in the art and may be used in connection with these embodiments. An exemplary scaffold synthesis scheme is shown in FIG. 13 and discussed in the Examples herein. In some aspects, the use of templates 4 and 5 shown in FIG. 13 allows for the formation of both bi- and trivalent meditopes, respectively. In some embodiments, different length polyethylene glycol (PEG) and/or other linkers are used, for example, to improve or alter binding or other properties. In some aspects, the PEG length is between at or about IOA and at or about 1000 A. The synthetic approach is also amenable to DOTA incorporation for radionuclide imaging. For example, a 30 A PEG bifunc \u00ad tional arm has been incorporated in the synthesis of a FITC- labeled divalent meditope, namely compound 13 (FIG. 13). The distance between the CDR regions within an IgG is -130 A. The length of the PEG linker may be systematically varied to ensure this approach is optimal. End-to-end distances of commercially available PEGs extend to 90 A (Pierce), which would exceed the IgG distance. [0348] In other embodiments, other scaffolds and/or linkers are used, e.g., to generate high affinity multivalent meditopes and/or to create synergy. For example, DNA may be used as a scaffold for the meditopes to create a more rigid scaffold. For example, different scaffolds of biological and chemical origin may also be used to achieve multivalency. This includes, but is not limited to, constructing a bivalent or trivalent scaffold, using et ah, Nature Nanotechnology 4, 245-248 (2009)) and the like. A chemical scaffold may also be created using molecules including, but not limited to, DNA (single strand, duplex, Holliday junctions, aptamers and the like), RNA (single strand, hairpin, stem loop, and acids), DNA/PNA triplexes for rigidity, organic and or inorganic nanoparticles (directly coupled or coupled through organic polymers such as PEG), organic polymers that can form duplexes with them \u00ad selves and/or with DNA or PNA. [0349] Characterization of Multivalent Meditopes [0350] Binding properties of the multivalent meditopes to meditope-enabled antibodies can be characterized by any of a number of known methods, including SPR and !TC, forexample, to ensure that conjugation to the multivalent scaf\u00ad fold does not affect the meditope-Ig interaction. In some cases, such measurements can be limited in their ability to determine mutlivalency and synergistic effects, given that these approaches generally do not involve antigen present on a cell surface (such as on the surface of a tumor cell). Thus, in some aspects, FACS analysis and/or cell viability assays are used to quantify the effect of the multivalent meditope directly on cells expressing antigen recognized by the medi \u00ad tope-enabled antibody (e.g., cells that overexpress EGFR in the context of cetuximab). Exemplary protocols are described in Example 7. In general, a cell line expressing (e.g., over\u00ad expressing) the antigen recognized by the meditope-enabled antibody is incubated with the meditope-enabled antibody under conditions whereby the antibody binds to the antigen expressed on the cells. In some cases, varying concentrations of the antibody are used. Either simultaneously or subse \u00ad quently, the cells are incubated with the multivalent medi \u00ad tope, in some cases in varying concentrations. Appropriate incubation times and washes are carried out. A second anti\u00ad body and monovalent meditopes may be used as positive and negative controls, respectively. The antibodies and meditopes may be labeled with agents detectable by flow cytometry or microscopy, which are well known. In some examples, a shift (in the case of FACS) or increased signal in the presence of multivalent meditope, compared to monovalent meditope, indicates a synergistic or additive effect. In another example, to further confirm the additive effects of the multivalent medi \u00ad tope, the meditope is used in a com\u00ad petition assay, to determine whether it can compete with the labeled multivalent meditope for the antigen-bound medi \u00ad tope-enabled antibody. [0351] In other examples, cell viability assays are used to determine the ability of a multivalent meditope to enhance cell-killing effects of a meditope-enabled antibody. For example, a cell expressing the antigen of interest may be incubated with varying concentrations of the meditope-en \u00ad abled antibody and/or multivalent meditope. Monovalent meditopes and second antibodies again are useful as controls. In some examples, MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5- diphenyltetrazolium bromide), is used to quantify the number or percentage of viable cells. Other approaches for measuring cell viability, proliferation, and/or death are known in the art and may be used. [0352] In another example, for multivalent meditopes that demonstrate activity in such assays, Western blot analysis or other biochemical or signaling approach is performed to investigate inhibition of signaling associated with a particular antigen, such as a cell surface receptor (e.g., in the case of cetuximab, to follow the phosphorylation status of EGFR, AKT, MAP which are part of the EGFR signaling pathway). Data from such studies may be compared with data from cells treated only with meditope-enabled antibody (i.e., without meditope), with monovalent meditopes, and/or with tyrosine kinase or other known inhibitors (AG1478, etc.). In some examples, an increase in cell death as a function of multiva \u00ad lent meditope concentration is observed, demonstrating syn\u00ad ergistic cell killing effects of the multivalent meditopes. [0353] III. Fusion Proteins [0354] Also provided are fusion proteins containing one or more meditopes. As demonstrated herein by diffraction on the meditope-enabled Fab fragment bound to a cQFD meditope (meditope I), the N- and C-termini of that antibody-bound meditope were shown to be juxtaposed to the location of US 2012/0301400 Al 29Nov. 29, 2012 bound Protein L, a bacterial protein that binds to human antibodies, including IgMs, IgDs, IgGs, IgEs, and IgAs. In meditope-Protein L fusion proteins (MPLs) . In some aspects, the Protein L-meditope fusions exhibit binding to meditope-enabled antibodies with greater affinity as compared to meditopes alone and/or Pro\u00ad tein alone, e.g., via energy additivity. The MPLs also can be advantageous compared to Protein L alone and other multi \u00ad valent conjugates of Protein L, Protein A, and/or similar antibody-binding proteins, in that they provide specificity for meditope-enabled antibodies and will not target endogenous immunoglobulin molecules when administered therapeuti from bacterium Peptostrepto- coccus magnus, Protein Lisa protein that binds to the kappa light chain of human and other antibodies. Exemplary medi \u00ad tope-Protein L (MPL) fusion proteins include those in which a provided meditope is coupled to a Protein L, which can be wild-type Protein L or a variant thereof, such as one of several variants known in the art, or a variant modified to improve one or more property, such as to reduce antigenicity. Methods for modifying similar proteins, such as to reduce antigenicity or immunogenicity, or to improve \"immune tolerance, \" are known in the art and described, for example, by Ahlgren et al., JNudMed, 2010; 51:1131-1138; 30; 398(2):232-47. Epub 2010 Mar. 10. For example, amino acid substitutions can be made, e.g., in an iterative process, randomly or based on structural modeling, following by analysis of the desired property, e.g., antigenic \u00ad ity. In another example, mutations are introduced to improve specificity. In other embodiments, the meditopes are fused with other antibody-binding substances, such as other anti\u00ad body-binding proteins, for example, Protein A or Protein G. [0356] The MPLs generally include a linker, linking the meditope portion to the Protein L portion. The linker typically includes at least 2, more typically at least 3, e.g., 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 amino acid residues (e.g., four glycines). In some aspects, such residues link the C-terminus of the meditope and the N-terminus of Protein L. In one example, the medi \u00ad tope-Protein L fusion protein has the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 58(SCQFDLSTRRLKCGGGGSEV T I K V N L I F A D G K I Q T A E F K G T F E E A T A E A Y R Y A A L L A K V N G E Y T A D L E D G G N H M N I K F A G). [0357] In some embodiments, the MPLs are used in con\u00ad nection with meditope-enabled antibodies, in the methods and uses described herein, including those involving the con\u00ad jugation of the meditopes to agents, such as therapeutic or diagnostic agents, such as cytotoxins, radionuclides, DOTA, proteins or other biological molecules, e.g., to taiget disease and/or image disease sites. In some aspects, to facilitate such conjugation, one or more lysines in the Protein L fusion are mutated, for example, to arginine or asparagine, to generate a Protein L fusion protein that can be specifically conjugated to other molecules, for example, by leaving the N-terminal amine and the epsilon amine available for conjugation, the latterbeing solvent exposed and more reactive. An exemplary fusion protein has the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 59 (S CQFDLSTRRLRCGGGGSEVTI RV NLIFA D G N I Q T A E F R G T F E EA TAE A Y R Y A A L L A R V N G E Y T A D L E D G G N H M N I K F A G ) , i n w h i c h all lysines but one have been removed. [0358] The coding sequence of an exemplary meditope- Protein L fusion protein is set forth in SEQ ID NO: 56. Thesequence of exemplary meditope-Protein L fusion proteins are set forth in SEQ ID NO: 57 (His6-Smt3-meditope-Pro- teinL) and SEQ ID NO: 58 (containing two cysteins, set forth in bold text, which in some aspects are used to cyclize the MPL, e.g., by peroxide or overnight (MPL) construct exhibits improved binding affinity for a meditope-enabled antibody as compared to meditope alone. For example, the improvement can be an at least or an at or about 10,000, 9000, 8000, 7000, 6000, 5000, 4000, 3000, 2000, 1000, 900, 800, 700, 600, 500, 400, 300, 200, 100, 90, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, or 10-fold improvement in affinity, e.g., in dissociation constant, for the meditope-enabled anti\u00ad body as compared with the corresponding meditope alone and/or with the Protein L alone. In one example, the binding constants for interactions between Protein L and the meditope alone with the meditope-enabled antibody are approximately 0.5 and I , respectively, whereas the binding constant for the MPL to the antibody is approximately 165 pM. [0360] IV. Meditope-Agent Conjugates [0361] In certain agents are conjugated to one or more therapeutic or diagnostic agent, e.g., imaging agents, therapeutically effective agents or com\u00ad pounds in therapeutically effective amounts or both. Provided are such complexes containing the meditope and one or more agent. [0362] In some aspects, the binding of the meditopes or variants thereof to one or more meditope-enabled antibody conjugated to a therapeutic or diagnostic (e.g., imaging) agent or compound is used to treat, prevent, diagnose or monitor a disease or condition. In one aspect, such conjugation of a meditope, such as a multivalent meditope, to an agent, when used in connection with meditope-enabled monoclonal anti\u00ad bodies, provides a highly versatile platform technology that will significantly improve mAh based therapeutics and imag \u00ad ing methods to treat and detect disease (see FIG. 8). [0363] The diagnostic and therapeutic agents include any such agent, which are well-known in the relevant art. Among the imaging agents are fluorescent and luminescent sub\u00ad stances, including, but not limited to, a variety of organic or inorganic small molecules commonly referred to as \"dyes, \" \"labels,\" or \"indicators. \" dyes, and cyanine dyes. Enzymes that may be used as imaging agents in accordance with the embodiments of the disclosure include, but are not limited to, enzymes be in combi \u00ad nation with a chromogen, a fluorogenic compound or a Iumi- nogenic compound to generate a detectable signal. [0364] Radioactive substances that may be used as imaging agents in accordance with the embodiments of the disclosure include, but are not may be used as additional imaging agents in accordance with the embodiments of the disclosure include, but are not limited to, ions of transition and lanthanide metals (e.g. metals having atomic numbers of 21-29, 42, 43, 44, or 57-71). Thesemetals include ions of Cr, V, Mn, Fe, Co, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb and Lu. [0365] When the imaging agent is a radioactive metal or paramagnetic ion, the agent may be reacted with another long-tailed reagent having a long tail with one or more chelat \u00ad ing groups attached to the long tail for binding to these ions. The long tail may be a polymer such as a polylysine, polysac \u00ad charide, or other derivatized or derivatizable chain having pendant groups to which the metals or ions may be added for binding. Examples of chelating groups that may be used according to the disclosure include, but are not limited to, ethylenediaminetetraacetic is nor\u00ad mally linked to the PSMA antibody or functional antibody fragment by a group, which enables the formation of a bond to the molecule with minimal loss of immunoreactivity and minimal aggregation and/or internal cross-linking. The same chelates, when complexed with non-radioactive metals, such as manganese, iron and gadolinium are useful for MRI, when used along with the antibodies and carriers described herein. Macrocyclic chelates such as , DOTA, and TETA are of use with a variety of metals and radiometals including, but not limited to, radionuclides of gallium, yttrium and copper, respectively. Other ring-type chelates such as macrocyclic polyethers, which are of interest for stably binding nuclides, such as 223Ra for RAIT may be used. In certain embodiments, chelating moieties may be used to attach a PET imaging agent, such as an Al\u201418F complex, to a targeting molecule for use in PET analysis. [0366] Exemplary therapeutic agents include, but are not limited to, drugs, chemotherapeutic agents, therapeutic anti\u00ad bodies and antibody fragments, toxins, radioisotopes, enzymes (e.g., enzymes to cleave prodrugs to a cytotoxic agent at the site toactive agents and dyes. The therapeutic agent may also include a metal, metal alloy, intermetallic or core-shell nano \u00ad particle bound to a chelator that acts as a radiosensitizer to render the targeted cells more sensitive to radiation therapy as compared to healthy cells. Further, the therapeutic agent may include paramagnetic nanoparticles for MRI contrast agents (e.g., magnetite or Fe3O4) and may be used with other types of therapies (e.g., photodynamic and hyperthermal therapies and imaging (e.g., fluorescent imaging (Au and CdSe)). [0367] Chemotherapeutic agents are often cytotoxic or cytostatic may include alkylating agents, anti\u00ad metabolites, anti-tumor antibiotics, topoisomerase inhibitors, mitotic immunotherapeutics. In some embodiments the chemothera \u00ad peutic agents that may be used as therapeutic agents in accor \u00ad dance with the embodiments of the disclosure include, but are not limited Therapeutic antibodies and functional fragments thereof, that may be used as therapeutic agents in accordance with the embodiments of the disclosure include, but are not with specific diseases listed herein. [0369] Toxins that may be used as therapeutic agents in accordance with the embodiments of the disclosure include, but are not limited abrin, endotoxin. [0370] Radioisotopes that may be used as therapeutic agents in accordance with the embodiments of the disclosure include, but are not of Use and Compositions [0371] Also provided are methods and uses of the medi- topes, meditope-enabled antibodies, and complexes contain \u00ad ing the same, including therapeutic and diagnostic uses, as well as other uses, including antibody purification. Also pro\u00ad vided are pharmaceutical compositions containing the medi- US 2012/0301400 Al 31Nov. 29, 2012 topes (including variant and multivalent meditopes and medi- tope fusion proteins) for use in such diagnostic and therapeutic methods. [0372] I. Therapeutic and Diagnostic Uses and Pharmaceu \u00ad tical Compositions [0373] In one embodiment, tethering agents, etc., are used to deliver therapeutic agents, diagnostic agents (e.g., imaging agents), or a combination thereof for treatment, diagnosis (e.g., imag \u00ad ing) a disease or condition, typically when administered in combination with (either simultaneously or separately) one or more meditope-enabled monoclonal antibodies. [0374] In one example, meditopes, e.g., multivalent used for pre-targeted therapy or pre-taigeted imag \u00ad ing, as described further below, by administering a meditope- enabled monoclonal antibody before administering use of multivalent meditopes can enhance selectivity and improve tumor detection as has been demonstrated for engineered scFvs or chemically conjugated mAbs, but avoids potential immunogenicity inherent in these non-human con\u00ad structs. [0375] Thus, the platform technology described herein has a broad impact on the mAh delivery field and provides useful methods for the treatment and diagnosis of various diseases and conditions, including cancers, such as those against which use of an antibody is indicated. For example, medi \u00ad tope-enabled antibodies directed against EGFR-positive can\u00ad cers, including colorectal and squamous cell carcinoma head and neck cancers, would benefit from use of where cetuximab and a meditope. Additionally, modifying other therapeutic antibodies to generate meditope-enabled versions of such antibodies allows forthe platform technology to be utilized in methods for the treatment and diagnosis of several other cancers, diseases and other conditions. [0376] Use of the meditopes in such methods is advanta \u00ad geous, for example, by way of specificity, e.g., as compared to other means for binding or conjugation to antibodies. For example, PpL (Protein L) and SpA (Protein A) are not murine-specific or chimeric antibody-specific. PpL binds to -66% of murine and -50% of human IgG Kappa light chains and SpA binds to 12% of murine and 50% of human variable heavy chains (Graille et ah, 2002). In contrast, as demon \u00ad strated herein, the interaction of meditopes with meditope- enabled antibodies is highly specific, which can avoid adverse effects, including off-target effects, e.g., avoiding binding of the therapeutic compound to immunoglobulins endogenous to the subject. [0377] In some embodiments, a meditope administered in combination with a meditope enabled antibody, an antibody - meditope complex, a multivalent agent adminis \u00ad tered in combination with a meditope enabled antibody, or a combination thereof may be conjugated to one or more imag \u00ad ing agent. In one aspect, an imaging agent may include, but is not limited to a fluorescent, luminescent, magnetic protein, or radionuclide protein, peptide or derivatives thereof (e.g., genetically engineered variants). Fluorescent proteins that may be expressed by the mRNA component include green fluorescent protein (GFP), enhanced GFP (EGFP), red, blue, yellow, cyan, and sapphire fluorescent proteins, and reef coral fluorescent protein. Luminescent proteins that may beexpressed by the mRNA component include luciferase, aequorin and derivatives thereof. Numerous fluorescent and luminescent dyes and proteins are known in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication 2004/0067503; Valeur, B., \"Molecular Fluorescence: Principles and Applications, \" JohnWiley and Sons, 2002; Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Products, Molecular Probes, 9.sup.th edition, 2002; and The Handbook \u2014A Guide to Fluorescent Probes and Labeling Technologies, Invitrogen, 10th edition, avail \u00ad able at the Invitrogen web site; both of which are hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.) [0378] In other aspects, the meditope administered in com\u00ad bination with a meditope combination with a meditope enabled antibody, or a combination thereof may be further conjugated to or other \u00ad wise associated with a non-protein imaging agent or a deliv \u00ad ery vehicle such as a radioactive radioisotopes, radionuclides, radiolabels or or mol\u00ad ecules, bioluminescent compounds or molecules, enzymes and enhancing agents (e.g., paramagnetic ions). In addition, it should be noted that some nanoparticles, for example quan \u00ad tum dots and metal nanoparticles (described below) may also be suitable for use as an imaging agent or a therapeutic agent (e.g., using hyperthermal and photodynamic therapies as well as imaging agents through fluorescence and or MRI contrast) . [0379] The meditope-mAb technology allows for a system that may be used to generate an antibody-meditope complex that may be further conjugated to one or more meditope- enabled antibody, a therapeutic agent, an imaging agent or a combination thereof. Thus, a set of meditopes or high affinity meditope variants, each conjugated to a unique cytotoxic or imaging agent, would allow for the co-administration of a desired meditope conjugate and meditope-enabled mAh for treatment. The meditope conjugates are an improvement over the current antibody-drug conjugates, which have drawbacks such as a reduced specificity due to chemical modification or release of payload. A method for enhancing the binding affin \u00ad ity of a therapeutic antibody or functional fragment thereof is provided herein. Such a method may include administering to a subject a therapeutically effective amount of a pharmaceu \u00ad tical composition via any suitable route of administration. The pharmaceutical composition may include a meditope or meditope variant in combination with a meditope enabled antibody, a multivalent meditope or meditope variant tether \u00ad ing entity in combination with a meditope enabled antibody, a meditope-enabled therapeutic antibody or functional frag\u00ad ment thereof, a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and any combination thereof. The enhanced binding affinity of the multivalent meditope may be attributed to the multivalent cross-linking of IgGs bound to the cell surface. Crosslinking (through parental murine M425 antibody or using anti- IgG IgM) significantly affects signaling, receptor endocytosis and recycling, and cell death. Thus, multivalent peptides may act synergistically with a therapeutic monoclonal antibody to enhance its therapeutic efficacy. [0380] In some embodiments, the meditope, alone or as part of the tethering entity, may contain a cysteine or other suitable alkylating agent that binds to a Fab cysteine at the binding site, thus creating a cysteine-cysteine interaction. Alternatively, the meditope may bind to the Fab at an urmatu- US 2012/0301400 Al 32Nov. 29, 2012 ral amino acid (e.g., p-acetylphenylalanine). The Cys medi- tope is conjugated to any substance and directs the conjugate to the IgG. [0381] An antibody -meditope complex may also be used in a method for directing treatment to a particular type of cell or population of cells in a disease or condition that can be tar\u00ad geted by a therapeutic antibody. Such a method of treatment may include administering a therapeutically effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition to a subject having the dis\u00ad ease or condition via any suitable route of administration. The pharmaceutical composition may include a meditope or meditope variant in combination with a meditope enabled antibody, a multivalent meditope or meditope variant tether \u00ad ing entity in combination with a meditope enabled antibody, a meditope-enabled therapeutic antibody or functional frag\u00ad ment thereof. [0382] In other embodiments, a method for imaging tumors or other tissues is provided. In such methods, an unmodified therapeutic antibody may be administered to taiget a tumor or other tissue that overexpress the corresponding antigen. Sub\u00ad sequently, a multivalent meditope tethering entity that is labeled with an imaging agent is administered via any suitable route of administration and will bind to the therapeutic anti\u00ad bodies that are bound to the target tumor or tissue. See FIG. 8. Examples of imaging agents include but are not limited to radiolabels biotin, chelating or any agent described above. In one embodiment, the imaging agent used with the method described herein is DOTA. [0383] There are several advantages over known methods to the imaging or treatment methods described above. First, the bivalent character of a therapeutic monoclonal antibody enhances the selectivity to the tumor. As discussed further below, this enhanced selectivity is lost with the use of scFvs and is not entirely compensated for by enhanced affinity. Second, the mass of the labeled multivalent meditope tether \u00ad ing entity will be below the renal threshold for filtering (less than 60 kDa, may be as low as -10 kDa), allowing it to be easily filtered out of the body. In contrast, direct labeling of a therapeutic antibody with an imaging agent or other thera \u00ad peutic agent is typically avoided because it will circulate for extended periods (days to weeks) in the body. Thus, imaging of tumors or other diseased organs is often accomplished using less selective scFvs. [0384] In further embodiments, the meditopes may be used to join two or more therapeutic molecules to form a pharma \u00ad ceutical compound that may be administered, as part of a pharmaceutical composition, in a therapeutically effective amount to a subject for treatment of cancer, autoimmune disease or other conditions. The two or more therapeutic molecules may include, but are not limited to, functional antibody fragments (e.g, F(ab') 2 or Fab fragments), peptides or other small molecules that can taiget tumor or disease- specific receptors such as those described above. The thera \u00ad peutic molecules may be two or more of the same therapeutic molecule or alternatively, may be two or more different mol\u00ad ecules that target the same tumor or diseased tissue. [0385] In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical com\u00ad pound or composition may include a proprietary antibody, or portion thereof, such as a CovX-Body. In one example, the meditopes are used as linkers to join two or more therapeutic molecules to a specially designed CovX antibody. In oneexample, a small molecule, peptide or scFv associated with such a meditope is recognized by the meditope-binding site (e.g, framework binding interface) of the CovX antibody. When these components are combined, the resulting bivalent CovX-Body possesses the biologic actions of the small molecule, peptide or scFv while also retaining an extended half-life of the antibody. [0386] In some embodiments, the provided meditopes, meditope-enabled antibodies, and complexes thereof, are used in treatment, diagnosis or imaging of a disease or con\u00ad dition, including any cancer, disease or other condition that may be treated or targeted using a therapeutic antibody. Can\u00ad cers avoid immune surveillance by actively suppressing the immune system. One method envisioned for counteracting this immunosuppression is through vaccination using epitopes of antigens that are either uniquely expressed or over-expressed by the tumor cells. For example, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that block signaling pathways, sequester growth factor and/or induce an immune response have been successfully implemented in the clinic to treat cancer and other diseases. [0387] Thus, the diseases and conditions include any can\u00ad cer, as well as other diseases and conditions, such as those targeted using therapeutic mAbs, including, but not limited to, leukemia and lymphomas (which can be treated or imaged using, meditope-enabled ver\u00ad sions of trastuzumab, adecatumumab, ertumaxomab) \u00ad tate cancer (which can be treated or imaged using, e.g, medi \u00ad tope-enabled versions of adecatumumab, capromab etaracizumab), colorectal can be using, e.g, meditope-enabled versions of arcitu- mumab, catumaxomab), ovarian cancer (which can be treated or imaged using, e.g, meditope-enabled versions of anatumumab mafenatox), pancreatic cancer (which can be treated or imaged using, e.g, meditope-enabled versions of clivatuzumab tetraxetan), renal cancer (which can be treated or imaged using, e.g, meditope- enabled versions of girentuximab), melanoma cancer (which can be treated or ver\u00ad sions of meditope-enabled ver\u00ad sions of nimotuzumab), bone metastases (which can be treated or imaged using, e.g, meditope-enabled versions of denosumab), head and neck cancer (which can be treated or imaged using, e.g, meditope-enabled versions of zalutu- mumab), cardiovascular disease (which can be treated or imaged using, e.g, meditope-enabled versions of abcix- imab), autoimmune disorders (which can be treated or imaged using, e.g, meditope-enabled versions of adali- mumab, infliximab), rheumatoid arthritis (which can be treated using, e.g, meditope-enabled versions of atlizumab, golimumab, infliximab), transplant rejection (which can be treated or (which can be or imaged using, e.g, meditope-enabled versions of certolizumab, imaged using, meditope-enabled versions of eculizumab), psoriasis (which can be treated or imaged using, e.g., meditope-enabled versions of efalizumab, infliximab, ustekinumab), multiple sclerosis (which can be treated or imaged using, e.g., meditope-enabled versions of natalizumab, ustekinumab), asthma (which can be treated or imaged using, meditope-enabled versions of benrali- zumab, mepolizumab, omalizumab), syncytial virus (which can meditope-enabled versions of palivizumab), macular degen \u00ad (which can be treated using, e.g., meditope- enabled versions of ranibizumab), appendicitis (which can be treated or imaged using, e.g., meditope-enabled versions of fanolesomab) and any other condition that may be targeted or treated with an antibody. The above-listed antibodies and related diseases or disorders are examples only and do not limit the platform. [0388] In certain embodiments, one or may be conju \u00ad gated to one or more imaging agents, therapeutically effective agents or compounds in therapeutically effective amounts or both, such that the binding of the meditopes or variants thereof to one or more meditope-enabled antibody with the therapeutically effective compound may treat, prevent, diag\u00ad nose or monitor a disease or condition. Such conjugation of a high affinity and/or multivalent meditope coupled to medi \u00ad tope-enabled mAbs provides a highly versatile platform tech\u00ad nology that will significantly improve mAh based therapeu \u00ad tics and imaging methods to treat and detect disease (see FIG. 8). [0389] III. Other Uses and Compositions [0390] Also provided are methods and compositions for stabilization of scFv (single chain Fab variable) fragments. In general, scFv fragments (e.g., the scFv format of a given Fab) bind antigen with a substantially lower affinity than full- length mAbs and other fragments, such as the Fab itself. Such reduced affinity is attributed, at least in part, to absence of the Fab constant domain that directly affects the orientation, con\u00ad formational fluctuations of the Fv domains, and possibly, to poor linker design. On the other hand, scFv and other smaller fragments can have other advantages, including better tissue, e.g., tumor penetration. [0391] In some embodiments, provided is a method for improving the stability and affinity of scFv fragments. In one aspect, such methods are carried out by incorporating a medi \u00ad tope into an scFv fragment by facilitating its interaction with residues in the VH and VL regions corresponding to residues within the meditope binding site of the corresponding Fab or whole antibody, for example, by introducing a linker between the scFv and the meditope, to stabilize the scFv. Also pro\u00ad vided are complexes containing the scFv bound to one or more meditopes, and compositions containing the same, and uses thereof in the provided methods. In some aspects, such methods will help to enforce the proper orientation of the variable domains and thus enhance the affinity (FIG. 9). [0392] Also provided are isolation and purification meth \u00ad ods using the meditopes, including methods for purifying meditope-enabled antibodies and fragments thereof, and/or cells expressing such antibodies, and compositions and kits for use in the same. In one embodiment, such methods are carried out by coupling the meditope (e.g., any of the pro\u00ad vided meditopes) to a solid support, such as a bead, e.g.,magnetic bead, plate, column, or other solid support. See FIG. 10. In another example, a meditope having the sequence CQFDLSTRRLRCGGGSK was successfully linked through amine coupling to a solid support, and is useful, for example, in biacore/surface plasmon resonance studies. See FIG. 29. Such biacore studies in certain embodiments are performed by flowing antibody over an amine coupled long meditope chip. [0393] Methods for coupling proteins to solid supports are well known to those skilled in the art and can be used in connection with this embodiment. Meditope-enabled anti\u00ad bodies or cells expressing the same then can be exposed to the solid support, whereby they are isolated and purified. [0394] There are several advantages to such purification methods compared to other available methods. For example, the provided meditopes are easily synthesized and can be readily added to common solid supports (including magnetic beads). Second, the affinity of the meditopes is easily modu \u00ad lated by point mutations, which enables the fine-tuning of the purification procedure and avoids harsh conditions such as low pH that is commonly used to elute antibodies from Pro\u00ad tein A or Protein L. In some embodiments, these ProteinA or Protein Lresins usually contain the full length (e.g., wildtype) sequence where there are up to 5 domains. One or more of these domains are the same as Protein L and Protein A being used herein. In some examples, the meditopes are made biva\u00ad lent or multivalent (such as those described in Example 7 below) for use in extracting meditope-enabled antibodies, such as intact meditope-enabled antibodies. [0395] In some aspects, the provided purification and iso\u00ad lation methods have additional advantages over other purifi \u00ad cation methods using ProteinA or Protein L, including reduc \u00ad tion in the high cost associated with the production of Protein A or Protein L, improvement compared to the limited life cycle of these proteins, and avoidance of the risk of introduc \u00ad ing extraneous biological material such as bacterial patho \u00ad gens, associated with use of Protein L or A. F. Modification and Screening of Meditopes and Meditope-Enabled Antibodies [0396] I. Modification of Meditope-Enabled Antibodies [0397] Alsoprovidedaremethods for modifying meditope- enabled antibodies to alter one or more properties of the antibodies, such as binding affinity or specificity with respect to the meditope, and/or other properties. Also provided are modified antibodies produced by the methods and libraries for producing the same. In one embodiment, residues that line the meditope-binding site of a meditope-enabled antibody and/or that are otherwise important for binding of such an antibody to a meditope, are systematically or randomly altered (e.g., using degenerate libraries and selection), for example, to enhance and/or change the specificity of the meditope or meditope analogs (see, for example, Sheedy et al. 2007 and Akamatsu et al. 2007, hereby incorporated herein by reference, for methods of making alterations). In some aspects, the residues are substituted with natural or non\u00ad natural amino acids or both, in order to improve the affinity of the meditope interaction and/or alter another property of the meditope-antibody interaction. The incorporation of a non\u00ad natural amino acid in an antibody to generate a bi-specific antibody was described by Hutchins et al. 2011). [0398] Residues of meditope-enabled antibodies that make contact with the meditope and/or are otherwise important, e.g., line the cavity, for example, residues within 8 A of any US 2012/0301400 Al 34Nov. 29, 2012 atom of a bound meditope, that can be systematically or randomly changed to improve the meditope affinity through hydrogen bonding, ionic, electrostatic or steric interaction can include, but are not limited to, one or more light chain residues (e.g., P8, V9 or Rabat numbering and with reference to cetuximab, meditope-enabled trastuzumab, or meditope-en- abled M5 A, or analogous residues in other meditope-enabled antibodies), and/or one or more heavy chain and with reference to cetux \u00ad imab, meditope-enabled trastuzumab, or meditope-enabled MSA, or analogous residues in other meditope-enabled anti\u00ad bodies), or a combination thereof. [0399] For example, in some aspects, one or more of P8, V9 or Yl 73 of the light chain, and/or one analogous residues in other medi \u00ad tope-enabled antibodies) of the heavy chain are mutated. [0400] Other residues within or in proximity to the medi \u00ad tope binding site may be mutated to allow a meditope group to hydrate it and bind with high affinity. For example, the Tyr87 of the light chain residue, the Tyr9 Iof the heavy chain residue, or both, may be used to form a hydrate with an aldehyde or boron containing compound originating from a meditope analog. In some aspects, as shown in the Examples herein, meditopes do not affect antigen binding and can be used to deliver drugs, daisy chain/crosslink antibodies, to increase the efficiency and/or efficacy of therapeutic antibod \u00ad ies, and in targeted diagnostic, e.g., imaging, methods, among other uses as described herein. Thus, in some embodiments, the meditope binding site of a provided meditope-enabled antibody is altered, for example, such that it can bind to a meditope with higher affinity and/or can bind with one or more variant meditopes, meditope analogs, and/or small mol\u00ad ecules such as DOTA or a DOTA derivative (for radioactive delivery and/or pre-targeted imaging). [0401] In some embodiments, alteration of the residues of the meditope binding site is by systematic alteration. In some aspects, mutating all sites would involve >206, potentially >20 16, combinations of mutations. Thus, in some aspects, desired mutations are efficiently identified using a library, in which mutations in the antibody are generated at the DNA level. In one aspect, the library contains individual members that collectively express each individual natural amino acid at one or more positions targeted for mutation. In one example, a DNA library is created using degenerate oligonucleotides at sites of interest (e.g., any one or more of the sites described herein, e.g., Ile89, Thr87, Leul08 and ThrllO of the heavy chain and Lysl03 and Glul65 light chain), producing a library the members of which collectively encode all 20 natu \u00ad rally occurring amino acids at these sites.[0402] In some aspects, an anchor, e.g., a GPI domain, is coupled to the antibody members of the library, such as to the C-terminus of the antibody (e.g., IgG) heavy chain, to facili \u00ad tate selection of the expressed antibodies. The library can be transfected using standard methods and members of the library expressed. [0403] Mutant antibodies of the library having one or more desired characteristics then can be selected. In some aspects, members of the library are selected for their ability to bind to an antigen, e.g., to select for mutations that do not affect antigen binding. In one example, cells expressing antibodies of the library that bind to a fluorescently labeled antigen (e.g., HER2, EGFR, IGFR, CLTA-4, etc) are selected, e.g., by FACS (FIG. 20). In some aspects (either after or instead of antigen-binding selection), cells expressing antibodies of the library are selected for another characteristic, such as binding to a specific meditope, meditope analog, or other molecule of interest (e.g., DOTA). In another example, two or more char\u00ad acteristics are simultaneously selected for. [0404] Selected members of the library, e.g., cells express \u00ad ing the antibodies, are evaluated and characterized, for example, to determine the desired mutation or combination of mutations for achieving a particular property. In one aspect, sorted cells are characterized by PCR to identify the resulting mutations that facilitate or enhance meditope/analog/small molecule binding. [0405] In some aspects, the methods are carried out in an iterative fashion, for example, by repeating the mutation, selection, and characterization process, e.g., multiple times, to \"evolve/optimize \" the binding or other desired character \u00ad istic^). [0406] II. MeditopeAnalogs and Fragments [0407] Also provided are meditope analogs, and methods for identifying, producing, and screening such analogs. Thus, in some embodiments, other molecules also bind to meditope binding sites of meditope-enabled antibodies, with functional characteristics similarto those of a meditope. Suchmolecules are called meditope analogs and include, but are not limited to, small molecules, aptamers, nucleic acid molecules, pep- tibodies and any other substance able to bind to the same binding interface as a meditope. In one example, the analog is a DOTA derivative. [0408] In one embodiment, provided are screening meth \u00ad ods for identifying such analogs, including small molecule analogs that mimic the meditopes. Such methods include fluorescence polarization assays, diffraction based and based \u00ad fragment-based drug dis\u00ad covery approach is used to identify fragments, small mol\u00ad ecules, such as chemical groups, that bind to the meditopes, meditope binding sites, and/or meditope-enabled antibodies near the meditope binding sites. See, for example, Erlanson, Top Curr Chem (2012) 317:1-32. In some examples, the identified fragments are coupled to the meditopes, for example, to improve their affinity or other properties of the interaction with the meditope binding site. In other examples, they are expanded and/or linked together to generate com\u00ad pounds for coupling to meditopes or meditope-enabled anti\u00ad bodies, or for use as meditope analogs. Methods for fragment and/or meditope analog discovery include, but are not limited to, the following. In some examples, the fragments are between about or at 100 and about or at 1000 Da. US 2012/0301400 Al 35Nov. 29, 2012 [0410] Fluorescence PolarizationAssays [0411] In some aspects, methods include fluorescence polarization assays and/or other competition-based assays. In one example, to identify alternative molecules that can bind at the meditope site and be used for similar functions, a fluores \u00ad cent marker (e.g., Alexafluor, rhodamine, fluorescein) is con\u00ad jugated to a a suitable method (e.g., amines, sulfhydryl, carboxylate, sugars or other known meth \u00ad ods), and allowed to interact with a meditope-enabled anti\u00ad body. In general, interaction between the labeled meditope and meditope-enabled antibody causes a change in the fluo\u00ad rescence polarization/intensity of the fluorescent tag. Once established, test compounds (potential analogs), such as small molecule compounds (MW<1000 Da), are added and equilibrated, e.g., with fluorescent tagged meditope-antibody complex, and the fluorescence polarization is monitored. Test compounds that block the meditope-antibody interaction will alter the fluorescent polarization properties. Accordingly, another embodiment is a method of identifying compounds that can be optimized and used for target delivery. The ana\u00ad logs or potential analogs may be screened and further char\u00ad acterized, e.g. , by crystallography or other methods described characterization of the meditopes. [0412] Diffraction Methods [0413] Diffraction based methods to identify lead com\u00ad pounds are well established (Shuker et al. 1996; Erlanson et al. 2001; Hughes et al. 2011). Since cetuximab and other meditope-enabled Fabs diffract beyond 2.5 A, this approach is used in certain embodiments to identify lead compounds or small molecule fragments that can be coupled to a meditope or used as analogs. For example, such compounds include fragments that are then linked together to form synthetic meditope analogs. In one example, a compound library is developed to soak into crystals of cetuximab or other medi \u00ad tope-enabled antibody. Diffraction data from these soaks are collected and data sets analyzed. Such methods can identify additional sites on meditope-enabled antibodies that are amendable for fragment growth and optimization. [0414] The fragments, can be grown (chemically deriva- tized) to enhance their binding and specificity. The fragments can also be chemically tethered to the meditope. Optimization of this chemical coupling can significantly enhance the over\u00ad all binding affinity of the meditope for the meditope binding site. Additionally, analogs found by diffraction methods can be optimized and used in lieu of the meditope for drug deliv \u00ad ery, multivalent scaffolding and other functions. Further, mutations in the light and heavy chains may be made to change the specificity of the ligand (meditope) and that these diffraction methods (including fluorescence polarization, NMR screening, and phage display methods) can be used to optimized alternative ligands. [0415] NMR Screening [0416] NMR can also analogs and ments (e.g., peptide fragments, non-peptide based small mol\u00ad ecules) that can be optimized and used as described herein. In one example, to identify such leads, one dimensional (ID) spectra of pools containing fragments, e.g., 15 to 20 frag\u00ad ments, are collected. In one embodiment, the fragments used are non-peptide based small molecules. Next, a meditope- enabled antibody is added to each pool and a second ID spectra collected. Compounds that bind (transiently) to a meditope-enabled antibody undergo rapid magnetization transfer, resulting in a loss of intensity. Thus, in some aspects, comparing the spectra before and after meditope-enabledantibody binding and identifying peaks that are altered, indi\u00ad cates an interaction. These peaks can be pre-assigned to a specific compound and thus immediately known or the pools can be subdivided and the spectra recollected. After several rounds the exact identity of the compound is known. In these experiments, the precise position of the interaction is not known. The binding site can be determined by NMR or the fluorescence polarization assay. Alternatively, the Fab frag\u00ad ment can be labeled with NMR active and inactive nuclei (e.g., 13C, 15N and 2H), multiple NMR experiments per\u00ad formed to assign the spectrum, and then used with the frag\u00ad ment library to identify the binding position. [0417] Virtual Ligand Screening [0418] Virtual ligand screening is another method that can be used to identify lead meditope analogs, fragments, and other compounds. Using crystal structures, standard pro\u00ad grams (e.g., Schroerdinger Glide) can define a \"box ' about a site of a macromolecule (the meditope binding site) and dock known ligands to this site. Potential lead compounds are scored by a select energy function and the top 50 to 200 compounds can be purchased. In our initial studies, approxi \u00ad mately 100 lead compounds have been identified, and using crystallography, these lead compounds should be shown to demonstrate that they bind to the meditope site. [0419] Inone embodiment, a method of screening \u00ad topes or meditope analogs is provided herein. Such a method may include, but is not limited to, steps of contacting a library of putative meditopes or small molecules with a meditope- enabled antibody; determining whether the putative medi \u00ad topes of small molecules bind the meditope-enabled antibody at a framework binding interface; identifying one or more candidate meditopes or meditope analogs; determining bind \u00ad ing affinity of the one or more candidates; and identifying one or more of the candidates as a meditope or meditope analogs when the binding dissociation constant is less than 0.70 . In other contexts, a low affinity meditope is desired, such that a minimum dissociation constant is specified, for example, 0.70 . In some examples, the candidate is identified as a meditope or analog thereof if it exhibits binding constant of less than at or about 10 , less than at or about 5 , or less than at or about 2 , less than at or about I , less than at or about 500, 400, 300, 200, 100 nm, or less. In some cases, the dissociation constant, such as any of those listed herein, is that measured using a particular technique, such \u00ad etry, or other known method. For example, in some cases, the analog or meditope exhibits a binding constant of less than at or about 10 , less than at or about 5 , or less than at or about 2 , less than at or about I , less than at or about 500,400,300,200, 100 nm, or less, as measured by SPR or as measured by ITC or as measured by any of these methods. [0420] Additionally, methods of screening for novel frame \u00ad work binding interfaces are also provided, and are described further in the examples below. [0421] In another embodiment, provided is a method for identifying and optimizing fragments useful in connection with the meditopes, such as in building meditope analogs and/or in coupling to the meditopes to improve their function. Also provided are such analogs and fragments and com\u00ad pounds. [0422] Having described the invention with reference to the embodiments and illustrative examples, those in the art may US 2012/0301400 Al 36Nov. 29, 2012 appreciate modifications to the invention as described and illustrated that do not depart from the spirit and scope of the invention as disclosed in the specification. The Examples are set forth to aid in understanding the invention but are not intended to, and should not be construed to limit its scope in any way. The examples do not include detailed descriptions of conventional methods. Such methods are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art and are described in numerous publications. Further, all references cited above and in the examples below are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety, as if fully set forth herein. Example I Determination of Meditope-Antibody Fab Crystal Structures [0423] Meditopes were discovered that bind with high specificity and affinity within a central cavity of the Fab region and Fab fragment of cetuximab. These meditopes were bound to cetuximab Fabs and the structures determined crys- talographically. [0424] Materials and Methods [0425] Reagents. [0426] An antigen binding fragment (Fab) of cetuximab was obtained by digestion of the cetuximab IgG with immo \u00ad bilized papain (Pierce), followed by reverse purification with Protein A and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) on a Superdex 75 column (GE Flealthcare). The single chain vari\u00ad able fragment of cetuximab (scFvC225) was synthesized with a twenty amino acid linker between the light chain and heavy chain. ScFvC225 and soluble epidermal growth factor receptor domain III (sEGFRdIII) were expressed in Sf9 cells and purified as previously described (Donaldson, J. M., Kari, C., Fragoso, R. C., Rodeck, U. & Williams, J. C. Design and development of masked therapeutic antibodies to limit off- target effects: Application to anti-EGFR 5A. B. et Vaccinationwithcetuximab mimotopes and biological properties of induced anti-epider \u00ad mal growth factor receptor antibodies, JNatl Cancer Inst 97, 1663-70 (2005), were synthesized, oxidized and purified at the City of Hope Synthetic and Polymer Chemistry Core Facility. [0428] Crystallization and Diffraction Data. [0429] Cetuximab with cQFD and cQYN meditopes at a 1:10 molar ratio and screened for crystal formation using the Qiagen JCSG Core Suites (IIV) at 20\u00b0 C. Co-crystals that diffracted beyond 2.2 A were grown in 100 mM sodium phosphate/citrate, pH 4.5, 2.5 M sodium/ potassium phosphate and 1.6% wicked through mesoerythritol and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Crystallization trials and initial screening studies were carried out in the X-ray facility at City of Hope. Diffraction data were collected at the Stanford Syn\u00ad chrotron Radiation Lab, beam lines 9.1 and 11.1. The initial phases were determined by molecular replacement using the program Phaser (McCoy, A. J. et al. Phaser crystallographic software. J Appl Crystallogr 40, 658-674 (2007)) with the unliganded structure of cetuximab (pdb:lYY8\u2014 chains A and B) (Li, S. et al. Structural basis for inhibition of the epidermal growth factor receptor by cetuximab. Cancer Cell7, 301-1 1 (2005)). Two Fabs were placed in the asymmetric unit with a Matthews Coefficient of 3.26 and solvent content of 62.4%. The Z scores (standard deviation of the solution over the mean) were 27 and 25 for the rotational search and 38 and 71 for the translational search. A third Fab fragment could not be placed (three Fabs in the asymmetric unit cell produces a reasonable Matthews coefficient of 2.18 at 43% solvent). The cQFD and cQYN meditopes were built into the density manually through multiple iterations using Coot (Emsley, P & Cowtan, K. Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr 60, 2126-32 (2004)) and Phenix (Adams, P D. et al. PHENIX: building new software for automated crystallographic structure Structure Determination [0431] As noted above, cetuximab Fabs were generated and purified and mixed with cQFD meditope (cyclic peptide of 1:10 ratio; commercial factorials were used to screen for crystal formation. Crystals formed after I day at 20\u00b0 C. Initial diffraction analysis of these crystals indicated that the unit cell dimensions and space group were similar to those for the cetuximab Fab already deposited in the Protein Data Bank (lYY8.pdb) (Li, S. et al. Structural basis for inhibition of the epidermal growth factor receptor by cetuximab. Cancer Cell 7, 301-11 (2005)). The observation that the CDR loops in the deposited structure make extensive crystal contacts could have suggested that the cQFD medi \u00ad tope was not present in the crystal. Nonetheless, the structure was solved by molecular replacement and the experimental maps were examined to identify unmodeled electron density consistent with the meditope. The initial Fo-Fc map clearly indicated an area in the middle of the Fab fragment as a potential binding site (FIG. I). After an initial round of refine \u00ad ment using the Fab model only, a continuous stretch of unmodeled density consistent with the meditope was observed. The meditope was built into the density and the R and UFree dropped accordingly. Water molecules were added during refinement using Phenix (Adams, P D. et al. PHENIX: building new software for automated diffraction data and refinement statis \u00ad tics are given in Table 5 below.

As for the meditope of SEQ ID NO: I, clear unmodeled electron density was observed in the center of the Fab. Using the first structure, the differences in sequences were modeled accordingly and mul\u00ad tiple rounds of refinement were carried out. Representative electron density maps of both meditopes are shown in FIG. IB. The diffraction data and refinement statistics for the cQYN-Fab complex also are presented in Table 5, above. Example 2 Characterization of the Meditope Binding Site of Cetuximab Fab [0433] The meditope binding site of cetuximab was char\u00ad acterized as discussed below. It was demonstrated that this meditope binding site is unique and has not been found to exist in the immunoglobulins examined to date. [0434] Materials and Methods [0435] In addition to those described in Example I above, the following materials and methods were used. [0436] Meditopes and Point Mutations. [0437] As described in and CQYNLSSRALKC (cQYN; SEQ ID NO:2), were synthesized, oxidized and purified at the City of Elope Synthetic and Polymer Chemistry Core Facility. Alanine point mutations in the cQFD meditope were gener \u00ad ated at residues 3 (Phe3 to Ala), 5 (Leu5 to Ala), 8 (Arg8 to Ala) and 10 (Leu 10 to Ala) and the mutants produced bacte- rially by encoding the peptides at the C-terminus of SMT3 (Mossessova, E. & Lima, C. D. Ulp I-SUMO crystal structure and genetic analysis reveal conserved interactions and a regu \u00ad latory element essential for cell growth in yeast. Mol Cell 5, 865-76 (2000)). The peptides were oxidized by dialysis into buffer without DTT and purified by SEC to obtain monomers . plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis, ubiquitin- Iike protease (Ulpl) was added to the samples to release the peptides. Each of the biosynthesized mutant peptides con\u00ad tained an additional serine residue at the N-terminus due to the ULPl cleavage site. Ulpl and SMT3 were run as controls and did not interact with the cetuximab Fab.[0438] Characterization of the Meditope-Fab Interface. [0439] Affinity analysis by SPR was performed as previ \u00ad ously described (Donaldson et ah, 2009; Li et ah, 2005, supra). Briefly, scFvC225 or FabC225 (cetuximab Fab) was immobilized on a CM5 chip using amine chemistry. Peptide or sEGFRdIII affinities were assessed by equilibrium meth \u00ad ods at 20\u00b0 C. and fit to the equation RU={Rmax*[L]}/{[L] *Krf}+K0Jset. SEC was performed using a Superdex 200 10/300 column (GE Healthcare). The proteins were mixed, incubated at room temperature for 20 min and applied to the column at 4\u00b0 C. [0440] The EGFR-expressing MDA-MB-468 cell line was used to test cetuximab binding in the presence of peptide meditope. Labeled cetuximab (AF488, Invitrogen) was added for 20 min with or without 60 cQFD peptide at 4\u00b0 C. Labeled MOPS-21 was used as an isotype control. Cell fluorescence was determined using a FACS Biosciences). [0441] Analysis of Meditope/Fab Interface [0442] The interface of the binding site between the medi \u00ad tope (SEQ ID NO: I) and the cetuximab Fab was determined to be formed by all four domains of the IgG Fab (e.g., the variable heavy and light chain domains, the light chain con\u00ad stant region, and the heavy chain CHI). Using the PISA server, the buried surface area at the cQFD or cQYN medi- tope-Fab interface was 904 (\u00b128) A2 and 787 (\u00b142) A2, respectively, and approximately equally distributed between the light and heavy chains. FIGS. 2, 35, and 36 show the residues and the loops from the Fab that were determined to contact the meditope. [0443] Both meditopes (SEQ ID NOs : I and 2) were deter \u00ad mined to make multiple hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts with the cetuximab Fab. The amino acid sequences of cetuximab as an isotype con\u00ad trol in the phage display experiments that originally identified the meditopes of SEQ ID NOs: I and 2, and trastuzumab (a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to ErbB2) (see FIG. 2A). The structure of trastuzumab Fab also was super \u00ad imposed onto the structure of cetuximab Fab bound to the meditope of SEQ ID NO: I. FIG. 2A shows amino acid differences between the residues within the central cavity meditope-binding interface of the cetuximab Fab indicated that Arg9 of the cQFD meditope binds to a unique cavity created by the murine variable light chain. Specifically, Asp85, Ile83 and Thr40 of the murine variable light chain of cetuximab, based on Rabat numbering, were shown to be important with respect to binding to the Arg9 residue of the cQFD meditope (FIG. 2B). Asp85 in the murine framework region of the variable light chain was shown to make a salt bridge to the guanidinium group of Arg9 of the cQFD meditope (d^ 0/31=2.7 and 2.9 A & Anh2 OZ32=3.0 and 3.1 A). The carboxyl group of Asp85 also was shown to make a hydrogen bond to the backbone amide nitrogen of LeulO of the cQFD meditope (Aod2 HN=2.1 and 2.8 A). The hydroxyl group of Thr40 from the light chain also was shown to make a hydro \u00ad gen bond to guanidinium group of the meditope Arg9 (dOG1 .. ot/i=3.2 A for both). Superimpositionofthe structures also showed that the phenyl ring in Phe83 and the pyrrolidine ring of Pro40 found in the human variable light chain sequence (corresponding to He and Thr, respectively, in cetuximab) are US 2012/0301400 Al 38Nov. 29, 2012 positioned such that they would sterically occlude the side chain of Arg9 in the cQFD meditope. [0445] Although the Arg9 side chain in the cQFD meditope mapped to the differences between the sequences, the cQYN meditope encodes an same position as Arg9 in the cQFD meditope, and thus could potentially have bound to the human Fab. Although the hydro \u00ad gen bond to the guanidinium group of Arg9 of the cQFD meditope to Asp85 of the light chain was not present for the cQYN meditope, the carboxyl group of Asp85 of the light chain was shown to retain its hydrogen bond to the backbone amide nitrogen of LeulO of the cQYN meditope. Differences between the cQFD and cQYN meditopes and their interaction with the cetuximab Fab were determined. Superposition of the structures of the two meditopes (cQFD and cQYN) bound to cetuximab Fab (specifically of the Ca atoms of the heavy and light Fab chains) showed that the hydrophobic side chains of residues Phe/Tyr3, Leu5 and Leul Oofeach meditope were positioned nearly identically, indicating that interaction of these residues with the antibody were important for binding (FIG. 2B). The phenyl ring was shown to pack against the conserved Gln39 of the heavy chain variable region (Rabat numbering); the Leu5 side chain was shown to pack against He 89 and Leu 108 of the heavy chain variable region (Rabat numbering), as well as the phenyl ring from Phe3/Tyr3 of the meditopes. LeulO of the meditopes was shown to bind to an exposed pocket located on the variable light chain. [0446] The backbone traces of the cQFD and cQYN pep\u00ad tides, however, did deviate. Specifically, the Arg8 side chain structure of the cQFD meditope is extended and makes a strong backbone hydrogen bond to the backbone carbonyl of Glnl 05 of the Fab heavy chain Uiv771 and 2.8; Anh2 0=c=2.% and 2.9 of Tyr3 in the cQYN peptide, however, sterically interferes with the Arg8 side chain (FIG. 2B) and blocks the interaction between Arg8 of the cQYN meditope and Glnl 05 of the heavy chain. Consistent with this observation, both Arg8 side chains in the cQYN complex are poorly defined in the electron density map and takes on at least two different rotamers. (There are two Fab-meditope complexes in the asymmetric unit.) Concomi \u00ad tant with this change, a shift in the backbone hydrogen bond pattern was observed. The amide carbonyl of Thr7 in the cQFD meditope makes a hydrogen bond to the amide Asn41 in the cetuximab Fab light chain d^.^ 0=c=21 and 2.8 A). This hydrogen bond shifts to the carbonyl of the Arg8 back \u00ad bone in the amide of backbone of Asn4 1 in the cQYN peptide (Ac=o h-n= 3 \u00b7 0 and 3.1 A). [0447] The superposition indicated that the change from Pro40 and Gly41 in the human light chain sequence to Thr and Asn in the cetuximab light chain relieves a steric con\u00ad straint and affords two additional points for forming hydro \u00ad gen bonds to the meditopes. In the cQFD meditope-cetux- imab Fab structure, the amide nitrogen of Fab Asn41 was shown to interact with the carbonyl of Thr7 Uivj7 0=c =2.1 and 2.8 A) of the meditope and the side chain amide of Fab Asn4 1 was shown to interact with the carbonyl of Ser6 (And2 ... O=C= 3.2 and the meditope. In the cQYN medi- tope-cetuximab Fab structure, the shift of the backbone results in a shift of the hydrogen bond pattern. The amide nitrogen of Fab Asn41 interacts with carbonyl of Arg8 of cQYN Uivj7 (^\u00a2.=3.0 and 3.1 A) but the side chain interaction with Fab Asn41 is lost. [0448] In addition to these results, superposition of the molecular structure oftrastuzumab (1N8Z; Cho et ah, Nature,\"Structure of the extracellular region of F1ER2 alone and in complex with the Fab,\" 2003 Feb. 13; 421(6924): 756-60) and 2007 May 18; 282(20):15073-80. Epub 2007 Mar. 29) Fabs on to the meditope bound cetuximab Fab structure further high \u00ad lighted the uniqueness of the framework. [0449] Collectively, these results suggest that the differ \u00ad ences in the framework region of cetuximab and the control IgG (as opposed to the differences in the CDRs) accounted for the selection of the meditope to the central cavity of the Fab (Te., cetuximab and the phage display control antibody dif\u00ad fered in regions other than CDRs). [0450] Meditopes do not Induce Laige Conformational Changes in the Fab [0451] Based on the location of the meditope-cetuximab Fab interface, it was determined whether the meditopes per\u00ad turbed the relative orientation of the IgG domains to the unligated and/or ligated structure. First, the light and heavy chains within the asymmetric unit cell of both meditope com\u00ad plexes were compared and then each chain was compared to the unligated and EGFR-Iigated structures. The variable domains of the light chains bound to either meditope were essentially identical to the unliganded A). Flowever, the variable domains of the heavy chain showed a greater divergence (r.m.s.d. average: cQFD, 0.85\u00b10.01 A, cQYN, 0.88\u00b10.01 A). This divergence mainly stemmed from the position of framework region 2 (residues 39-46), since deleting the residues in this region and recalculating the r.m. s.d. resulted in a much lower value: cQFD, 0.18\u00b10.01 A; cQYN, 0.31\u00b10.01 A) (FIG. 6). In addition, this region was also shown to be displaced in the Fab C225-EGFR (cetux \u00ad imab Fab-antigen) co-crystal structure, and its relative B-fac- tor value suggested that it is flexible (FIG. 6). Finally, the presence of the meditope did not result in significant changes to the CDR structure relative to the EGFR bound or unbound structure. Although the backbone of Tyr98 in the heavy chain CDR loop 3 of the EGFR-Iiganded structure was shown to be flipped as compared to the Fab structure bound to either meditope, this flip is also observed in the unliganded cetux \u00ad imab Fab structure (Li et ah, 2005, supra). [0452] Contribution of Meditope Residues to Antibody Binding [0453] Based on the structure of the cQFD meditope-Fab complex, as well as the sequence similarity of cQYN to cQFD, several point mutations in 10\u2014\u00bb Ala) to characterize the role of these residues to the overall binding affinity of the meditope. To assess binding affinity, the cetuximab Fab fragment was coupled to a CM5 chip using standard amine chemistry and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was used to measure the binding properties of the various meditopes. The affinities of the synthetic cQFD and cQYN meditopes to the cetuximab Fab were measured be 950\u00b130 nM and 3.5\u00b10. 1 , respectively (n=3). The bind \u00ad ing kinetics were also measured (FIG. 3). The association constants, modeled as a bimolecular interaction, were 4.2 (\u00b10. 1 )x IO4 and cQYN, respectively. The R73 based on these measurements, 430 (\u00b130) nM for cQFD and 3.5 (\u00b10.1) for cQYN, are in close agreement with the equilibrium measurements. US 2012/0301400 Al 39Nov. 29, 2012 [0454] Next, the affinity of each mutated cQFD meditope was measured. The point mutation and wild type cQFD medi- topes were generated as C-terminal fusions to Ulpl biologically-pro \u00ad duced, wild type cQFD meditope bound with an affinity of 770 nM, similar to the synthetically-produced cQFD, Leu5 \u2014\u00bbAla significantly reduced the affinity for the cetux- imab Fab (Table 6, below). In particular, theArg8 \u2014\u00bbAla muta \u00ad tion resulted in an approximately 183-fold in binding affinity. [0455] In Table 6, WT=cQFD (SEQ ID NO: I), F3A=SEQ ID NO: 26 additional serine before the cysteine, L5A=SEQ ID NO: 27 with an additional serine before the cysteine, R8A=SEQ ID NO: 28 with an additional serine before the cysteine, and LlOA=SEQ ID NO: 29 with an additional serine before the cysteine. TABLE 6 Dissociation constants for 141 3.1 LlOA 2.2 0.63 [0456] trastuzumab, a humanized thera \u00ad peutic monoclonal antibody, was coupled to a CM5 chip to characterize the affinity of the cQFD and cQYN meditopes to a human framework. Equilibrium measurements revealed that the dissociation constants for both meditopes exceed 150 . Example 3 Binding of Meditopes to Regions Other than CDRs [0457] Materials and Methods [0458] It was demonstrated that binding of the meditopes cQFD and cQYN, and others, to a meditope-enabled antibody (cetuximab), does not affect the ability of the antibody to bind to antigen, meaning that the meditope-enabled antibodies can bind to antigen and a meditope simultaneously. [0459] In addition to those described in Examples I and 2 above, the following materials and methods were used. [0460] Reagents. [0461] As described above, the single chain variable frag\u00ad ment of cetuximab (scFvC225) was synthesized with a twenty amino acid linker between the light chain and heavy chain. ScFvC225 and soluble epidermal growth factor recep \u00ad tor domain III (sEGFRdIII) were expressed in Sf9 cells and purified as previously described (Donaldson et ah, 2009). [0462] Meditopes and Point Mutations. [0463] As oxidation of the cysteines to create a disulfide bond and purified at the City of Elope Synthetic and Polymer Chemistry Core Facility. Alanine point mutations in the cQFD meditope were generated at residues 3 (Phe3 to Ala), 5 (Leu5 to Ala), 8 (Arg8 to Ala) and 10 (Leu 10 to Ala) and were produced bacterially by encodingthe peptides at the C-terminus of SMT3 (Mossessova et ah, Before surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis, ubiquitin-like protease (Ulpl) was added to the samples to release the peptides. An N-terminal serine residue remained as a remnant of the protease cleavage site. [0464] Simultaneous Binding of EGFR and Meditope Fab [0465] The cetuximab Fab was incubated with sEGFRdIII and cQFD and applied to an analytical SEC column. A peak at 13.9 mL was observed, indicating the formation of a het- erotrimeric complex between these three components. Non \u00ad reducing SDS-PAGE of the peak showed the presence of all three components (FIG. 4B). In comparison, the individual components eluted at 15.2 mL (Fab C225), 15.6 mL (sEG- FRdIII) and 16.3 mL (SMT-CQFDLSTRRLKC; SEQ ID NO:l). The results showed that the meditopes and EGFR could bind to cetuximab simultaneously, indicating that meditope binding did not occlude antigen binding by cetux \u00ad imab. [0466] In addition, Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements were used to confirm that the medi \u00ad tope did not affect antigen binding by cetuximab. The fluo\u00ad rescent signal emitted from Alexfluor of labeled cetuximab with labeled sEG- FRdIII afforded a binding constant of 20 nM, essentially the same value as was observed using SPR (data not shown). To test for allostery, labeled cetuximab Fab was incubated with sEGFRdIII at concentrations ranging from 5 to 1000 nM in the presence of the cQFD meditope (66 ). The experiment was performed in triplicate. Similar to the SEC studies, no substantial change in the binding constant of the Fab-sEG- FRdIII interaction was observed. [0467] Taken together, these biochemical studies indicate that the meditope-Fab interaction does not substantially affect antigen binding. These observations are similar to results with Protein L and Protein A, which also bind to the Fab framework region without affecting antigen binding to Fab. [0468] cQFD Meditope does not Bind to CDR Loops of Cetuximab [0469] To further confirm that the meditopes did not bind to CDRs, binding between the cQFD meditope and the scFv fragment of cetuximab was assessed. In the scFv, the CDR loops remain intact, but the Fab variable domains are directly connected through a short peptide linker, eliminating the Fab constant domains. In other words, much of the meditope binding pocket is eliminated in the scFv, while the CDRs are minimally affected. SPR demonstrated that EGFR domain III and the cQFD meditope bound to cetuximab Fab tethered to a CM5 chip (See FIG. 4D). In addition, EGFR domain III bound with a minimal affinity loss to the scFv tethered to a second CM5 chip. Flowever, relative to Fab binding, the cQFD meditope did not saturate the scFv at concentrations as high as 100 of meditope. This indicates minimal, if any, affinity of the meditope for the CDRs, consistent with the crystallographic studies. [0470] cqFD Meditope Binding does not Affect Cetuximab Binding to EGFR-Expressing Cells [0471] As described above, the cetuximab Fab could bind to the cQFD meditope and EGFR domain III simultaneously. It was further shown that this meditope did not affect cetux \u00ad imab (full IgG) binding to EGFR-expressing cells. FACS analysis was used to follow the binding of the IgG, as a US 2012/0301400 Al 40Nov. 29, 2012 function of meditope concentration, to MDA MB-468 which overexpress EGFR. Cells were incubated concen trations. Even with meditope concentrations greater than 60 , no significant changes in cetuximab binding to the cells were observed. This observation is consistent with the SEC studies described above, and indicates that the meditope does not act as an allosteric regulator of antigen binding. [0472] Simultaneous binding to the Fab of EGFR domain III and the meditope is shown at concentrations significantly above the K13 of the meditope Like the cQFD and cQYN meditopes, superantigens SpA and PpL, bind to the Fab framework region and do not affect antigen binding (see Graille, M. et al. Crystal structure of a Staphylococcus aureus Protein A domain complexed with the Fab fragment of a human IgM antibody: structural basis for recognition of B-cell receptors and superantigen activity.

Evidence for plasticity and structural mimicry at the immunoglobulin light chain-Protein L \u00ad face. JBiol Chem 211, 47500-6 (2002)). [0473] Meditope Binding in Relation to Other Fab-Binding Proteins [0474] The meditope binding site on the Fab is distinct from that of other proteins that bind to the framework region of a Fab. For example, domain D of Protein A, isolated from Staphylococcus aureus, binds to the framework of heavy chain (Vh) of human IgG; the B1 domain of Protein L, iso\u00ad lated from Peptostreptococcus magnus, binds to the frame \u00ad work region of kappa light chain (Vi) of human IgG; and domain II of Protein G, isolated from a Streptococcal strain, binds to the framework of heavy chain (Vc) of human IgG. Unlike these interactions, in which the interface is predomi \u00ad nantly confined to a single Fab domain that is solvent-ex- posed, the meditope-Fab interface was shown to be formed by all four domains (e.g., the variable and constant domains of the heavy and light chains). [0475] The buried surface areas at the cQFD and cQYN meditope-cetuximab Fab interface were shown to be 904 (\u00b128) A2 and 787 (\u00b142) A2, respectively, and generally dis\u00ad tributed equally between the light and heavy chains. These values are roughly similar to those for the interfaces of the Protein A, L and G domains bound to their Fab domains: are two unique interfaces between the variable region of the Fab and Protein L, which buries 646 A2, and a minor interaction between the constant region of the Fab and Protein G, which buries 184 A2. [0476] Steric Mask [0477] The meditope can be tethered to the N-terminus of either the light chain or heavy chain N-terminus of a murine chimera or meditope-enabled human mAh through a flexible linker (FIG. 11). The N-termini of mAh IgGs are juxtaposed to the antigen binding site and the extension from the N-ter- mini through the flexible linker will sterically interfere with antigen binding. By encoding a tumor specific protease site (e.g., MMP9, MMP14, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) serine protease other linker, the steric con\u00adstraint of intramolecular \"masked \" IgG construct will be sev\u00ad ered at the tumor site and permit antibody binding. This design principle would avoid binding of the intramolecularly 'masked ' IgG to healthy tissues and avoid adverse side effects due to off-target binding. Off-rate determination for avidin- peptide mask on cetuximab showed that a multivalent medi \u00ad tope bound with higher affinity than a monovalent meditope, but did not mask. Example 4 Generation of Meditope-Enabled Antibodies [0478] Based on structural information, additional medi \u00ad tope-enabled antibodies were generated. [0479] A. Generation of Meditope-Enabled Trastuzumab by Mutation [0480] A meditope-enabled F1ER2-binding antibody was generated by mutating trastuzumab. The sequence differ \u00ad ences between the heavy and light chain variable region framework regions of a human IgG (trastuzumab-lN8Z.pdb) compared to those of cetuximab were mapped onto the crystal structure of cetuximab Fab bound to cQFD meditope. Resi \u00ad dues in the human framework corresponding to residues lin\u00ad ing the meditope binding site in cetuximab were mutated to contain the corresponding residues present in cetuximab; additionally, S9 and SlOof the light chain, according to Rabat numbering, were mutated to isoleucine and leucine, respec \u00ad FIGS. 23 A and 23C show nucleic acid sequences of a portion of the heavy chain (SEQ ID NO: 5) and the light chain (SEQ ID NO: 8), respectively, of the mutant (meditope-en \u00ad abled) trastuzumab. FIGS. 23B and 23D show the amino acid sequences of a portion of the heavy chain (SEQ ID NO:6) and light chain (SEQ ID NO: 9), respectively, of the meditope- enabled trastuzumab. FIGS. 23B and 23D also show a com\u00ad parison of these amino acid sequences and those of a portion of the heavy and light chain of wild type trastuzumab (SEQ ID NO:7 and SEQ ID NO:10, respectively). [0481] The nucleic acids encoding the heavy and light chains of this mutant, meditope-enabled trastuzumab were synthesized using standard methods and subcloned into a standard vector for mammalian expression. The meditope- enabled trastuzumab IgG was purified using standard meth \u00ad ods and characterized for the ability to bind to F1ER2 and the cQFD meditope. [0482] Meditope-Enabled Trastuzumab Binds to Indistinguishable PK/PD Properties as Wild-Type Trastuzumab [0483] In one study, to characterize antigen binding, wild- type trastuzumab and meditope-enabled trastuzumab were labeled with Alexa 647 using standard protocols. A cQFD (SEQ ID NO: I) meditope-Fc fusion protein (produced as described in Example 7 and shown in FIGS. 15 and 16) was labeled withAlexa488 using the same protocols. To show that the meditope-Fc binds to the meditope-enabled trastuzumab and not to the trastuzumab, 6), which with wild- type and meditope-enabled trastuzumab for 30 minutes. Unbound antibody was washed and the cells were incubated with the meditope-Fc construct for 30 minutes. Antibody binding and meditope binding were analyzed by FACS analy \u00ad sis. The data demonstrate that meditope-enabled tuzumab binds to F1ER2 expressed on the SKB R3 cells (e.g., the meditope site can be grafted onto an antibody without loss US 2012/0301400 Al 41Nov. 29, 2012 of antigen specificity) (FIG. 22A), and that the meditope-Fc binds to the meditope-enabled trastuzumab, but not to wild- type trastuzumab In another study, wild-type and meditope-enabled trastuzumab were labeled with Alexafluor 488 using standard protocols. SKBR3 cells (0.5xl0 6) were trypsinized, washed once with 0.1% BSA, and incubated with I, 10, or 100 nM wild-type or meditope-enabled trastuzumab, for 30 minutes. Unbound antibody was washed twice and analyzed by flow cytometry. The results are shown in FIG. 43, demonstrating that meditope-enabled trastuzumab had a similar affinity for antigen-expressing cells as did wild-type trastuzumab. [0485] In another study, a cQFD(SEQ ID NO: l)meditope- Protein L fusion protein (MPL) was labeled with Alexafluor 647 using the same standard protocols. SKBR3 cells were trypsinized, washed once with 0.1% BSA, and or meditope-enabled trastuzumab (TM) (by incubation for 30 minutes). The cells then were washed, followed by another 30 min incubation with 0.1 or I MPL (right). Cells were washed twice and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACS). Cells not pre-bound antibody (MPL (WT) only) were used as a negative control. The results are shown in FIG. 44. Histograms demonstrate that cells bound to meditope-enabled trastuzumab, but not unbound cells or cells bound to wild-type trastuzumab, bound to the meditope-Protein L fusion protein. Dot plots show percentage of cells in each quadrant relative to the MPL only control. [0486] As shown in FIG. 45, the same results were obtained using a meditope-Protein L in which all but one lysine in the Protein L were mutated to Arg/Asn residues (MPL-5K). [0487] These data demonstrate that meditope-enabled tras\u00ad tuzumab is able to bind to antigen to the same degree as the wild-type antibody, and that that the meditope-enabled tras\u00ad tuzumab (but not wild-type trastuzumab) binds to the medi- tope. Thus, these data confirm that binding of the meditopes to the meditope binding site of this antibody did not affect antigen binding in this study, demonstrating the tripartite interaction. [0488] FIG. 50 (top panel) shows stick representations of the structures of meditope 18 (SEQ ID NO: 18, shown in Table 3, with a ,'-diphenylalanine at position 5) bound to cetuximab (dark grey sticks), the same meditope (18) bound to meditope-enabled trastuzumab (white sticks), and wild- type trastuzumab (outline), superimposed. The bottom panel shows a ribbon cartoon comparing wild-type and meditope- enabled trastuzumab. The results demonstrate that the posi\u00ad tion of residues important for binding with the meditope are in nearly identical places in cetuximab and the meditope-en \u00ad abled trastuzumab. The right panel of FIG. 50 shows a ribbon cartoon of wild-type and meditope-enabled trastuzumab, demonstrating little difference in structure. [0489] Likewise, FIG. 51, in the upper-left panel, shows a superposition of the structures trastu \u00ad zumab memAb (labeled \"Meditope-enabled Memab \") involved in meditope-binding in the medi \u00ad tope-enabled antibody illustrated by sticks. The top right panel shows a superposition of the structures of meditope- enabled trastuzumab (memAb) and cetuximab, with the same residues labeled. As shown, Ile83 takes on two rotamers in the respective structures, which was determined not to be prob \u00ad lematic, given that in the meditope bound meditope-enabled trastuzumab crystal structure, it assumes the same rotamer as observed in cetuximab. The bottom panel is a 'cartoon/ribbondiagram ' figure of all three structures superimposed, demon \u00ad strating no significant differences overall. Some differences in CDR loops were observed, as expected (given binding of these antibodies to different antigens). [0490] Additionally, animal studies indicated that the bio\u00ad distribution of the meditope-enabled trastuzumab and wild- type trastuzumab were indistinguishable. [0491] These demonstrate that antibodies can be effec \u00ad tively meditope-enabled, while retaining other functions, by mutating residues to correspond with those in the meditope- binding interface of cetuximab. [0492] Meditope-Enabled Trastuzumab Binds to Sequentially or Pre-Mixed with Meditope [0493] Another study demonstrated that meditope bound to meditope-enabled trastuzumab with similar efficiency whether the cells were pre-bound with antibody (sequential) or a pre-formed meditope-antibody complex (pre-mixed) was applied to cells. The results are shown in FIG. 46. In this study, SKB R3 cells were trypsinized, washed once with meditope-enabled trastu (TM) for 30 min, washed, and then incubated for another 30 min with 4, 20, or 100 nM MPL (left panel). Alternatively, 10 nM of TM was premixed with 4, 20, or 100 nM of MPL for 30 min on ice, followed by application of the mixture to the cells for I hr (right panel). Cells were washed twice and analyzed by FACS. Percentage of MPL-positive cells relative to no-treatment control is shown in the legend. [0494] B. Generation of Meditope-Enabled HER2-Binding Antibody by CDR-Grafting [0495] meditope-enabled acid amino acid sequences of a heavy chain of trastuzumab are shown in FIG. 25 A (SEQ ID NOs : 11 and 12, respectively), with signal sequence and other sequences. Nucleic acid and amino acid sequence of a light chain of trastuzumab are shown in FIG. 25B (SEQ ID NOs : 13 and 14, respectively), with signal sequence and other sequences. [0497] While the \"boundaries \" of the CDR loops of mAbs have been clearly defined by sequence homology structural methods in general, the crystal structure of trastuzumab was superimposed onto cetuximab and the position of each resi\u00ad due examined to address potential differences outside of the CDR loops that may have a secondary effect on the confor \u00ad mation of the CDR loops; based tional modifications beyond modifying the CDRs . The amino acid sequences of the light and heavy chains of the antibody designed to contain trastuzumab-like CDRs on a cetuximab- Iike framework were translated into DNA sequences and the genes encoding each were synthesized. The amino acid and nucleic acid sequences of the resulting heavy and light chains of antibodies containing trastuzumab-like CDRs grafted onto cetuximab-like framework are shown in FIG. 47. Specifically, FIG. 47A shows light chain nucleic acid (SEQ ID NO: 60) and light chain amino acid (SEQ ID NO: grafted onto a cetuximab-like framework), with the signal sequence and other residues shaded. FIG. 47B shows heavy chain nucleic acid (SEQ ID NO: 62) and heavy chain amino acid (SEQ ID NO: 63) of this antibody. [0498] The genes were then subcloned in frame into the remaining IgG DNA sequence, confirmed by DNA sequenc \u00ad US 2012/0301400 Al 42Nov. 29, 2012 ing and placed in individual expression vectors . The resulting expression vectors were transfected into NSO cells for co\u00ad expression of the heavy and light chains. As the expressed full-length CDR-grafted IgG was secreted, the supernatant was clarified by centifugation, concentrated, and passed over a Protein A column. IgG was eluted using a low pH solution and immediately neutralized. SDS-PAGE (poly acrylamide gel electrophoresis) was carried out on the full-length CDR- grafted IgG, under reducing conditions. The results indicated two protein bands with apparent masses consistent with the light and heavy chain. The position of the bands migrated at similar positions compared to wild-type cetuximab. [0499] To characterize CDR-grafted, with Alexafluor dard protocols. As described above, cQFD (SEQ ID NO: I) meditope-Fc (produced as described in Example 7 and shown in FIGS. 15 and 16); Meditope-Fc was labeled with Alex- afluor 488 using the same protocols. To show that the medi- tope-Fc binds to the trastuzumab CDR-grafted, meditope- enabled mAh not to the R3 cells (0.5xl0 6) wild-type or CDR-grafted meditope-enabled trastuzumab as produced in this example, for 30 minutes. Unbound antibody was washed and the cells were incubated with the meditope-Fc construct for 30 minutes. Antibody binding and meditope binding were analyzed by FACS analy \u00ad sis. As an important component of the \"CDR-grafting. \" The results are shown in FIG. 24. The FACS data showed that the trastuzumab CDR-grafted, meditope-enabled mAh bound to HER2 expressed on the SKBR3 cells, demonstrating that CDR loops of one antibody (trastuzumab) grafted onto a meditope-enabled antibody (cetuximab) framework retain the ability to bind to antigen (HER2) (FIG. 24A). The FACS data also showed that bound to the trastu \u00ad zumab that a CDR-grafted meditope-enabled antibody binds to meditope. [0500] It is noted that optimizing the production of the CDR-grafted meditope-enabled trastuzumab would produce more material for more rigorous/quantitative characteriza \u00ad tion. The low amount of material and thus less rigorous/ quantitative characterization (e.g., uncertainty in the final concentration of the meditope-enabled trastuzumab and its labeling with Alexafluor 647) in this study likely accounted for the apparent reduced affinity. There are art-known meth \u00ad ods to optimize antigen binding. The data show that the CDR- grafted meditope-enabled trastuzumab bind the trastuzumab antigen (i.e., bind to HER2 overexpressing SKB R3 cells) and bind to the meditope of SEQ ID NO: I (i.e., the CDR-grafted meditope-enabled Antibody (Meditope-Enabled M5A) [0501] Additionally, an anti-CEA antibody (M5A) was meditope-enabled by mutation of residues to correspond to those of cetuximab. Specifically, as shown with shading in FIG. 56, eight point mutations were introduced in the light chain of the M5A antibody, allowing it to bind to meditopes. The wild-type heavy chain sequence and the meditope-en \u00ad abled light chain sequence were cloned into a Lonza glutamine selection expression vector and transfected in NSOcells. Two stable lines were obtained, expressing the medi \u00ad tope-enabled mAh at -5 mg/L. [0502] Binding of the meditope-enabled M5A to the M5A antigen (CEA) was demonstrated using LS174T cells by FACS. 500 nM of Alexa Fluor 488 labeled wild-type or medi \u00ad tope-enabled M5A was incubated with trypsinized cells and 9 of Alexa Fluor 647 labeled meditope-Protein L (see Example 10) for 30 min, room temperature. Cells were washed twice with 0.1% BSA and FACS analysis was per\u00ad formed. The results are shown in FIG. 57. Given that M5A is a humanized antibody with the same backbone as trastu \u00ad zumab, results showed that the meditope-Protein L bound readily to the wild-type M5 A. However, an enhanced binding was observed with the meditope-enabled M5A (M5A 8M), which is due to avidity gained from simultaneous binding of both the meditope and Protein L. [0503] Additionally, SPR measurements were carried out as described herein using surface plasmon resonance, con\u00ad firming binding of various meditope variants tope-enabled meditope 31, and the cQYN meditope (FIG. 58). Example 5 Modification of the Meditope Binding Site [0504] The residues lining the meditope-binding site of one ormore of the provided meditope-enabled antibodies, such as cetuximab, are systematically or randomly altered, for example, using degenerate libraries and selection, to enhance and/or change the specificity of the meditope or meditope analogs (see Sheedy et al. 2007 and Akamatsu et al. 2007, for methods of making alterations). Residues at these positions are substituted with natural or non-natural amino acids or both, for example, to improve the affinity of the meditope interaction and/or alter another property of the meditope- antibody interaction. [0505] Residues of meditope-enabled antibodies that make contact with the meditope, line the cavity, and/or are other \u00ad wise important (such as residues described for modification herein), are mutated. In one example, structural data, such as those obtained in the studies described above, are used to replace residues in the Fab, by mutagenesis, for example, to add additional hydrogen bonds, substitute amino acids for unnatural amino acids or alter the hydrophobic interface, for example, in ways that might better complement meditope binding. (See FIG. 21). [0506] In one example, individual residues are systemati \u00ad cally altered, followed by production and characterization of the mutant antibodies. Inanother example, a library of IgGs is generated at the DNA level using degenerate oligos at sites of interest to produce members that collectively encode all 20 naturally-occurring amino acids at the site or sites of interest, such that the library produces individual members of the library having each amino acid substituted at one or more given site. [0507] A GPI domain was added, e.g., to the C-terminus of the Ig heavy chain, of the antibodies in the library. In one example, the library is transfected using standard methods; antibodies (e.g., IgGs) from the library are expressed. [0508] To demonstrate binding to a GPI-Iinked meditope- enabled antibody according to these methods, a GPI-Iinked meditope-enabled trastuzumab was produced. FIG. 54 shows that this GPI-Iinked meditope-enabled trastuzumab bound to US 2012/0301400 Al 43Nov. 29, 2012 a meditope-Protein L (MPL), produced as described in Example 10, below. In this study, Ixl CF 6 cells/sample were used. Cells were removed from plates by gentle pipetting and were washed once with 0.1% BSA (w/v) in PBS. AF647 MPL was diluted to 10 nM in wash buffer and incubated with cells for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed twice and then analyzed by FACS. [0509] Antibodies produced from the library are screened for one or more desired traits. In one example, to select mutations that do not affect antigen binding, antibodies from the library (e.g., cells expressing the antibodies) that bind to a fluorescently labeled antigen to which the antibodies specifi \u00ad cally bind (e.g, HER2, EGFR, IGFR, CLTA-4, etc.) are selected, e.g, by FACS (FIG. 20). In one example, antibodies selected fortheir antigen-binding capabilities are subjected to another round of selection, for example, to select for mutant antibodies that bind to a specific meditope, meditope analog, or other molecule of interest. [0510] Following selection, the selected antibodies are characterized to determine the desired combination of muta \u00ad tions. In one example, following cell sorting, PCR is used to identify the resulting mutations that facilitate or enhance meditope/analog/small molecule binding. In one example, this process is repeated multiple times to 'evolve/optimize ' the desired characteristic, e.g, binding, pFl dependency, PK, and/or PD. Example 6 Variant Meditopes [0511] Several variant meditopes were generated. For example, certain meditope variants in Tables 3 and 4 (above) were synthesized, with demonstrated binding affinities to cetuximab. Forthepeptides in Table 3, a disulfide linkage was used to connect the C and N termini (except that meditope 31 contained an additional tail, meaning that the disulfide link\u00ad age is not between the two terminal residues). Meditopes 26, 27, 28, and 29 were biosynthesized and thus in this example, contained an additional serine before the first cysteine, Te, position zero. Further, in some embodiments, meditope 31 may optionally include a GGSK linker. For the peptides in Table 4, a lactam bridge, a linkage other than disulfide (such as [3+2] cycloaddition), or no linkage was used as the con\u00adnector. For example, meditope 55 is a linear peptide that binds within the meditope-binding site. Individual meditopes in these tables are discussed below. [0512] As described above, the cyclic peptide I) 2) were identified and co-crystallized with cetuximab Fab, and shown to bind in a cavity created by the light and heavy chains of the Fab. Bio\u00ad physical and biochemical methods were used to characterize this interaction. Specifically, mutation of Phe3, Leu5, and Arg8 to alanine reduced the affinity of the meditope for the binding interface by 44-183-fold. See Tables 6 and 7. [0513] Meditope Modification and Chemistry Design [0514] Based on the structural and thermodynamic data, multiple positions within the provided meditopes were iden\u00ad tified as targets for modification, e.g, with substitutions and/ or non-natural amino acids, for example, to enhance the over\u00ad all binding affinity and/or to alter another property. Modifications included generation of head-to-tail cyclic lac\u00ad tam peptides, modification of Arg8, modification of of Leu5, incorpora of 31). Modification of Arg8. [0516] Modifications were made to Arg8. Based on struc \u00ad tural data, it unmodified meditope (cQFD; SEQ ID NO: I) is extended, making a hydrogen bond with the heavy chain carbonyl of Q105 of the meditope-enabled antibody heavy chain. The immediate area about this residue is hydrophobic, yet solvent-exposed (FIG. 33A). [0517] Structural data indicated that incorporation of a modified Arg8 residue that maintains the guanidinium func \u00ad tionality for meditope-enabled antibody H-bonding, while simultaneously introducing a hydrophobic arm to partially fill the cavity, could produce significant gains in binding, due to entropic increases, as supported by ligand docking calcula \u00ad tions. [0518] A variant meditope was containing n-butyl-arginine at position 8, meditope 54 (SEQ ID NO: 54, shown in Table 4), as follows: Synthesis of Fmoc-N-butyl Arg Derivative 3 (Meditope 54) [0519] 16 US 2012/0301400 Al 44Nov. 29, 2012 [0520] To a stirred solution of 15, above, (23 mg, 0.03 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (0.6 mL) were added EDCI (12 mg, mmol, equiv) and n-butylamine (4.4 mg, 0.06 mmol, 2 equiv). After 5 min at room temperature (rt), the solvent was removed in vacuum. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (40-50% EtOAc/Hex) to afford the product above, NMR [0521] To a stirred solution of 16, above, (23 mg, 0.03 mmol) in THF (0.8 mL) were added N-methylaniline (10 mg, 0.09 mmol, 3 equiv) mg, 0.0015 mmol, 0.05 equiv) . After 45 min at rt, the solvent was removed in vacuum. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatogra \u00ad phy (MeOH:CH 2Cl2:HOAc=25:l:0.1) to afford the product mg, NMR See Martin, N. I., and Liskamp, R. M. J Org. Chem. 2008, 73,7849-7851. US 2012/0301400 Al 45Nov. 29, 2012 Synthesis [0524] Additionally, meditope 54 ((SEQ ID NO: 54), in the above structure) was prepared as according to solid phase Fmoc synthesis protocol using Fmoc-N-butyl Arg derivative 17. FIG. 59 shows an FlPLC trace and mass spectrum of meditope 54. [0525] The structure of meditope 54 bound to a cetuximab Fab fragment (backside view) is shown in FIG. 48, with structures of the 5-position ,'-diphenylalanine meditope (SEQ I, SEQ ID NO: I) superimposed. As shown in Table 7, below, medi \u00ad tope 54 was determined by SPR to bind to cetuximab with an average Kd of 745.2 nM. [0526] In some examples, this meditope-enabled antibody binding pocket identified in these studies is explored as described herein for new contacts (meditopes or analogs) that may increase affinity of a meditope-meditope-enabled anti\u00ad body interaction. [0527] Modification of Phe3. [0528] Various modifications were made to Phe3 of cQFD. Structural data demonstrated that the hydroxyl group of the meditope variant Phe3Tyr cQYN (SEQ ID NO: 2) has an alteration in the extended conformation of the Arg8 side chain as compared to cQFD (meditope I) (see FIGS. 30C and 35). SPR demonstrated that the overall affinity of this variant for the cetuximab Fab was reduced. ITC measurements indicated a significant decrease in entropy for this Phe3Tyr cQYN variant upon binding that was off-set by a favorable increase in enthalpy compared to unmodified [n=3]) (FIG. 30D). Structural data suggested the formation of a favorable hydro \u00ad gen bond network, with water bound to the Fab. [0529] It was determined that when bound to a meditope- enabled antibody, the hydrophobic phenyl ring of Phe3 was surrounded by a fairly polar array of side chain residues of a meditope-enabled antibody (cetuximab) Fab (FIG. 35). It wasdesired to introduce one or more halogen atom onto the phe\u00ad nyl ring, which could participate in halogen bonding (rela \u00ad tively strong non-covalent bonding, similar to a hydrogen bond but involving the interaction of a halogen such as bro\u00ad mine or chlorine with an oxygen atom), such as by incorpo \u00ad ration of an ortho-meta- and/or para-bromo phenyl substitu \u00ad ent to favorably place a bromine atom for halogen bonding with Tyr87 (light chain), Gln39, and/or Tyr91 (heavy chain) of a meditope-enabled antibody, respectively. Meditopes 36 (SEQ ID NO: 36), 37 (SEQ ID NO: 37), and 38 (SEQ ID NO: 38) were generated, containing 2-bromo-L-phenylalanine, 3-bromo-L-phenylalanine, and 4-bromo-L-phenylalanine, respectively, in place of the Phe at position 3. These medi \u00ad topes were co-crystallized with cetuximab Fab. These com\u00ad mercially available derivatives were incorporated by SPPS . Structures are shown in FIG. 39. Diffraction data are shown in FIG. 40. Affinities of some of these meditopes for the cetux \u00ad imab Fab (average Kd values) were determined by SPR and are listed in Table 7, below. [0530] Additionally, based on the structural information for the meditope containing a Phe3His mutation (meditope 33, SEQ ID NO: 33), a meditope was synthesized with ,'- diphenylalanine at position 3 (meditope 17, SEQ ID NO: 17). As shown in FIG. 41, a significant improvement in the bind \u00ad ing affinity for cetuximab was observed by SPR, representing a roughly 4-fold increase compared to cQFD (increase in affinity by a factor of approximately 4 to 5 (-200 nM)). [0531] Modification of Leu5 and LeulO. [0532] Modifications were made to Leu5 and LeulO. It was determined that the Leu5 and LeulO side chains make hydro- phobic contacts to the meditope-enabled Fab (FIG. 36, right panel; LeulO). In one example, natural amino acids (Phe/Tyr/ non-natural analogs (e.g., ,'-diphenylalanine, branched alkyl, extended such as napthyl, etc.) are systematically introduced via SPPS at one or both of these US 2012/0301400 Al 46Nov. 29, 2012 positions. The observation, above, that introduction of ,'- diphenylalanine at position three increased the overall affinity for the cetuximab Fab (see FIGS. 41-42), demonstrated suc- cessby introducing such non-natural amino acids inthemedi- topes. Accordingly, a ,'-diphenylalanine was introduced at position 5 and the average affinity of the resulting meditope (meditope 18, SEQ ID NO: 18) determined by SPR to be 687 nM (see Table 7, below). These data confirm that use of structural biology to identify regions for alteration and muta \u00ad tion of residues are useful to alter characteristics of the medi- topes, such as to improve their binding kinetics. In another embodiment, the same modification may be made to Leuf 0. [0533] Alternative Cyclization Strategies and Replacement of Disulfide Bridge [0534] Alternative cyclization strategies were used to replace the disulfide bridge in cQFD and other meditopes. As shown in Table 4, various lactam cyclization strategies were used, including those involving natural and non-natural amino acids, generated based on different starting materials, including glycine, -Ala, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, diamino- propionic acid, and isoaspartic acid, to produce different lac\u00ad tam ring sizes (see FIG. 31, left and middle boxes). [0535] In one example, a 7-aminoheptanoic acid was used to replace the disulfide bridge of the original cQFD meditope, and the affinity of the resulting meditope for the cetuximab Fab fragment determined by SPR (meditope 42, SEQ ID NO: 42). The SPR data are shown in FIG. 41, bottom panel. Although the binding affinity was decreased compared to cQFD, these data indicate that modifications can be made to the meditope to address potential issues with pharmacokinet \u00ad ics, pharmacodynamics and toxicity in animal and human studies. It is noted that alternative linkers can be combined with unnatural amino acids atotherpositions within the medi \u00ad tope. [0536] Other variant meditopes lactam glycine, 7-aminoheptanoic acid, -alanine, and diaminopropionic acid (see meditopes 42,43, 44, 45, 46, 49, 51, 52, 53, and 54, IistedinTable 4 and others). Affinities for some of these meditope variants for cetuximab Fab are listed in Table 7. [0537] An azide alkyne Huisgen cycloaddition was used to produce in meditope 50, by incorpo \u00ad rating propargy Iglycine at position 12 and beta-azidoalanine at position I and carrying out a cyclization between these termini. [0538] Additional cyclization strategies, such as 'click ' chemistry and olefin metathesis, also were used (FIG. 31, right boxes). For example, head-to-tail lactam peptides were designed and synthesized by solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) starting from Fmoc-Asp (Wang resin LL)-Oall (FIG. 31, lower left box & FIG. 32). One such variant, meditope 32 (SEQ ID NO: 32), with FITC conjugation, was shown to bind to cetuximab in a similar manner but with slightly reduced affinity compared to the unmodified meditope of SEQ ID NO: I produced include meditopes 33-47,49, and 50-54 (see Tables 4 and 7). Meditope 48 in Table 4 was engineered with a disulfide linkage and a with fluorescein for FACS analysis. In another example, this strategy is applied to conjugate the meditope with DOTA for in vivo PET imaging. [0540] Structural data demonstrated that additional posi\u00ad tions are amendable to cyclization, such as by cyclization between residues 3 and 11 or 4 and 11.[0541] Meditope 55, a linear peptide, was produced and demonstrated to bind to the meditope-enabled antibody, cetuximab, albeit with reduced affinity. [0542] Hydratable Carbonyl another example, a meditope with hydratable car\u00ad bonyl capabilities is developed to create a highly selective but irreversible interaction. Several Fab hydroxyl-bearing side chains in a meditope-enabled antibody that surround the meditope cavity are exploited through selective trapping, by formation of their corresponding hemi-acetal or -ketal, using a hydratable-enabled meditope. For example, Arg8 of the meditope extends in proximity to Ser43 of the light chain (3.5 A) and Tyr91 of the heavy chain (3.8 and 4.0 A) of the meditope-enabled antibody light chain, according to Rabat numbering (FIG. 36, left panel). In one example, incorpora \u00ad tion of a hydratable carbonyl functionality at the end of Arg8 or LeulO of the meditope allows selective formation of a serine or tyrosine hemi-acetal, which essentially affords irre\u00ad versible binding. In another example, a residue containing boronic acid is integrated into the meditope as an alternative to a hydratable carbonyl group. Boronic acid plays an impor \u00ad tant role in the structural activity of bortezamib (Velcade\u00ae), which is used to treat multiple myeloma. Representative examples of such hydratable residues are also shown in FIG. 36 or 34, where R=\u2014CH2CHO or \u2014CH 2B(OH) 2. In some examples, such analogs are modified using SPPS (Duggan, P J. and D. A. Offermann (2007). \"The Preparation of Solid- Supported Peptide Boronic Acids Derived from 4-Borono-L- phenylalanine and their Affinity for Alizarin, \" Australian Journal of Chemistry, 60(11): 829-834. [0544] Other Methods [0545] In some examples, fluorescence polarization assays are used to identify meditope variants that can displace a given meditope, such as SEQ ID NO: I. In other examples, the same technique is used to identify small molecules that can displace the meditope and then use these small molecules as templates to further improve the binding affinity of the meditopes. [0546] Characterization of Meditopes [0547] For characterization, variant meditope peptide Iyo- philized powders were suspended in 500 pL of 10 mM Tris pH 8.0 buffer and dialyzed 3 times into I L OfH 2O each time. The final volume after dialysis was carefully measured and absorbance measurements were taken to estimate the concen \u00ad tration (typically I-IOmM). These stock solutions were used to make dilutions into HBS-EP buffer (10 mM Hepes pH 7.4, 150 NaCl, mM v/v surfactant P20) for SPR measurements. were carried out on the GE Biacore TlOO instrument using a CM5 chip with cetuximab IgG cetuximab Fab ligand immobilized using amine coupling chemistry. Ligands were immobilized at low levels suitable for kinetic data. Typical kinetics SPR experi \u00ad ments were carried out at a flow rate of 30 pL/min using HBS-EP as both running and regeneration buffer. Kinetic parameters were calculated using the performed in mM Hepes, pH 7.4 at 25\u00b0 C. using Nano ITC calorimeter (TA Instruments). In a typical experiment, 250 of protein (Fab or IgG) at 0.03-0.06 mM were loaded into the calorimeter cell (163 or 185 ) and the titrant (meditope, at 0.3-0.8 mM) was loaded into a 50 syringe. The cell solution was stirred at 250 rpm and upon equilibra \u00ad tion the titrant was added in 2-2.5 increments. Heat of the US 2012/0301400 Al 47Nov. 29, 2012 reaction was measured and the data was processed using NanoAnalyze software (TA Instruments). Background heat was subtracted by averaging the last four measurements or by subtracting heat of reaction obtained from titration of the meditope at the same concentration into buffer containing no protein. [0549] A number of the meditope variants were co-crystal- fragment. Meditopes were purified to >95% homogeneity and structurally characterized by mass spectrometry. Peptides were dialyzed in water. Their concen \u00ad trations were measured, for example, in some cases, by UV- Vis and calibrated with elemental analysis, and diluted (>100x) into the appropriate buffer. The structures of some of these meditope variants, corresponding to SEQ ID NOs: 15-18, 22-25 and 31-40, are shown in FIG. 39. [0550] Interactions of various meditopes with the medi- tope-enabled antibody cetuximab were characterized by X-Ray diffraction. Since the co-crystallization conditions of the cetuximab Fab fragment and the meditope of SEQ ID NO: I are well-established, diffraction quality crystals were typi\u00ad cally obtained in I to 3 days, typically I day. Full data sets were collected in 8 to 12 hours with an in-house source (Rigaku007-F1F and an R-Axis IV++) and in less than IOmin at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource, which allows for rapid characterization of the interactions of the meditope variants with cetuximab. [0551] Diffraction data were collected for various different meditope-Fab (cetuximab) complexes, including complexes containing the cQFD (SEQ I) and cQYN and modified meditopes. X-ray diffraction data for several meditopes are shown in FIG. 40. Most of these co-crystal structures were shown to diffract beyond 2.4 A and be well refined, with R and Riiee less than 20 and 24%, respectively. All of these meditope variants have very good stereochemical values (Molprobity scores above 89 tA percen \u00ad tile). [0552] For SPR measurements, low density and high den\u00ad sity chips were conjugated with the cetuximab Fab or full IgG. Each chip was first characterized using a soluble frag\u00ad ment of the entire extracellular domain of EGFR (residues 1-621). Similarkinetics and binding affinities were observed as previously reported. Using the low density chips, on and off rates were measured for the unmodified meditope and I and 2, con\u00ad sistent with ITC, similar values for the Fab-conjugated chip and the IgG-conjugated chip were observed, demonstrating that either can be used for binding assessments. [0553] Table 7, below, lists information on the average dis\u00ad sociation constants (K13S), which were determined by SPR, for several of the meditopes listed in Tables 3 and 4.

ITC measurements were performed on a TA Instruments nanoITC, with as little as I -2 mg of peptide permeasurement. ITC, SPR and X-ray diffraction data, e.g., collectively, pro\u00ad vide atomic detail to guide subsequent chemical modifica \u00ad tions and ultimately improve the affinity of the meditopes and/or make other alterations to the meditopes. A calculation based on AG=-RT In Ka shows that the difference between micromolar and nanomolar affinity of a meditope for cetux \u00ad imab results from a change in free energy at 300 K of -4 kCal/mol, which is on the order of a strong hydrogen bond. Thus, the loss of an ordered water molecule from a protein binding pocket or the reorientation of an amino acid residue- chain may be sufficient to alter binding by orders of magni \u00ad tude. [0555] The data in this example demonstrate that a large number of meditope permutations may be systematically and efficiently introduced, indicating that a large number of medi \u00ad tope variant permutations may be generated, for example, to produce altered meditope-meditope enabled antibody bind \u00ad ing affinity, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), toxicity, and/or ability to bind or strength of binding under differing conditions, such as pH, e.g., pH dependence, for example, to produce high affinity meditopes. US 2012/0301400 Al 48Nov. 29, 2012 [0556] In one example, after characterization by ITC, SPR and diffraction methods, the meditope with the highest affin \u00ad ity (or other desired property, e.g., pH dependence) is subse \u00ad quently modified, e.g., to further improve the desired property (e.g., overall affinity or pH dependence). Example 7 Generation of Multivalent Meditopes [0557] Bivalent and other multivalent e.g., for use in enhancing selectivity and/or binding affinity by \"cross-linking \" meditope-enabled antibodies on the surface of cells expressing antigen. [0558] Bivalent Meditope-Fc [0559] The use of the Fe region to 'dimerize ' ligands is established and described, for example, by Jazayeri J A & Carroll G J., \"Fc-based cytokines: prospects for engineering superior I) was fused to the N-terminus of the Fe region of an IgG through a flexible peptide linker of 17 amino acids in length, comprised of glycine and serines . The length of the linker was chosen to roughly match the distance between the Fabs of an IgG. The nucleic acid and amino acid sequences of the result \u00ad ing \"meditope-Fc \" are shown in FIG. 15 (SEQ ID NO: 3 and 4, respectively). The structure of the meditope-Fc is shown in FIG. 16. [0560] To demonstrate enhanced binding to antigen afforded by the multivalency of the meditope-Fc, 0.5xl0 6 MDA-MB-468 cells were labeled with 10 nM cetuximab for 30 min at room temperature, washed, then incubated with 0.1, 0.3, 1 and3 of bivalent meditope-Fc or monomeric medi \u00ad tope for 30 min at room temperature, washed, and then ana\u00ad lyzed by FACS. As shown in FIG. 17, FACS analysis dem\u00ad onstrated that the meditope-Fc, corrected for the stoichiometry, bound to cells pre-treated with cetuximab with higher affinity compared to the meditope monomer. The inter \u00ad action was demonstrated to be specific to the meditope-en \u00ad abled mAh (cetuximab). These data demonstrate synergy using meditope-Fc, combined with a meditope enabled mAh, and thus that a bivalent meditope can be substituted for a second antibody to produce syneigistic effects. [0561] In another study, the meditope-Fc fusion protein was labeled with Alexa488 as described above. MDA-MB- 468 cells were labeled with cetuximab or M425 (a murine anti-EGFR antibody) for 30 minutes. Unbound antibody was washed and the cells were incubated with the meditope-Fc (600 nM, 180 nM, or 60 nM) for 30 minutes. Antibody bind \u00ad ing and meditope binding were analyzed by FACS analysis. The FACS data, shown in FIG. 49 demonstrate that the medi- tope-Fc bound to the cells incubated with cetuximab, but not to cells incubated with M425 or those not incubated with any antibody, with increasing signal at higher concentrations of meditope-Fc. [0562] Similar to the FACS experiments described above, MDA-MB-468 cells were treated with Alexa 555-labeled cetuximab, washed, incubated with Alexa 488-labeled medi- tope-Fc, and The cells were then by microscopy (FIG. 61A). Strong surface-associated staining of Cetuximab was observed. The meditope-FC also localized to the cell surface and appeared to co-localize with cetuximab (FIG. 61A). Concomitant with this staining, we also observe the co-localization of the labeled meditope-Fc was observed(FIG. 61A, white arrows). This co-localization, however, was absent in cells which that were not pre-treated with cetuximab (FIG. 61B). [0563] Taken together, these experiments show that the meditope binds to EGFR-expressing cells that are pre-treated with cetuximab, that using a multivalent scaffold affords cre\u00ad ates a higher apparent affinity for cetuximab pre-treated cells, and that the apparent binding affinity, in this study, was more sensitive. [0564] The ability of a bivalent meditope-Fc to induce cell death in conjunction with the meditope-enabled antibody, cetuximab, was confirmed using an MTT assay. 4000 MDA- MB-468 cells were placed in each well of a 96 well plate in 80 of medium. 10 of I cetuximab was added along with 10 of 0.1, I or 10 of monovalent meditope (cQFD \u2014 (control) or bivalent meditope-Fc (two cQFDs) to a final concentration of 0.1 cetuximab and 0.01, 0.1 and I meditope or meditope-Fc. Each component was also added alone with PBS as control. After a 48-hour incubation, 10 of MTT reagent was added and allowed to incubate for another 4 hours. The culture supernatant was then removed, 100 of MTT crystal dissolving reagent was added, and the plate was read at 630 nm. Neither addition of monovalent meditope (alone or with cetuximab), or meditope-Fc alone altered cell growth significantly. Addition of meditope-Fc together with cetuximab, however, inhibited cell growth, as shown in FIG. 28A. [0565] The ability of the multivalent meditope-Fc to enhance cell killing by cetuximab to a degree comparable to a second anti-EGFR antibody was demonstrated by MTT assay. The assay compared the enhancement of cetuximab- mediated inhibition of antigen-expressing tumor cell growth by meditope-F c and by M425 (a mouse anti-EGFR antibody) . 4000 MDA-MB-468 cells were placed in each well of a 96 well plate in 80 of medium. 10 of I cetuximab was added, along with 10 of either 2, 4 or 8 of meditope-Fc or M425, to a final concentration of 0.1 cetuximab and either 0.2, 0.4 or 0.8 meditope-Fc or M425. cetuximab added with PBS alone was used as control. After a 48-hour incubation period, 10 MTT reagent was added and the mixture allowed to incubate for an additional 4 hours. The culture supernatant was removed, 100 of MTT crystal dissolving reagent added, and the plate read at 630 nm. As shown in FIG. 28B, meditope-Fc and M425 enhanced the cell-killing capacity of cetuximab to a similar degree. [0566] In some examples, the composition of and the dis\u00ad tance between the Fe and meditope are systematically explored to optimize affinity and specificity. In one example, each natural or unnatural residue is substituted at any position within the linker, for optimization. In another example, the linker is 'rigidified ' to limit the radius of gyration and to enhance the affinity and specificity of the Fc-meditope. In one example, a coiled coil domain is placed between the meditope and the Fe (FIG. 18). In another example, inert protein domains (e.g., immunoglobulin folds) are substituted for the linker. In one example, multiple immunoglobulin folds are placed between the meditope and the Fe domain. In certain examples, the composition of the linker is of human origin, e.g., to mitigate potential antigenicity. [0567] Multivalent Scaffolds [0568] To address the receptor were coupled to multivalent scaffolds. [0569] designed to adjacent IgGs to form a \"daisy-chain \"-like array (see FIG. US 2012/0301400 Al 49Nov. 29, 2012 8). Synthesis of a FITC-Iabeled bivalent meditope was devel \u00ad oped using \"Click using compound 2 (SEQ ID NO: 32). Templates 4 and 5 of FIG. 13, were used to form bl\u00ad and trivalent meditopes, respectively. A 30 A PEG bifunc \u00ad tional arm was incorporated in the synthesis beled bivalent meditope containing meditopes of SEQ ID NOs: 32 (meditopes 32), namely compound 13, shown in FIG. 13. As also shown in FIG. 13, a trivalent meditope (compound 14) also was successfully synthesized. FIG. 14 illustrates the characterization of this fluorescein isothiocy \u00ad anate (FITC)-Iabeledmeditope compound 13. [0570] In other examples, differing lengths of polyethylene glycol (PEG) (and other) linkers are used, for example, to optimize binding. In other examples, this synthetic approach is used to incorporate DOTA for radionuclide imaging. The distance between the CDR regions within an IgG is -130 A. End-to-end distances of commercially available PEGs extend to 90 A (Pierce), which would exceed the IgG distance. In one example, the length of the PEG linker is systematically var\u00ad ied, bearing in mind this constraint. [0571] In some examples, trivalent or higher valency scaf\u00ad folds are used, with the goal of having more than one antibody \"daisy chained \". In some example, different scaffolds and linkers are used to generate high affinity multivalent medi \u00ad topes. In one example, DNA is used as a more rigid scaffold. [0572] Different scaffolds of biological and chemical ori\u00ad gin also are used to achieve multivalency. This includes, but is not limited to, constructing a bivalent or trivalent scaffold, using like. A chemical scaffoldmay also be created using molecules including, but not limited to, DNA (single strand, duplex, Holliday junctions, aptamers and the like), RNA (single strand, hairpin, stem loop, aptamers and the like), nucleic acids), duplexes and triplexes for rigidity, inorganic or organic nanoparticles (directly coupled or coupled through organic polymers such as PEG), organic polymers that can form duplexes with themselves and/or with DNA or PNA. [0573] Multivalent Meditope Characterization are char\u00ad acterized by SPR and ITC, to verify that conjugation to the multivalent scaffold does not affect the meditope-IgG inter \u00ad action. [0575] In other examples, FACS analysis, cell viability assays, and other assays are used. For example, cell viability assays are used as described above for meditope-Fc to quan \u00ad tify the effect of the multivalent meditope directly on cells that overexpress the antigen recognized by the meditope- enabled antibody of choice, such as EGFR when the medi- tope-enabled antibody is cetuximab. is used to quantify the number or percentage of viable cells . In some examples, a shift at far lower concentrations than observed for the corresponding monovalent meditope and/or a relative increase in percentage of cells that shift, is observed. [0576] In some examples, for multivalent meditopes that demonstrate activity in such assays, Western blot analysis is performed to follow other parameters, such as phosphoryla \u00ad tion status of EGFR, AKT, and MAPK in the case of antibod \u00ad ies targeting the EGFR signaling pathway, such as cetuximab.In one example, the data are compared with data from anti\u00ad body (e.g., cetuximab)-only treated cells and cells treated with inhibitors (e.g., tyrosine kinase inhibitors (AG1478)). An increase in cell death as a function of multivalent medi \u00ad tope concentration is observed. [0577] In one example, to further confirm the additive effects of the multivalent meditope, the non-labeled, monova \u00ad lent meditope is used with the labeled multivalent meditope for the antigen-bound cetuximab. Example 8 Meditope Binding Affinity as a Function of pH [0578] The composition of the meditope was altered to affect the binding affinity as a function of pH. As shown in FIG. 27, the binding affinity of three different meditope vari\u00ad ants was measured as a function of buffer pH. The results demonstrated that cQYD (SEQ ID NO: 16, meditope 16) meditope variant had a marked decrease in affinity for the meditope-enabled antibody cetuximab at lower pH. Substi \u00ad tution of the aspartate to asparagine in the cQYN variant produced a flat pH dependence. The affinity of the cQFD meditope (SEQ ID NO: I) was determined to be slightly greater at higher pHs. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the affinity of the meditope-memAb interaction can be tailored to pH, which is used, for example, to generate medi \u00ad tope variants for the specific release at low pH, such as in lysozymes for drug delivery, and/or to bind with higher affin \u00ad ity in a hypoxic environment, e.g., tumor stroma. Example 9 Meditope Analogs, Fragments, and Other Com \u00ad pounds [0579] Screening methods were carried out to identify meditope analogs and compounds, such as small molecules, fragments, aptamers, nucleic acid molecules, peptibodies and/or other substances that bind meditope-enabled antibod \u00ad ies near meditope-binding sites and in some aspects can be linked to meditopes, for example, to improve their affinities for the meditope-binding sites. [0580] Fluorescence Polarization Assays: [0581] To identify compounds, including alternative mol\u00ad ecules that could bind at the meditope binding site of medi \u00ad tope-enabled antibodies and thus be used for similar func \u00ad tions, a displacement assay was established. A cyclic meditope was synthesized and chemically attached to a fluo\u00ad and the fluorescence polarization measured. The inter \u00ad action between the labeled meditope and mAh cause a change in the fluorescence polarization/intensity of the fluorescent tag. The dissociation constant, I , closely matched values obtained from surface fluorescein-label peptide pre-bound to cetuximab. The fluorescence polarization was monitored. Compounds that blocked the meditope-antibody interaction altered the fluo\u00ad rescent polarization properties. As shown in FIG. 37, a sig\u00ad US 2012/0301400 Al 50Nov. 29, 2012 moid curve indicative of a competition reaction was observed. Accordingly, this method is useful for identifying meditope analogs. [0582] Based on these data, an initial screen to identify small molecules capable of displacing the meditope was car\u00ad ried out. In this study, 42 lead compounds at concentrations of 50 were identified from a library of 30,000 small mol\u00ad ecule compounds. FIG. 38 shows five such lead compounds. [0583] In another example, these compounds are character \u00ad ized further, for example, by crystallography. [0584] Diffraction Methods. [0585] Cetuximab Fab was shown to diffract beyond 2.5 A, as shown above. Established diffraction-based methods (well-established for identifying lead compounds (Shuker et al. 1996; Erlansonet al. 2001; Flughes et al. 2011)) were used to identify candidate compounds, including compounds that can be coupled to a meditope, for example, to improve affinity for the meditope binding site. A library of small molecules was developed to soak into crystals of cetuximab. Diffraction data from these soaks was collected and several data sets analyzed. In these initial studies, two additional sites were identified on cetuximab that are amendable for fragment growth and optimization. [0586] In another example, such fragments (small mol\u00ad ecules that can serve as building blocks for larger entities), such as chemical groups, e.g., imidazole or other chemical group, are grown (chemically derivatized) to enhance their binding and specificity and/or are chemically tethered to the meditope. Optimization of this chemical coupling can signifi \u00ad cantly the overall binding affinity. [0587] NMR was tion of meditopes, e.g., by linkageto the meditope, and/or use in lieu of the meditope (i.e., as meditope analogs). To identify these leads, one dimensional (ID) spectra of pools containing 15 to 20 fragments were collected. Cetuximab was added to each pool and second ID spectra were collected. Compounds that bound (transiently) with cetuximab underwent rapid magnetization transfer, resulting in a loss of intensity. The spectra were compared before and after addition of cetux \u00ad imab and altered peaks identified, indicating interactions. [0589] In one example, these peaks are pre-assigned to a specific compound, and thus immediately known. Alterna \u00ad tively, the pools are subdivided and the spectra recollected. After several rounds, the exact identity of the compound is known. In these experiments, the precise position of the inter \u00ad action is not known. The binding site is determined by NMR or the fluorescence polarization assay. Alternatively, the Fab fragment is labeled with NMR active and inactive nuclei (e.g., 13C, 15N and 2H), followed by multiple NMR experiments performed to assign the spectrum, and use of the fragment library to identify the binding position. Using this procedure, a set of initial lead compounds has been identified (FIG. 19, bottom). [0590] Virtual Ligand Screening: [0591] Virtual ligand screening was used to identify lead compounds to function as meditopes. Using crystal structure, standard programs (e.g., Schroerdinger Glide) were used to define a \"box ' about a site of the macromolecule (the medi \u00ad tope binding site); known ligands were docked to this site. Potential lead compounds were scored by a select energy function. In this study, approximately 100 lead compounds were identified.[0592] In another example, additional analogs found by diffraction methods are optimized and used in lieu of the meditope for drug delivery, multivalent scaffolding and other functions. [0593] In another example, mutations in the light and heavy chains are made to change the specificity of the ligand (medi \u00ad tope) and all the above-described methods rescence polarization, NMR screening, phage display, and diffraction methods are used to optimized alternative ligands . Example 10 Meditope-Protein L Fusion [0594] Characterization by diffraction of the cQFD medi- tope-enabled Fab fragment bound to a meditope demon \u00ad strated that the N- and C-termini of the meditope were juxta \u00ad posed to the location of bound Protein L, a bacterial protein that binds to human IgGs. See FIG. 52, showing the crystal structure of meditope 18 (5-,' -diphenyl), Protein L (left), Protein A (right) and Fab (grey cartoon) and meditope-en- abled trastuzumab Fab. [0595] To generate a meditope that binds to meditope-en- abled antibodies with greater affinity via eneigy additivity, a meditope-Protein L fusion polypeptide was produced. Based on structural data information, four glycines were introduced to link the C-terminus of the cQFD meditope and the N-ter- minus of Protein L. The coding sequence of a meditope- Protein L fusion protein is set forth in SEQ ID NO: 56. [0596] The amino acid sequence of an encoded protein, including a His6-Smt3 tag (plain text), meditope (under \u00ad lined), and Protein L (bold) is set forth below and in SEQ ID of the meditope-Protein L fusion protein, after cleavage of the tag, is set forth below (meditope underlined; two cysteins that are cyclized (e.g., by peroxide or overnight with air) set forth in bold text) SEQ ID Binding constants for the interaction of this fusion protein (and separately, the interaction of each individual component) with meditope-enabled antibody trastuzumab were measured by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) . The binding constant for the interaction between Protein L and the meditope-enabled trastuzumab was approximately 0.5 . For the interaction between the meditope and the meditope- enabled trastuzumab Fab fragment, it was approximately I . The binding constant for the interaction between the meditope-Protein L fusion protein and the IgG, however, was 165 pM. FIG. 53 shows surface plasmon resonance (SPR) US 2012/0301400 Al 51Nov. 29, 2012 data for a meditope-Protein L fusion (MPL) : The top panel shows the traces of MPL being added to the meditope-en- abled trastuzumab at concentrations up to 10 nM. The fit data indicates a binding affinity of 165 pM. The bottom panel shows the traces of Protein L (only) added at the same con\u00ad centrations to the meditope-enabled trastuzumab, showing that there was no binding at this concentration in this study. This result demonstrated far stronger binding between the fusion protein and meditope-enabled antibody compared to the individual interactions, indicating improved affinity via additivity. [0599] Point mutations were created in Protein L and the meditope to ensure specificity. As expected, in both cases, the binding constant was reduced. [0600] To facilitate conjugation of various molecules, such as therapeutic and diagnostic agents, e.g., cytotoxins, radio \u00ad nucleotides, for example, DOTA, proteins, solid supports, and other molecules, e.g., for drug delivery, imaging, or puri\u00ad fication, all lysines in the Protein L-meditope fusion protein but one were mutated to arginine or another residue. The crystal structure shown in FIG. 52 was used to identify all lysines on Protein L and the meditope that, if conjugated, would sterically occlude the meditope-Protein L/meditope- enabled antibody interaction. Based on this information, the meditope-Protein L fusion (MPL) having the sequence set forth ID NO: 59 (SCQFDLSTRRL- RCGGGGSEVTIRVNLIFADGNIQTAE- FRGTFEEATAEAYRYAALLARV NGEYTADLEDGGN- in which certain lysines in Protein L/meditope (shown in black in FIG. 52\u2014all but one lysine) were mutated to Arg or Asn. In the sequence shown above, the residues mutated from lysine to arginine/aspar- agine are shown in bold text. The lysine that was not mutated (underlined above) is pointed into the solvent. Thus, in the resulting meditope-Protein L fusion protein, the N-terminal amine and epsilon amine were left for conjugation, the latter being solvent exposed and likely more reactive. [0601] In another example, this unique lysine residue in this mutant is used to PEGylate the MPL, e.g., to address potential antigenicity. [0602] MPL-DOTA-NHS [0603] having the SEQ ID NO: 59 was conjugated to DOTA-NHS in a reaction carried with various ratios (0.5:1,2:1, 10:1, 30:1, 60:1, 120:1, 240:1) of starting material (DOTA-NHS:MPL) in phosphate buffer (80 mM) for 10 minutes at a pH=l 0, which favors conjugation to lysine as compared to N-terminal conjugation. product increases with increasing DOTA- NHS . A significant amount of MPL-mono-DOTA-MPL was formed at a 60:1 ratio, and a significant amount of both MPL-mono-DOTA and MPL-di-DOTA formed at a 120:1 ratio (FIG. 60). [0604] The foregoing examples and methods of the inven \u00ad tion are illustrative only and are not intended to be limiting of the invention in any way. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that various modifications of the foregoing are within the intended scope of the invention.
