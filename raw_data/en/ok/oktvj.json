Homeopathic, Holistic, Alternative, Integrative, Natural health methods may be the answer you have been looking for. \"It can be liberating to transition from a system of medical management to self-directed health and wellness.\" \"The Alternative: Your Family's Guide to is by Elena Upton, Ph.D., a classically trained Homeopath. It contains the usual disclaimers for health-related books. The type-face that's been used seems particularly small and at times was difficult to read, but there is plenty of white-space, so that does help. The first few chapters of the book focus on the history and implementation of natural medicine and some of its different disciplines. Of particular interest is \"How Did We Get Here?\" which deals with the 1908 report by Abraham Flexner, commissioned by the Carnegie Foundation to study medical schools in the United States. It's alleged that, within a few years of its publication, the recommendations of the report were responsible for the demise of not only most of the medical schools in the U.S. (those that weren't affiliated with a University), but also most of the alternative medicine options. Also mentioned is the \"Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973\" which made health care in this country a for-profit enterprise. While the book centers on homeopathy, there is some introductory information about Chinese medicine and acupuncture, naturopathy, and chiropractic and osteopathic processes. Most of the book is dedicated to setting forth the causes and symptoms of common maladies and injuries and the homeopathic remedies for them, but some of the entries include other types of treatment possibilities. This is a great book for Inquiring Minds that Want to Know more about natural medicine, why it isn't currently at the forefront of medical care in the U.S. like it is in the rest of the world, and some examples of how to implement it. But this book will also work for someone who already has an interest in homeopathy or other healing arts. There are actual remedy dosages listed in this book. I've read a lot of herbals and other books of natural and alternative medicine, and it's refreshing to find this information actually put forth. It has to do with the nature of homeopathic remedies themselves -- there's pretty much no way you can hurt yourself with them and that's the crux of the controversy. I don't know that homeopathy will every be my go-to medical route, but there's a lot of information in this book that's still useful and relatable. I'm very happy to have this book in my library. Elena Upton clearly explains and addresses the different types of alternative medicine in her book The Alternative: Your Family's Guide to Wellness. She addresses the commercial interest the pharmaceutical companies, and the government has in the drug world. Someone desiring to know more about alternative medicine would find this a wealth of information. The research and practical applications is valuable for future reference when treatment is needed for an ailment. I found Elena Upton clarifies much of the confusion in the work of alternative medicine. The Alternative: Your Family's Guide to Wellness focuses on teaching about the different methods and cleansing your body of toxins that cause the diseases and illnesses that trouble you. I loved the information on the skin detoxification. Who really thinks of the attention this organ needs? This is a book I will read multiple times and savor the wealth of information the author discloses to her readers. You feel as if the author cares for and about you, an excellent book. This is perfect for both newbies and those experienced with the homeopathic lifestyle. I'm pretty new to homeopathic methods of healing, while I don't know if going completely homeopathic is right for my family it is nice to have this stuff in the arsenal to use before I do any medicines with questionable ingredients. I like that this is really easy to follow and very clear what to do for each ailment. I love that I can go through the table of contents and tap on what is wrong and it will instantly take me to the solution. This book really opened my mind. I really feel like this book would be helpful to newbies like me as well as those who are well versed in the homeopathic world. I know I mentioned it earlier but I really like the format of this book, it makes it so easy to find exactly what I am looking for when I need it. It's even better that I can keep it on my phone on my kindle app so it's at my fingertips all the time! This book is certainly a good deal. I have one similar but it's in German, so this is nice to have as I speak mainly English now and don't have to constantly look up translations. This one gives those of us who may not be so familiar with alternative medicine, a insightful and enlightening look at what is considered alternative medicine, how to use it and what to expect with the most common treatments out there. There is so much information in here that it may be wise to get a paperback copy for you to be able to highlight and reference when needed. This was very well written and easy to understand. I am familiar with some concepts, mainly the ones pertaining to thyroid and anemia issues. However, this is good to get because it is so well-rounded. The section on how to build and utilize your own home pharmacy was especially valuable for me This book is about alternative healing and what natural medicine can be used in place of big pharmacy medication. This book contains a vast amount of information on cleansing your body of toxins and using natural healing methods to return your body to pristine condition. This book discusses the history of medicine and how it became what it is today and then offers an alternative to this normal practice. I found this to be a useful tool to gain knowledge of alternatives to the mainstream medicine used today. A good read with useful information as well as being very educational. "}
