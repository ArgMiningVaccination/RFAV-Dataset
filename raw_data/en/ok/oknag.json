They are infections that patients acquire while being hospitalized to receive treatment for...", "sitename": "ipl.org", "date": "2023-01-01", "cleaned_text": "In the paediatric ward in hospitals infection control and prevention is very important. Service users in hospital are much more prone to infections and diseases as they are already unwell therefore extra precautions are always taken. This includes service providers ensuring that their vaccinations are up to date, working in a Through the learning from week 1 and week 2, I have learnt that the most frequent adverse event in health-care delivery is health care-associated infections. It is essential for us to follow the infection control practices that both patients and us are at a risk of being infected. Standard Precautions involve the use of safe work practices and protective barriers, for example, the use of personal protective equipment(PPE). At first, I think Standard Precautions are very easy. Everyone knows PPE can protect us from infections and hand hygiene is important throughout the process. However, what I ignored and did wrong were the correct sequences of wearing PPE and how to use them correctly. The sequences are totally different when taking on and Clostridium difficile infection and transmission prevention continues to represent difficult and serious challenge in patient safety and infection prevention. A single inpatient Clostridium difficile infection costs more than $35,000 in average and the estimated yearly cost burden for the health care system is more than $3 billion (MedPage Today, 2012). The epidemiology of Clostridium difficile infection is continue to change, and its presence in the community and the healthcare settings has caused healthcare personnel continue to re-evaluate approaches and perspectives. A work environment requires more consideration for those around you and how your actions impact their health and wellbeing. It is astonishing to realise how quickly germs can spread through basic hygiene neglect. Improper patient safety has been an issue plaguing the medical industry since day one. It's extremely important that we medical professionals follow the protocols that are put in place. Safety covers proper hygiene, from washing your hands before and after handling patients to prevent infection and spread of disease, Infection control refers to action devoted to policies and procedures that reduce the risk of spreading infections, reduce the occurrence of diseases caused by bacteria and viruses, parasite. The infectious diseases are normally spread by human to human, human to animal contact or by ingestion of food, droplet in the air, and contact with a surface that is the vehicle of the infective agent. H1N1, commonly known as the swine flu, a viral infection, was a cause of 2009 world-wide pandemic. The virus was first found in pigs, but a similar virus also found in humans. The virus spreads in a same manner as any other seasonal flu, mainly by droplets (small particles in the air) when an infected person coughs, sneezes or even talks, but also by touching Staphylococcus epidermidis is an opportunistic pathogen, meaning that they can cause infection more frequently and more easily in persons' with a weakened immune system such as, HIV patients (CDC, 2015). This organism is seen primarily in nosocomial infections, also known as, hospital-acquired infections (Bukhari, 2004). This means that the organisms favors the hospital environment and is easily passed to a person while they are in the hospital. Ways that a person can get a Staphylococcus epidermidis infection is through IV's, more commonly in drug users, catheters, and artificial equipment (Bukhari, 2004). Skin-to-skin contact can also be a form of getting this type of infection. The people that are most susceptible to get Staphylococcus epidermidis are newborns, the elderly, immunocompromised patients, and patient's who are using a catheter. This is because newborns and the elderly do not have as strong of immune systems as children and middle-age adults The spread of infection towards immunocompromised patients are definitely directly cost and quality oriented. The cost of treatment of the infection with its complications which lead to prolonged the hospital stay of patients. Not only protecting the individual workers but also the patients who exposed to. I appreciate and motivate my colleagues for getting In the review of the literature regarding National Patient Safety Goals and the reduction of healthcare associated infections by the implementation of evidence-based practice, one article addressed the education of patients and family to prevent catheter-related bloodstream infections (Dela Cruz et al., 2012). MD Anderson Cancer Center Infusion Therapy Team places 600 central venous catheters (CVC) and PICC's and 100 implanted ports each month at their facility (Dela Cruz et al., 2012). Volume like this has lead to an extensive formal education program to assist the patient and family with care and maintenance of their CVC to reduce the number of catheter-related bloodstream infections (Dela Cruz et al., 2012). The education program consists 2. Discuss catheter-associated urinary tract infection & apply evidence-based principles for inserting and removal of a catheter. The Death Penalty, loss of life due to previous crimes and actions, is believed by some to be extremely costly, inhumane, and cruel unlike some others whom believe it is just, right, and provides closure. The Death Penalty is not a quick and easy process. Most who get sentenced to deaths row wait years for their ultimate punishment of death. Some believe that it is not right to punish and kill a human for actions they have done because, they believe that the inmate should have another chance. Then others believe that it is right to punish someone for their actions especially if their actions involve killing another or multiple humans. Clinical governance ensures that organisations become accountable for continuously improving their services and safe-guarding standard of care 'by creating an environment in which excellence in clinical care will flourish' (Scally and Donaldson 1998). Clinical audit emerged from within the clinical governance framework and is now seen as one of the most important elements of clinical governance (NICE 2002); it has been defined as 'a quality improvement process that seeks to improve patient care and outcomes through systematic review against explicit criteria and the implementation of change'. The student intends to focus this audit on staff knowledge in relation to Hand Hygiene and Infection Control and to evaluate the hand hygiene education Needlestick injuries are injuries due to exposed and improper use of needles or sharps. The ANA in 2010, commemorated the 10th anniversary of the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act, which improved protection against these injuries that expose health care workers to potentially deadly blood borne pathogens. These injuries, unfortunately, are still occurring today and far too often. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in March 2000, estimated that approximately 62-88 percent of sharps and needlestick injuries are preventable. Health care workers that handle sharp devices or equipment like scalpels, sutures, needles, phlebotomy devices or blood collection devices are all at risk but nurses are at a very high risk for being exposed to these preventable injuries which exposes them to numerous bloodborne pathogens especially deadly viruses such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV/AIDs. Needle-stick injuries may occur when disposing needles, collecting and disposing of materials used during patient care procedures, administering injections, drawing blood, or handling trash or dirty linens where needles have been inappropriately discarded. The CDC estimates that over 1,000 hospital-based health practitioner (HP) sustain injuries from contaminated needles and other sharp devices during the delivery of patient care everyday. Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) is one of the most important agents in the prevention of hospital acquired infections or what we termed nosocomial infections. IPC channels every member of the hospital, which includes, healthcare providers (HCP), patients and the hospitals perse. It is important to practice IPC commandment to every hospital as well as community. The Palestinian Ministry of Health (MOH) adopted the national IPC protocol. Employees working in pediatrics hospital are supposed to take precautions to protect their patients and staff from exposure to potentially infectious materials. A fundamental component of standard infection prevention measures are a system of barrier precautions to be used by all personnel In all areas of healthcare, particularly in acute care settings, patients may be unable to care for their nutritional and/or hygienic needs properly. One area that is especially important to address is the perineal care of patients who are incapacitated, or otherwise unable to care for their hygienic needs independently. Normal bacterial flora can develop into an opportunistic infection if the bacteria reaches certain areas of the body. For example, a common cause of urinary tract infections (UTI) is due to Escherichia coli from the colon coming into contact with the urethra (Copstead & Banasik, 2013). If the patient is immunocompromised, elderly, sedentary, or otherwise compromised in their abilities to void, this can predispose the patient "}
