That's why so much is written about it'. That is the [title of a post](http://www.dcscience.net/2013/11/18/we-know-little-about-the-effect-of-diet-on-health-thats-why-so-much-is-written-about-it/) in which I advocate the view put by John Ioannidis that remarkably little is known about the health effects if individual nutrients. That ignorance has given rise to a vast industry selling advice that has little evidence to support it. The 2016 Conference of the so-called \"College of Medicine\" had the title \"Food, the Forgotten Medicine\". This post gives some background information about some of the speakers at this event. I'm sorry it appears to be too ad hominem, but the only way to judge the meeting is via the track record of the speakers. Quite a lot has been written here about the \"College of Medicine\". It is the direct successor of the Prince of Wales' late, unlamented, Foundation for Integrated Health. But unlike the latter, its name is disguises its promotion of quackery. [Originally](http://www.dcscience.net/2010/07/25/buckinghamgate-the-new-college-of-medicine-arising-from-the-ashes-of-the-princes-foundation-for-integrated-health/) it was going to be called the \"College of Integrated Health\", but that wasn't sufficently deceptive so the name was dropped. For the history of the organisation, see [The new \"College of Medicine\" arising from the ashes of the Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health](http://www.dcscience.net/2010/07/25/buckinghamgate-the-new-college-of-medicine-arising-from-the-ashes-of-the-princes-foundation-for-integrated-health/) [Don't be deceived.

Is Graeme Catto selling out?](http://www.dcscience.net/2012/05/03/the-college-of-medicine-is-in-the-pocket-of-crapita-capita-is-graeme-catto-selling-out/) The conference programme ( [download pdf](http://www.dcscience.net/College-of-Medicine-Food-conf-programme-2016.pdf)) is a masterpiece of [bait and switch](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=Bait+and+switch). It is a mixture of very respectable people, and outright quacks. The former are invited to give legitimacy to the latter. The names may not be familiar to those who don't follow the antics of the magic medicine community, so here is a bit of information about some of them. The introduction to the meeting was by [Michael Dixon](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22Michael+Dixon) and [Catherine Zollman](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=Zollman), both veterans of the Prince of Wales Foundation, and both devoted enthusiasts for magic medicne. [Zollman even believes](http://www.bmj.com/content/319/7217/1115.1) in the battiest of all forms of magic medicine, homeopathy ( [download pdf](Vickers-Zollman-homeopathy-1999.pdf)), for which she totally misrepresents the evidence. Zollman works now at the [Penny Brohn centre](http://www.pennybrohn.org.uk/) in Bristol. She's [also linked to](http://portlandcentrehealthcare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Portland-Centre-4pp-A5-Programme-68048-FINAL-4.pdf) the \" [Portland Centre for integrative medicine](http://portlandcentrehealthcare.co.uk/)\" which is run by [Elizabeth Thompson](http://www.dcscience.net/2011/07/27/dr-elizabeth-thompson-of-bristol-homeopathic-hospital-finds-that-pills-that-contain-nothing-have-no-effect-not-even-placebo-effect/), another advocate of homeopathy. It came into being after NHS Bristol shut down the Bristol Homeopathic Hospital, on the very good grounds that it doesn't work. Now, like most magic medicine it is privatised. The [Penny Brohn shop](http://www.shopatpennybrohn.com/) will sell you a wide range of expensive and useless \"supplements\". For example, [Biocare Antioxidant capsules](http://www.shopatpennybrohn.com/collections/supplements-1/products/biocare-antioxidant-complex-90-vegecaps) at \u00a337 for 90. Biocare make [several unjustified claims](https://www.biocare.co.uk/default.aspx?GroupGuid=1053) for their benefits. Among other unnecessary ingredients, they contain a very small amount of green tea. That's a favourite of \"health food addicts\", and it was the subject of a [recent paper](http://www.dcscience.net/delaTorre-green-tea-2016.pdf) that contains one of the daftest statistical solecisms I've ever encountered \"To protect against type II errors, no corrections were applied for multiple comparisons\". If you don't understand that, try [this paper](http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/1/3/140216). The results are almost certainly false positives, despite the fact that it appeared in Lancet Neurology. It's yet another example of broken peer review. It's been know for decades now that [ \"antioxidant\" is no more than a marketing term](http://www.dcscience.net/2007/03/03/anti-oxidant-supplements-dangerous-garlic-useless-update/), There is no evidence of benefit and large doses can be harmful. This obviously doesn't worry the College of Medicine. Margaret Rayman was the next speaker. She's a real nutritionist. Mixing the real with the crackpots is a standard bait and switch tactic. Eleni Tsiompanou, came next. She runs yet another [private \"wellness\" clinic](http://healthbeing.co.uk/), which makes all the usual exaggerated claims. She seems to have an [obsession with Hippocrates](http://healthbeing.co.uk/hippocrates/) (hint: medicine has moved on since then). [Dr Eleni's Joy Biscuits](http://healthbeing.co.uk/recipes/dr-elenis-joy-biscuits/) may or may not taste good, but their health-giving properties are make-believe. Andrew Weil, from the University of Arizona gave the keynote address. He's described as \"one of the world's leading authorities on Nutrition and Health\". That description alone is sufficient to show the fantasy land in which the College of Medicine exists. He's a typical supplement salesman, presumably very rich. There is no excuse for not knowing about him. It was 1988 when [Arnold Relman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_S._Relman) (who was editor of the New England Journal of Medicine) wrote [A Trip to Stonesville: Some Notes on Andrew Weil, M.D.](http://www.quackwatch.com/11Ind/weil.html). \"Like so many of the other gurus of alternative medicine, Weil is not bothered by logical contradictions in his argument, or encumbered by a need to search for objective evidence.\" This blog has mentioned his more [recent activities](http://www.dcscience.net/2008/02/17/quackademics-in-usa-and-canada/#arizona), many times. [Alex Richardson](http://www.fabresearch.org/viewItem.php?id=7412), of Oxford Food and Behaviour Research (a charity, not part of the university) is an enthusiast for omega-3, a favourite of the supplement industry, She has published several papers that show little evidence of effectiveness. That looks entirely honest. On the other hand, [ their News section](http://www.fabresearch.org/viewItem.php?id=342) contains many links to the notorious supplement industry lobby site, Nutraingredients, one of the least reliable sources of information on the web (I get their newsletter, a constant source of hilarity and raised eyebrows). I find this worrying for someone who claims to be evidence-based. I'm told that her charity is funded largely by the supplement industry (though I can't find any mention of that on the web site). Stephen Devries was a new name to me. You can infer what he's like from the fact that he has been endorsed byt Andrew Weil, and that his address is \"Institute for Integrative Cardiology\" (\"Integrative\" is the latest euphemism for quackery). Never trust any talk with a title that contains \"The truth about\". His was called \"The scientific truth about fats and sugars,\" In [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24PC0zYKLkk), he claims that diet has been shown to reduce heart disease by 70%. which gives you a good idea of his ability to assess evidence. But the claim doubtless helps to sell his books. Prof Tim Spector, of Kings College London, was next. As far as I know he's a perfectly respectable scientist, albeit one with [books to sell](http://www.tim-spector.co.uk/), But his talk [ is now online](https://www.collegeofmedicine.org.uk/food-medicine-diet-myths-microbes/?dm_i=PC7,4DPC1,3PB5TI,G3CAO,1), and it was a bit like a born-again microbiome enthusiast. He seemed to be too impressed by the PREDIMED study, despite it's statistical unsoundness, which was [pointed out by Ioannidis](http://www.dcscience.net/Ioannidis-2013-nutrition-bmj.pdf). Little evidence was presented, though at least he was more sensible than the audience about the uselessness of multivitamin tablets. Simon Mills talked on \"Herbs and spices. Using Mother Nature's pharmacy to maintain health and cure illness\". He's a herbalist who has featured here [many times](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22Simon+Mills%22). I can recommend especially his video about [Hot and Cold herbs](http://www.dcscience.net/2012/06/10/bait-and-switch-by-herbalists-chinese-and-western/) as a superb example of fantasy science. Annie Anderson, is [Professor of Public Health Nutrition](http://medicine.dundee.ac.uk/staff-member/professor-annie-s-anderson) and Founder of the Scottish Cancer Prevention Network. She's a respectable nutritionist and public health person, albeit with their customary disregard of [problems of causality](http://www.dcscience.net/2013/11/18/we-know-little-about-the-effect-of-diet-on-health-thats-why-so-much-is-written-about-it/). Patrick Holden is chair of the [Sustainable Food Trust](http://www.ciwf.org.uk/about-us/high-profile-supporters/visionaries/civil-society/patrick-holden-cbe/). He promotes \"organic farming\". Much though I dislike the cruelty of factory farms, the \"organic\" industry is largely a way of making food more expensive with no health benefits. The Michael Pittilo 2016 Student Essay Prize was awarded after lunch. Pittilo has [featured frequently](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=pittilo) on this blog as a result of his execrable promotion of quackery -see, in particular, [A very bad report: gamma minus for the vice-chancellor](http://www.dcscience.net/2008/06/18/a-very-bad-report-gamma-minus-for-the-vice-chancellor/). Nutritional advice for patients with cancer. This discussion involved three people. Professor Robert Thomas, Consultant Oncologist, Addenbrookes and Bedford Hospitals, Dr Clare Shaw, Consultant Dietitian, Royal Marsden Hospital and Dr Catherine Zollman, GP and Clinical Lead, Penny Brohn UK. Robert Thomas came to my attention when I noticed that he, as a regular cancer consultant had spoken at a meeting of the quack charity, \"YestoLife\". When I saw he was scheduled tp speak at another quack conference. After I'd written to him to point out the track records of some of the people at the meeting, he withdrew from one of them. See [The exploitation of cancer patients is wicked. Carrot juice for lunch, then die destitute](http://www.dcscience.net/2013/03/25/the-exploitation-of-cancer-patients-is-wicked-carrot-juice-for-lunch-then-die-destitute/). The influence seems to have been temporary though. He continues to lend respectability to many dodgy meetings. He edits the [Cancernet web site](http://www.cancernet.co.uk/index.html). This site lends credence to bizarre treatments like [homeopathy](http://www.cancernet.co.uk/comp-homeopathy.htm) and [crystal healing](http://www.cancernet.co.uk/comp-crystal.htm). It used to sell [hair mineral analysis](http://www.cancernet.co.uk/nutritional-reports.htm), a well-known phony diagnostic method the main purpose of which is to sell you expensive \"supplements\". They still sell the \"Cancer Risk Nutritional Profile\". for \u00a3295.00, despite the fact that it provides no proven benefits. Robert Thomas designed a food \"supplement\", Pomi-T: capsules that contain Pomegranate, Green tea, Broccoli and Curcumin. Oddly, he seems still to subscribe to the antioxidant myth. Even the supplement industry [admits that that's a lost cause](http://www.nutraingredients.com/Regulation-Policy/Why-antioxidant-claims-have-been-killed-off-in-the-EU/?utm_source=newsletter_daily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=22-Jun-2016&c=Spm99iS8YwD3CuvOLnW9pQ%3D%3D&p2=), but that doesn't stop its use in marketing. The one [randomised trial](http://www.cancernet.co.uk/pp-pomi-t.pdf) of these pills for prostate cancer was inconclusive. [Prostate Cancer UK says](http://prostatecanceruk.org/about-us/news-and-views/2013/6/superfoods) \"We would not encourage any man with prostate cancer to start taking Pomi-T food supplements on the basis of this research\". Nevertheless it's promoted on Cancernet.co.uk and widely sold. The [Pomi-T site boasts](https://www.pomi-t.co.uk/) about the (inconclusive) trial, but says \"Pomi-T\u00ae is not a medicinal product\". There was a cookery demonstration by Dale Pinnock \"The medicinal chef\" The programme does not tell us whether he made is signature dish \"the [ Famous Flu Fighting Soup](http://www.dalepinnock.com/flu-fighting-soup-itvs-this-morning/)\". Needless to say, there isn't the slightest reason to believe that his soup has the slightest effect on flu. In summary, the whole meeting was devoted to exaggerating vastly the effect of particular foods. It also acted as advertising for people with something to sell. Much of it was outright quackery, with a leavening of more respectable people, a standard part of the bait-and-switch methods used by all quacks in their attempts to make themselves sound respectable. I find it impossible to tell how much the participants actually believe what they say, and how much it's a simple commercial drive. The thing that really worries me is why someone like Phil Hammond supports this sort of thing by chairing their meetings (as he did for the \"College of Medicine's\" direct predecessor, the Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health. His defence of the NHS has made him something of a hero to me. He assured me that he'd asked people to stick to evidence. In that he clearly failed. I guess they must pay well. Follow-up Here is a record of a couple of recent newspaper pieces. Who says the mainstream media don't matter any longer? Blogs may be in the lead now when it comes to critical analysis. The best blogs have more expertise and more time to read the sources than journalists. But the mainstream media get the message to a different, and much larger, audience. The Observer ran a whole page interview with me as part of their [\"Rational Heroes\" series](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2013/apr/21/rational-heroes-david-colquhoun-pharmacologist?INTCMP=SRCH). I rather liked their subtitle [ [pdf of article](/David-Colquhoun-Twitter-addicted scourge of scientific quackery _ Science _ pseudoscience on his unmissable blog\" It was pretty accurate apart from the fact that the picture was labelled as \"DC in his office\". Actually it was taken (at the insistence of the photographer) in Lucia Sivilotti's lab. Photo by Karen Robinson. The astonishing result of this was that on Sunday the blog got a record 24,305 hits. Normally it gets 1,000-1,400 hits a day . between posts, fewer on Sunday, and the previous record was around 7000/day A week later it was still twice normal. It remains to be seen whether the eventual plateau stays up. I also gained around 1000 extra followers on twitter, though some dropped away quite soon, and 100 or so people signed for email updates. The dead tree media aren't yet dead. I'm happy to say. 3 June 2013 Perhaps as a result of the foregoing piece, I got asked to write a column for The Observer, at barely 48 hours notice. This is the best I could manage in the time. The [web version has links](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2013/jun/02/medical-cure-health-quackery-david-colquhoun?INTCMP=SRCH). This attracted the usual \"it worked for me\" anecdotes in the comments, but I spent an afternoon answering them. It seems important to have a dialogue, not just to lecture the public. In fact when I read a regular scientific paper, I now find myself looking for the comment section. That may say something about the future of scientific publishing. It is for others to judge how succesfully I engage with the public, but I was quite surprised to discover that UCL's public engagement unit, @UCL_in_public, has blocked me on twitter. Hey ho. They have 1574 follower and I have 7597. I wish them the best of luck. Follow-up Almost all the revelations about what's taught on university courses in alternative medicine have come from [post-1992 universities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_universities). (For readers not in the UK, post-1992 universities are the many new univerities created in 1992, from former polytechnics etc, and [Russell group](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_group) universities are the \"top 20\" research-intensive universities) It is true that all the undergraduate courses are in post-1992 universities, but the advance of quackademia is by no means limited to them. The teaching at [St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical School](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1143), one of the oldest, was pretty disgraceful for example, though after protests from their own students, and from me, it is now better, I believe. Quackery creeps into all universities to varying extents. The good ones (like Southampton) don't run \"BSc\" degrees, but it still infiltrates through two main sources, The first is via their HR departments, which are run by people who tend to be (I quote) \" [credulous and moronic](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=226)\" when it comes to science. The other main source is in teaching to medical students. The General Medical Council says that medical students must know something about alterantive medicine and that's quite right, A lot of their patients will use it. The problem is that the guidance is shockingly vague . \"They must be aware that many patients are interested in and choose to use a range of alternative and complementary therapies. Graduates must be aware of the existence and range of such therapies, why some patients use them, and how these might affect other types of treatment that patients are receiving.\" (from [Tomorrow's Doctors, GMC]) In many medical schools, the information that medical students get is quite accurate. At UCL and at King's (London) I have done some of the familiarisation myself. In other good medical schools, the students get some shocking stuff. [St Bartholomew's Hospital](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=555) medical School was one example. [Edinburgh University](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=239#cumming) was another. But there is one Russell group university where alternative myths are propagated more than any other that I know about. That is the University of Southampton. In general, Southampton is a good place, I worked there for three years myself (1972 - 1975). The very first noise spectra I measured were calculated on a PDP computer in their excellent Institute of Sound and Vibration Research, before I wrote my own programs to do it. But Southanpton also has a The Complementary and Integrated Medicine Research Unit . Oddly the unit's web site, [http://www.cam-research-group.co.uk](http://www.cam-research-group.co.uk), is not a university address, and a search of the university's web site for \"Complementary and Integrated Medicine Research Unit\" produces no result. Nevertheless the unit is \"within the School of Medicine at the University of Southampton\" Notice the usual euphemisms 'complementary' and 'integrated' in the title: the word 'alternative' is never used. This sort of word play is part of the [bait and switch](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/personalized-medicine-bait-and-switch/) approach of alternative medicine. The unit is [quite big](http://www.cam-research-group.co.uk/people.php): ten research staff, four PhD students and two support staff It is headed by [George Lewith](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3956). Teaching about alternative medicine to Southampton medical students. The whole medical class seems to get quite a lot compared with other places I know about. That's 250 students (210 on the 5-year course plus another 40 from the 4-year graduate-entry route). Year 1: Lecture by David Owen on 'holism' within the Foundation Course given to all 210 medical students doing the standard (5-year) course. Year 2: Lecture by Lewith (on complementary medicine, focusing on acupuncture for pain) given within the nervous systems course to the whole medical student year-group (210 students). Year 3 SBOM (scientific basis of medicine) symposium: The 3-hour session (\"Complementary or Alternative Medicine: You Decide\"). I'm told that attendance at this symposium is often pretty low, but many do turn up and all of them are officially 'expected' to attend. There is also an optional CAM special study module chosen by 20 students in year 3, but also a small number of medical students (perhaps 2 - 3 each year?) choose to do a BMedSci research project supervised by the CAM research group and involving 16-18 weeks of study from October to May in Year 4. The CAM research group also supervise postgraduate students doing PhD research. As always, a list of lectures doesn't tell you much. What we need to know is what's taught to the students and something about the people who teach it. The other interesting question is how it comes about that alternative medicine has been allowed to become so prominent in a Russell group university. It must have support from on high. In this case it isn't hard to find out where it comes from. Here are some details. Year 1 Dr David Owen [David Owen](http://www.thenaturalpractice.com/practitioners/index/?practitioner=1) is not part of Lewith's group, but a member of the Division of Medical Education headed by Dr Faith Hill (of whom, more below). He's one of the many part-time academics in this area, being also a founder of [The Natural Practice](http://www.thenaturalpractice.com/) . Owen is an advocate of homeopathy (a past president of the Faculty of Homeopathy). Homeopathy is, of course, the most barmy and discredited of all the popular sorts of alternative medicine. Among those who have discredited it is the head of the alt med unit, [George Lewith](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3695) himself (though oddly he [still prescribes it](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3956http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3956)). And he's also a member of the [British Society of Environmental Medicine](http://www.ecomed.org.uk/) (BSEM). That sounds like a very respectable title, but don't be deceived. It is an organisation that promotes all sorts of seriously fringe ideas. All you have to do is notice that the star speaker at their 2011 conference was none other than used-to-be a doctor, Andrew Wakefield, a man who has been responsible for the death of children from measles by causing an unfounded scare about vaccination on the basis of data that turned out to [ have been falsified](http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c7452). There is still a [letter of support](http://www.ecomed.org.uk/the-gmc-and-dr-andrew-wakefield) for Wakefield on the BSEM web site. The BSEM [specialises in](http://www.ecomed.org.uk/practitioners) exaggerated claims about 'environmental toxins' and uses phony allergy tests like [ kinesiology](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2011/05/how-applied-kinesiology-can-be-used-to-justify-any-quack-treatment.html) and the [Vega test](http://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/south/series2/food_sensitivity_allergy_vega_tests.shtml) that misdiagnose allergies, but provide en excuse to prescribe expensive but unproven nutritional supplements, or expensive psychobabble like \"neuro-linguistic programming\". Other registered \"ecological physicians\" include the infamous D [r Sarah Myhil](http://www.skepticat.org/2010/04/dr-myhill/)l, who, in 2010, was the subject of a [damning verdict by the GMC](http://www.drmyhill.co.uk/wiki/GMC%27s_full_verdict), and Southampton's George Lewith. If it is wrong to expose medical students to someone who believes that dose-response curves have a negative slope (the smaller the dose the bigger the effect -I know, it's crazy), then it is downright wicked to expose students to a supporter of Andrew Wakefield. David Owen's appearance on Radio Oxford, with the indomitable Andy Lewis appears on his [Quackometer blog](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2011/06/debating-homeopathy-on-bbc-oxford-radio.html). Year 2 Dr George Lewith Lewith is a mystery wrapped in an enigma. He's participated in some research that is quite good by the (generally pathetic) standards of the world of alternative medicine. In 2001 he showed that the [ Vega test did not work](http://www.dcscience.net/Lewith-Vega-test-01.pdf) as a method of allergy diagnosis. \"Conclusion Electrodermal testing cannot be used to diagnose environmental allergies\", published in the BMJ .[ [download reprint](http://www.dcscience.net/Lewith-Vega-test-01.pdf)]. In 2003 reprint](http://www.dcscience.net/Brien-Lewith-2003.pdf)] that showed homeopathic pills with no active ingredients had no effects: The conclusion was \"\"Ultramolecular homeopathy has no observable clinical effects\" (the word ultramolecular, in this context, means that the belladonna pills contained no belladonna). In 2010 he again concluded that homeopathic pills were no more than placebos, as described in [Despite the spin, Lewith's paper surely signals the end of homeopathy (again)](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3695). [ [download reprint](http://rheumatology.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2010/11/08/rheumatology.keq234.full.pdf)] What i cannot understand is that, despite his own findings, his private practice continues to prescribe the Vega machine and continues to prescribe homeopathic pills. And he continues to preach this subject to unfortunate medical students. Lewith is also one of the practitioners [recommended by BSEM](http://www.ecomed.org.uk/practitioners). He's a [director of](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3263) the \"College of Medicine\". And he's also an advisor to a charity called Yes To Life. (see [A thoroughly dangerous charity: YesToLife promotes nonsense cancer treatments](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=4239)). 3rd year Student Selected Unit The teaching team includes: - David Owen - Principal Clinical Teaching Fellow SoM, Holistic Physician - George Lewith - Professor of Health Research and Consultant Physician - Caroline Eyles - Homeopathic Physician - Susan Woodhead - Acupuncturist - Elaine Cooke - Chiropractic Practitioner - Phine Dahle - Psychotherapist - Keith Carr - Reiki Master - Christine Rose - Homeopath and GP - David Nicolson - Nutritionalist - Shelley Baker - Aromatherapist - Cheryl Dunford - Hypnotherapist - Dedj Leibbrandt - Herbalist More details of the teaching team [here](http://www.cam-research-group.co.uk/teachingteam.php). There is not a single sceptic among them, so the students don't get a debate, just propaganda. In this case. there's no need for the Freedom of Information Act. The [ handouts](http://www.cam-research-group.co.uk/handouts.php). and the [powerpoints](http://www.cam-research-group.co.uk/presentations.php) are on their web site. They seem to be proud of them Let's look at some examples Chiropractic makes an interesting case, because, in the wake of the [Singh-BCA libel case](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1980), the claims of chiropractors have been [scrutinised as never before](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1775) and most of their claims have turned out to be bogus. There is a close relationship between Lewith's unit and the Anglo-European Chiropractic College (the 3rd year module includes a visit there). In fact the handout provided for students, [Evidence for Chiropractic Care ](http://www.cam-research-group.co.uk/pdf/evidence_for_chiropractic_care.pdf), was written by the College. It's interesting because it provides no real evidence whatsoever for the effectiveness of chiropractic care. It's fairly honest in stating that the view at present is that, for low back pain, it isn't possible to detect any difference between the usefulness of manipulation by a physiotherapist, by an osteopath or by a chiropractor. Of course it does not draw the obvious conclusion that this makes chiropractic and osteopathy entirely redundant -you can get the same result without all the absurd mumbo jumbo that chiropractors and osteopaths love, or their high-pressure salesmanship and superfluous X-rays. Neither does it mention the sad, but entirely possible, outcome that none of the manipulations are effective for low back pain. There is, for example, no mention of the fascinating paper by Artus et al [ [download reprint](http://www.dcscience.net/artus-rheumatology-2010.pdf)]. This paper concludes \"symptoms seem to improve in a similar pattern in clinical trials following a wide variety of active as well as inactive treatments.\" This paper was brought to my attention through the blog run by the exellent physiotherapist, Neil O'Connell. [He comments](http://bodyinmind.com.au/research-into-back-pain-treatments/) \"If this finding is supported by future studies it might suggest that we can't even claim victory through the non-specific effects of our interventions such as care, attention and placebo. People enrolled in trials for back pain may improve whatever you do. This is probably explained by the fact that patients enrol in a trial when their pain is at its worst which raises the murky spectre of regression to the mean and the beautiful phenomenon of natural recovery.\" This sort of critical thinking is conspicuously absent from this (and all the other) Southampton handouts. The handout is a superb example of bait and switch: No nonsense about infant colic, innate energy or imaginary subluxations appears in it. Acupuncture is another interesting case because there is quite a lot of research evidence, in stark contrast to the rest of traditional Chinese medicine, for which there is very little research. | | There is a The message is simple and totally uncritical. It works. | | In fact there is now a broad consensus about acupuncture. (1) Real acupuncture and sham acupuncture have been found to be indistinguishable in many trials. This is the case regardless of whether the sham is a retractable needle (or even a toothpick) in the \"right\" places, or whether it is real needles inserted in the \"wrong\" places. The latter finding shows clearly that all that stuff about meridians and flow of Qi is sheer hocus pocus. It dates from a pre-scientific age and it was wrong. (2) A non-blind comparison of acupuncture versus no acupuncture shows an advantage for acupuncture. But the advantage is usually too small to be of any clinical significance. [ In all probability it is a placebo effect](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3136) -it's hard to imagine a more theatrical event than having someone in a white coat stick long needles into you, like a voodoo doll. Sadly, the placebo effect isn't big enough to be of much use. Needless to say, none of this is conveyed to the medical students of Southampton. Instead they are shown crude ancient ideas that date from long before anything was known about physiology as though they were actually true. These folks truly live in some alternative universe. Here are some samples from the acupuncture [powerpoint show](http://www.cam-research-group.co.uk/presentations/Acupuncture%20presentation%20Susan%20Woodhead.pdf) by Susan Woodhead. Well this is certainly a \"different diagnostic language\", but no attempt is made to say which one is right. In the mind of the acupuncurist it seems both are true. It is a characteristic of alternative medicine advocates that they have no difficulty in believing simultaneously several mutually contradictory propositions. As a final exmple of barminess, just look at the acupuncture points (allegedly) on the ear The fact that it is a favoured by some people in the Pentagon as [battlefield acupuncture](http://blogs.forbes.com/sciencebiz/2010/02/15/battlefield-acupuncture-pseudoscience-for-wounded-troops/), is more reminiscent of the mad general, Jack D. Ripper, in [Dr Strangelove](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1KvgtEnABY&feature=related) than it is of science. There is an equally uncritical [handout on acupuncture](http://www.cam-research-group.co.uk/pdf/_compmed_handouts_acupuncture.pdf) by Val Hopwood. It's dated March 2003, a time before some of the most valuable experiments were done. The handout says \"sham acupuncture is generally less effective than true acupuncture\", precisely the opposite of what's known now. And there are some bits that give you a good laugh, always helpful in teaching. I like \"There is little doubt that an intact functioning nervous system is required for acupuncture to produce analgesia or, for that matter, any physiological changes\" and Modern techniques: These include hybrid electro-acupuncture . . . and Ryadoraku [sic] therapy and Vega testing. Vega testing!! That's been disproved dozens of times (not least by George Lewith). And actually the other made-up nonsense is spelled [Ryodoraku](http://www.ryodoraku.eu/). It's true that there is a short paragraph at the end of the handout headed \"Scientific evaluation of acupuncture\" but it doesn't cite a single reference and reads more like excuses for why acupuncture so often fails when it's tested properly. Homeopathy. Finally a bit about that most boring of topics, the laughable medicine that contains no medicine, homeopathy. Caroline Eyles is a member for the Society of Homeopaths, the organisation that did nothing when its members were caught out in the murderous practice of recommending homeopathy for prevention of malaria. The Society of Homeopaths also [endorses Jeremy Sherr](http://gimpyblog.wordpress.com/2007/11/01/jeremy-sherr-fellow-of-the-society-of-homeopaths-wants-to-cure-aids-and-malaria-with-homeopathy/), a man so crazy that he believes he can cure AIDS and malaria with sugar pills. The homeopathy [handout](http://www.cam-research-group.co.uk/pdf/_compmed_handouts_homeopathy.pdf) given to the students has 367 references, but somehow manages to omit the references to their own boss's work showing that the pills are placebos. The handout has all the sciencey-sounding words, abused by people who don't understand them. \"The remedy will be particularly effective if matched to the specific/particular characteristics of the individual (the 'totality' of the patient) on all levels, including the emotional and mental levels, as well as just the physical symptoms. 'Resonance' with the remedy's curative power will then be at it's [sic] best.\" The handout is totally misleading about the current state of research. It says \"increasing clinical research confirms it's [sic] clinical effectiveness in treating patients, including babies and animals (where a placebo effect would be hard to justify).\" | | The | | Anyone who has to rely on the utterly discredited [Jacques Benveniste](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Benveniste) as evidence is clearly clutching at straws. What's more interesting about this slide the admission that \"reproducibility is a problem -oops, an issue\" and that RCTs (done largely by homeopaths of course) have \"various methodological flaws and poor external validity\". You'd think that if that was the best that could be produced after 200 yours, they'd shut up shop and get another job. But, like aging vicars who long since stopped believing in god, but are damned if they'll give up the nice country rectory, they struggle on, sounding [increasingly desperate](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2011/07/1887.html). How have topics like this become so embedded in a medical course at a Russell group university? The details above are a bit tedious and repetitive. It's already established that hardly any alternative medicine works. Don't take my word for it. Check [the web site](http://nccam.nih.gov/health/atoz.htm) of the US National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) who, at a cost of over $2 billion have produced nothing useful. A rather more interesting question is how a good university like Southampton comes to be exposing its medical students to teaching like this. There must be some powerful allies higher up in the university. In this case it's pretty obvious who thay are. Professor Stephen Holgate FBMS FMed Sci CBE has to be the primary suspect, He's listed as one of Southampton's [Outstanding Academics](http://www.soton.ac.uk/research/outstanding_academics/index.html). His work is nothing to do with alternative medicine but he's been a long term supporter of the late unlamented Prince of Wales' Foundation, and he's now [on the advisory board](http://www.collegeofmedicine.org.uk/professor-stephen-holgate) of it's successor, the so called \"College of Medicine\" (for more information about that place see the [new \"College of Medicine\" arising from the ashes of the Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3263), and also [Don't be deceived. The new \"College of Medicine\" is a fraud and delusion](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=3632) ). His description on that site reads thus. \"Stephen Holgate is MRC Clinical Professor of Immunopharmacology at the University of Southampton School of Medicine and Honorary Consultant Physician at Southampton University Hospital Trust. He is also chair of the MRC's Populations and Systems Medicine Board. Specialising in respiratory medicine, he is the author of over 800 peer-reviewed papers and contributions to scientific journals and editor of major textbooks on asthma and rhinitis. He is Co-Editor of Clinical and Experimental Allergy, Associate Editor of Clinical Science and on the editorial board of 25 other scientific journals.\" Clearly a busy man. Personally I'm deeply suspicious of anyone who claims to be the author of over 800 papers. He graduated in medicine in 1971, so that is an average of over 20 papers a year since then, one every two or three weeks. I'd have trouble reading that many, never mind writing them. Holgate's long-standing interest in alternative medicine is baffling. He's published on the topic with George Lewith, who, incidentally, is [one of the directors](http://www.dcscience.net/blREX+0L0198-7358_6-05180774.pdf) of the \"College of Medicine\".. It may be unkind to mention that, for many years now, I've been hearing rumours that Holgate is suffering from an unusually bad case of [Knight starvation](http://www.dcscience.net/?page_id=13#quote). The Division of Medical Education appears to be the other big source of support for. anti-scientific medicine. That is very odd, I know, but it was also the medical education people who were responsible for mis-educating medical students at. [St. Bartholomew's](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=555) and at [ Edinburgh university](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=239#cumming). Southampton's [Division of Medical Education](http://www.som.soton.ac.uk/research/medicaleducation/) has a mind-boggling 60 academic and support staff. Two of them are of particular interest here. Faith Hill is director of the division. [Her profile](http://www.som.soton.ac.uk/about/staff/listing/profile.asp?fhill) doesn't say anything about alternative medicine, but her interest is clear from a 2003 paper, [Complementary and alternative medicine: the next generation of health promotion?](http://www.dcscience.net/Faith-Hill-CAM.pdf). The research consisted of reporting anecdotes from interviews of 52 unnamed people (this sort of thing seems to pass for research in the social sciences). It starts badly by misrepresenting the conclusions of the [House of Lords report](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=199) (2000) on CAM. Although it comes to no useful conclusions, it certainly shows a high tolerance of nonsensical treatments. Chris Stephens is Associate Dean of Medical Education & Student Experience. His sympathy is shown by a paper he wrote In 2001, with David Owen (the homeopath, above) and George Lewith: [Can doctors respond to patients' increasing interest in complementary and alternative medicine?](http://www.bmj.com/content/322/7279/154.full?ijkey=cef1ed0dd3a181def66f02738144eb35ba3f229c&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha). Two of the conclusions of this paper were as follows. \"Doctors are training in complementary and alternative medicine and report benefits both for their patients and themselves\" Well, no actually. It wasn't true then, and it's probably even less true now. There's now a lot more evidence and most of it shows alternative medicine doesn't work. \"Doctors need to address training in and practice of complementary and alternative medicine within their own organisations\" Yes they certainly need to do that. And the first thing that Drs Hill and Stephens should do is look a bit more closely about what's taught in their own university, I hope that this post helps them, Follow-up 4 July 2011. A correspondent has just pointed out that Chris Stephens is a [member of the General Chiropractic Council](http://www.gcc-uk.org/page.cfm?page_id=8). The GCC is a truly pathetic pseudo-regulator. In the wake of the Simon Singh affair it has been kept busy fending off well-justified complaints against untrue claims made by chiropractors. The [ GCC is a sad joke](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2010/11/chiropractors-at-war-with-their-regulator-the-gcc.html), but it's even sadder to see a Dean of Medical Education at the University of Southampton being involved with an organisation that has treated little matters of truth with such disdain. A rather unkind tweet from (ex)-chiropractor @RichardLanigan. \"Chris is just another light weight academic who likes being on committees. Regulatory bodies are full of them\" This post has been [translated into Belorussian](http://onlinepharmacycheck.com/~doc/cnmed-be).. Chinese medicine and herbal medicine are i [n the news at the moment](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2007). There is a real risk that the government could endorse them by accepting [ the Pittilo report](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=235). In my view traditional Chinese medicine endangers people. The proposed 'regulation' would do nothing to protect the public. Quite on the contrary, it would add to the dangers, by giving an official stamp of approval while doing nothing for safety. The government's idea of improving safety is to make sure that practitioners are 'properly trained'. But it is the qualifications that cause the danger in the first place. The courses teach ideas that are plain wrong and often really dangerous. Why have government (and some universities) not noticed this? That's easy to see. Governments, quangos and university validation committees simply don't look. They tick boxes but never ask what actually goes on. Here's some examples of what goes on for them to think about. They show clearly the sort of dangerous rubbish that is taught on some of these 'degrees'. These particular slides are from the University of Westminster, but similar courses exist in only too many other places. Watch this space for more details on courses at Edinburgh Napier University, Middlesex University and the University of East London Just a lot of old myths. Sheer gobbledygook, SO much for a couple of centuries of physiology, It gets worse. Plain wrong. Curious indeed. The fantasy gobbledygook gets worse. Now it is getting utterly silly. Teaching students that the brain is made of marrow is not just absurd, but desperately dangerous for anyone unlucky (or stupid) enough to go to such a person when they are ill. Here's another herbal lecture., and this time the topic is serious. Cancer. Herbal approaches for patients with cancer. I've removed the name of the teacher to spare her the acute embarrassment of having these dangerous fantasies revealed. The fact that she probably believes them is not a sufficient excuse for endangering the public. There is certainly no excuse for the university allowing this stuff to be taught as part of a BSc (Hons). First get them scared with some bad statistics. No fuss there about distinguishing incidence, age-standardisation and death rates. And no reference. Perhaps a reference to the simple explanation of [statistics at Cancer Research UK](http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/help/default.asp?page=153) might help? Perhaps this slide would have been better ( [from CDC](#)). Seems there is some mistake in slide 2. Straight on to a truly disgraceful statement in slide 3 The is outrageous and very possibly illegal under the Cancer Act (1939). It certainly poses a huge danger to patients. It is a direct incentive to make illegal, and untrue claims by using weasel words in an attempt to stay just on the right side of the law. But that, of course, is standard practice in alternative medicine, Slide 11 is mostly meaningless. \"Strengthen vitality\" sounds good but means nothing. And \"enhancing the immune system\" is what alternative medicine folks always say when they can think of nothing else. Its meaning is ill-defined and there is no reason to think that any herbs do it. The idea of a 'tonic' was actually quite common in real medicine in the 1950s. The term slowly vanished as it was realised that it was a figment of the imagination. In the fantasy world of alternative medicine, it lives on. Detoxification, a marketing term not a medical one, has been extensively debunked quite recently. The use of the word by The [Prince of Wales' company](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=920), Duchy Originals recently [fell foul of the Advertising Standards Authority](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/05/there-goes-my-knighthood.html), and his herbal 'remedies' were [ zapped by the MHRA (](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8035072.stm)Medicines and Health Regulatory Authority). And of course the [ antioxidant myth](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=90) is a long-disproved hypothesis that has become a mere marketing term. \"Inhibits the recurrence of cancer\"! That sounds terrific. But if it is so good why is it not even mentioned in the two main resources for information about herbs? In the UK we have the National Library for Health Complementary and Alternative Medicine Specialist Library (NeLCAM), now a [part of NHS Evidence. It ](http://www.library.nhs.uk/cam/) was [launched in 2006](http://www.uclh.nhs.uk/News/2006/May/NeLCAM+launch+-+NHS+Complementary+Medicine+website+goes+live.htm). The clinical lead was none other than [Peter Fisher](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22Peter+Fisher%22), clinical director of the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital, and the Queen's homeopathic physician. The library was developed with the School of Integrated Health at the [University of Westminster](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22University+of+Westminster%22) (where this particular slide was shown to undergraduates). Nobody could accuse these people of being hostile to magic medicine, It seems odd, then, that NeLCAM does not seem to thnk to think that Centella asiatica, is even worth mentioning. In the USA we have the National Center for Alternative and Complementary Medicine (NCCAM), an organisation that is so friendly to alternative medicine that it has spent a billion dollars on research in the area, though it has produced not a single good treatment for that vast expenditure. But NCCAM too does not even mention Centella asiatica in [its herb list](http://nccam.nih.gov/health/herbsataglance.htm). It does get a mention in [Cochrane reviews](http://search.cochrane.org/search?q=centella&restrict=cochrane_org&scso_colloquia_abstracts=colloquia_abstracts&client=my_collection&scso_evidence_aid=evidence_aid&scso_review_abstracts=review_abstracts&lr=&output=xml_no_dtd&sub_site_name=Cochrane_Reviews_search&filter=0&site=my_collection&ie=&oe=&scso_registered_titles=registered_titles&scso_newsletters=newsletters&scso_cochrane_org=this_site&proxystylesheet=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cochrane.org%2Fsearch%2Fgoogle_mini_xsl%2Fcochrane_org.xsl&btnG=Search) but only as a cosmetic cream and as an unproven treatment for poor venous circulation in the legs. What on earth is a \"lymph remedy\". Just another marketing term? \"especially valuable in the treatment of breast, throat and uterus cancer.\" That is a very dramatic claim. It as as though the hapless students were being tutored in doublespeak. What is meant by \"especially valuable in the treatment of\"? Clearly a desperate patient would interpret those words as meaning that there was at least a chance of a cure. That would be a wicked deception because there isn't the slightest reason to think it works. Once again there this wondrous cure is not even mentioned in either NELCAM or NCCAM. Phytolacca is mentioned, as Pokeweed, in Wikipedia but no claims are mentioned even there. And it isn't mentioned in Cochrane reviews either. The dramatic claims are utterly unfounded. Ah the mistletoe story, again. NHS Evidence (NeLCAM) lists [ three completed assessments](http://search.cochrane.org/search?q=centella&restrict=cochrane_org&scso_colloquia_abstracts=colloquia_abstracts&client=my_collection&scso_evidence_aid=evidence_aid&scso_review_abstracts=review_abstracts&lr=&output=xml_no_dtd&sub_site_name=Cochrane_Reviews_search&filter=0&site=my_collection&ie=&oe=&scso_registered_titles=registered_titles&scso_newsletters=newsletters&scso_cochrane_org=this_site&proxystylesheet=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cochrane.org%2Fsearch%2Fgoogle_mini_xsl%2Fcochrane_org.xsl&btnG=Search). One concludes that more research is needed. Another concludes that \"Rigorous trials of mistletoe extracts fail to demonstrate efficacy of this therapy\", and the third says \"The evidence from RCTs to support the view that the application of mistletoe extracts has impact on survival or leads to an improved ability to fight cancer or to withstand anticancer treatments is weak\". NCCAM [says of mistletoe](http://www.cancer.gov/cancerinfo/pdq/cam/mistletoe) - More than 30 human studies using mistletoe to treat cancer have been done since the early 1960s, but major weaknesses in many of these have raised doubts about their findings (see [Question 6](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/mistletoe/patient/21.cdr#Section_21)). - Very few bad side effects have been reported from the use of mistletoe extract, though mistletoe plants and berries are poisonous to humans (see [Question 7](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/mistletoe/patient/25.cdr#Section_25)). - The [U.S. Food and Drug Administration](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454785&version=Patient&language=English)(FDA) has not approved mistletoe as a treatment for cancer or any other medical condition (see [Question 8](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/mistletoe/patient/28.cdr#Section_28)). - The FDA does not allow injectable mistletoe to be imported, sold, or used except for [clinical](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44168&version=Patient&language=English)research (see [Question 8](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/mistletoe/patient/28.cdr#Section_28)). Cochrane reviews lists conclusions. [For example](http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab003297.html) \"The evidence from RCTs to support the view that the application of mistletoe extracts has impact on survival or leads to an improved ability to fight cancer or to withstand anticancer treatments is weak\". Anthroposophy is one of the highest grades of fantasy you can find. A post on that topic is in the works. \"Indicated for cancers . . . colon/rectal, uterine, breast, lung\". A cure for lung cancer? That, of course, depends on how you interpret the weasel words \"indicated for\". Even [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thuja_occidentalis) makes no mention of any claims that Thuja benefits cancer. NHS Evidence (NeLCAM) doesn't mention Thuja for any indication. Neither does NCCAM. Nor Cochrane reviews. That is not the impression the hapless students of this BSc lecture were given. In my view suggestions that you can cure lung cancer with this tree are just plain wicked. Pure snake oil, and not even spelled correctly, Harry Hoxsey's treatment centres in the USA were closed by court order in the 1950s. At least this time it is stated that there is no hard evidence to support this brand of snake oil. More unfounded claims when it says \"treated successfully many cancer patients\". No references and no data to support the claim. It is utterly unfounded and claims to the contrary endanger the public. Gerson therapy is one of the most notorious and unpleasant of the quack cancer treatments. The Gerson Institute is on San Diego, but their clinics are in Mexico and Hungary. It is illegal in the USA. According to the [American Cancer Society](http://www.cancer.org/docroot/ETO/content/ETO_5_3x_Gerson_therapy.asp) you get \"a strict low-salt, low-fat, vegetarian diet and drinking juice from about twenty pounds of fresh fruits and vegetables each day. One glass of juice is consumed each hour, thirteen times a day. In addition, patients are given several coffee enemas each day. Various supplements, such as potassium, vitamin B12, pancreatic enzymes, thyroid hormone, and liver extracts, are used to stimulate organ function, particularly of the liver and thyroid.\". At one time you also got several glasses of raw calf liver every day but after infections killed several people []](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Gerson#cite_note-mmwr-6) carrot juice was given instead. [Cancer Research UK](http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/help/default.asp?page=21853) says \"there is no evidence to show that Gerson therapy works as a cure for cancer\", and \"The Gerson diet can cause some very serious side effects.\" Nobody (except perhaps the Price of Wales) has any belief in this unpleasant, toxic and expensive folk-lore. Again patients are endangered by teaching this sort of stuff. And finally, the usual swipe at vaccines. It's nothing to do with herbalism. but just about every alternative medicine advocate seems to subscribe to the anti-vaccination lobby.. It is almost as though they have an active preference for things that are known to be wrong. They seem to believe that medicine and science are part of an enormous conspiracy to kill everyone. Perhaps this dangerous propaganda might have been ameliorated if the students had been shown this slide ( [from a talk by Melinda Wharton](http://www.cga.ct.gov/coc/PDFs/immunization/wharton_ppt.pdf)). Left to people like this, we would still have smallpox, diphtheria. tetanus and rabies, Take a look at [Vaccine-preventable diseases](http://wolfsden.wordpress.com/2008/08/27/vaccine-preventable-diseases/). This is the sort of 'education' which the Pittilo report wants to make compulsory. [Smallpox in Baltimore,](http://www.williams.edu/resources/chapin/exhibits/disturbing1.html) USA, 1939. This man was not vaccinated. Conclusion This selection of slides shows that much of the stuff taught in degrees in herbal medicine poses a real danger to public safety and to public health. Pittilo's idea that imposing this sort of miseducation will help safety is obviously and dangerously wrong. The Department of Health must reject the Pittilo recommendations on those grounds. Follow-up Here is a short break from the astonishing [festival of chiropractic](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1775) that has followed the British Chiropractic Association (BCA) v Simon Singh defamation case, and the [absurd NICE guidance](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1593) on low back pain. | | Singh's statement already has over 10000 signatories, many very distinguished, Sign it now if you haven't already. And getting on for 600 separate complaints about exaggerated and false claims by chiropractors have been lodged with the General Chiropractic Council and with Trading Standards offices. The BCA has exposed the baselessness of most of chiropractic's claims more effectively than any sceptic could have done. The University of Westminster is seeing the light? It is only recently that the University of Westminster suspended entry to degrees in homeopathy and remedial massage and neuromuscular therapy. Luckily for science, they have a new Dean who knows bullshit when she sees it. I suspect than she has been instrumental in starting to restore Westminster's reputation. The job isn't finished yet though. According to [the UCAS site](http://search.ucas.com/cgi-bin/hsrun/search/search/StateId/DznxSo5l-E-1c2C8bLXFFVBCTGQQA-3kKP/HAHTpage/search.HsKeywordSearch.whereNext?query=5382&word=COMPLEMENTARY+MEDICINE) Westminster still offers - Chinese Medicine: Acupuncture with Foundation (B341) 4FT Hon Health Medicine (B342) 3FT Hon BSc - Health Sciences: Herbal Medicine with 4FT BSc - Sciences: Naturopathy (B391) Sciences: Foundation Hon - Health Nutritional Therapy (B400) Therapy with Foundn (B402) 4FT Hon BSc With the possible exception of herbal medicine, which could be taught scientifically. all the rest is as delusional as homeopathy. Rumour has it that Naturopathy may be next for the chop, so it seems appropriate to help the dean by showing a bit more of what the hapless students get taught. Remember that, according to Westminster, this is a bachelor of science degree! Psychotherapeutic Approaches in Naturopathy 3CMW606 \"This module is a core subject for BSc (Hons) Health Sciences: Naturopathy and BSc Bodywork; Graduate Diploma in Therapeutic Bodywork.\" Lectures 3 - 5 of this course are about the Theory and Application of EmoTrance. EMOTRANCE? No I had never heard of it either. But it takes only two minutes with Google to discover that it yet another product of the enormous navel-gazing self-help industry. A new variant is born almost every day, and no doubt they make buckets of money for their inventors. You can download a primer from [http://emotrance.com/](http://emotrance.com/). The web site announces. \"EmoTrance REAL energy healing for the 21st Century\" Here are three quotations from the primer. | | And then I thought of the lady in the supermarket whose husband had died, and I spend the following time sending her my best wishes, and my best space time quantum healing efforts for her void. It doesn't matter how \"bad\"; something is or how old, it is ONLY AN ENERGY and energy can be moved with consciousness in quantum time, easily, and just for the asking. Is EmoTrance a Science? Now back to Westminster Here are a few slides about EmoTrance So it is pure vitalistic psycho-babble. The usual undefined use of impressive sounding words like \"energy\" and \"quantum\" with no defined meaning. Just preposterous made-up gobbledygook. Before getting to EmoTrance, the course Psychotherapeutic Approaches in Naturopathy (3CMW606) had a lecture on Flower Essences. The evidence says, not surprisingly, that the effects of flower essences is not distinguishable from placebo \"The hypothesis that flower remedies are associated with effects beyond a placebo response is not supported by data from rigorous clinical trials.\" (See Ernst Wien. Klin. Wochenschr. 2002 114(23-24):963-6). Here are two of the slides. This last slide departs from the simply silly to the totally mad. Dowsing? Kinesiology? Pendulums I'm told from more than one source that the use of pendulums is not uncommon. both in teaching and by students in the Westminster University polyclinic Apparently they provide an excellent way to choose a 'remedy' or make a diagnosis (well, I expect they are as good as the alternatives). If in doubt, guess. Of course pendulums were popular with Cherie Blair [who is reported](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1456688/Cherie-took-Leo-to-pendulum-healer-in-place-of-MMR-jab.html) to have taken her son Leo to a pendulum waver, [Jack Temple](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1454835/Jack-Temple.html), rather than have him vaccinated with MMR. At least her delusions affected fewer people than those of her husband (the latest [Iraq body count](http://www.iraqbodycount.org/) is about 100,000). Kinesiology was originally a word that applied to the perfectly sensible science of human movement. But [Applied Kinesiology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_kinesiology) more often refers now to a fraudulent and totally ineffective diagnostic method invented by (you guessed) a chiropractor. It has been widely used by alternative medicine to misdiagnose food allergies. It does not work (Garrow, 1988: [download reprint](/garrow-kinesiology-bmj-1988.pdf)). General Chiropractic Council It is a mind-boggling sign of the incompetence of the General Chiropractic Council that they manage to include kinesiology within their definition of \"evidence based care\". Their definition is clearly sufficiently flexible to include anything whatsoever. The incompetence of the GCC is documented in superb detail on [jdc325's blog (James Cole)](http://jdc325.wordpress.com/2009/06/09/incompetence-and-the-general-chiropractic-council/). Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence (CHRE) is yet another example of the network of ineffective and incompetent quangos that plague us.. It is meant to ensure that regulation is effective but utterly fails to do so. The CHRE is [quoted as saying](http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=20&storycode=4122930&c=2) \"[The GCC] takes its role seriously and aspires to, and often maintains, excellence.\". Like endorsing kinesiology and 'craniosacral therapy' perhaps? Quangos like the CHRE not only fail to ensure regulatory excellence, they actually endorse rubbish. They do more harm than good.

What? No honestly, I didn't invent that. The idea that stuff of this sort is appropriate for a bachelor of science degree is simply ludicrous. I have no doubt that Westminster's new dean can see that as well as anyone else. She has the delicate diplomatic job of extirpating the nonsense, I wish her well. Follow-up The Nutrition Society is the interim professional body for nutrition. It seems that, unlike so many 'regulatory bodies', it may actually take its responsibilities seriously. The following announcement has [appeared on their web site](http://www.nutritionsociety.org/node/36). | | The UK Voluntary Register of Nutritionists acts to protect the public and the reputation the nutrition profession On March 4th 2009, a Fitness to Practice Panel was convened to consider an allegation against a registrant, Dr Ann Walker, that her fitness to practise was impaired. The panel considered whether the registrant, in advocating the use of a web based personal nutritional profiling service had complied with the Code of Ethics' clause 3: This expects all registered nutritionists to \"maintain the highest standards of professionalism and scientific integrity\". In particular, the panel considered whether the registrant showed \"knowledge, skills and performance of high quality, up-to-date, and relevant to their field of practice\", in keeping with the Statement of Professional Conduct (para 9). The Panel accepted the allegation of impaired fitness to practice. Mindful of its duty to protect the public, it recommended that Dr Walker be removed from the register. Dr Walker has a right of appeal. Well. well, this must be none other than the Dr Ann Walker who caused UCL,and me, such trouble a few years ago. And just because I described her use of the word \"blood cleanser\" as gobbledygook. She has appeared a few times on this blog. [Nutribollocks: antioxidants useless, some are dangerous](http://dcscience.net/?p=90) [Red clover, interests](http://dcscience.net/?p=78) test](http://dcscience.net/?p=169) [Nutriprofile: useful aid or sales scam?](http://dcscience.net/?p=221) - She even gets a brief mention at [Boots reaches new level of dishonesty with CoQ10 promotion](http://dcscience.net/?p=223) Presumably the \"web-based personal nutritional profiling service\" that is referred to is Nutriprofile, on which, with the help of a dietition, we had a bit of fun a while ago. However ideal your diet it still recommended at the end of the questionnaire that you should buy some expensive supplements. Read about it at [Nutriprofile: useful aid or sales scam?](http://dcscience.net/?p=221) I have no idea who lodged the complaint (but it wasn't me). It is interesting to compare the high standards of the Nutrition Society with the quite different standards of BANT (the British Association for Applied Nutrition and Nutritional Therapy). They bill themselves as the \"Professional Body for Nutritional Therapists\". Nutritional therapists are those fantasists who believe you can cure any ill by buying some supplement pills. Their standards can be judged by, for example, [BANT ethics code: BANT nutritional therapists are allowed to earn commission from selling pills and tests](http://holfordwatch.info/2008/04/07/bant-ethics-code-bant-nutritional-therapists-are-allowed-to-earn-commission-from-selling-pills-and-tests/). It seems Dr Ann Walker may have joined the wrong society. Follow-up Sense about Science have just produced a rather good pamphlet that exposes, yet again. the meaningless marketing slogan \"detox\". You can [download the pamphlet ](http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/index.php/site/about/282)from their web site. The pamphlet goes through the claims of eleven products. Needless to say, the claims are either meaningless, or simply untrue. - Garnier Clean Detox Anti-Dullness Foaming Gel \"Detoxifies by cleansing surface\" - MG Detox Shampoo Trevor Sorbie \"Deep cleansing and clarifying shampoo\" - Boots Detox Body Brush \"Ritualistic body brushing helps expel toxins through the skin\" - Innocent Natural Detox Smoothie \"Helps neutralise nasty free radicals which can cause damage to your body's cells\" - Vitabiotics Detoxil 15 day support \"Helps the body cleanse itself of toxins and pollutants caused by the excesses of a busy life\" - V-Water Detox \"Cleanse your system and whisk away the polluting nasties\" - 4321 Shape Up and Detox \"To drain off water and toxins\" and \"purify the body\" - Boots Detox 5 Day Plan Works \"in harmony with your body to flush away toxins\" - Farmacia Spa Therapy Detox range To \"rid your body of these damaging toxins\" - Crystal Spring Detox patches \"I'm the easy way to detox, just put me on one foot at night and take me off in the morning\" - Fushi Holistic and Health Solutions Total Detox Patch \"it acts as a toxin sink and absorbs impurities through your feet\" One nice thing about the pamphlet is that each item is written by a young scientist (including my close neighbour, Daniella Muallem). They are all people at an early stage in their career, but they care enough to spend time dissecting the rubbish spread by companies in order to part you from your money. Garnier, it's true, is a cosmetics company, so one expects nothing but lies You won't be disappointed on that score. That [least ethical of pharmaceutical companies](http://dcscience.net/?cat=66), Boots, appears twice The Boots Detox Body Brush is reviewed by a young chemist, Tom Wells. It turns out (there's a surprise) to be nothing more than an ordinary stiff brush. It seems that Boots' definition of \"detox\", for this purpose, is \"removing dead skin cells\" A totally shameless con, in other words. The Boots Detox 5 day plan consists if 5 phials of apple or strawberry flavoured goo containing two vitamins and one mineral, mixed with glycerol. In this case the young investigator, Evelyn Harvey, elicited a quite remarkable response from Boots. Well, have you tested the effects of that diet, with or without the detox product? Does the 'goo' stuff [the drink which forms part of the plan] add anything extra? Well, it's meant to kick start it. But has is been tested like that? No. Ok, I'm thinking I'll just try a healthy diet for a week, a bit more exercise, and not bother with buying the detox. Yes, that sounds like a better idea, to be honest I'd never do this myself. The media coverage The Radio 4 Today programme interviewed Ben Goldacre and the managing director of yet another product \"Detox in a box\" (following their usual policy of equal time for the Flat Earth Society). [Listen to the mp3](/detox-today-050109 Jan 05.mp3). When Ben Goldacre asked the MD for evidence for the claim made on the web site of Detox in a box, that their diet could remove cadmium from the body, it was denied explicitly that any such claim had been made. Not so. But by 10.02 the site had already changed So no apology for the mistake. Just a sneaky removal of a few words. That seems to be the only change though. All the rest of the nutribollocks is still there. For example There isn't the slightest reason to believe that it will \"improve our immune function\". There isn't the slightest reason to think that scavenging free radicals would do you any good, even if it happened. There isn't the slightest reason to think it will strengthen body's fight against cancer cells (that looks like a breach of the Cancer Act to me). \"Cleansing mucous\" doesn't mean much, but whatever it is there isn't any reason to think its true. \"Purify our blood\". Total meaningless bollocks. The words mean nothing at all. [I've been here before.](http://dcscience.net/?p=16) Ben Goldacre's own account is here \" [The barefaced cheek of these characters will never cease to amaze and delight me](http://www.badscience.net/2009/01/the-barefaced-cheek-of-these-characters-will-never-cease-to-amaze-and-delight-me/).\" The BBC web site does [a good job](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7808348.stm) too.

Thames Valley University is one of those shameful institutions that offer Bachelor of Science degrees in homeopathy. They don't stop there though. They'll teach you several other forms of make-believe medicine. Among these is \"nutritional medicine\". This is taught at the Plaskett Nutritional Medicine College which is now part of Thames Valley University. Everyone is for good nutrition of course, but 'nutritional medicine', or 'nutritional therapy' pretends to be able to cure all sorts of diseases by changes in diet or by buying expensive nutritional supplement pills. It has no perceptible relationship to the very important subjects of 'nutrition' or 'dietetics'. Nutritional therapy is very firmly part of alternative medicine, in other words it is largely quackery. If you don't believe that, read on. The subject of nutritional therapy was in the news recently because of Matthias Rath. He is the person who is reponsible for the death of many Africans because of his advocacy of vitamin pills for the treatment of HIV/AIDS. He didn't just (mis)treat people, but also played a role in persuading the recently departed Thabo Mbeki, and his health minister (\"Mrs Beetroot\") to abandon effective therapies for AIDS sufferers. See reports in [The Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/sep/12/matthiasrath.aids2), by [Ben Goldacre](http://www.badscience.net/2008/09/matthias-rath-pulls-out-forced-to-pay-the-guardians-costs-i-think-this-means-i-win/), and [here](http://dcscience.net/?p=256), I've written a lot about the penetration of quackery into universities, and I thought I'd seen the worst with ' [amethysts emit high yin energy](http://dcscience.net/?p=227)'. But, as Goldacre said, [let me tell you how bad things have become](http://dcscience.net/?p=254). . Recently I came into possession of a lengthy set of notes for a first year course on \"The Holistic Model of Healthcare\". The notes are from the 2005 course at Thames Valley University, They are not signed, but appear to have been written by [Dr Lawrence Plaskett](http://www.therapyofcancer.co.uk/about.cfm) himself. . You can download [ the whole set of notes here](/tvu-plaskett-nut-therap-2005.pdf). Here are a few choice quotations. The basis of them is pure [vitalism](http://skepdic.com/vitalism.html). They read like a throwback to the dark ages. Little comment is needed. They speak for themselves. 1.3 What do Orthodox Dieticians know about Food and Health? Dieticians working in the National Health Service and private clinics and hospitals are usually well trained in the basics of the subject, though they too have an entirely orthodox slant. By and large they seem to accept the general view of most of the medical profession that nutrition does not affect illness much. Hence, they restrict themselves to designing diets required by the doctors for whom they work - usually for specified narrow purposes, such as low fat diets, low sodium diets etc. Such diets are, indeed, important in the hospital management of certain diseases (once these have become established) but they represent extremely limited horizons. Much that is in the basic and essential training of alternative nutritional practitioners is missing from the training of dieticians. As a result, most hospital diets are not very good for health judging from the parameters that will be set down in the following Sessions Well, it is true that real dietitians prefer not to base their practice on mediaeval vitalism. That is what marks them out as professionals. 1.4 Relationship to Science and the Limitations of Orthodox Methods However, the subject of Wholistic Nutrition transcends the area of human understanding for which science, alone, is appropriate. The reason is that it is 'vitalistic'. It recognises the presence in all life forms including the human body, of subtle (or 'etheric') energy forces not easily measurable by the physicist's equipment. It shares that position with the 'energy medicine' disciplines such as homoeopathy, traditional acupuncture and spiritual healing. It follows an approach to those subtle energies that is embodied in the discipline and philosophy of naturopathy. Vitalism is the notion that life in living organisms is sustained by a vital principle that cannot be explained in terms of physics and chemistry. This vital principle, often called \"the life force\", is something quite distinct from the physical body and is responsible for much that happens in health and disease. Naturopathy is a relatively modem term for an ancient concept (dating back to 400 BC). This concept embraces the notion that the body is inherently self-healing and that it is the practitioner's job to stimulate and support this process. Each patient is recognised as having a unique life experience and a unique genetic inheritance. All diseases are seen as one and as attempts by the body to purify itself of toxins. Treatment focuses on causes rather than on symptoms and always addresses the whole person. The wise words of Hippocrates (often called the Father of Medicine) express some of the main tenants of naturopathic thought. He said: - It is only nature that heals and wherever and whenever possible nature should be given the opportunity to do so. - Disease is only an expression of purification. - All disease is one. - Let food be your medicine and medicine be your food.\" Hence, most 'alternative' nutritionists see conventional nutrition. as being rather rigid and unmoving. Hence, they also see it as very limited. This happens because orthodox nutritionists tend to be locked into science alone. They fail to grasp the significance (or the reality of) the subtle energies and they reject the philosophy of vitalism. It is generally the view of 'alternative' nutritionists that understanding these things is a major step to healing the patient. \"Understanding\" vitalism sounds more like a way of harming patients than healing patients. 1.5 The Pressure of the Orthodox model Almost everyone who takes steps towards 'alternative' medicine experiences a backlash from others around them who have not been able to make the same conceptual change. Patients wanting to settle into an 'alternative' approach can be subject to negativity from their doctors (and as a result many patients do not ask the doctor's opinion). But students and practitioners alike are frequently subject to negative expressions and even frank hostility from relatives who can understand only orthodox, symptomatic treatment. It is therefore best to be forewarned that your adherence to 'alternative' principles will be tested in these ways. The \"Life Force\" gets capital letters, like God, But what is it? Pure fantasy. 2 THE LIFE FORCE 2.1 What does our Energy Consist of? At the root of most hoIistic therapies lies the belief that all life is animated by a subtle force. We call this the Life Force. You either believe it or you do not. It cannot exactly be proved at the moment and the belief is not in accord with the yardsticks that we call 'scientific', The belief is a little akin to the belief in God or in spirits or ghosts, and yet at the same time it is not, because the Life Force is by no means so remote from us. It is not necessarily difficult for an agnostic to accept the Life Force. The writer was once asked for a definition of the Life Force and wrote: \" The Life Force is that non-material. non-physical force that animates all life forms and distinguishes them from non-living matter. It Is seen as a determining Force, not as a mere accompaniment to the phenomenon of Life. That is, it determines whether Life can exist or not. It determines the physical form that a life form takes: by its quality and its strength it determines the health, vigour and vitality of the life form. Hence it determines our freedom from, or our susceptibility to illnesses, and our general ability to come through and to recover from Life's stresses and traumas.\" A bit later it gets even better, when we get to astral travel and even survival after death. Truly bonkers. The postulate of a subtle Life Force makes a natural connection with such topics as out of body experiences, astral travel and even survival after death. This happens because the subtle Life Force appears by its very nature to be \"life within a different medium\" and if life can exist in a different medium, then why should it not exist quite independently of the physical body? So what's the evidence? 2.2 Evidence Concerning the Life Force Since our 'usual' human senses only work through the medium of the human body we can only expect to detect the Life Force or other subtle forces, through their interactions with matter. It is clear that these interactions are themselves subtle and sensitive because one level or state is impinging upon another. It is postulated that they are not entirely of our world, not physical, only detectable with physical apparatus under special conditions. Often they are described as \"that which science cannot see\". Not surprisingly, therefore, when investigators come forward convinced that they have a phenomenon that demonstrates the Life Force. the physicists, looking at it with a steely scientific eye, are not usually ready to accept the conclusions claimed. Hence, we have several delicate phenomena that are often claimed to be manifestations of the Life Force, yet not accepted as such scientifically. The experiments done by Harold Saxton Burr on the \"Fields of Life\". The experimen1s performed on detecting and measuring \"Electrodynamic fields\" The phenomenon of \"Capillary dynamolysis\" Homoeopathic effects. The Chinese 'energy pulses' at the human wrists. From experience it is clear that many students will simply accept the Life Force as 'obvious'. Some will say they have always known about it. Others are able to accept the concept now as a reasonable principle. Others perhaps (though we have rarely come across it) will never accept the Life Force. If that occurs, it seems a shame, for it removes some of the excitement from wholistic nutrition, . . . What's said about the homeopathic evidence? 2.6 Homoeopathic Effects It is not until Nutritional Medicine students have qualified and got into practice that they usually employ any homoeopathy as an adjunct to their therapy in anything other than a first-aid role. That is because homoeopathy is a complex training in its own right and a quite separate discipline. However, any demonstration of the effectiveness of homoeopathic medicines at potencies higher than 12C is evidence for the existence of the subtle etheric energies. Such remedies have been diluted beyond the point at which the last traces of material substance derived from the Mother tincture, have been removed, leaving only the residual energy associated with the original material. Of course the notes go on to misrepresent the clinical trials which actually show that homeopathy is mere placebo. 2.9 Toxic Effects upon the Life Force The Life Force is generally seen as an abundant ebullient and beautiful manifestation of Nature's energy. Although some forms of acupuncture take in the concept of a form of polluted Life Force called Aggressive Energy\", that idea is not shared much by other whoIistic disciplines. We are left for the most part with the idea of a rather perfect form of energy. In Western Naturopathic thought, the enemy of the Life Force is toxicity. The Life Force inhabits a potentially perfect physical body. The main threat to the integrity of that body consists of the body's own metabolic wastes, if they are not properly cleared out. Plus environmental toxins that gain access to the body from outside, or that are generated in the bowel. In that way the bowel gains a high level of importance in Naturopathy and '\"Nature Cure\". The Life Force, then, with its almost holy purity, is in danger of being inhibited, dampened down and threatened by what amounts to some entirely physical dirt that gains access to that temple of the soul the human body. Whilst in Traditional Chinese Medicine impurities in the mind, emotions or spirit are just as important as physical impurity, it is naturopathy that focuses upon the actual physical sewers of the body. Aha, that's it. Holy water. The inability of naturopaths in the past to identify specific toxins or to point with sufficient exactitude to the ways in which they can be removed, has been the Achilles Heel of the naturopaths in trying to represent their views in the past to orthodox doctors or medical scientists. And it still is. The alleged toxins have never been identified, still less removed. [Detoxification is a myth ](http://www.badscience.net/?p=134)of downmarket women's magazines and profiteering spas. And, of course, of some Bachelor of Science degrees. 2.10 Nutritional Effects upon the Life Force 2.10.1 Bulk nutrients Next comes the consideration of the bulk nutrients - the protein, carbohydrate and fat. These are our source of biochemical energy and we obviously starve without them. Their purity is crucial. If they have been chemically modified or damaged by toxic interactions, then they will entrain toxicity and also be hard to break down. Even at best, their digestion and assimilation costs energy, which may well be both biochemical and subtle. What \"toxic interactions\"? This is all sheer fantasy. 2.10.3 The micronutrients When you practice [sic] nutritional therapy in a naturopathic setting, being aware at the same time of the on-going biochemistry, you become critically aware of the role of the micronutrients in a way that the classical naturopaths were not. Biochemical reactions will flow better when they are present in the correct balance. Therefore the minerals have a key interaction with the Life Force. Without the right minerals the Life Force can be conceived of as pushing forward to achieve high activity in the body, yet being blocked through the chemical composition not being correct. If you apply the minerals in this situation, there may, indeed. be a surge forward of the energy. Whatever that may mean. 3 THE EBULLIENCE OF THE LIFE FORCE: STOPPING THE ROT AND STARTING TO RECOVER 3.1 The Horror of Deterioration: The Chronic State All that has gone before has already shown that the grassroots of deterioration in the physical body are: - Weakened Life Force - Nutritional Deficiency and Imbalance - Toxic Attack If nutritional error or deprivation are the more strongly implicated primary cause, then the Life Force struggles with an unbalanced physical body, getting the tissue biochemistry to work at full integrity is impossible; hence. the body's detoxification system becomes incompetent and the body's toxic burden may rise steeply. At the same time the Life Force ails. So, focusing as we do now upon elimination of toxins (the very nub of classical naturopathy), we perceive that it is a process that depends upon a good strong Life Force and also upon adequate nutrient intake. Therapies that directly stimulate the Life Force (homoeopathy, acupuncture and spiritual healing) therefore make an indirect, though real, contribution to toxic elimination through increasing the Life Force or otherwise improving its health and balance. So according to this, all CAM is much the same. That idea will provoke bitter internecine warfare. 3.5 The Law of Cure We have above depicted the move from relative health to chronic illness as a downward path. Equally, the route back from the edge of the abyss of chronic illness is one of revitalisation and detoxification. The idea of the 'route back' was spotted years ago by the homoeopath, Constantine Hering, and has become known as 'Hering's Law of Cure'. The Law further embodies the notion that toxins, and therefore symptoms, tend to move outward from within as recovery or cleansing occurs. This is fully in accord with the classical naturopath's idea. Toxins close to the surface of the body are conceived to be most likely on their way out. The skin is an eliminatory organ and toxins at or near the skin level are not so much of a threat to well being. Naturally, the patient may well be horrified at the disfiguring rash that may be seen by all. Nonetheless, the patient is seen to be far better off than when having these toxins deep within the body, held, perhaps within essential organs that are becoming progressively damaged. This sounds increasingly like a 'do-nothing' approach (much like homeopathy then). 3.6 Suppression Boils used to swell up into a red sore and then burst. Very bad ones, or carbuncles, might be lanced to cause the pus (morbid matter) to run out. These days, boils and carbuncles tend to occur much less than formerly, presumably because of the lower Life Force of the population and the generally suppressive medical culture. The chances are that they get treated with an antibiotic long before they get a chance to come to a head and burst. Such treatment is suppressive in the strictly naturopathic sense of the word. The same is absolutely true with regard to bringing down artificially the temperature during a fever, whereas 'sweating it out' is the natural thing to do. More of the do-nothing approach. 4.2 How lridology Helps us to See Toxic Foci As mentioned above, toxic foci (deposits) in the body show up in the iris of the eye. The iris is arranged so as to encompass a complete 'map' of the body. with all the organs and systems laid out upon it. Hence the location of a toxic deposit in the iris shows the iridologist its position within the body. The toxins may appear as colours, spots. blobs and smears in particular places in the iris, or as darkened areas. Now [iridology, another sort of fantasy medicine](http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/iridology.html), creeps in. 5.5 What Place for Immunisations? Here we shall restrict ourselves to saying as little as possible. We shall. indeed, make no recommendations. However. the classical naturopaths and homoeopaths have all been of one voice in condemning the use of morbid diseased matter for injection into the human body to prevent disease. It was not, they said, a proper procedure. There has also been much disagreement about how effective such measures are. Of course, whenever there is danger of infection. it is wrong to do nothing. At least you should use the homoeopathic equivalent treatment. As to the effectiveness of those methods, that is beyond the scope of this course. As to the personal view of the writer, it is that the natural therapists who have declared thernselves on this topic in the past are probably right. They have maintained that immunisation is just another form of toxin and an especially potent one capable, on its own, of sparking a downward spiral into ill health in susceptible people. As to what extent that effect might be balanced by benefit, that is an unresolved argument. The writer does not use immunisations himself. Well there is a surprise. Just like almost every other quack, the writer would endanger the whole population by opposing immunisation. The quiz The notes contain a number of questions, and, more interestingly, model answers are given at the end. Here is one example. Question. Why do some patients respond well to very little treatment? Answer. The size of the toxic burden, the strength of the Life Force and micro nutrient status strongly influence a person's response to treatment. Therefore a person with a low toxic burden, high micro nutrient status and strong life force should respond well to very little treatment. Or, to put it differently, echinacea cures your cold in seven days, when otherwise it would have taken a week. Conclusion We'll always have crackpot ideas about medicine, at least until real medicine gets much more effective than it is now. For example, in low back pain, the cause is usually not known, the treatments are only palliative, and it isn't very effective palliation either. The big difference between real medicine and crackpot medicine, is that in real medicine you aren't allowed to invent the answer when you don't know it. No doubt the author of these fantasy notes was entirely sincere in his delusions. But how can any self-respecting vice-chancellor tolerate having this sort of stuff as part of a Bachelor of Science degree? Professor Peter John, vice-chancellor of Thames Valley University is not a scientist. His background is in education. But you don't need to be a scientist to see what nonsense is being taught as science in his university. Perhaps he didn't know what is going on. Well, he does now.

Then the next day, Chris McGreal [investigates the Rath Foundation](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/sep/15/matthiasrath.aids) Nutritional therapist? Let's be clear about what the words mean. Nutritional therapists are not like dietitians, and they are not like nutritionists. Nutritional therapists are solidly in the camp of alternative medicine practitioners, Don't take my word for it. [They say so themselves](http://www.bant.org.uk/bant/pdf/Optimum_Nutrition_Boundaries.pdf). \"For nutritional therapists (who practise Complementary and Alternative Medicine) optimum nutrition encompasses individual prescriptions for diet and lifestyle in order to alleviate or prevent ailments and to promote optimal gene expression through all life stages. Recommendations may include guidance on natural detoxification, procedures to promote colon health, methods to support digestion and absorption, the avoidance of toxins or allergens and the appropriate use of supplementary nutrients, including phytonutrients.\" They love to use imaginary words like \"detoxification\", and, much more dangerously, they love to pretend that they can cure diseases by changes in diet. As long as you buy from them a stack of expensive \"supplement\" pills, of course. That means they are selling medicines, but by pretending they are selling food supplements they manage to evade the law that requires medicines to be safe and effective. That will not be so easy under new legislation though, and we can look forward to a few prosecutions soon. Guess who runs an [\"Honours BSc degree\" in Nutritional Therapy](http://www.wmin.ac.uk/sih/page-46). No prizes for realising it is the [UK's leading university purveyor of woo](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=401581). The University of Westminster On their web site we learn that the Course Leader is [Heather Rosa](http://www.wmin.ac.uk/sih/page-147), and the Deputy Course Leader is [Val Harvey](http://www.wmin.ac.uk/sih/page-181). Harvey qualified in the subject at the Institute of Optimum Nutrition, the private college run by none other than the famous pill-peddler, Patrick Holford, about whom so very much has been written (try [Holfordwatch](http://holfordwatch.info/), or the masterly chapter in Goldacre's [Bad Science](http://dcscience.net/?p=254)) We don't know much about what is taught on the Nutritional Therapy course because the University of Westminster has refused repeated requests to say (but watch this space).. One can only assume that, whatever it is, they are not very proud of it. It seems a little unlikely that they will go as far as Matthias Rath and claim to cure AIDS -we'll just have to wait and see. Meanwhile we can get an inkling by looking elsewhere. Course leader, Heather Rosa, pops up for example, on the expert panel of a web site called [Supplements Compared.com](http://www.supplementscompared.com/about-us/expert-panel/). \"Supplements Compared is designed [to help you find the best dietary supplement product for your health needs](http://www.supplementscompared.com/about-us/).\" And what sort of advice do you find there? Try the page that [compares 10 brands of CoQ10](http://www.supplementscompared.com/cellular-antioxidants/) (that is the stuff I wrote about recently, in \" [Boots reaches new level of dishonesty with CoQ10 promotion](http://dcscience.net/?p=223)\" - their advertising was [deemed improper](http://dcscience.net/?p=232) by the ASA ). It isn't a recommended treatment for anything at all, but you certainly wouldn't guess that from what is written by the 'expert panel'. [The winners](http://www.supplementscompared.com/cellular-antioxidants/p/0/) are, according Holland and Barrett's CoQ10. Winners? Perhaps the explanation for that comes elsewhere, under [\"How are we funded?\"](http://www.supplementscompared.com/about-us/#How%20are%20we%20funded?). \"Manufacturers who are awarded \"best product\" and \"worth a look\" are given the opportunity to promote this fact throughout the site for an additional fee.\". Well well. Deputy Course leader, Val Harvey has her [own web site](http://www.vh-nutrition.co.uk/index.htm) and business (I do hope thar Westminster does not pay these people a full time salary too). What can we glean from there? It has the usual scare tactics \" [Why you are at risk?](http://www.vh-nutrition.co.uk/importance.htm)\". Never fear; buy enough vitamin pills and you'll be saved. Her [home page](http://www.vh-nutrition.co.uk/index.htm) makes some pretty drastic claims. \"Potential health benefits of your nutritional programme An appropriate Nutritional Programme can benefit many conditions including: Allergies Arthritis Asthma Bloating, indigestion Chronic degenerative diseases Chronic fatigue, ME Constipation, diarrhoea Cystitis Depression, mood swings Digestive or bowel problems Eczema, psoriasis, other skin problems Food sensitivities Frequent infections Hormone imbalance Hypertension or elevated cholesterol Irritable bowel syndrome Low energy Menopausal symptoms Migraines, headaches Parasitic and fungal infections Pre-conceptual issues Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) Sinus congestion Stress Thrush Weight problems and many others .... These are just some of the wide range of health problems that may be helped by nutritional therapy. Even those who consider themselves well and healthy may be able to enhance their physical and mental health, as well as their performance, including athletic performance, by improving their nutrition.\" There is, in my view, not the slightest bit of good evidence that swallowing vitamin pills can benefit most of these conditions. But at least the list doesn't contain AIDS, so is all this really relevant to the case of Matthias Rath? Yes, I believe it is. The University of Westminster may well not support the views of Matthias Rath (they won't say), but we have heard no choruses of protests about him from any nutritional therapists, as far as I'm aware. There is no mention of him at all on [the web site](http://www.bant.org.uk/bant/jsp/index.faces) of the British Association of Nutritional Therapists (BANT), the UK club for these people. BANT, by the way, has a rather curious [code of ethics](/bant-code_of_ethics.pdf). It allows its members to take undisclosed financial kickbacks for the pills they prescribe to patients. If doctors were caught doing that they'd be struck off the register. It is the existence of degrees in subjects like \"nutritional therapy\" that gives the subject a spurious air of respectability which allows seriously dangerous people like Rath to flourish with very little criticism. In an indirect way, the vice-chancellors who allow it to flourish (and Universities UK who do nothing about it) must bear some small part of the responsibility for the deaths of thousands of people from AIDS. It is about time they did something about it. Follow-up ANH. The first reaction from the supplement-peddling industry comes from the [Alliance for Natural Health](http://www.anhcampaign.org/news/dr-rath-under-fire%E2%80%94-there-silver-lining) on 16th September. It contains not one word of condemnation for Rath's murderous activities. It's hard to believe how low they will sink. The [Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health](http://www.fih.org.uk/) remains totally silent about Rath. HRH's concern for health seems to dry up if things don't suit his views. The British Association of Nutritional Therapists shows it's total irresponsibility after [a letter was sent](http://jdc325.wordpress.com/2008/09/17/critical-self-appraisal-in-alternative-medicine/) to them to ask about their reaction. Their answer , on [jdc325's weblog](http://jdc325.wordpress.com/2008/09/18/bant-no-opinion/) was \"The association has no opinion to offer on Dr Raths vitamin trials.\". My original piece on [Integrative Baloney@Yale](http://dcscience.net/?p=231) was posted on May 16th, after I got back from a visit there. The [talk I gave there](http://dcscience.net/yale-endarkenment-poster-120508.pdf) included a short video. My movie, [Integrative baloney@Yale](http://dcscience.net/?p=231), was made entirely from clips taken from Yale's own YouTube movies which showed something approaching three hours of its \"1st Annual Scientific [sic] symposium\", entitled \"Complementary and Alternative Medicine: Evidence for Integration\". I had merely interspersed a few titles to show the worst scientific absurdities of that rather pathetic event. YouTube removed the movie last week. You can [download the movie here](http://dcscience.net/yale-int-med-symp-08.wmv) [15.8 Mb, wmv file]. It should soon reappear on YouTube (actually it took over a month and several reminders, but eventually they kept their word in the end). Yale's lawyers had written to YouTube, to have my movie removed. I guess if you have no evidence, all you can do is resort to law to suppress the views of those who have the temerity to point out that the emperor is naked. Last week it was [New Zealand Chiropractors' Association Inc](http://dcscience.net/?p=245). This week the rather more substantial Yale University. We live in interesting times. This is what I got on 15th August. |Dear Member | This is to notify you that we have removed or disabled access to the following material as a result of a third-party notification by Yale University, Yale School of Medicine (CME) claiming that this material is infringing: Integrative baloney@Yale: Please Note: Repeated incidents of copyright infringement will result in the deletion of your account and all videos uploaded to that account. In order to prevent this from happening If you clicked on the link you saw \"This video is no longer available due to a copyright claim by Yale University, Yale School of Medicine (CME)\" It seems that [Yale's Continuing Medical Education (CME)](http://cme.yale.edu/) department was responsible. Of course Yale is correct. I expect they own the copyright of their original movies, but they are not what I posted. I would argue that selecting 6 minutes from a 3 hour original amounts to \"fair quotation\", no different from when one cites a short passage from somebody else's book or paper. Perhaps Yale was just a bit jealous that my movie was getting viewed a lot more times than theirs. Or perhaps they were a bit peeved that a Google search for \"Yale Integrative Medicine\" produced my movie as #2 (add the word movie and I was #1). My movie seems to me to be fair comment from someone who is a pharmacologist by trade. Apparently it didn't seem that way to the apparatchiks of Yale Medical School, who seem to think that academic arguments should be settled by paying lawyers to suppress views they don't like, rather than by rational discussion. It's interesting that the three hours of Yale's own movie have also vanished from YouTube. Could that be because they realise that the remarks made at the meeting are so embarrassing intellectually that it would be better not to make them public? Actually, no. What does Yale CME say? Rather than publishing this straight away, I thought it better to delve a bit further into what had happened. I lodged an appeal with YouTube and I wrote to Ronald J. Vender, MD (Associate Dean, YSM Clinical Affairs, CMO, Yale Medical Group, Medical Director, Yale CME ). The outcome was rather interesting. First, it turned out that the original posting of the three hours of the symposium proceedings on YouTube was itself unauthorised, which is why it suffered the same fate as my movie. Dr Vender told me that he is new to the job, and didn't know about the incident. What's more surprising, he said he \"did not know an Integrative Program even existed at Yale\". That does seem a bit odd indeed for an Associate Dean of Clinical Affairs. However, Dr Vender turned out to be a very reasonable man,.After some amiable correspondence over the weekend, it took him only a day and a half to sort the matter out. After talking to Yale's attorney, he wrote on 19th August, thus \"The University attorney believes that there is in fact a difference between the initial unauthorized filming of an entire conference as opposed to quoting from that conference. Therefore, she has agreed to withdraw the injunction that has been imposed on your use of the material. YouTube will be contacted.\" That's good for me, but it isn't the main thing. The movie would doubtless have been seen by more people if Yale had tried to maintain the ban. Much more impressively, Dr Vender also said \"As for this particular program, I will be speaking with Dr Belitsky and the program directors to encourage them to adopt a more critical view of the scientific basis for claims made by proponents of CAM. They will also be encouraged to develop a future program that includes faculty who have opposing points of view.\" It remains to be seen what actually happens, but so far, so good. What next? The removal of the original videos of the meeting is understandable because they were pretty embarrassing to Yale. But can that be the real reason? I was told that it is simply because their posting was \"unauthorised\". But Yale Continuing Medical Education [ still boasts about the meeting](http://cme.yale.edu/hpstory.html) on their own web site. They describe the meeting as \"successful\", but if they are so proud of it, why remove the video from YouTube whether it was authorised or not? We are told \"The symposium, accredited for 7.5 AMA PRA Category 1 Credits, began what is hoped to be a long tradition at the Yale School of Medicine.\" They give credits for such miseducation? Dr Katz's phrase \"we need a more fluid concept of evidence\" now gets about 148 hits in Google, since I first helped him to publicise it. Two of the six \"learning objectives\" that Yale CME lists for this symposium are particularly revealing. - Describe therapeutic benefits and recent scientific evidence supporting a wide range of safe and practical complementary treatments, including acupuncture, massage, yoga, meditation, nutrition and exercise - Identify and discuss barriers to CAM use, practice and research, as well as propose ways of overcoming these barriers 'Describe the evidence supporting complementary treatments'? But don't on any account describe the much more substantial evidence that does not support them? A question (or \"learning objective\") put in this loaded way is the very antithesis of education. Equally the second 'learning objective' carries with it the assumption that CAM works, otherwise why would anyone want to overcome the barriers to it? This is indoctrination, not education. It betrays everything that a university should stand for. Let's hope the new head of CME, the admirable Dr Vender, succeeds in doing something about it Follow-up Success!. Well I think it is success. On 26 November 2008, the admirable Dr Vender wrote to me as follows. \"I do not know if another CAM/Integrative Medicine program is planned at Yale. However, based on the new ACCME standards, this program does not fulfil the standards for receiving CME accreditation (by my interpretation of the standards). At least one of last year's program directors has been notified already.\" |A report has appeared on Regulation of Practitioners of Acupuncture, Herbal Medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine. The report is written by people all of whom have vested interests in spreading quackery. It shows an execrable ability to assess evidence, and it advocates | Alice Miles put it well in [The Times, today](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/alice_miles/article4159652.ece). \"This week came the publication of the \"Report to Ministers from the Department of Health Steering Group on the Statutory Regulation of Practitioners of Acupuncture, Herbal Medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine and Other Traditional Medicine Systems Practised in the UK\".

So join in. Write to the Health Minister Ben Bradshaw at Richmond House, 79 Whitehall, SW1A 2NS. Write, on behalf of the NHS: \"What I want for my 60th birthday is... the chance to provide medical, dental, and nursing care to all. And absolutely nothing else.\" Judging by Ben Bradshaw's [speech to the Prince's Foundation](http://www.fih.org.uk/what_we_do/regulation/speech_by_ben.html), there may be a problem in conveying to him the evidence, but one can and must try. Why is it that a health joutnalist can do so much better than a university head? Yes, the chair of the steering group is Professor R. Michael Pittilo BSc Vice-Chancellor of The Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen. Despite all those impressive-lookin initials after his name, I believe that this is a very bad report. Here is something about Prof Pittilo from his [ university's web site](http://www.rgu.ac.uk/governance/management/page.cfm?pge=12928) (the emphasis is mine). Professor Michael Pittilo joined The Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen, as Principal and Vice-Chancellor on 5th September, 2005. After postdoctoral research on arterial disease at the University of London, he was appointed to Kingston University where he became Head of Life Sciences. In 1995 he became Foundation Dean of the Faculty of Health and Social Care Sciences at Kingston University and St George's Medical School (University of London). He was appointed Pro Vice Chancellor at the University of Hertfordshire in 2001. Professor Pittilo has held a number of additional roles, including chairing Department of Health working groups, and as a trustee for the Prince of Wales's Foundation for Integrated Health. \" Notice that Prof Pittilo is a Trustee of the Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health, source of some of the [ least reliable information](http://dcscience.net/?s=Prince%27s+Foundation) about alternative medicine to be found anywhere. This steering group is, as so often, a nest of vested interests. It does not seem to have on it any regular medical or clinical scientist whatsoever. Why not? They just might produce some embarrassing facts perhaps? Like most government committees its members seem to have been chosen to produce the desired outcome. For a start, the university run by Prof Pittilo, Robert Gordon's University, is itself involved in [a few antiscientific courses](http://www.rgu.ac.uk/search/act_search_new.cfm?restrict=ExternalOnly&ie=utf8&q=Complementary+therapies&site=RGUWEB&output=xml_no_dtd&client=RGUWEB&access=p&btnG=Search+RGU&lr=&ip=193.63.235.92&proxystylesheet=RGUWEB&oe=utf8&start=0). Since his report recommends that degrees in quackery should become mandatory, I expect he'd welcome the chance to run more. Amazingly, Robert Gordon's University runs an [Introduction to Homeopathy](http://www.rgu.ac.uk/prospectus/modules/disp_moduleView.cfm?Descriptor=NU3786), just about the daftest of all the common sorts of magic medicine. Most of the the members of the steering group represent vested interests, though strangely this is not made clear in the list of members. An earlier [report, in 2006](http://dcscience.net/acupunc-steering-group-2006.pdf), from the steering group was more open about this. Twelve of the members of the group represent Herbal Medicine, Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture (four from each). Most of the rest are lay members or bureaucrats. With membership like that it is, I suppose, not surprising that the assessment of evidence is, to put it kindly, grossly distorted and woefully inadequate. The report starts badly by failing to mention that the [ House of Lords report (2000)](http://dcscience.net/?p=199), and the government's response to it, set the following priorities. Both state clearly \"... we recommend that three important questions should be addressed in the following order . . - (1) does the treatment offer therapeutic benefits greater than placebo? - (2) is the treatment safe? - (3) how does it compare, in medical outcome and cost-effectiveness, with other forms of treatment? The word 'placebo' does not occur a single time in the main report (and only twice in the text of the seven appendices). But they do say (page 11): \"We recommend that public funding from the NHS should be used to fund CAM therapies where there is evidence of efficacy, safety and quality assurance.\" The evidence The problem is that the assessment of the evidence for efficacy in the report is pathetically poor. The report, sad to say, consists essentially of 161 pages of special pleading by the alternative medicine industry, served up with the usual large dose of [HR gobbledygook](http://dcscience.net/?p=226). There is really no excuse for this utterly incompetent assessment. There have been plenty of books this year alone that make excellent summaries of the evidence, mostly written for the lay public. They should, therefore, be understandable by any university vice-chancellor (president). The one benefit of the upsurge in public interest in magic medicine is that there are now quite a lot of good clinical trials, and when the trials are done properly, they mostly confirm what we thought before: in most cases the effects are no more than placebo. Here is one example. Annexe1 concerns \"Developing Research and Providing an Evidence Base for Acupuncture and Herbal/Traditional Medicine Treatment\". The wording of the title itself suggests, rightly, that this evidence base does not exist, in which case why on earth are we talking about them as \"professions\"? The discussion of the evidence in Annexe 1 is nothing if not partial. But what do you expect if you ask herbalists to assess herbal medicine? An honest assessment would put them out of business. The eternal mantra of the alternative industry appears as usual, \"Absence of evidence is, of course, not evidence of absence\". True of course, but utterly irrelevant. Annexe 1 says \"Acupuncture is a complex intervention and lack of a suitable placebo control has hindered efforts to evaluate efficacy\" This is simply untrue, In recent years enormous efforts have been put into devising controls for assessment of acupuncture, but they are entirely ignored here. One thing that has been [established quite clearly](http://dcscience.net/?p=166) is that it makes no difference where you put the needles, so all the talk of Qi and meridians is obvious mumbo-jumbo. Have the authors of Annexe 1, and Professor Pittilo, not read the relevant studies? Two books this year have dealt with the question of evidence with great care. They are both by people who have been involved personally with acupuncture research, Prof Edzard Ernst and Dr Barker Bausell. Edzard Ernst is the UK's first Professor of Complementary Medicine. Barker Bausell was research director of an NIH-funded Complementary and Alternative Medicine Specialized Research Center at the University of Maryland. Singh and Ernst discuss thoroughly the question of controls and assess all the evidence carefully. Their conclusions include the following. - The traditional principles of acupuncture are deeply flawed, as there is no evidence at all to demonstrate the existence of Ch'i [Qi] or meridians. - By focussing on the increasing number of high-quality research papers, reliable conclusions from systematic reviews make it clear that acupuncture does not work for a whole range of conditions, except as a placebo. - In short, the evidence is neither consistent nor convincing. It is borderline. Barker Bausell was himself involved in designing and analysing trialsof acupuncture. His conclusions are even less positive. \"There is no compelling, credible scientific evidence to suggest that any CAM therapy benefits any medical condition or reduces any medical symptom (pain or otherwise) better than a placebo\". These are serious authors with direct experience in CAM research, which is more than can be said of anyone on the steering group. Why are their conclusions ignored entirely? That is sheer incompetence. Degrees in anti-science One conclusion of the report is that \"The threshold entry route to the register will normally be through a Bachelor degree with Honours\" This is utter nonsense. It is quite obvious surely that you can't award honours degrees until after you have the evidence. You can read on page 55 of the report \"3a: Registrant acupuncturists must: understand the following aspects traditional East-Asian acupuncture: - yin/yang, /5 elements/phases, eight principles, cyclical rhythms, qi ,blood and body fluids, different levels of qi, pathogenic factors, 12 zang fu and 6 extraordinary fu, jing luo/ meridians, the major acupuncture points, East-Asian medicine disease categorisation, the three burners, the 4 stages/levels and 6 divisions - causes of disharmony/disease causation - the four traditional diagnostic methods: questioning, palpation, listening and observing\" This is utter baloney. Anyone who advocates giving honours degrees in such nonsense deserves to be fired for bringing his university into disrepute (and, in the process, bringing all universities and science itself into disrepute). That includes also degrees that teach that \" [amethysts emit high yin energy](http://dcscience.net/?p=227)\". So what should be done? If making peole do degrees in mumbo-jumbo is not the answer, what is? Clearly it would be far too draconian to try to ban quackery (and it would only increase its popularity anyway). The answer seems to me to be quite simple. All that needs to done is to enforce existing laws. It is already illegal to sell contaminated and poisonous goods to the public. It is already illegal to make fraudulent advertisemants and to sell goods that are not as described on the label. The only problem is that the agencies that enforce these rules are toothless and that there are a lot of loopholes and exceptions that work in favour of quackery. I have tried myself to complain about mislabelling of homeopathic pills to the Office of Fair Trading on the grounds that are labelled Arnica 30C but contain no Arnica. They solemnly bought a bottle and sent it to an analyst and of course they found no arnica, But nothing happened, because an exception to the usual law applies to homeopathic pills. The Advertising Standards Authority is good as far as it goes. They quickly told Boots Pharmacies to [withdraw advertisements that claimed CoQ10 \"increased vitality\"](http://dcscience.net/?p=232). But they can exact no penalties and they can't deal with lies that are told to you orally, or with anything at all on the web. The Health Professions Council (HPC) says that [one of the criteria for registering new professions](http://www.hpc-uk.org/aboutregistration/newprofessions/criteria/) is aspirant groups must \"Practise based on evidence of efficacy\". If that were actually applied, none of this process would occur anyway. No doubt the HPC will fail to apply its own criteria. On past form, it can be expected to adopt a \" [fluid concept of evidence](http://dcscience.net/?p=231)\"., One more thing, New European legislation was [described recently in the BMJ](http://dcscience.net/bmj-new-law-240508.pdf) \"Consumers in the United Kingdom are to receive stronger legal safeguards against products that claim, without any identifiable scientific evidence, to provide physical and mental health benefits such as tackling obesity or depression.\" \"The scope of the legislation is deliberately wide and is the biggest shake up in consumer law for decades. It targets any unfair selling to consumers by any business.\" Politicians seem to be immune to rational argument when it comes to quackery. But a few legal actions under these laws could bring the house of cards tumbling so fast that this gamma-minus report would become rapidly irrelevant. There will be no shortage of people to bring the actions. I can't wait. Follow up Dominic Lawson, 24 June 2008. An excellent column appeared today in the Independent. Dominic Lawson writes about the Pittilo report: \" [So now we will have degrees in quackery. What, really, is the difference between acupuncture and psychic surgery?](http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/dominic-lawson/dominic-lawson-so-now-we-will-have-degrees-in-quackery-852858.html)\". The reference to that well known conjuring trick, \"psychic surgery\" as a \"profession\", [revealed here](http://dcscience.net/?p=25), causes Lawson to say \"It makes it clear that the lunatics have taken over the asylum. For a start, how could Philip Hunt, previously director of the National Association of Health Authorities and Trusts, possibly have thought that \"psychic healing\" constituted a \"profession\" - let alone one which would \"develop its own system of voluntary self-regulation?\" \"One can see how this might fit in with the Government's \"never mind the quality, feel the width\" approach to university education. One can also see how established practitioners of such therapies might see this as a future source of income - how pleasant it might be to become Visiting Professor of Vibrational Medicine at the University of Westminster. Thus garlanded with the laurels of academic pseudo-science, the newly professionalised practitioners of \"alternative medicine\" can look down on such riff-raff as the \"psychic surgeons\" Once again I have to ask, how is it that we have to rely on journalists to prevent vice-chancellors eroding academic standards; indeed eroding simple common sense? I guess it is just another sign of the delusional thinking engendered by the culture of managerialism that grips universities. The extent to which irrationality has become established in US Medicine is truly alarming I wrote about [Quackademics in the USA and Canada](http://dcscience.net/?p=219) on my last trip to the USA, and on [my May trip](http://dcscience.net/?page_id=230) I visited Yale, where I decided to try a full frontal attack. [ [download the poster](http://dcscience.net/yale-endarkenment-poster-120508.pdf)] Several US blogs have written about this phenomenon. For example the incomparable Orac at the [The pseudoscience get admitted to medical school? ](http://doctorrw.blogspot.com/2005/11/how-did-pseudoscience-get-admitted-to.html) and [What is happening to our medical schools? Abraham Flexner is turning over in his grave. ](http://doctorrw.blogspot.com/2005/11/what-is-happening-to-our-medical.html) Excellent US stuff too at [Science-based Medicine](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/) (try [this](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=119) and [this](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=85)). There is also a good analysis of what's happening at Yale by Sandy Szwarc at [Junkfood Science](http://junkfoodscience.blogspot.com/2008/04/sold-out-our-doctors-in-training.html). Remember that the terms 'integrative' and 'complementary' are euphemisms coined by quacks to make their wares sound more respectable, There is no point integrating treatments that don't work with treatments that do work. ['Integrative Medicine' at Yale ](http://www.cam.yale.edu/)says, like all the others on [the roll of shame](http://dcscience.net/?p=219), says \"we aim to improve awareness and access to the best in evidence-based, comprehensive medical care available worldwide\". They all pay lip service to being \"evidence based\", but there is just one snag. It is untrue. In almost all cases, the evidence is either negative or absent. But this does not put them off for a moment. The whole process is simply dishonest. The evidence The evidence has been summarised in several books recently, The following books are particularly interesting because they are all 'views from the inside. Edzard Ernst is the UK's first Professor of Complementary Medicine. Barker Bausell was research director of an NIH funded Complementary and Alternative Medicine Specialized Research Center at the University of Maryland. The first two books go through the evidence fairly and carefully. They show no bias against alternative treatments (if anything, I'd say they are rather generous in cases of doubt). For a first class US account try Barker Bausell's Snake Oil Science |Bausell's book gives an excellent account of how to test treatments properly, and of all the ways you can be fooled into thinking something works when it doesn't. Bausell concludes | |For an excellent account of how to find the truth, try | It can now be said with some certainty that the number of alternative treatments that have been shown to work better than placebo is very small, and quite possibly zero, With that settled, what's going on at Yale (and many others on the roll of shame)? David L. Katz, MD, MPH, FACPM, FACP, is founder and director of the Integrative Medicine Center (IMC) at Griffin Hospital in Derby, Connecticut. He is also an associate professor, adjunct, of Public Health and director of the Prevention Research Center (PRC) at the Yale University School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut. That sounds pretty respectable. But he is into not just good nutrition, exercise, relaxation and massage, but also utterly barmy and disproved things like homeopathy and 'therapeutic touch'. |Watch the movie | It so happens that Yale recently held an \"Integrative Medicine Scientific Symposium\". Can we find the much vaunted evidence base there? That is easy to answer because three hours of this symposium have There's some interesting history and a great deal of bunkum and double-speak.

[Dean and Dr David Katz](http://dcscience.net/yale-int-med-symp-08.wmv) Pretty remarble uh? Dr Katz goes through several different trials, all of which come out negative. And what is his conclusion? You guessed. His conclusion is not that the treatments don't work but that we need a \"more fluid concept of evidence\" . It's equally bizarre to hear Richard Belitsky, Dean of Medical Education at Yale saying he is \"very proud\" of this betrayal of enlightenment values. If this is what Yale now considers to be education, it might be better to go somewhere else. This is not science. It isn't even common sense. It is a retreat to the dark ages of medicine when a physician felt free to guess the answer. In fact it's worse. In the old days there was no evidence to assess. Now there is a fair amount of evidence, but Dr Katz feels free to ignore it and guess anyway. He refers to teaching about evidence as 'indoctrination', a pretty graphic illustration of his deeply anti-scientific approach to knowledge. And he makes a joke about having diverted a $1m grant from CDC, for much needed systematic reviews, into something that fits his aims better. Katz asks, as one must, what should we do if there is no treatment that is known to help a patient. That is only too frequent a problem. The reasonable thing to say is \"there is no treatment that is known to help\". But Dr Katz thinks it's better to guess an answer. There is nothing wrong with placebo effects but there is everything wrong with trying to pretend that you are doing more than give placebos. Perhaps he should consider the [dilemmas of alternative medicine](http://dcscience.net/?page_id=10). You can read about more about Yale's activities [here](http://www.cam.yale.edu/) and [in interviews here](http://www.imc-griffin.org/images/IMCJ_viewpoints.pdf). Dr Katz says \"The founding approach\u2014and I think Andrew Weil, MD, gets the lion's share of credit for establishing the concept \u2014is training conventional practitioners in complementary disciplines\". Let's take a look at this hero. Try, for example, Arnold Relman's \" [A trip to Stonesville](http://www.quackwatch.org/11Ind/weil.html)\". \"According to Weil, many of his basic insights about the causes of disease and the nature of healing come from what he calls \"stoned thinking,\" that is, thoughts experienced while under the influence of psychedelic agents or during other states of \"altered consciousness\" induced by trances, ritual, magic, hypnosis, meditation, and the like.\" \"To the best of my knowledge, Weil himself has published nothing in the peer-reviewed medical literature to document objectively his personal experiences with allegedly cured patients or to verify his claims for the effectiveness of any of the unorthodox remedies he uses.\" Here is the advertisment for Andrew Weil's nutrition symposium. Not only does this yet again propagate the [great antioxidant myth](http://dcscience.net/?p=90), but a few moments with Google show that it is riddled with vested interests, as already pointed out on [Quackademics in USA and Canada](http://dcscience.net/?p=219). What has brought medical schools down to this level? That isn't hard to see, The main thing is simply money. Very few university administrators have the intellectual integrity to turn down money, whatever the level of dishonesty that is required by its acceptance. You can buy a lot of silence for $100m The US Taxpayer has given almost a billion dollars, via NIH.

It is the only entity in the NIH devoted to an ideological approach to health.\" NCCAM has given money from some very dubious trials too, Both [Orac on Respectful Insolence](http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/05/they_dont_call_it_cheatlation_for_nothin.php) and [Dr RW (R.W. Donnell)](http://doctorrw.blogspot.com/2008/05/medscape-article-blows-lid-off-of.html) recently about the NCCAM-funded trial of \"chelation therapy\", as first exposed in a devastating article by Kimball C. Atwood IV, MD; Elizabeth Woeckner, AB, MA; Robert S. Baratz, MD, DDS, PhD; Wallace I. Sampson, MD on [Medscape Today](http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/570625). This is a $30 million, 5-year, phase 3 Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy (TACT) for coronary artery disease. \"But how did such a crappy study ever come to be, much less be funded by the NIH to the tune of $30 million? The answer, not surprisingly, involves one of the foremost promoters of quackery in the federal government, Representative Dan Burton (R-IN).\" \"We conclude that the TACT is unethical, dangerous, pointless, and wasteful. It should be abandoned.\" Orac comments \"TACT is not the only example of an unethical and scientifically worthless trial being funded not because the science is compelling but because powerful lobbies and legislators who are true believers in woo applied pressure to the NIH to do them\" The Bravewell Collaboration is the other major source of money. [Forbes Business](http://www.forbes.com/business/2006/11/17/alternative-medicine-christy-mack-biz-cz_rl_1120bravewell.html) says \"Bravewell is not some flaky New Age group\".

Mack Foundation, Member, Board of Directors, The Bravewell Collaborative. The Flexner report. The story of Bravewell stands in chilling contrast to another case of philanthropy. Andrew Carnegie's foundation financed the report by Abraham Flexner, \"Medical Education in the United States and Canada\" (1910) [ [download, 15 Mb](http://dcscience.net/flexner_report-ocr.pdf)] . That report was responsible for dragging medical education out of the dark ages almost a century ago. It resulted in creation of some of the best medical schools anywhere (including Yale). \"By educational patriotism I mean this: a university has a mission greater than the formation of a large student body or the attainment of institutional completeness, namely, the duty of loyalty to the standards of common honesty, of intellectual sincerity, of scientific accuracy.\" \"The tendency to build a system out of a few partially apprehended facts, deductive inference filling in the rest, has not indeed been limited to medicine, but it has nowhere else had more calamitous consequences.\"Flexner (1910). Now another philanthropist is using big bucks to reverse the process and push medicine back into the 19th century. Flexner would have thought it quite inconceivable that in 2007 medical schools would be offering Continuing Medical Education in homeopathy. Why are Yale's academics so quiet about this? Perhaps they don't even know it's happening. If they say firmly that they don't want it, it will go, It's been done before Florida State University, allegedly under political pressure, proposed to set up a school of Chiropractic. That would have made it Florida State school of snake-oil salesmanship. What a sad fate.

An FSU professor, Albert Stiegman, predicted the future campus map.

Let's hope that Yale follows their example. Follow up The problem of Yale has been taken up with great eloquence by some US commentators Dr RW (R.W, Donnell): \" [Quackademic Medicine at where's the [AAMC]in all this? Aren't they supposed to be guardians of integrity and professionalism in medical education? Are they asleep at the switch or is money silencing them too?\" Orac (Respectful Insolence): \" [Integrative\" medicine at Yale: A more \"fluid\" concept of evidence?](http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2008/05/integrative_medicine_at_yale_a_more_flui.php)\" \"after the Dean of the Yale School Medicine embarrassed himself in the introduction by saying he's proud of how far this nonsense has come, Dr. Katz takes the stage and demonstrates the sort of hostile attitude towards science that, if allowed to take root will be the death of scientific medicine in any meaningful form at U.S. medical schools\" Junkfood Science.

When alternative medicine people do not like the evidence, they change the rules to get the outcome that they want, as seen so graphically in this post. They have always done this, but it is only recently that this sort of behaviour has been endorsed by places like Yale.

We therefore respectfully decline to compile and provide the information you have requested.\" So pretty clear signs of guiltiness there. Dr David Katz, yes, he of the \"fluid concept of evidence\", has posted an article, [Health Hazards of rhe Blogoshere.

Indeed, he is so unhappy that apparently a few weeks ago he tried t answer the bloggers who had raked him over the coals for blatantly advocating \"integrating\" unscientific woo like homeopathy with scientific medicine. Unfortunately for him, he did not do a particularly good job of it. Indeed, what most stood out as I read his rejoinder was that he does not answer a single substantive criticism leveled at his comments. Not one. Instead, he does what pretty much all woo-meisters do when criticized for shifting goalposts and appealing to other ways of knowing besides science as a means of \"proving\" that their preferred fairy dust works; he wraps himself in the mantle of the brave iconoclast willing to challenge accepted dogma and whines about the peons who criticized him, heaping contempt on the bloggers who had the temerity to criticize his advocacy for pseudoscience because to him they have not earned the right to criticize his (at least in his opinion, apparently) greatness in comparison to him.\" [Prince of Wales' unconstitutional meddling](http://dcscience.net/?s=Wales)in public affairs.

Alternative Medicine on Trial, they go carefully through all the evidence for all sorts of 'alternative' treatments. They find some evidence that a handful of them work. For most the answer is 'not enough evidence', and for a number there is good evidence that many of them don't work to any useful extent. \"Sir, For over two decades the Prince of Wales has been actively promoting alternative medicine and his Foundation for Integrated Health continues to encourage the use of treatments such as homoeopathy or reflexology.\"\"In light of this \"rigorous scientific evidence\", we strongly advise that the Prince of Wales and the Foundation for Integrated Health withdraw the publications Complementary Health Care: A Guide for Patients and the Smallwood report. They both contain numerous misleading and inaccurate claims concerning the supposed benefits of alternative medicine.

Natasha Finlayson, of the Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health, is quoted as saying \"The foundation does not promote complementary therapies.\". That takes some beating for sheer bare-faced dishonesty. Edzard Ernst appeared on the Today Program on 18th April. He was interveiwed by the formidable John Humphrys, along with Kim Lavely, Chief Executive, The Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health (FIH). Ernst points out that the FIH guide suggests that chiropractic is effective in asthma, and that acupuncture is good for addiction, whereas the evidence says the opposite. Lavely retorts, rather lamely (OK I'm biassed). Lavely: \" . . . we attempt to evidence on every therapy\". \"We think they [the public] have the right to know and what doesn't\" Humphrys: \"Well isn't that the whole point? the professor is saying here is that these things do not work, at least in terms of the claims that are made for them, such as homeopathy and chiropractic . . . \" Lavely: \"There are no claims made in this guide for what works and what doesn't. What we have said is that some therapies are used for some things but we aren't saying they are effective for those things . . . \" So, one might ask, what on earth is the use of a guide is it that offers no indication of effectiveness? Lavely's second quotation contradicts directly her first. A pretty pathetic performance. [Listen to the interview [mp3 file]](ernst-today-prog-180408.m3u) The Sunday Times, on April 20th, pblished a pretty good [review of Trick of Treatment?](http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/non-fiction/article3764173.ece). \"Their case against the folly, vanity and damage of HRH et al. is hard to argue with.\" Of course, [the letters column](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/letters/article3774639.ece) drew the expected response from the quacks, most verging on the hilarious. Another blow for the alternative industry came in the same week, The authoratitve [Cochrane review](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/homepages/106568753/CD007176.pdf) confirmed [earlier reports ](http://dcscience.net/?p=90)that vitamin supplements not only do not help you but some actually increase mortality. The [antioxidant myth](http://dcscience.net/?p=90) nevertheless rumbles on, and on, and on. There is too much money in it for it to die easily. Predictably enough, the conclusions were denied by the Health Food Manufacturers' Association (HFMA). They wheeled out several pop singers to say how wonderful their products are. Read about that pathetic defence on [Holfordwatch.](http://holfordwatch.info/2008/04/18/sir-cliff-richard-offers-conclusive-refutation/) Who is behind HFMA? Incidentally, HFMA are strangely reticent about the identity of their 120 members. They will not reveal who they are. Does anybody out there know the answer? I'll buy a good dinner for anyone who can root this out. If it is anything like the ' [Health Supplements Information Service](http://dcscience.net/?p=90)' it is likely to be backedby the very big pharmaceutical companies that the alternative industry loves to hate. Take the test Prince of Wales Guide \"Reflexologists work with a wide range of conditions including certain types of pain, particularly back and neck pain, migraine and headaches, chronic fatigue, sinusitis, arthritis, insomnia, digestive problems such as irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation, stress-related disorders and menopausal symptoms.\" Singh & Ernst \"The notion that reflexology can be used to diagnose health problems has been disproved and there is no convincing evidence that it is effective for any condition.\" In a wonderful demonstration of common sense, the BBC has removed all the alternative medicine pages from [BBC Health web site](http://www.bbc.co.uk/health/). I expect that it was helped in making that decision by the many complaints it had received about statements on these pages that were simply not true, The existence of these pages was just not compatible with the BBC's commitment to accuracy. |Needless to say, this decision was greeted with howls of rage from the alternative world. Some wrote to the BBC to complain (and I wrote to congratulate them). Until today I haven't been able to find any BBC statement on the matter. This one appeared on Healthypages, one of the zaniest sites on the net. Nothing is too barmy for them. This is the picture they used to show how wrong the BBC is|| | Picture from Healthypages \"I do a range of spiritual healing practices and can offer an energetic healing session including techniques from the Order of Melchizedek and about 10 forms of Reiki in exchange for a Theta Healing session.\" And just in case you don't know about the Melchidezek method, here is a picture of a poster in the window of my local \"health food\" shop. The explanation says \"Using ancient holographic technology, the basis of the techniques presented is the activation of the Merkaba, a rotating lightfield awakening your spherical consciousness. This raises one's quotient of light vibration within the human atomic cell structure. Once activated. the merkaba assists us in accessing our naturally ascended consciousness state: the healing capabilities are enhanced a hundred-fold. The Hologram of Love has the ability to heal and rejuvenate any form of creation as it is the living conscious holographic pattern of God Source vibration.\" There, and I'll bet you thought [holography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holography) was a recent invention. As an example of sciencey-sounding words used in random order, this one takes a bit of beating. It really is an insult to human intellect. Anyway, back to the BBC. This is their diplomatic response (what they should have said really was, 'those pages were nonsense so we removed them'). BBC issued the following statement, dated 22 Feb 2008: |Complaint | We received complaints about the Complementary section of the BBC Health website being disbanded The BBC's response The decision to remove the complementary medicine area of the health website was taken as part of a wider review of all the health content in order to enable the BBC to focus its efforts on creating new and exciting content. In order to release resources for this redevelopment work, we're reviewing existing content from an editorial and value-for-money perspective.The complementary health section was incomplete and, therefore, not of a satisfactory editorial standard. It also represented a small proportion of traffic to the site but was disproportionately time-consuming.Therefore, the decision to take it down was based on a combination of factors: how much work it needed to maintain to a high editorial standard, how much this cost and how popular it was with site users.We have already removed other sections of the health site and plan to reduce or remove others. We appreciate people are disappointed this area of the site has been removed and apologise if the decision has appeared abrupt to site users or inconvenienced other sites linking to BBC Health. The BBC will continue to cover complementary health in other areas of its output, such as TV, radio and news programmes, and may reassess its complementary health content in future. \" . . . However the site has in recent by the self-appointed 'quackbusters' ( . . . such as David Colquhoun), who sent a deluge of letters and emails claiming that complementary therapies such as homeopathy and cranial osteopathy were 'unscientific' and should be removed.\" Well thanks for the credit, but sorry, there was no deluge. I wrote no more than a couple of times myself, and I suspect that a handful of friends did the same. I didn't even ask them to remove the whole lot, merely to correct particular statements that were not true, 'Mardi' goes on \"Rather than taking a reasoned view and considering the evidence from good research studies on complementary medicine, these individuals seem simply hell bent on trying to stamp out complementary medicine\" That really is a bit rich. Suddenly the alternative industry are invoking evidence from good research studies. It is precisely the other way round. It is because that evidence is almost all negative that the BBC have decided to remove their coverage. Of course it may have helped that the BBC had to spend a lot of time defending itself against criticism of the BBC 2 TV series on Alternative Medicine from February 2006. After initially rejecting complaints, an appeal to the highest level, the Board of Trustees, [ two of the most serious complaints were upheld](http://dcscience.net/?p=14) against these programmes. Boots the Chemists have [proved themselves dishonest](http://dcscience.net/?s=Boots) before, over their promotion of homeopathy and of B Vitamins \"for vitality\" In a [press release](http://www.responsesource.com/releases/rel_display.php?relid=37515&hilite=) dated 12 March 2008, they have hit a new low in ethical standards |Boots help boost the nation's energy levels in just one week | \"Health and beauty expert Boots has launched an exclusive energising vitamin supplement that helps boost depleted energy levels and maintain vitality.

Boots Energy Super Strength CoQ10 containing natural Kaneka CoQ10 is a way of boosting energy levels that can help people who lack energy to see results in a week\" You decide. Last year there was an [equally misleading press release](http://www.pr.com/press-release/20107)about CoQ10 from Solgar/Boots Herbal. That one was headed \"Need More Energy - Solgar's Nutri Nano Uses Nanotechnology to Deliver Unprecedented Bioavailability of CoQ10\". Not only is the word 'energy' misused but notice that the trendy term 'nanotechnology' is worked in for extra sciencey effect. It turns out that all this means is that the preparation contains [micelles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micelle). So nothing new there either. Micelles have been known for almost 100 years. In contrast, the [Boots online store](http://www.boots.com/onlineexperience/flexible_template_2006.jsp?classificationid=1046312)is noticeably more restrained. Could that be because the Advertising Standards People can't touch press releases, just as they can't control what [Boots Expert Team](http://dcscience.net/?p=203)tell you face to face in the shop?

Perhaps you should write to her and let her know what you think. You might point out to her [Boots (anti) Social Corporate (ir)Responsibility Page](http://www.boots-csr.com/main.asp?pid=620). It says |\"So it's part of our heritage to treat our customers fairly and act with integrity in everything we do, rather than seizing on the quickest and easiest way to turn a profit.\"| CoQ10 and \"energy\" [Coenzyme Q10](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coenzyme_Q) (also known as ubiquinone) is a relatively small molecule. It cooperates with cytochrome enzymes (big proteins) to synthesize a molecule called [ATP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate). This is a chemical form of energy that can be used to do work, such as making a muscle fibre contract. The word \"energy \" here is used in the sense that a physicist would use it. It is measured in joules or in calories. The [meaning of the word 'energy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy)' is described nicely in the Wikipedia entry. For example, when an electric current passes through a resistor (like a kettle) the electrical energy is converted to heat energy, and the energy used is potential difference (volts) X current (amps) X time. In other words energy is power (in watts) times time. So another unit for energy is kilowatt-hours (one kilowatt-hour is about 3.6 megajoules). Energy in this sense has nothing whatsoever to do with the everyday use of 'energy' to indicate your vitality, or how lively you feel. Furthermore there is not the slightest empirical reason to think that CoQ10 makes you feel more lively. None. The press release cites a sciencey-sounding reference (Ernster L, Dallner G. Biochemical, function. Biochim Biophys Acta. 1995 May 24;1271(1):195-204.). But this paper is just a review of the biochemistry, nothing whatsoever to do with feeling good. CoQ10 and the supplement business There is nothing new in this big push by Boots. CoQ10 has been a staple of supplement business for a long time now. All sorts of medical claims have been made for it. Everything from migraine, to Parkinson's disease to cancer has been raised as possible benefits of the magic drug, oops, I mean 'supplement'. This is quite improper of course, since it is being sold as a food not as a medicine, but it is standard practice among supplement hucksters, and so far they have been allowed to get away with it. What's interesting though is that until Boots PR machine swung into action, one thing that hadn't been claimed much is that it made you feel more lively. That's one they just invented. CoQ10 and the press It's standard technique to get free advertising by hoping that journalists will dash off an article on the basis of a press release, with the hope that they will be in too much hurry to check the spin. Too often it works. The Daily Mail has big coverage of the press release, under the title \" [Can a 60p pill from the chemist really add years to your life?](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/health/thehealthnews.html?in_article_id=530236&in_page_id=1797)\". This was written by Anna Hodgekiss and it's not bad. It starts with a nice note of scepticism \"Forget vitamins C, E or even B12. The real wonder supplement is Coenzyme Q10 or CoQ10. That's what Boots would have you believe, anyway. \" \"So should we all be taking this supplement? Not according to David Colquhoun, professor of pharmacology at University College London, who says Boots' claims are \"deliberately misleading customers\". \"Yes, CoQ10 helps the body convert glucose into energy, but it's not the psychological get-up-and-go energy you feel day to day. \"The type of energy it does produce powers our muscles and cells - physical energy. They have confused the two here to promote a product that I'm not convinced would make any difference to how you actually feel at all.\" The article goes on Among the other sceptics is Scott Marsden, a senior dietician at The London Clinic. \"There haven't been enough trials to warrant us all taking CoQ10,\" he says. \"It sounds boring, but if you are healthy and eating a balanced diet, you will get all the nutrients you need and shouldn't have to take supplements. \"Not only could you be spending money unnecessarily, you could also be putting your health at risk. Buy some wholesome food instead.\" \" Dr Clare Gerada, vice chairman of the Royal College of General Practitioners, is more forthright. \"While there is some evidence to suggest CoQ10 supplements may help patients with heart failure or severe respiratory disorders, more work is needed,\" she says. \"This is just another example of normal health being medicalised, and it's an issue that worries me. \"The human body is an amazing machine, and we have never been in better health. The fact that more people are living well into their 80s and 90s is proof. \"People need to stop looking for a wonder pill in their quest to live for ever.\" But guess who comes out fighting for Boots? None other than my old friend [Dr Ann Walker](http://dcscience.net/?s=Ann+Walker). Little wonder then that my [ Nutriprofile](http://dcscience.net/?p=221) result recommended a co Q10 supplement, because she is involved in that too. Ann Walker's colleague on the [Nutriprofile](http://dcscience.net/?p=221) project, Dr [Sarah Brewer comments on CoQ10](http://www.healthspan.co.uk/articles/what_is_coq10__a3861618.aspx) on the Healthspan site, thus. \"As CoQ10 is vital for energy production in muscle cells, lack of CoQ10 is linked with lack of energy, physical fatigues, muscle aches and pains . . .\" It seems that she also can't distinguish between energy in joules and energy as vitality, Female First and [Marie Claire](http://www.marieclaire.co.uk/news/health/197481/wonder-pill-adds-years.html) also carry a story \" [Boots Sell 'Life Extending' Pill](http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/lifestyle-fashion/stylebeauty/coenzyme-4655.html)\" \"A new pill that claims to add years to our lives is due to hit shelves in Boots stores this week but scientists say the drug is misleading.\" \"Despite these claims Professor David Colquhoun told Marie Clare that he believes the drug is 'deliberately misleading customers': \"Yes, CoQ10 helps the body convert glucose into energy, but it's not the psychological get-up-and-go energy you feel day to day,\" he said.\" (Funny, I never consciously spoke to Marie Claire but the quotation is OK.) The Times, in contrast, carries an appalling column by their Dr Thomas Stuttaford, \" [A natural solution to tiredness](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article3540069.ece)\". There isn't even a question mark in the title, and the content is totally uncritical. Private Eye has nicknamed the author 'Dr Thomas Utterfraud'. How very cruel. See also, excellent articles on CoQ10 by Ben Goldacre in the [Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/mar/15/3), and at [badscience.net](http://www.badscience.net/?p=630), and at [Holfordwatch](http://holfordwatch.info/2008/03/15/the-energy-equation-and-co-enzyme-q10-holford-the-pioneer/) and [Dr Aust's Spleen](http://draust.wordpress.com/2008/03/19/an-imperfect-q-ten/) Aha Boots have repeated their mendacious claims in newspaper advertisements This appeared in the Guardian on 18 March, and I'm told it was in the Mail too. The small print says \"The new Boots Energy supplement contains Kaneka Q10 to help boost your energy levels throughout the day\" Here is what I just sent to the [Advertising Standard Authority](http://www.asa.org.uk/asa/how_to_complain/), or email [new.complaints@asa.org.uk ](mailto:new.complaints@asa.org.uk). Why not have a go yourself? |\"The words \"boost your energy levels\" and \"still lacking energy\" constitute a (presumably deliberate) confusion beteen 'energy' measured in joules and the everyday use of the word 'energy' to mean vitality. The former usage would be justified in viewof the role of Coenzyme Q10 in ATP production. There is neither theoretical justification nor any empirical evidence that CoQ10 helps your vitality or 'energy' in the latter sense.\"| A full size graphic to attach to your complaint "}
