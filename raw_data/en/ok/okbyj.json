Ayurveda is a holistic medical system rooted in India. We specialize in a full range of holistic health and wellness treatments to bring a balanced approach to diet and lifestyle guidance. What is Ayurveda? Ayurveda is a holistic medical system rooted in India. Ayurvedic treatments are designed to maintain wellness and help you keep your body healthy and fit to avoid illness. The term Ayurveda translates to \"knowledge of life,\" and Ayurvedic treatments are rooted in the principles of ancient wisdom that teach us that our health and bodily functions are interwoven. Through Ayurvedic science, we use this knowledge to harmonize the internal world of your body with the external world around us. Ayurveda teaches health science on the understanding of the five elements of ether, air, fire, water and earth. These elements combine to make up the doshas, also known as constitutions, of vata, pitta, and kapha. Each dosha is comprised of qualities that are expressed in the physical, emotional, and mental aspects of health and wellness. Each of us have aspects of each dosha within us; but one or two doshas tend to dominate in each individual, affecting everything from digestion to emotions. Knowing your dosha is the first steps in evaluating effective treatments that form the basis for an effective Ayurvedic program. Leveraging the basic principles of Ayurveda, we create customized preventative wellness treatments that are unique to the constitution of each individual. Ayurveda offers one of the most comprehensive cleansing protocols known as panchakarma. This ancient practice uses five primary therapies to release and eliminate accumulated toxins from deep within your body's tissues. Through this cleansing process, we help return your doshas to their proper balance within your body.
