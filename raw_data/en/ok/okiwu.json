There's lots of great information in this post, but here's this most important thing to know: using crystals with essential oils feels overwhelming, but only at first. The more you practice, the more comfortable you will feel using them! (Psst-I'm Haylee, creator of Whimsy + Wellness and mom of 3. You can learn more about my story [here](https://whimsyandwellness.com/pages/about-us)!) Here's what I'll cover today: - Do crystals work? - How do crystals work? - What are crystals used for? - How do you activate crystals? - How long do crystals take to work? - Why use crystals with essential oils? - How to use crystals with oils (two steps)? - Crystals and their uses Do Crystals Work? Yes, but not in the way you might think! Using crystals isn't like popping an Advil to relieve a headache. Instead, it's about tapping into the innate wisdom deep inside of you. Using crystals is about helping our minds choose positivity and abundance instead of negativity and scarcity. How Do Crystals Work? Many people believe in the healing energies of crystals. Humans are made up of energies that are constantly changing based on our moods, behaviors, and even our surroundings. Crystals also give off energy-but because of their crystalline structure, their energy is constant, not changing like ours. Because of this, they can help us rebalance our own energies. What Are Crystals Used For? There are SO many benefits of crystals. Here are just a few: [Sleep](https://blog.whimsyandwellness.com/my-21-favorite-deep-sleep-diffuser-blends/) [Anxiety](https://blog.whimsyandwellness.com/my-top-3-favorite-ylang-ylang-essential-oil-benefits-9-amazing-diffuser-blends/)and depression - Emotional ups and downs - Stress - Motivation and productivity - Abundance - Balance and calm - Emotional healing or protection from toxicity or trauma - Increased resilience - Creativity - Communication and empathy ...and so much more! How Do You Activate Crystals? You should buy your crystals only from reputable sources-you don't want crystals arriving with negative energy. But even then, sometimes your crystals needs a little energy recharge. Here's how to activate your crystal: - Leave it outside under a full moon, or outside in full sun for a few hours - Place it on or near selenite, a cleansing crystal - Bury it in the earth overnight [Burn sage](https://blog.whimsyandwellness.com/how-to-use-sage-to-energetically-clear-your-house/)(called [smoke cleansing or energy cleansing](https://blog.whimsyandwellness.com/how-to-use-sage-to-energetically-clear-your-house/)) nearby How Long Do Crystals Take to Work? If you're open to using crystals, you might experience some of their benefits right away-or at least feel their energy quickly. But to really benefit from crystals, you should pair them with intentions and use them daily. After a few weeks of intentional, sustained use, you'll start to see your life shift! Why Use Crystals With Essential Oils? I love learning how to use crystals with oils for a few reasons. First, I love essential oils, and using crystals with oils makes me want to use my oils even more! Second, I love finding ways to use crystals and keep them around daily, even if I'm too busy to meditate or journal. I'm a mom and a business owner and I need quick, easy, beautiful, and helpful! Third, using crystals and essential oils are synergistic-both are completely natural and part of the earth's ancient healing gifts. Each one is effective on its own; together, they're incredibly powerful! Finally, using crystals and oils together makes me smile-we act like wellness needs to be a \"thing,\" but honestly if it makes you smile, you're winning! How Do You Use Crystals With Oils? (3 Easy Steps!) Step 1: Choose Your Crystal Many people believe that just by looking at crystals, or picking them up and holding them, you will be able to tell which ones your body needs because you will be drawn to it. In other words-your body knows what you need! Once you choose one using this method, you can research its benefits by doing a quick google search (crystal name + \"healing properties\"). Then, identify why you were drawn to it by choosing the benefit that best fits your current need. (PS we've made this really easy for you-bookmark this page and use the guide below to research the crystals you're interested in!) Step 2: Choose an Oil Once you've chosen your crystal and identified why you need it, then you can choose an oil to pair with it. Understanding your desired end result after working with the crystal and oils will give you the best results. Having a reference guide for your essential oils is also helpful at this stage since it will allow you to look up your specific concern and then recommend oils to use! For example, if you chose amethyst as your crystal and after researching, feel you need it for confidence, then look to your oils reference guide and choose an oil(s) you would use for confidence. Step 3: Use Your Crystal and Oil Together You can diffuse your oils while you hold a crystal and meditate with it, but I find that the easiest way to use crystals and oils together is to use a clear glass essential oil roller bottle with [crystals inside](https://whimsyandwellness.com/collections/crystals-for-oils/products/the-crystal-collection), or a roller bottle with a [gemstone roller top](https://whimsyandwellness.com/collections/crystals-for-oils/products/gemstone-roller-top)-or [both](https://whimsyandwellness.com/collections/gemstone-rollers)! I've even created [gemstone roller bottles by feeling and need](https://whimsyandwellness.com/collections/crystals-for-oils/products/crystal-rollers-by-feelings?variant=16894813831257).
