This Kansa Wand's compact size is perfect for massaging the face, marma points of the body & also for while you are on the go. Pair with your PAAVANI Serum. If irritation occurs, discontinue use. Directions: To learn how to use the Kansa Wand please refer to our videos on the product page. FACE Prepare: Apply PAAVANI Serum to the face & neck. You can also apply a few extra drops to the top of the wand. Heal: Move in circular motions, focusing on the areas that hold the most tension or expression lines. As you roll the wrist, apply a slight pressure to the skin. Use friction along the jaw line & aside from that, use small circular motions. Holistic healing experiences are approximately 15-20 minutes, starting at the forehead on the face & working counter-clockwise in circular motion, returning to the forehead once again. Caring for your product: When you first receive the tool, use a non-abrasive & chemical-free soap. Rinse the tool in cool water (never hot). We suggest utilizing white (sterilized, organic) Kaolin clay or tea tree oil to clean the wand, however, practitioners may choose to use a bacteria-fighting agent as per state requirements (UV Cabinet). The greying effect: When bronze transmits electromagnetism, it reacts positively when acidity is present. Therefore, the primary reason for greying is the drawing out of acidity from your skin, which is a positive thing! It means that you are effectively eliminating excess acid & toxins while reducing inflammation. Just wipe off the grey oil with a steamed towel & a mild cleanser. Greying will not happen every time, as it depends on how the environment has effected your skin. So, don't worry if you don't see greying every time. The Kansa wand also pulls toxins, acidity & inflammation out of the body, working on the body's subtle electrical fields that run in the collagen & fascia layers. Note: No medical claims are entailed. Please consult your Ayurvedic or Naturopathic physician with serious medical concerns. Practitioners understand that they use the wand to apply product, unless a massage therapist, then they may use the tool to manipulate the tissues more deeply. In Ayurvedic Medicine, the Kansa Wand is cherished because it is said to balance the three doshas, the vata (air + ether), pitta (fire + a little water) & kapha (water + earth). Doshas are energies in the body & their alignment is key in influencing overall health. This holistic practice of harmonizing the mind & body is something that has been tried, proven & true for thousands of years in Ayurveda to boost energy & healing. The goal is to increase the prana (life force) the healing energy of vata, bring about our tejas (our inner radiance) the healing energy of pitta & restore ojas (the ultimate energy reserve of the body) derived from kapha. As you use your Kansa Wand, not only are you paying homage to an ancient ritual, you are also drawing out acidity from the tissues & improving the body's natural electrical energy system.
