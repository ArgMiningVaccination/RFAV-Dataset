Through this initiative, called th e Comprehensive Indian Resources for Community and Law Enforcement (CIRCLE) Project, the federal partners provided the tribes with incentives and opport unities (streamlined and coordinated federal funding for justice functions was the primary one) th at helped them consider how the individual components of their tribal justi ce systems (courts, police, correc tions, and other programs) might work together to strengthen their approach es to pressing crime and social problems. This collection of documents comprises the first (process) phase of the CIRCLE Project evaluation. The combined process a nd participatory qualities of th is evaluation phase generate a complicated set of products. It includes a cross- site analysis, which focu ses on the opportunities, accomplishments, and continuing challenges for both the tribes and the federal government; a description of the federal planning and implemen tation process; and pro cess-oriented summaries of each participating tribe's implementation work. An important goal of the evaluation is to unde rstand whether the design of CIRCLE was useful to tribes in their efforts to strengthen their ju stice systems; in particul ar, what design features seemed most helpful and why? In answer to this question, this phase of the evaluation shed light on the following: The promise of federal cross-agency (and, potentially, cross-department) cooperation and coordination as a means of maximizing the value of federal investments in building strong and resourceful tribal communities The strategic importance of addressi ng crime problems through system-level (rather than program-level) thinking The powerful, intertwined influence of nation building, culture, and context on change efforts in Indian Country The role sustainability goals should pl ay in the design of such initiatives The dynamics surrounding these factors over the cour se of the initiative were complicated and presented difficult challenges for the participati ng federal agencies and for the participating tribes. Even so, we conclude that CIRCLE made an important contribution to the tribes' efforts to design and build stronger just ice systems. This report discusse s the contribution in detail and, based on the bulleted points above , presents opportunities for in creasing the value of future federal investments in building strong and resourceful tribal communities.

Through this initiative, called the Comp rehensive Indian Resources for Community and Law Enforcement (CIRCLE) Pr oject, USDOJ provided incentives and oppor- tunities (in particular , streamlined and coordinated federa l funding for justice functions) that helped the tribes consider how their justice systems' individual components might better work together to address pressing crime and social problems. With this assistance, the tribes' challenge shifted away from how they might fund specific ju stice programs to how they might leverage an array of justice (and related program) resources to address tribe-specific, crime-related goals. Evaluation of the CIRCLE Project occurred two phases - a firs t, 18-month \"process\" phase, reported on here, and a second, 30-month \"outcomes\" phase, which will generate a separate report. This was a participatory evaluation. It enga ged the tribal and federal partners in a number of core design and data collectio n tasks, including identifying th e focus, goals, and end products of the evaluation, and the outcomes and indicators regarding program and system performance. An important goal of the evaluation was to unders tand whether the design of CIRCLE was useful to tribes in their justice system-strengthening e fforts; it asked, what desi gn features seemed most helpful and why? In answer, the first phase of the evaluation shed light on the following: The promise of federal cross-agency (and, potentially, cross-department) cooperation and coordination as a means of maximizing the value of federal investments in building strong and resourceful tribal communities The strategic importance of addressi ng crime problems through system-level (rather than program-level) thinking The powerful, intertwined influence of nation building, culture, and context on change efforts in Indian Country The role sustainability goals should pl ay in the design of such initiatives The dynamics surrounding these factors over the c ourse of the Project were complicated and presented difficult challenges for the participati ng federal agencies and for the participating tribes. Even so, CIRCLE made an important contri bution to the tribes' effo rts to design and build stronger justice systems, and thus, we present our discussion of the bulleted points above as opportunities for increasing the value of future federal investments in building strong and resourceful tribal communities.

In the face of these barriers, the federal partners forged a strong inter-agency working group that succeeded in creating a significant set of opportunities for the tribes. Our site-based interviews and obser vations point particularly to two working group products that provided valuab le support to the tribal partners' efforts: The federal partners' work toward st reamlining and coordinating funding, and Improved communication and cooperation am ong the federal partners themselves and between the federal partners and tribes These products provided the pa rticipating tribes with a mix of \"system change\" tools and opportunities (for example, preferential access to selected pr ogram resources) in exchange for local efforts to strengthen justice systems a nd local commitments to performance accountability. Viewed thusly, the context for CIRCLE includes not only comprehensive tribal justice initiatives but also similar comprehensive initiatives by th e federal and state gove rnments in the health, social service, and justice arenas. This broader array of reform initiatives is producing evidence that comprehensive system change can help communities make progress toward important social goals (improved safety, improved health outcomes, etc.), and it is generating a valuable set of lessons learned about how to accomplish such change. Based on these findings and our analysis of CIRCLE, we recommend that USDOJ build on the approach it took to the Project in future initiatives. Formalizing the CIRCLE working group (a nd, over time, vesting it with increased authority and resources) could be an effective means of sustaining the oppor tunities and incentive s the Project provided. Further, we note that there are existing federa l models for improving and institutionalizing the type of funding CIRCLE offered tribes. The most flexible model is block grants; the federal Local Law Enforcement Block Grant and Juven ile Accountability Incentive Block Grant are examples of two such USDOJ programs. They pr ovide substantial funds to cities and counties with limited restrictions on their use. Prog ressive communities have used the grants as \"innovation funds\" and invested th e money in improvements to ove rall system performance. Opportunity 2: Use the Concept of Nation Bu ilding to Guide the Initiative's Goals, Plans, and Implementation \"Nation building\" refers to the process, unde rtaken by indigenous nations themselves, of constructing effective institut ions of self-government that can provide a foundation for sustainable development, community health, and successful political action. In other words, it is the process of promoting Indian nations' self-d etermination, self-govern ance, and sovereignty - This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. viiiand, ultimately, of improving tribal citizens' social and economic s ituations - through the creation of more capable, culturally legitimate institutions of governance. Our observations suggest there are two reasons why the nation-build ing process is important to CIRCLE. The first might be called a \"frame of reference\" problem, the second a missed opportunity. Using Nation Building as a Frame of Referen ce Will Improve Communication and Project Design As a frame of reference, the leaders, government al personnel, and citizens of tribes generally think of their tribes as nations and, hence, make decisions and undertake in itiatives based on this understanding. Committed tribal nation builders add an additional layer to this viewpoint. They realize that their nations part icipate in federally funded proj ects like CIRCLE by choice; the federal government cannot tell them to take the money, they can opt not to, and they can take action to accept federal s upport on their own terms. Initial documents describing CIRCLE reflect US DOJ's appreciation of tribes' nationhood. It is less clear that the USDOJ grant managers and t echnical assistance provi ders participating in CIRCLE consistently embraced this orientation. Unfortunately, any time federal CIRCLE part- ners failed to recognize tribal partners' \"nationa l\" orientation, a functional mismatch arose, with tribal partners thinking and acting as national representatives and federal partners treating them in a more conventional manner (as typical \"gra ntees,\" \"programs,\" or \"local governments\") - with generally detrimental results. This \"frame of reference problem\" generated disjunctions between the options tribal partners believed th ey ought to have and the options the federal partners believed were available. The result s were stymied negotiations, frustration on both sides, forced \"compromise,\" and lower productivity. Critically, the point is not that tribes' requests must always be honored. Rather, the federal government and tribes must work harder to share the \"tribes as nations\" frame of reference. If tribes' nationhood is a consistent focus, federal and tribal repres entatives may find more fruitful ways to negotiate and compromise , and tribes may gain increased control of their futures by exercising greater choice over the types of f unding they accept and programs they develop. As noted, an important consideration for tribes is that the nation building perspective obligates them to think strategically about the role grant opportunities play in nation building. For tribes that recognize the importance of nation building, the question is difficult: does this initiative offer the opportunity to make a sound investment in more capable tribal institutions, or does it commit us to yet another three-year cycle of s hort-term jobs and unrealistic expectations for improvements in social conditions ? When tribal leaders and gran t seekers have answered this question honestly, their prioriti es may necessarily shift; for ex ample, a tribe may request the opportunity to think more fundamentally about st rategies that move th e tribe forward along the path of nation-building, and mi ght request not \"program support, \" but a very different set of resources (such as technical assi stance and support for thorough planning and assessment). There is, of course, tremendous pressure on tribes wi th limited funds to pursue new grant opportunities regardless of their long-term valu e. We propose, however, that there may be substantial untapped value in communicating to funders that piece-meal, categoric al, and culturally inappropriate grant initiatives are of little use - and that one powerful way of communi cating this would be for tribes to refuse participat ion in such initiatives.

Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. ixIdentifying Nation Building as a Shared Goal Will Improve Focus and Productivity Well-understood, deeply shared goals are valuable because they serve as organizing principles and ultimate objectives. Our sense is that the tribes and USDOJ agencies participating in CIRCLE lacked such a goal. Further, we believ e that identifying \"nation building\" as CIRCLE's overarching goal would have served the purpose - a nd that not identifying it as the explicit goal for CIRCLE was a missed opportunity, which ultimate ly prevented funds from being used in the most productive manner possible. In the future, USDOJ ought to a dopt nation buildi ng as its overarching goal for projects in Indian Country. The goal would better co ordinate federal partners' ac tions by requiring them to pass their plans and activitie s through this filter: do the plans and activities of our organization support tribes in the process of constructing effe ctive institutions of self governance that can provide a foundation for sustainable developmen t, community health, and successful political action? The filter for Indian nations is similar: does the strategy we propose for strengthening our justice system fit with our long-term effo rts to become a stronger, more resourceful community? Opportunity 3: Take Context and Culture Seriously - Generate More Tailored Tribal Strategies The CIRCLE tribes display great variation in te rms of culture, political systems and stability, demographics, criminal justice system organizati on, available social services, proximity to urban areas, etc. Understanding of these factors is essen tial, as they create the local context for change. Done well, assessment honestly portrays this c ontext, revealing the ch allenges and resources present within the community. By clarifying and highlighting local constr aints and opportunities, good assessment results in good strategy, or in practical expectations of how and how much change will be achieved. Indeed, research and experience with similar community initiatives recommend a structured and inte nsive period of assessment a nd planning. Yet this connection between context, assessment, and strategy was not evident in the development and initiation of CIRCLE, as the Project moved stra ight to a strategizing phase. The tight connection between assessment, planni ng, and strategy suggests th at because contexts differ, strategies ought to differ. Here we focus on a particular aspect of that point: the partner tribes' highly distinct cultures in crease the probability that differe nt strategies will be needed within each community in order to generate substantive justice syst em change. Significantly, there is growing evidence on the connection betw een culture, institutiona l and strategic design, and organizational or programmatic success. One body of evidence concerns the success of governing institutions in Indian country. Res earch has found that better-performing tribal governments are in the development \"driver's seat \" and possess constitutiona l-level institutions that pass the twin tests of cultural legitimacy a nd capability. In other words, effective tribal government institutions distribute power and authority in ways that make sense to their citizens (where \"what makes sense\" is based on a Nativ e nation's living culture) and are capable of getting things done in the contemporary world. The critical cultural variable has been called \"cultural match\": if a nation's institutional rules and processes are culturally legitimate, they underwrite socioeconomic progress; if not, progress is difficult. This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. xThis research on constitutional-level instituti ons is complemented by emerging evidence that culturally appropriate strategies increase the su ccess of a wide variety programs and processes. For instance, culturally appropriate strategies appear key to the progress some Native nations are making against hard problems such as community infrastructure development, healing for victims of sexual abuse, and diabetes. Criminal justice programs and institutions with cultural match also may generate improved outcomes; for example, they may reduce recidivism. Especially when combined with strong signals from the tribal CIRCLE partners, the research indicates that success is more likely if strate gies vary appropriately with tribal settings. Nonetheless, the architects of CIRCLE and the ongoing fe deral working group did not adequately define and support the role culture might play in tribal program s and strategies, in the design of the individual agencies and institutions that make up tribal justice systems, and in the overall design and administration of the systems th emselves. The challenge here is an important one. For any given Indian nation, the systems that animate and guide criminal justice functions (policing, prosecution, corrections, etc.) - including the organizati onal structures of individual agencies and the criminal justice system overa ll, tribal personnel and training systems, local management information and control systems, and tribal agencies that conduct strategic planning - ought to be linked to a vision of these criminal justice functions that is shaped by the nation's beliefs, needs, priorities, and re sources. As a result, the agenci es charged with administering justice would become more indigenous (or se lf-determined), more likely to build upon and reinforce important cultural norms and valu es, and more valuable to the community. We acknowledge that it is not easy to hearken to this call for more tailored, cultura lly appropriate strategies. Federal players may fi nd it difficult to work within their institutional and legislative constraints to help tribes craft such strategies , and tribes may lean toward the path of least resistance and return to the procedures and pol icies of the past, despite the probable success of new approaches. However, federal agencies have well-developed roadmaps for instituting funding streams that provide greate r flexibility to localities, incl uding tribes. We again cite Local Law Enforcement Block Grants and Byrne discretionary grants, which afford cities and counties substantial discretion in how they are invested, as well as the self-governance amendments to Public Law 93-638, which provide s ubstantial discretion to tribes in how they are invested. As emphasized under Opportunity 1, our point is not that the right funding mechanisms presently exist, but that there is precedent for them in current government practice. With appropriate legislative changes, the development of co rresponding support functio ns within USDOJ, and knowledge about these oppor tunities in Indian country, similar programs could promote the more effective use of USDOJ resources for tribal justice system enhancement. Opportunity 4: Introduce a Focus on Sustainability from the Start For the purposes of this evaluation, we think it is useful to define sust ainability in two ways. First, those changes in institut ional and system design and opera tion that are most able to weather fiscal, political, and othe r challenges over an ex tended period of time may be defined as \"sustainable.\" Sustainable change may arise from investments in infras tructure, training, and technology, but more precise identi fication of the contributing fact ors also necessitates, as we suggest under Opportunity 3, careful consideration of the local context. Guiding questions must be: given this particular cultura l, social, and political setting, do investments in (for example) This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. xiinstitutional re-design, government structures, staff development, or technology make sense as a means of promoting project sustainability? What makes programs live on in this nation? Second, sustainability is related to the specific investme nts that maximize local actors' effectiveness both during and after the period for wh ich the initiative is funded. Th e tribal CIRCLE partners are managing change within and across sectors in complicated political, cultural, and social settings, with limited resources. What kinds of support and professional development opportunities will optimize their contributions over time? High Quality Technical Assistance Plays a Key Role in Sustainability A critical investment is in good technical assistance (TA). High quality TA promotes both types of project sustainability, and thereby increases the odds that a project will result in system change. At the least, it leaves behind human capital, data, or procedural t ools; even if a program or initiative withers after the withdrawal of external funding, these are bases on which an individual or community can later build. At best, TA promotes the creation of sufficient capacity for the initiative to carry on and meet its goals. Across the sites, CIRCLE affiliates who received on-site, program-specific technical assistance told us how much they learned from and en joyed the trainings and other TA opportunities provided through CIRCLE. Unfort unately, CIRCLE coordinators, steering committees, partner program directors, and partner pr ogram staff also reported that th ere was too little TA, that the time gap between the request for and provision of TA was too large, and that the TA needed often extended beyond USDOJ's trad itional areas of expertise. Fo r example, USDOJ fruitfully provided training in community po licing and to court-appointed special advocates and provided technology assessment TA, but trib al-level implementers' needs ex tended to TA on evaluation, institution building (and cultural match), stra tegic planning, political communication and strategy, leadership development, incorporating the community in decision making, and financial management and budgeting, among others. For an agency like USDOJ to provide or even fund such TA may be a challenge, but evaluation findings argue that it would be a challenge well met. Intriguingly, providing better TA may provide the means for offering more TA. The key is recognizing the TA-increasing impl ications of two facts: 1) th at good technical assistance can reduce or even replace the need to monitor compliance; and 2) that meetings (cluster meetings, for example) and other already-funded project-re lated events offer opportunities for peer TA. Expanding on the first point, we note that many non-federal gove rnment funders (especially foundation actors) have made, or are making, a gra dual shift away from in tensive monitoring and toward intensive, well-rounded technical assistan ce. There are several reasons for this shift. Certainly, it creates a better se nse of partnership. Joint invol vement in TA would create situations in which the federal government and tr ibes truly partnered in problem solving, where by contrast, monitoring visits leave the impressi on that federal actors are interested only in overseeing tribal efforts. But it is also cost-effective. Good TA, that which is targeted at specific site needs and addresses problems in a way that is useful to implementers, provides essentially the same information as monitoring. If grantmakers are actively involved in the delivery of such TA, it becomes a \"twofer\" and makes for a better use of funds.

The site coordinators appear to be particularly important local leaders: when we asked questions at the site s about sustainability, we invariably were told that sustainability depended on th e Project's coordinators (the role, not nece ssarily the person), in that the coordinators prom oted an overall vision for the Project within the community and helped ensure that the entire e ffort continued to move forward. This finding argues that investme nts that support the site coordina tors - and other local leaders and stakeholders - or build their capacity to do their jobs well are likewise investments in sustainability. In future initiatives, federal and tr ibal actors should consid er providing these local leaders with carefully designed s upport and capacity enhancements. A Closer Look at the Federal Process We have noted that the federal partners prod uced two extremely important products in the implementation of CIRCLE - a streamlined and coordinated approach to funding and better inter-agency and federal-tribal communication. While we were cr itical of the lack of an overarching goal to focus CIRCLE work, the ma ny \"sub goals\" the federal partners set for themselves offer another evaluation opportunity: analysis of the federal partners' progress against their goals provides a more nuanced understanding of Project accomplishments and failures. A summary of this pr ogress is presented below. Goal: to accelerate and coordinate USDOJ programs and grants at CIRCLE demonstration sites to guide general im plementation of the Indian Country Law Enforcement Initiative In general, CIRCLE succeeded in a ccelerating the participating tribes' receipt of an overall set of program funds from the U.S. Department of Jus tice, which allowed them to begin implementa- tion quickly. But this is not to say that accele ration is necessarily a good thing. The Northern Cheyenne Tribe and the Pueblo of Zuni were administratively prepared for the Department's rapid grant award, but the Oglala Sioux Tribe was not. The Depart ment's subsequent decision to freeze Oglala Sioux's receipt of CIRCLE funds sugge sts that acceleration is desirable as long as a tribe's financial management infrastructure is adequate and accountable . Furthermore, acceler- ation of funding forced the tribes to bypass early-stage assessment and follow-on strategic planning. On the positive side and as noted earlier in th is summary, the federal CIRCLE partners also succeeded in coordinating funding and, to a larg e extent, grant management, accomplishments that provided valuable support to the tribal partners' efforts. Goal: to promote the inter-tribal exc hange of ideas and experiences in law enforcement, community development, and federal-tribal relations Cluster meetings were the right first step toward achieving this goal. They were a deliberate attempt to gather together tribal-level change agents, program directors, and leaders who were This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. xiiiworking on similar issues and striving toward rela ted goals. Yet the meetings fell short of their potential. They might have been more useful had the participant tribes b een given more latitude in meeting planning. But funding realities also mean that this freer hand must be accompanied by an upfront, e xplicit, and mutually understood explanation of the kinds of activities that can legitimately be supported. (We add emphasis to \"mut ually understood\" as we were told that the federal partners believed they had informed the tr ibal partners about the li mitations on the use of federal funds. This suggests that a still more explicit and affirmed understanding is necessary in the future.) With this understanding, tribal partners are savvy enough and creative enough to work within constraints or to seek non-federa l sources of funding (triba l funds, foundation funds, private donations, etc.) to support more innovative and productive meetings. Goals: i) to develop a comprehensive pl anning and development process for safe and healthy tribal communities, and ii) to foster true strategic planning and to increase the partnership between tribes and USDOJ These related goals link comprehensive and strategi c planning to two very different but desirable outcomes - safer communities and improved government-to-government relations. While outcomes data to lend credibility to the first point is not yet available, several factors suggest that CIRCLE has at least partially met these goals. The tribes' CIRCLE Project applic ations are one piece of eviden ce that CIRCLE assists tribes with comprehensive and strategic planning. Especi ally for years two and three, the application process served as a tool and opportunity for strategic planning ; the applications that emerged for Northern Cheyenne and Zuni in 2000, and a ll three tribes in 2001, reflected significant improvement in the development of strategic a nd comprehensive plans. But USDOJ did less than it could have to develop and foster sound pla nning processes. As has been noted, goal one (accelerated funding) is itself a barrier to im proved planning, since good strategic and compre- hensive planning takes time and should be prelim inary to program implementation. In general, sound planning processes also requi re site-specific, problem-ta rgeted technical assistance, especially in the form of baseline assessmen t, which was not really part of CIRCLE. With regard to the connection between strategic planning and federal-tr ibal partnership, both federal and tribal commentators suggested that CIRCLE's short time horizons and limited investments in strategic planni ng stood in the way of a long-te rm sense of partnership. A government-to-government relationship isn't \"her e today and gone tomorro w\"; tribes need to sense that the federal government is working wi th them over the long haul. Critically, substantial funding transfers are only one indicator of a positive long-term relationship. Personnel avail- ability, technical assistance, s upport for assessment and planning efforts, and institutionalized training within USDOJ on Native issues are ot her means of building enduring partnerships. Goal: to address (or at least draw atten tion to) the baseline roadblock that tribes have in developing comprehensive program s - serious gaps in their criminal justice systems While it is not clear that this understanding ha s broadly permeated USDOJ , the six Offices and Bureaus collaborating on CIRCLE Project funding were forced, tim e and again, to recognize the limitations on action posed by system gaps. For ex ample, increasing the size of a tribe's police This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department.

Given that they faced these problems, the federal partners also wo rked with the tribal pa rtners to fill the gaps. Goal: to highlight the need for additional and more consis tent resources for tribal law enforcement projects (and to remedy the problem, at least for a little while, for the three participating tribes) For the three years of CIRCLE, it seems clear that the Pueblo of Zuni and the Northern Cheyenne Tribe (neither of which experien ced a CIRCLE funding freeze or uncertainty around the third year of corrections construction funding, as did the Og lala Sioux Tribe) did receive funding from USDOJ in a more consistent ma nner than they would have without CIRCLE. Again, it was the guarantee of funds from the federa l partners that generated this consistency. When looking beyond the three years of Project f unding, however, the guarantee is gone and any strong sense of \"consistency\" in funding is gone t oo. At best, there is a weaker version of \"more consistent funding\" in play once the Project e nds: the federal partners are now much better informed about each other's programs and can better direct tribal applican ts to appropriate and additional funding sources when questions arise. Of course, this benefit lasts only as long as the federal personnel who worked on CIRCLE remain in their positions and the current grant program structure lasts. Summary and Conclusion: What Was Accomplished In every instance, evidence from the preceding re view of the federal government's involvement with the CIRCLE Project suggests that CIRCLE he lped USDOJ move in the direction of its goals. Sometimes the movement was not far, but it was progress nonetheless. Sometimes the progress was made in the face of difficult tensions - between \"policymakers\" and \"grantmakers,\" between the tribes and USDOJ, and perhaps even among grantmakers themselves. But the progress suggests that the undertaking was produc tive, and with that result, USDOJ ought to think seriously about how to build on a nd move forward from the CIRCLE Project. This recommendation is further supported by the f act that the CIRCLE Project helped strengthen the justice system at each of the tribal sites: It enabled the Pueblo of Zuni to make substantial progress toward the development of a functioning criminal justice system by: (1) strengthening the performance of agencies such as domes tic violence service providers, the police department, corrections, etc.; (2) build ing a management information system capable of providing timely informati on on the performance of individual agencies and the system as a whole; a nd (3) developing a logic model that has helped the tribe craft a strategic appro ach to \"breaking the cycle of violence.\" It has helped a set of key Northern Cheyenne leaders and community members consider the importance of developing a tr ibal Department of Justice; allowed the creation and expansion of programs that s upport a better tribal court (probation programs, victims assistance programs, and court clerk positions); and enabled an This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

It has provided citizens of the Oglala Sioux nation an opportunity to identify how their culture and other important features of the local context should influence the design of their criminal justice institutions . This has, in turn, provided reformers with a framework for rethinking the design of current institutions and agencies charged with addressing crime and crime-related problems. Taken together, these accomplishments and the valuable new know ledge produced by the CIRCLE Project suggest that the federal investment in CIRCLE was a worthy one.

The combined process and participatory qualities of this ev aluation phase generate a complicated set of products. It includes: Cross-site analysis. The opportunities, accomplishments, and continuing chal- lenges for both the tribes and the federal government are described together in a cross-site analysis, a piece which we offer at the outset of the evaluation documents as an integrated discussion of the individual products listed below. Federal process evaluation. Not only the tribes, but also the participating federal agencies were engaged in an important change effort. They were attempting to change the way the federal government work ed with tribes seeking to improve the capacities of their justice systems. This evaluation explores in detail how the federal partners' innovative efforts evolved in to design features of the initiative, and whether or not, through those efforts, they succeeded in meeting their goals. Tribal summaries. Each tribe was provided a pro cess-oriented account of its implementation work, and summary versions are included with this report. The emphases, formats, and contents of the accounts are very different, differences that are a result of tribal priorities. The Z uni, for example, were less interested in a review and analysis of thei r work to date than in identifying the elements of a theory of change and a framework for ongoing evaluation efforts. The Northern Cheyenne originally sought assistance in placing CIRCLE in the context of a number of similar efforts they have unde rtaken (Weed and Seed and the Indian Country Justice Initiative, for example); that has since evol ved into a concern with the links between CIRCLE and the capac ity of the Tribe's justice system to operate as a fully functioning, independent \"Department of Ju stice.\" The Oglala have begun to tease apart the complicated role that CIRCLE, especially through community-based organizations in the part nership, might play in the reform of core governance institutions.

CIRCLE produced valuable ne w knowledge on the strategic importance of addressing crime problems through system-level (rather than program-level) thinking, on the promise of federal cross-agency (and, potentially, cross-de partment) cooperation and coordination as a means of maximizing the va lue of federal investments in building strong and resourceful tribal communities, and on the cr itical role that tribal sovereignty and culture play in creating effectiv e tribal institutions. The architects of CIRCLE drew on a number of previous U.S. Department of Justice (USDOJ) efforts in shaping and managing the overall initiative, including th e Indian Country Law Enforcement Improvements Initiative, the Indian Country Justice Initiativ e, tribal Weed and Seed programs, and the Tribal Strategies Against Violence Program. Just as these programs and projects influenced the design and implementati on of CIRCLE, there are valuable observations and conclusions that can now be made about CI RCLE that tribes and the Department might use as they consider the design, funding, implemen tation, and oversight of future projects. This section presents those observations and co nclusions. They are grou nded in our understand- ing of the sites' efforts to strengthen their justic e systems, reports from on-site implementers of their experiences and concerns, and reports from both tribal and federal partners on their experiences working together. Because we conc lude that CIRCLE was a productive investment of the efforts and resources of all the partic ipating partners, we pr esent our findings as opportunities or \"next steps\" for th e U.S. Department of Justice ot her federal agencies as they continue to expand and improve their partnerships with American Indian nations and for tribes as they continue to strengthen their justice systems. I. Opportunity 1: Build on the Federal Part ners' Efforts to Support Comprehensive Justice System Planning CIRCLE was an important step forward for the U. S. Department of Justice in terms of its engagement with Indian nations and an important step forward for tribes in their thinking about the design of better-functioning justice systems. Th ese strides suggest that USDOJ would do well to build on CIRCLE by offering similar but imp roved programs in the future. This section demonstrates that ideas for this process emer ge from the considerat ion of CIRCLE's broad context (its sister comprehensive justice a nd comprehensive community programs) and the lessons it offers, and from the identification of CIRCLE's specific management successes and the ways the Department might move forward from them.

These ambitious efforts often entail increased at tention to performance accountability (including more rigorous approaches to evaluation), coll aborative planning, and strong commitments to institutional reform. For example, California's AB 1741 (a tradition in Califor nia is to name such initiatives after bill numbers) permitted a number of counties to use state health and social service funds much more flexibly and reflected a major shift in authority from the state to counties. Placer County, a community of about 250,000 residents located in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, used this opportunity to undertake comprehensive social service system reform (Giffen 1998). The state of Iowa's \"decategorization\" program is an example of a state offering local communities performance-ba sed incentives linked to increased funding flexibility (Cutler 1994). These a nd examples like them are produci ng a set of lessons learned on how the provision of tools and opportunities for co mprehensive system change can contribute to improved social service, health, and justice sy stem performance and, ultimately, to progress against important social goals (safer commun ities, improved health outcomes, and so on). Notably, the programs that offer lessons for CIRC LE and similar future initiatives are diverse. Passed through an appropriate \"fil ter,\" or understanding of what works in Indian country and why (questions explored later in this paper), not only past U.S. Department of Justice efforts, but many other initiatives can provide valuable guida nce to Native nations and their funding partners in the implementation of tribally based comprehensive programs. Meeting the Challenge of Implementing and Managing a Comprehensive Program One of the first lessons that emerges from the un iverse of like programs is this fact: government actors seeking change, whether they are the spons ors of such initiatives and functioning in an oversight or funding role or whether they are local actors in system change, face daunting obstacles. The various factors that preserve na rrow, poorly coordinated, categorical program and funding mandates include nothing less than custom, politics, personality, and law. Furthermore, though change agents in oversigh t/funding and implementation are actu ally involved in a single, overarching challenge, their different roles generate dramatic differences in perspective and their relationships are not always amicable. It is, for example, common for communities to complain 1 In some cases, health, social service, and justice syst ems have been combined as the focus of comprehensive community initiatives, and more than one tribal partner noted the potential value of combining CIRCLE with similar initiatives targeted at these other systems. Arguments in favo r of a broader approach include the fact that the systems often work with the same populations on related problems and that they (unproductively) compete for resources to do so. It is clear that, for example, a more efficient and effective response to alcohol abuse in Indian Country would require a coordinated effort across health , social service, and justice systems.

Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 4that state and federal level agencies preach co operation and collaboration without practicing it.2 In other words, the challenges players in either role face are formidable, and they may even see their partners in oversight/f unding or implementation contribu ting to those challenges. The tribal partners in CIRCLE reported exactly th is type of problem. An important part of the philosophy of the CIRCLE initiativ e was that through cooperation and collaboration, the tribal programs participating in CIRCLE c ould deliver better services to their clients. Thus, the tribal partners reported that it was common for the fede ral partners to encourag e them to find ways to work together, cooperate, and support each othe r. This advice was well intended; active cooperation and collaboration were not business as usual for many of the tribal programs, which implied that cooperation had great s ynergistic potential. Yet the trib al partners also felt that the advice was confounding, as it was not always apparent that the federal part ners were willing (or able) to take it themselves. Again, the experience and expertise offered by the broader context of comprehensive community initiatives offers a helpful lesson. Focus on an overarching goal allows participants to continue to work togeth er despite tension - even conflict - between their interests and perspe ctives. Our opinion about what that goal should be is disc ussed explicitly under Opportunity 2. For now, the point is that a common, well-understood, deeply shared goal can reduce the inevitable tensions that surround initiatives like CIRCLE.3 The considerable specific challe nge the federal CIRCLE partners f aced was to craft a set of tools and opportunities tribes could use to strengthen their justice systems, and to do so despite the fact that change at the federal level is greatly inhibited by, among othe r things, partisan politics, the sheer size and complexity of the relevant fede ral partner agencies, a nd numerous funding guide- lines and restrictions that circ umscribe the partner agencies' wo rk. Yet in the face of these obstacles, the federal CIRCLE part ners were remarkably succe ssful in creating a limited but quite important set of opportuni ties useful to the tribes for pursuing system change. The method the federal partners used was to forge a strong working group with representation from a number of departments and agencies, which met regularly over an extended period. It seems to have been led not by one agency or individual, but by a core set of agency representatives who were sufficiently committed to the initiative's goals to work on a difficult set of problems for a relatively long time. Two char acteristics of the workin g group stand out. First, the group kept a focus on the outcomes they sought (this is similar to the point about goals above, but applied to a subset of the partners). Second, they used this commitment to outcomes to \"stay at the table\" until they had created meaningful new opportunities for the tribes. This second characteristic fits well with another of the lessons learned from other comprehensive community initiatives - that the actors \"steering\" change must view their efforts as part of a long-term commitment (Gardner 2000). 2 Some experts on system change have observed a fairly strong correlation between the size of an agency or jurisdiction and its ability to implement system reform: the larger the agency or jurisdiction, the more difficult it is to achieve meaningful change. 3 Another typical challenge to system-change efforts is finding a balance between the seemingly conflicting objectives of increasing local (here, tribal) control and ensuring acceptable levels of accountability. Sister initiatives actually provide a set of \"guideposts\" that the architects of future USDOJ initiatives might use in balancing these objectives. We discuss these guideposts further in Opportunities 3 and 4. This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department.

One of these was the federal partners' work toward st reamlining and coordinating the funding process. The other was the improved communication and cooperation among the federal partners and between the federal partners and the tribes. Greater detail of th e benefit of these products is provided below. In general, however, these two e fforts enabled the participant tribes to make significant progress in shaping st ronger justice systems, whether that was to th ink in very fundamental terms about what a successful jus tice system might look like or whether it was to shape the work of only marginally coordi nated agencies into cohesive systems. Streamlined Funding The initiative's efforts to streamline funding were especially valuable to the participa ting tribes (as they have been for parties engaged in a wide range of similar initiatives outside of Indian country). One way of illustrating this point is to think of the organization and alignment of funding streams as existing along a spectrum, from highly restricted, categorical funding on one end to funding through block grants, which provide significant flexibility in terms of program and system design, on the other. When tribes ar e restricted to developi ng their justice systems through categorical funding, the opportunities to think comprehensively and to design local institutions and strategies to meet tribally defined goals are limited (if not nonexistent). By offering tribes the opportunity to apply for funding from the six pa rtner agencies and offices in CIRCLE, USDOJ took an important step toward freeing tribes inte rested in comprehensive work on justice issues from searching out a set of cate gorical programs that had some \"fit\" with each other and the tribes' goa ls, negotiating with thos e programs for funding (or entering the \"lottery\" for those programs' support), and trying to ex plain throughout implementation why a more comprehensive approach matters. We note, however, that while CIRCLE has creat ed important new opport unities for tribes' to think comprehensively and strategically and to self -define the ends they wish to meet with their programs, it still falls short of providing the opportunities for strategic thinking and system reform that would be offered through a bloc k grant funding approac h. CIRCLE was a menu of resources (grant dollars and t echnical assistance) that, idea lly, provided tribes with the opportunity to develop a strategy and then select the resources that supp orted the implementation of that strategy. While is was a step forward, the problem with CIRCLE' s funding approach is that it cannot support just any strategy a tribe decides upon. A tribe might decide on a strategic element for which no menu item can provide financ ial support, which then forces a somewhat backward approach: tribal program planners must stitch together a strategy based on the resources that are on the table. This is the roa dblock to full strategic thinking and comprehensive system change that a more flexib le funding structure could overcome. Improved Inter-Agency and Federal-Tribal Communication Categorical program mandates, institutional po licies and procedures, and custom at both the federal and tribal levels contribut e to poor system design and functi oning at the tribal level. One important goal of CIRCLE (and similar initiatives) was to provide the oppor tunity and impetus to productively organize the efforts of a variety of agencies and actors with differing mandates and funding constraints around a mutually agreed upon se t of goals (for example, to reduce youthful This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

While CIRCLE di d not eliminate these mandates and constraints, it is clear that the federal partners' attention to improved co mmunication, coordination, and cooperation comple- mented streamlined funding in en hancing tribes' ability to address critical crime and social problems in a systematic and strategic fashion. Co mmunication and cooperati on at least laid bare the differences between programs and allowed the partners to wrestle with the implications. The development of the working group not on ly facilitated improve d communication across federal agencies, but also facilitated improved communication between the federal agencies and the tribes. This created a vigorous conversation be tween the sites and the federal participants on a number of topics. The original goal was to create a system of communication between the federal working group and the tribes that was \"streamlined\" in a manner roughly analogous to the streamlining of funding: each tribal CIRCLE Project coordinator was to have a single point person within the working group (instead of having to talk to different individuals in each of the six offices that funded the trib es' CIRCLE components), and tribal partners at all levels of government and program administra tion were to have federal contacts with similar levels of authority. While both the tribes and the federa l partners implemented the communication model somewhat imperfectly, it nonethele ss created an environment in wh ich the tribal partners found much more support than they did prior to CIRCLE for thinking on system terms. Building on CIRCLE's Successes Viewed in the context of the U.S. Department of Justice's previous comprehensive tribal justice initiatives, such as Weed and Seed, the Indian Country Justice Initiative, and Tribal Strategies Against Violence, CIRCLE represents a significant step forward - wh ich suggests that its critical components should not be forgotten as the Departme nt continues its work in Indian country. Yet CIRCLE's streamlined funding structure was a pilot project and the improved federal communication and cooperation informal. Neither, therefore, can have a long lifetime without some sort of institutionalization. Looking to the still broader cont ext for lessons and ideas, one possibility is for the CIRCLE work group to be forma lized as an inter-agency task force. This is a model that, for some other comprehensive community initiatives, has been a means of preserving the progress made toward more st reamlined funding and improved communication and cooperation across agencies. Anot her lesson, however, is that ev en this success is likely only if the task force accrues the aut hority and resources necessary to gi ve it a voice in policy making. We also note that there are existing federal prog rams (including programs currently administered by the U.S. Department of Justice) for impr oving and institutionalizing the type of funding offered to tribes through CIRCLE. The most pref erred model is block grants; the federal Local Law Enforcement Block Grant and the Juvenile Accountability Incentive Block Grant are examples of two such USDOJ programs. They pr ovide substantial funds to cities and counties with few restrictions on their use. The most pr ogressive communities have used these grants as \"innovation funds\" and invested the money in improving overall system performance. 4 The Edward Byrne Memorial State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance Program, which offers both discretionary grants directly to local gov ernments and non-profit agencies and formula grants to states with local pa ss-through options, is another fede ral program that offers a model 4 Personal communication with representatives from the Cosmos Corporation (which is evaluating the Local Law Enforcement Block Grant program for USDOJ), summer 2001 and summer 2002.

Finally, the current Public Law 93-638 contracting process, which allows trib al governments to assume responsibility for functions that might otherwise be performed by the Department of the Interior or Department of Health and Human Services, could be amended to support a somewhat less restrictive approach to funding as well. We would be even more s upportive of funding of the type that occurs under the auspices of the self-governance amendments to P.L. 93-638; financing through self- governance compacts is another form of block gr anting and, thus, provides tribes with much more control over government functions than is permitted under P.L. 93-638 contracts. In sum, the point is that curren tly existing federal programs - both insi de and outside Indian country and inside and outside the U.S. Department of Justice - provide a roadmap to Congress, the Administration, and USDOJ for increasing the flex ibility of funding streams and providing even better support of comprehensive justi ce system change in Indian country. II. Opportunity 2: Use the Concept of Na tion Building to Guide the Initiative's Goals, Plans, and Implementation What Exactly is Meant by a Focus on Nation Building? \"Nation building\"6 is a term used increasingly in the liter ature and by leaders in Indian country to refer to the process of construc ting effective institutions of self governance that can provide a foundation for sustainable development, community health, and successfu l political action. In other words, it is the process of promoting I ndian self-determination, self-governance, and sovereignty - and, ultimately, of improving tribal citizens' social and economic situations - through the creation of more capable, cultura lly legitimate institutions of governance. As applied to Indian country, th e term is rooted in the treat ies tribes signed with foreign sovereigns (including the United States) in th e post-contact period and embraces Chief Justice John Marshall's admission that American Indian tr ibes are \"domestic depe ndent nations\" By calling atten- tion to tribes' nationhood, the term emphasizes the f act that tribes are not vestigial elements of American society, but an enduring yet separate part of it. Additiona lly, the term acknowledges Indian nations' need for governing institutions ca pable of dealing with contemporary issues - be 5 Indeed, tribes are already eligible for such grants, although few, if any, have been given grants under the program. For more information, see <www .ncjrs.org/html/bja/edbyrne/>. 6 The authors understand that in the current political climate, this term has some negative connotations. We do not use it in the same sense. The American Indian nation building we refer to is that of Native people building their own nations, not having external parties impose institutional elements upon them. In fact, the external imposition of institutions has been tried in the Native context and proven a dismal failure, a result that supports the contemporary hesitation to permit the United States government to engage in \"nation building\" abroad. 7 The term \"domestic dependent nations\" originated in Chief Justice John Marshall's opinion in Cherokee v. Georgia (1831). Vine Deloria, Jr. and Clifford Lytle are the authors of the book The Nations Within: The Past and Present of American Indian Sovereignty (New York: Pantheon Books, 1984).

Why is Nation Building an Important Idea for CIRCLE? Our observations suggest that there are at leas t two reasons why the nation-building process is important to CIRCLE and like programs. The firs t might be called a \"frame of reference\" problem, the second the occurr ence of a missed opportunity. The Frame of Reference Problem As a frame of reference, the leaders, government al personnel, and citizens of tribes generally think of their polities as nations and, thus, make decisions and undertake initiatives based on this understanding. With regard to pa rticipation in federally funded projects, tribes' nationhood and the process of nation building mean that tribes participate in su ch projects by choice; the federal government cannot tell them to take the money, trib es can opt not to, and th ey can take action to accept federal support on their own terms.8 Ideally, tribal nations' participation reflects these questions and decisions: does the fe deral funding offer fit with our vision for our nation? Does it help us implement the strategic plan our tribe has for nation building? Does it help us strengthen the institutions and processes that we have iden tified as in need of strengthening (and in ways that make sense to us)? Initial documents describing CIRCLE reflect USDOJ's appreciation of tribes' nationhood. For example, the \"Memorandum for the Attorney General\" that formally introduced and sought approval for the initiative proposes a \"project to cooperate with tribes towards improved law enforcement services and quality of life in Indian Country\" (L eClaire 1998, p. 1, italics added), and acknowledges that USDOJ's policy was to \"consult with Tribes on a government-to- government basis when instituting policies or programs that impact them\" ( ibid., p. 3). It is less clear that the USDOJ grant managers a nd technical assistance provi ders participating in CIRCLE consistently embraced this orienta tion. Unfortunately, any time federal CIRCLE partners failed to recognize trib al partners' \"national\" orienta tion, a functional mismatch arose, with tribal partners thinking a nd acting as national representative s and federal partners treating them in a more conventional manner (as typi cal \"grantees,\" \"programs,\" or \"local govern- ments\"), generally with detrimental results. Di sjunctions between the op tions tribal partners believed they ought to have and th e options the federal partners be lieved were available to them led to stymied negotiations, frustration on both sides, forced \"compromise,\" lower productivity, and may even have decreased the responsibility tribal personnel felt for program results. 8 There is, of course, tremendous pressure on under-resour ced tribes to pursue new funding opportunities regardless of their long-term value in nation building. We propose, however, that there may be substantial and untapped near- term value in communicating to funders that piece-meal, categorical, and cultu rally inappropriate grant initiatives are of little use - and that one powerful way of communicating th e fact would be for tribes to refuse to participate in such initiatives. Importantly, such actions have the bene fit of keeping a tribe on track toward its own, self- determined goals and not on a helter-skelter search for tem porary funding. This is the perspective from which the statement that tribes might \"take action to accept federal support on thei r own terms\" arises. Even if statutory guidelines severely restrict the uses of funds after a grant is received, tribes always have this negotiating room prior to funding: they can decline it. This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 9The experience of the Oglala Sioux Tribe (OST) dur ing the initial planning stages for CIRCLE is an example. OST interviewees reported that earl y in the process of prog ram development, they outlined a CIRCLE strategy and wrote an applica tion for CIRCLE funds that included substantial community involvement. However, when USDOJ representatives sugges ted that the proposal would not fit within the program matic structure of the participating USDOJ units, Oglala Sioux moved away from the grassroots-based applicati on and crafted a grant application for a group of programs that were apparently more \"accepted/exp ected\" within the federal program structure. While the Tribe's approach to the CIRCLE fu nding process began with the notion of nation building (Where are our needs? What works best to accomplish such tasks in our community?), the limited federal funding options available rein forced dependency in strategy drafting, and the process ended with the acceptan ce of funds on federal terms. Critically, the point is not that in future initiatives tr ibes' requests must be honored. Rather, it is that the federal government and tribes must work harder to share the \"tribes as nations\" frame of reference. If tribes' nationhood is a consiste nt focus in the work, federal and tribal representatives may find more fruitful ways to negotiate and compromise, and tribes may gain increased control of their futu res by exercising greater choice over the type of funding they accept and programs they develop. An important consideration for tribes is that the nation- building perspective obligates them to think more strategically about the role grant opportunities play in the process of nation building. For tr ibes that recognize the importance of nation building, the question is difficu lt: does this in itiative offer the opport unity to make a sound investment in more capable tribal institutions or does it commit us to yet another three-year cycle of short-term jobs and unrealis tic expectations for improvemen ts in social conditions? When tribal leaders and grant seekers have answered this question honestly, their priorities may necessarily shift; for example, a tribe may request the opportunity to think more fundamentally about strategies that move the tribe forward along the path of nation building, a nd might request not \"program support\" but a very different set of resources (suc h as technical assistance and support for thorough planning and assessment, a t opic which we discuss in more detail under Opportunity 4). The payoff of such deliberat e thinking and support - that is, of accepting, respecting, and promoting tribal nationhood - may be that it is the best formula for programmatic success, from both the federal and tribal perspective.9 The Missed Opportunity The first \"opportunity for moving forward\" discu ssed in this chapter un derscored the importance of common, well-understood, deeply shared goals for resolving conflicts between funders and implementers. More broadly, such goals are va luable because they serve as organizing principles, ultimate objectives, and a means of keeping participants' \"eyes on the prize.\" Our sense is that CIRCLE lacked this type of goal. Further, we believe that identifying \"nation building\" as CIRCLE's overarching goal would have served the purpose - and that not identifying it as the explicit goa l for CIRCLE was a missed opportunity. 9 This statement derives from argume nts made by Cornell and Kalt (1992, 1998) that socioeco nomicly successful Indian nations are those that practice de facto sovereignty - they are in the driver 's seat for decision making and are free from the constraints and mindsets of dependence.

Even among those who understood that the work done through CIRCLE to improve justice system s and other governmental capacities (for example, adopting or improving an MIS or accounti ng system that benefits a broader range of service providers and/or administ rative divisions) was part a nd parcel of nation building, the realization was obscured by other foci or sometimes came quite late in the implementation process; then, the benefits of thinking about nati on building were either unr ealized or less fully realized than they might ha ve been. Two examples are: While community strengthening (a version of nation building) was an important aspect of the conception of CIRCLE - and is even noted in the program's proper name, \"Comprehensive Indian Resources for Community and Law Enforcement\" - it was easy for this desired outcome to become lost in the details of the application process, the ru les that governed the use of various Office Justice Programs or Office of Community Orie nted Policing Services funds, and particular implementation issues. At Northern Cheyenne, it was not until the second year of CIRCLE funding that the steering committee and program managers began to admit that their goal was not merely to continue efforts made unde r programs such as the Risk Focused Prevention Project, the Indian Country La w Enforcement Initiative, and Weed and Seed, but to build a Northern Cheyenne Justice Department. Certainly, as noted in the preceding bullet point, the various partners each had goals for CIRCLE. The tribes had goals linked to their CI RCLE strategies. The next chapter, which out- lines the history of the CIRCLE Proj ect at the federal level, lists th ree federal goals made explicit the in the Office of Tribal Justice's proposal memo for CIRCLE 10 and three more implicit goals that emerged from conversati ons with federal partners.11 The problem we identify is that none of these goals were broadly shared, deeply unde rstood, and primarily relied upon by federal and tribal partners. No theme served to concentrate the various pa rtners' thinking about CIRCLE or to organize their priorities for work. Particular \"sub-goals\" may ha ve done this within each tribal community and within the federal partners' working group, but no goal linked the groups in thought and action. By contrast, a focus on nation building would have provided this linkage and allowed the Project to reap the be nefits of that single-mindedness. 10 To \"accelerate and coordinate USDOJ programs and grants at CIRCLE demonstration sites to guide general implementation of the Indian Country Law Enforcement Initiative\"; to \"promote the inter-tribal exchange of ideas and experiences in law enforcement, community developmen t, and federal-tribal relations\"; and to \"develop a comprehensive planning and development process for safe and healthy tribal communities\" (LeClaire 1998, pp. 1-2). 11 To address (or at least draw attention to) the baseline roadblock that tribes have in developing comprehensive programs, the serious gaps in their criminal justice systems; to highlight the need for additional and more consistent resources for tribal law enforcement projects (and to reme dy the problem, at least for a little while, for the three participating tribes); and to foster true strategic planning and to increase the partnership between tribes and USDOJ. This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 11This is a critical step for the U.S. Department of Justice, but consider ing the background of and organizing documents for CIRCLE, it is one that the Department ought to be rela tively prepared to make. For example, we again note that in its conception of CIRC LE, USDOJ hoped that the initiative would contribute to the creation of stronger, more resourceful communities, ones capable of building and sustaining CIRCLE's institu tional and system-change goals. If this idea had been made explicit as an organizing goal, it would have cl osely paralleled the concept of nation building - there is a st rong consonance between community approaches to justice and nation-building goals (see Wakeling et al. 2001, especially chapter 6). More tellingly, USDOJ's groundbreaking 1995 \"Polic y on Indian Sovereignty and Government- to-Government Relations with Indian Tribes,\"12 provides guiding principles for its work with Native nations. These include recognition of \"tribe s as domestic dependent nations [that] retain sovereign powers, except as divested by the United States\" (\"Policy\" 1995, p. 3); \"respect for Indian tribes and thei r sovereign authority\" ( ibid.); a commitment to consult with Indian tribes \"in decisions that relate to or affect [their] sovereignty, rights, resources or land\" ( ibid., p. 4); a commitment \"to strengthening and assisting Indian tribal governments in their development and to promoting Indian self-government\" ( ibid.); acknowledgment of the fe deral trust re sponsibility; and a commitment to protecting indi vidual civil rights and tribes' religions and cultures. This is a long list, but there is a theme that connects the principles - the Department's stated commitment (within the law) to strengthening tribal govern ments and promoting self-government. Essentially, the Department already has a co mmitment to nation building. The next step is for USDOJ to explicitly adopt the principle as the overarching goal for future programs that build on CIRCLE (and, indeed, for al l its programmatic inter actions with tribes) . Setting nation building as the goal helps coordinate federal partners' actions by requiring them to pass their plans and activities through this filter : do the plans and activities of our organization support tribes in the process of constructing effective instituti ons of self governance that can provide a foundation for sustainable developmen t, community health, and successful political action? It has a similar effect on tribal partners, by encouraging them to focus on this filter: does the strategy we propose for strengthening our jus tice system fit with our long-term efforts to become a stronger more resourceful community? Both parties are asking questions that push them toward the bigger picture even as they are imp lementing the nitty-gritty details of grants or programs. Instead of merely asking, \"how do we provide/get money for a new youth program or for a corrections facility?\" the partners are as king, \"how do we make this a stronger institution and a stronger system? The shift is to thinking a bout the design of institutions in the context of nation building, rather than the design of institutions in the context of funding particular programs. 13 In sum, a nation-building goal imposes oblig ations on all the partners that bind them to a more fundamental purpose in their work. Th e opportunity to do this should not be missed in USDOJ's next iteration of a comprehens ive justice program for Indian country. 12 This document can be viewed at <www.usdoj.gov/otj/sovtrb.htm>. 13 This point also has been made with respect to the appr opriate design of tribal human service and social welfare systems (Brown, Hicks, and Jorgensen 2002).

Opportunity 3: Take Context and Cult ure Seriously - Generate More Tailored Tribal Strategies According to the logic of the fo regoing section, the thr ee tribes participati ng in CIRCLE ought to be viewed as different developing nations; as su ch, they had very different social development needs and different starting points for the work CIRCLE hoped to accomplish. The individual tribes' process analyses document the truth in this statement: the CIRCLE tribes display great variation in terms of culture, demographics, po litical systems and stability, criminal justice system structure and organizatio n (for example, P.L. 93-638 status, degree of judicial independence, and jurisdictional authority), availa ble social services, proximity to urban areas, etc. Of course, USDOJ recognized these differences at the outset - the tr ibes' differences drove USDOJ's decision to include them in the CIRCLE demonstration (LeClaire 1998, pp. 4-5). What is less clear is whether the CIRCLE partners at both the federal and tribal levels reacted seriously enough to the implications of these contextual differences . This section makes the point first by highlighting the connections between c ontextual variation, assessment, planning, and strategy and then by considering the specific impact of cultural differences on tribal strategies. The Role of Planning and Assessment in Ge nerating Strategic Approaches to System Change and Nation Building Research shows that context plays a powerful role in determining the ch aracter and degree of system change (see, for example, Annie E. Casey Foundation 1995, especially pp. 4-6). This fact suggests that change agents who ignore context do so to their detrimen t and, further, that contextual assessment is a critical component of system change initiatives. Done well, assessment honestly portrays the circumstance s in which the change initiative will unfold, revealing the challenges and res ources present within the commun ity. In other words, assessment is itself a tool in system change that identif ies gaps, leverage points, and additional tools (in particular, possible partners and existing financia l, human, social, and other community capital). Assessment of this sort is critical to the success of comprehensive community initiatives ( ibid.). Stated in those terms, the tight linkage between assessment and strategy is not surprising. By clarifying and highlighting contex tual constraints and opportunities , good assessment results in good strategy, or in practical expectations of how and how mu ch change will be achieved. Several literatures document the fact that compre hensive community change strategies work best when they are tailored to their specific contex ts, including the politi cal science and economics literature on reform and change in the public sector,14 the planning and evaluation literature on comprehensive community initiatives,15 and the community policing literature.16 A major finding/observation in all of these sources is the n eed for flexibility across sites. In other words, it is appropriate and probably nece ssary for strategies to vary acro ss sites. Indeed, such flexibility and variability may be critical in reaching goa ls (see especially, The Pew Partnership 1998). 14 Grindle (1997) is a seminal example. 15 This literature is frequently addressed specifically to fu nders and only sometimes to a more general audience, but it is nonetheless helpful in designing comprehensive commun ity change initiatives. See, for example, Hahn (1998), The Annie E. Casey Foundation (1995), The Rockefeller Foundation (1997), and The Pew Partnership (1998). 16 See Moore and Poethig (1999), especially p. 141, and Wakeling et al. (2001), especia lly the concluding chapter. This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 13These connections between context, assessment, and strategy were not evident in the initiation and development of CIRCLE. Indeed, early prom oters assured the Associate Attorney General that because CIRCLE \"involves the acceleration of existing program and grants... performing a preliminary needs/priorities assessme nt is unnecessary\" (Fisher 1998, p. 1).17 Thus, upon approval, CIRCLE moved straight to a strategizi ng phase - strategy was the focus of the first CIRCLE meeting in Rapid City, South Dakota. Not all of the participating tribes were comfortable stepping over assessment in the CIRC LE development process. The Pueblo of Zuni certainly was not, as shown in the site's proces s analysis. In interviews, the Zuni Coordinator also explained the importance of ongoing assessm ent, and that certain aspects of their assessments would not be complete until after program development. The Northern Cheyenne partners may have felt that their earlier expe rience with other comprehensive programs (Risk Focused, the Indian Country Justice Initiative, an d Weed and Seed) mitigated the need for early assessment (although they did hire the Crossroads Leadership Institute fo r strategic planning facilitation). A back-of-the-envelope assessment ma y have been one of several forces leading to the Oglala Sioux Tribe's initial CIRCLE proposal , but it was certainly not a structured and deliberate process; indeed, the OST CIRCLE Coordinator has identified program-level assessment and planning skills as impor tant to that site 's ongoing progress. Even if assessment had been a formal part of the early stages of the initiative, however, it is not clear what its usefulness would have been for a program whose fundi ng horizon was only three years long. Research and experience with simila r community initiatives recommend a structured and intensive period of assessment and pl anning. The new Annie E. Casey Foundation Making Connections community change initiative will provide funding for a 10-year period, of which the first several years combine planning and assessment of planning.18 The Northwest Area Foundation's Community Ventures program reflects the same orientation.19 Some observers have argued that the political reality of changing administrations prohibits similar efforts; in answer, it should be noted that several fe deral initiatives (including the Weed and Seed and Local Law Enforcement Block Grant programs) have lasted through multiple administrations. All three CIRCLE tribes began Project implemen tation before the process of assessment was complete; all three site coordi nators said they would have preferred USDOJ-supported opportun- ities to conduct such work; and al l three are trying to gain, with the limited tools they have (even the evaluation), some sense of \"where they ar e\" and would welcome the opportunity to do more. Culture, Institutional Design, and System Change in Indian Country The discussion above outlines the tight connect ion between assessment, planning, and strategy and notes that because c ontexts differ, strategies ought to differ. This subsection focuses on a particular aspect of that same point - the part ner tribes' highly distinct cultures increase the 17 Despite this statement, some USDOJ Office of Justice Programs (OJP, the agency that administered CIRCLE) staff reported that during Pr oject implementation, they none theless made requests for assessment, strategic planning, and coordinator training around these issues - and that most such requests were denied. One notable exception is the technology assessments that OJP was able to pr ovide in years 2 and 3 of the CIRCLE Project. 18 For more information on Making Connections , see the Annie E. Casey Foundation website, <www.aecf.org>. 19 For more information on Community Ventures , see the Northwest Area Foundation website, <www.nwaf.org>.

Significantly, there is growing evidence on the connection between culture, institutional and strategic design, and organizati onal or programmatic success. On e body of evidence concerns the success of governing institutions in Indian country: in a series of relate d articles, Cornell and Kalt (1992, 1993, 1995, 1997, 1998, 2000) argue that the better performing tr ibal governments are in the development \"driver's seat\" (exercise de facto sovereignty) and possess constitutional- level institutions that pass the twin tests of cu ltural legitimacy and capability. In other words, effective tribal government institutions distribute power and authority in a way that makes sense to their citizens (where \"what makes sense\" is based on the tribe's living culture) and are capable of getting things done in the contemporary wo rld. Using a rigorous research methodology and carefully chosen tribal comparisons, Cornell and Kalt show that certain tribes with identical constitutional-level governing in stitutions have experienced radi cally different socioeconomic outcomes, while other tribes with quite different in stitutions have realized comparable levels of success. Other things equal, the variable that explains these divergent outcomes is \"cultural match\": if a nation's institutional rules and proce sses are culturally legitimate (that is, if they match underlying expectations of the way aut hority and power should be distributed and exercised), they underwrite socioeconomic progress; if not, progress is difficult. This research on constitutional-level instituti ons is complemented by emerging evidence that culturally appropriate strategies increase the su ccess of a wide variety programs and processes. For instance, culturally appropriate strategies appear key to the progress some Native nations are making against hard problems such as community infrastructure development (Jorgensen 2000), healing for victims of sexual abuse (Harvard Project on American Indian Economic Develop- ment 2001, pp. 8-9), and diabetes justice pr and inst itutions with cultural match also may genera te improved outcomes (Wakeling et al. 2001); for example, they may reduce recidivism. Especially when combined with st rong signals from the tribes, the research indicates that success is more likely if strategies vary appropriately with tribal settings. Noneth eless, across all sites, the \"cultural\" aspects of the CIRCLE strategies have either been dropped or de-emphasized.20 20 While not a changed strategy, the first cluster meeting provides an early example of the way in which culture was de-emphasized. One of USDOJ's CIRCLE goals was to ge nerate increased sharing between tribes about the problem-solving approaches they were implementing (LeClaire 1998, p.1). The Northern Cheyenne team took this goal seriously and relied on the philosophies of Cheyenne culture to design an agenda for the first cluster meeting; they especially felt that this would be a meaningful wa y of facilitating inter-tribal knowledge exchange. But these plans did not fit USDOJ funding guidelines, which led to a substantial re-working of the agenda. In the end, the tribal partners' sense was that their cultural orientation ha d been shifted from center stag e to a second stage; while certain \"cultural elements\" remained, they felt that the ove rall structure of the meeting had been determined by USDOJ. This experience may have contributed to reports we received throughout the evaluation period, from both tribal and federal partners, that the cluster conferences were not as valuable as they could have been. ( Nb: Evaluators heard conflicting stories about the planning phase for this cluster conference; the most common version of events is reported here. See also footnote 47). Such conflicts or misunderstandings may be inevitable given the differences in perspective between participating tribal and federal representatives, but they can be more effectively addressed when both groups of stakeholders This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 15 As mentioned above, Oglala Sioux initially proposed a strategy that relied more on community-based organizations for mon itoring and implementation than it did on the central tribal government. Yet, USDOJ representatives discouraged this approach for CIRCLE, and the tribal play ers consented to USDOJ's vision of an appropriate strategy. The decision is particul arly discordant at OST because of the expectations the init iative's acronym and actual name raise. In the Lakota cultural context, the word \"circle\" and the menti on of \"community\" in the program's title signal the appropriateness of wide popular engagement.21 At Northern Cheyenne, tribal implemente rs have been more eager to disengage from strict cultural elements. On the one hand, carry-over involvement with the Indian Country Justice Ini tiative and Weed and Seed, in which tribal partners were used to working in a particular way with the U.S. Department of Justice, may have caused the tribal implemente rs to choose a fairly \"Western-looking\" strategy. On the other hand, some tribal interviewees, as well as the ICJI evaluation (Lujan, Riding In, and Tsosie 1998), questioned how much the system could change without engaging those co mmunity members who saw themselves as having a \"traditional role\" in justice and law enforcement.22 At Zuni, a community chosen to particip ate in CIRCLE precisely because of its deeply rooted non-Western culture, site inform ants told us that they have plans to incorporate strictly cultural elements into their programs, processes, and institutional design but that they have found it difficu lt to do so within the constraints imposed by federal funding streams. The Zuni CIRCLE Project may succeed in incorporating aspects of culture, but it is likely that this could have been done more effectively had the initi ative supported the changes directly. participate in \"authoring\" the design of the initiative from the outset, with the goal being to achieve a clear, mutual understanding of the obligations and prerogatives of participants. In addition, the growing literature on \"group process\" provides a number of useful tools for tracking and acting on the conflicts that differences in perspective generate in such initiatives. Relevant and useful ideas include using well-qualified, neutral facilitators and employing structured debriefs after meetings in order to identify where things went right, where they went wrong, and how to address issues more productively in future meetings. 21 Early documents propose an initiative called the \"Consortium of Indian Reservations Cooperating in Law Enforcement\" (LeClaire 1998, Fisher 1998), which was later switched to \"Comprehensive Indian Resources for Community and Law Enforcement.\" A different title might have moderated tribal perceptions of USDOJ's programmatic capabilities. 22 This \"inclusive\" perspective gains support in other resear ch that addresses institutional change in Indian Country - in particular, in emerging analyses of effective proce sses of constitutional change. These analyses suggest that involving as broad a group of particip ants and supporters as possible (which automatically draws in more traditional tribal citizens) helps ensure the accep tability and sustainability of change (see, for example, Lemont 2002 and Lemont forthcoming). Yet we also want to underscore the f act that these are difficult and delicate issues at Northern Cheyenne, especially because of the r ecent rise of a new group of political , economic, and social leaders in the community (Jamison, retrieved September 24, 2002), which might signal that the community is experiencing significant cultural change. Those changes eventually might mean that involving certain groups in the justice system change process is unnecessary. And there is research to su pport this possibility as well: Menashi (1997) finds that forward progress on certain types of change initiatives migh t be possible only when certain groups are excluded.

Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 16These examples suggest that the CIRCLE sites implemented essentially the same strategy (regardless of how the tr ibes described them). Baldly stat ed, that strategy was to use grant support from a particular set of U.S. Department of Justice agencies and bureaus to create or expand tribal programs that had acce ptable ties to th e funding sources. The strategy appears to be coming together at the Pueblo of Zuni , where there are early signs of successful implementation. Of course, this is a s ite where there is alrea dy an institutionalized criminal justice infrastructure, where that infrastructure is embedded in an overall governmental system that is legitimate and stable, and wh ere on-the-ground implementers are skilled at working within that system. Ostensibly, CIRC LE's fairly Western community policing and com- munity justice model has a degree of \"cultural fit\" at Zuni. Yet at this midpoint of evaluation, questions remain. In particular, gi ven Zuni citizens' deeply rooted traditional culture, will these new and enhanced justice institutions have le gitimacy to the people who pass through them? The strategy also may have a de gree of fit with Northern Chey enne, where implementers largely have used CIRCLE to build on past community justic e initiatives. Furthermore, there is a chance that the Northern Cheyenne Project will be able to push beyond the generic strategy's confines, if the Steering Committee and implementers truly rely on the organizing concept of creating a \"Northern Cheyenne Department of Justice.\" By contrast, the CIRCLE strategy fits poorly with the Oglala Sioux nation. The problem is clarified by the theo ry of how change occurs at OST, wh ich proposes that ch ange occurs less through central tribal government action than it does through the action of lower level, more community-based institutions. 23 This theory is supported both by academic research (Cornell and Kalt 1995, among others) and by on-the-ground Society to Strengthe n/Defend the People and Families) has been working on behalf of children and families using a grassroots, culturally based organizational structure and appr oach to programming, and appe ars to be one of the most successful system change and service programs in the community. 24 It is also interesting to note that today, it is those component programs of the OST CIRCLE Project that are least tied to the central tribal government - the Boys and Girls Club, Cangleska, and CASA25 - that are marking some of the clearest progress m ilestones (see Oglala Sioux chap ter of this report). While we remain agnostic about the future role that such non-governmental organizations ought to have in 23 Indeed, one of the first signals of change that Oglala CIRCLE team members proposed was not that the tribal government had established Program X or that data point Y had changed but, rather, that the community had an increased ability to hold the government (and the justice system in particular) accountable. 24 OOIO's primary function is to promote wrap-around services for children and families who come into contract with the Oglala Sioux social services system. Their goal has necessitated code development, program development, program coordination, and service improvement. OOIO undertakes these tasks primarily through the formation of topic-specific workgroups with broad (but informed) membership. OOIO's longevity, accomplishments, stable leadership, and ab ility to attract talented lay and professional workgroup staff atte st to its success and capability in promoting and sustaining system change. 25 Not all of these organizations would describe themselves as \"community-based\" where that term is interpreted as reflecting the views of many individuals at the grassroots; however, each is firmly grounded in its service community (for Cangleska, the \"communi ty\" includes all victims of domestic abuse, for the Boys and Girls Club, the \"community\" includes all tribal youth). This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 17the governance of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, it is nonetheless clear at pres ent that their greater success signals the failing of a generic \"work through the tribal government system\" strategy. In sum, our sense is that the CIRCLE initiative would have bene fited greatly from the adoption of strategies that were more tailored to the participant communities' cultures. There is greater promise of success in this approach, and less pr obability of repeating and reinforcing past failures. On the other hand, we ackno wledge that this it is not an easy course to follow; federal players may find it difficult to work within their institutional and legislativ e constraints to help tribes craft such appropriate strategies, and tribes may lean toward the path of least resistance, which is to return to the procedures and policie s of the past, despite th e probable success of new approaches. However, federal agencies have well-developed roadmaps for instituting funding streams that provide greater flexibility to local ities, including tribes. We again cite not only Local Law Enforcement Block Grants and Byrne discretionary grants, which afford cities and counties substantial discretion in how they are invested, but also the self-governance amendments to Public Law 93-638, which provide subs tantial discretion to tr ibes in how they are invested. As emphasized under Opportunity 1, our poi nt is not that the right funding mechanisms exist at this time, but that there is precedent for them in current government practice. With appropriate legislative changes, the devel opment of corresponding s upport functions within USDOJ, and knowledge about these opportunities in Indian country, similar programs could promote the more effective use of USDOJ res ources for tribal justice system enhancement. Concluding Comments on Context and Strategy Moving forward in the initiation and development of similar coope rative projects between the tribes and USDOJ, we encourage the federal partne rs to fund, and the tribal partners to conduct, a data based needs and capacities assessment a nd to rely on that assessment in planning and strategizing. When strategies emerge from th ese assessments - about where the gaps are and what community resources exist that might e nhance the effectiveness of new or expanded initiatives - the federal partners must take seri ously the differences between tribes and between tribal and federal con ceptions of appropriate activities to fund. One way to do this is for all the partners to do their best to step out side perceived boundaries (hypothetically, \"I'm just a VAWA person, which means there is a relati vely narrow set of activities for which I grant and administer funds,\" or , \"I'm a tribal program director with a lot of experience, and I don't want to ha ve to collaborate with other pr ograms\") to find the \"play\" or negotiating room in their positions that would allo w them to together create the best projects possible. Of course, the process requires both part ies to understand the othe r's situation and goals very well. In order to find this negotiating room, agency personnel should proactively share copies of their legislative mandate s with tribal partners , tribal partners should work to explain their very specific need s and any concerns they have with the funding parameters, and both parties should work together toward a common understanding of the ove rall effort's goals. Another way is to acknowledge and act on the f act that planning and assessment are not simply data-driven, but require the coll ection of many kinds of inform ation. The primary criterion for tribes is: what do we need to know about our community as we develop a strategic plan for moving toward the goals of this initiative? Qualit ative information about the political climate, the contemporary interplay of culture and social be havior, and the state of relations between key criminal justice agencies are just a few impor tant elements of a comprehensive scan. This This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 18process sets the stage for asking hard questions of the full range of partners in the initiative: who can really do what, how quickly, and subject to wh at pressures? A stronger sense of the political challenges tribes face and how they intend to addr ess those challenges might have a variety of results for tribes and funders, all of which suppor t the more effective us e of funds. The funders might work with a range of tech nical assistance providers to cr aft a sound political strategy, they might provide training and support for those local actors entrusted w ith implementing that strategy, or they might in an extreme case reth ink their investment in the site. Many private foundations fund multiple sites in the early stages of si milar initiatives, but limit ongoing investment to only those sites th at show strong evidence of commitment and having crafted a strategic plan that promises significant pr ogress toward the goals of the initiative. Still another option that might help federal and tribal partners escape the tendency toward one- size-fits-all policy (and the cons traints of strict federal guid elines on program funds) is the creation of additional, separate funding streams to support assessment and, later, discretionary aspects of program implementation. With regard to the latter, the examples of Zuni and Oglala Sioux suggest that the sites would have benefited from discretionary funds (however small) to accompany the other resource streams that comprised CIRCLE. The money could have underwritten consciously cultural co mponents, such as staff training in the context of culture at Zuni or grassroots oversight as was desired at OST. Additionally, such funds tend to incentivize creativity, so that even those personnel who tend toward \"safe\" and \"known\" methods are tempted to innovate and search for the strategies that work best in their community. A note on the idea of additional funding streams is th at USDOJ might not have to bear this cost alone. Early in the plans for CIRCLE, there was discussion of working with other departments and agencies of the federal government to gain support for the CIRCLE Project (see, for example, LeClaire 1998). Likewise, during impl ementation, the Zuni partners pushed for the initiative to include an even broader circle of federal players (they specifically suggested the Bureau of Indian Affairs and I ndian Health Service, but there are many other possible federal partners). These ideas were not pursued to the ex tent that they led to the commitment of funds, and they remain an important opportunity for future projects.26 Additionally, the tribal and federal partners could have looked beyond their own coffers to community or private foundations or even to stat e government grant programs.27 26 Realistically, it may not be possible to pursue this opportunity to its fullest extent without additional legislation in support of inter-departmental collaboration. Fortunately, there is a precedent for such legislation. Public Law 102- 477, the Indian Employment, Training and Related Services Demonstration Act of 1992 , gives tribal governments the opportunity to integrate the employment, training, and rela ted services (such as child care) they operate, even if these services are funded by different federal agencies. In tegration allows tribes to operate the programs under a single plan, single budget, and single reporting system and, theoretically, promotes a focus on tribal (and client) needs rather than distant federal agencies' priorities. Th e federal departments whose programs may be integrated under P.L. 102-447 are the Department of Education, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of the Interior, and Department of Labor.

Opportunity 4: Introduce a Focus on Sustainability from the Start For the purposes of this evaluation, we think it is useful to define sust ainability in two ways. First, those changes in institut ional and system design and opera tion that are most able to weather fiscal, political, and othe r challenges over an ex tended period of time may be defined as \"sustainable.\" Sustainable change may arise from investments in infras tructure, training, and technology, but more precise identi fication of the contributing fact ors also necessitates, as we suggest under Opportunity 3, careful consideration of the local c ontext. Guiding questions must be: given this particular cultura l, social, and political setting, do investments in (for example) institutional re-design, government structures, staff development, or technology make sense as a means of promoting project sustainability? What makes programs live on in this nation? Second, sustainability is related to the specific investme nts that maximize local actors' effectiveness both during and after the period for which the initiative is funded. The tr ibal CIRCLE partners are managing change within and across sectors in complicated political, cultural, and social settings, with limited resources. What kinds of support and professional development opportunities will optimize their performance over time? Sustainability and Context At the final CIRCLE Project cluster conference, the answers federal part ners suggested to the question of \"What makes a program sustainabl e?\" included technology (such as management information systems), infrastructure (such as jails and police equipment), the ability to win competitive grants, and tribal government fundi ng. These answers are not without merit. For example, installed technology an d built infrastructure (provi ded they are not unreasonably expensive to operate and maintain and do no t quickly become obsolete) support project sustainability because the technology or physical infrastructure itself lives on. Competitive grant funding is a better alternative th an no funding. And ultimately, it does behoove tribes to find the means to support core governmental institut ions (which CIRCLE worked to strengthen). However, these answers also have tended to be ri sky in Indian country, mo st especially when the local context has not been a factor in strategy planning and design. Take, for instance, automated case management and reporting systems, which could play a key role in su stainability. In Indian country, underreporting of crime has been a long-term problem , and it occurs on multiple levels - between community members and police depa rtments and between local departments and federal agencies. At the second leve l, several problems relevant to this discussion contribute to underreporting, including staff shor tages, limited data-collection capacities, competing federal and local priorities, and problems with depart ment administration and management (Wakeling et al. 2001). In a prior study, members of the current research team report tribal managers pointing out boxes of high-end computers and explaining th at they welcomed sophisticated computer hardware but that their staff was not trained to use it. They also reported that many of these local managers consider reporting crime statistics a burdensome obligation with little apparent payoff. This suggests a series of questions regarding loca l context that serve as criteria for determining whether an investment in technology repres ents an investment in sustainability: Foundation; they gave an inflation-adjusted total of $246.6 million (1999 dollars) to Native American causes and concerns (Brimley and Jorgensen 2001).

Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 20 What important information can this syst em provide local actors that will help them better deploy their limited resources? What kind of investment in staff training will be necessary to ensure that the system is used as designed? Does the system make critical info rmation about program performance and community-level outcomes available to mana gers and system stakeholders on an ongoing basis? Is the information the system provide s valuable to local stakeholders? The point is that sustainability is a link in the chain that already includ es planning, assessment, and the importance of the local context. In addition to de termining community needs and resources, assessment must determine what ma kes programs live on in the participant nations. The CIRCLE sites provide several examples of how local culture, po litical conditions, and prevailing attitudes - that is, contextual variables - may link to sustainability:28 Oglala Sioux Tribe. As noted throughout this report , projects tend to live longer at OST when their managers receive, react to, and feel bound by \"community\" input and involvement.29 The CIRCLE Coordinator from Oglala Sioux underscored this fact by bringing two community members with long-time interests in justice issues to the final cluster conference. A s econd factor in sustai nability at OST is \"distance\" from the central tribal govern ment, which many citizens feel is an illegitimate government. Since USDOJ funds CIRCLE through this government, this distance is lacking, and staff hi red as a result of CIRCLE (and sometimes even those simply cooperating with CI RCLE, but who have other sources of funding) must fight against the perception that they ar e working for the tribal government only to receive a paycheck, as opposed to working for positive system change.30 Northern Cheyenne Tribe. The CIRCLE Project steering committee included a set of institutional actors, and in many instances a set of individuals, that had worked together on previous similar projects; th eir ongoing involvement helped keep the 28 Further information about wh at might promote sustainability at each of the sites should emerge from Phase II of the CIRCLE Project evaluation, which focuses on outcomes. 29 As suggested in an earlier footnote, including \"co mmunity\" essentially means including grassroots voices. Depending on the project, the specific community voice may vary: for Canglesk a, the supporting community is their pool of current, former, and even pros pective clients and those clients' mo ral supporters; for Oyate Iwicakiyapi Okolakiciye (OOIO, or the Society to Strengthen /Defend the People and Families) \"community\" includes representatives of the lay population with interests in and commitments to children's and family issues. Whatever the precise definition of \"community,\" the notion is that programs survive when there is significant horizontal input from non-governmental actors. 30 An important side question emerges from this example: what does an appropriate \"government-to-government relationship\" look like in this setting? Can the federal government find a more legitimate institution within the nation to establish a relationship with for work such as CIRCLE? This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 21focus on improving the opportunities for and treatment of youth in the community and continuing the change process.31 An additional opportunity for CIRCLE sustainability that has not been exploited is the effort tribal o fficials are making to give credence to recent constitutional and statutory changes in support of a separation of powers between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government; tribal officials are particular ly focused on the promotion of judicial independence. This justice issue, not CIRCLE, has been on the minds of many key governmental actors during the pe riod of Project implementation. Recognizing this \"distracti on\" and finding a way to lin k CIRCLE to it (perhaps by actively defining both efforts as \"strengthening the Northern Cheyenne justice system\" or as \"judicial na tion building\") from the outse t may have increased the Project's sustainability potential. Pueblo of Zuni. At the time CIRCLE was proposed, there was a strong sense of frustration among actors in the criminal justice system that they did not adequately share information about offende rs. There was also recognition that this was not simply a problem of arrest a nd prosecution, but of service delivery; offenders, their immediate and extended families, and their victims were not being adequately served by the justice and social services systems because of inadequate information sharing. To the extent that CIRCLE has been able to relieve this frustration th rough the development of Fu ll Court (the Pueblo's automated case management system), it has helped ensure its longevity - the advantages CIRCLE partners receive from Full Court help keep them committed to CIRCLE's processes (greater collabo ration) and goals (b etter service and, eventually, crime and violence prevention). In sum, generic means of promoting sustaina bility include, among other things, supportive political institutions, the formalization of ad ministrative structures, information technology, human capital, community knowledge and support, connections to other funding sources (within the tribe, foundation community, or other federa l agencies), and the support of particular individuals within the nations - but the specific ingredients vary from site to site. When conducting initial assessments and making determ inations about the c ontextual sources of sustainability, keeping a general list like th is in mind helps get to the answers faster. Define and Plan for Sustainability from the Outset The critical opportunity to address this collecti on of issues arises earl y in the design of an initiative - during the period devoted to planning and assessment and before major investments are made in institutional design, governance st ructures, training progr ams, and management information systems. Yet the focus of the final CIRCLE cluster conference was sustainability. On the one hand, this concentrat ion was inevitable, as the know n three-year federal funding 31 It should be noted that a stable team of individuals, rather than a stable team of institutions (as at Northern Cheyenne) is more likely to have certain negative aspects - for example, a stable team of individuals may carry \"baggage\" from previous interactions that makes it difficult to continue to work fruitfully together or be committed to some standard operating procedures that stand in the way of innovation, whereas new team members may inject a new sense of purpose and have more energy.

Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 22commitment to the CIRCLE program was coming to an end. On the other hand, the focus was out of place, as it came too late in the in itiative's planning and implementation process. Certainly, we were not privy to all conversations between CIRC LE site coordinators, federal partners, and tribal partners, so we cannot know how often they disc ussed sustainability at earlier points. But our site research a nd discussions with federal offici als nonetheless suggest that until the January 2002 cluster meeting, su stainability - and, more importa ntly, the contextual factors that determine sustainability - wa s on few players' radar screens. Instead, the federal and tribal pa rtners should have been asking themselves questions such as these from the start: what specific lessons about change and sustainability have we learned from previous efforts in Indian country?32 In the three years for which we have resources, what can be accomplished at each site that will keep this pro cess going? If this is really going to take 10 (or 20) years, what meaningful steps can we take in the first three years to get the process going? What other partners can we l ook to in order to support the process (with money, technical assistance, leadership training, institutional design he lp, etc.) beyond the three-year period? As these questions imply, addressing sustainability from the outset also implies being realistic about time horizons. Because there may be more basic work to do in Indian communities (including the need to address the intertwine d tasks of nation and institution building) and because the problems may be harder or more comp licated or more entrenched (because of the history of dependency and the long-standing negativ e effects of assimilation policies), change of the sort sought by CIRCLE takes a long time. The Pueblo of Zuni, where substantial progress on each facet of implementation goals has been made, provides an instructive example. The tribal partners' response to the question of \"how can you generate change?\" is, \"With time - it takes a long time.\" For instance, Zuni representatives ha ve been concerned that the federal partners' near-term expectations for reduced offending mi ght be unrealistic. They feel that reduced offending is significantly dependent on the Pueblo's ability to hold offenders' accountable and to provide appropriate correc tional services, and to a very real degree, this will not be possible until 2005, when the Pueblo's new correctional facility will be completed. In other words, even in a setting where the players do not ex perience some of the same diff iculties as are present at the other sites (the Zuni project benefits from pos itive tribal-federal rela tions, a stable tribal government, significant technologi cal capability, engaged tribal staff, interested community members, few or no other \"big issues\" in tribal justice to divert atte ntion from the goals of CIRCLE, etc.), the sense is that change is inevitably a long road. The issue of time and system change is certainly not confined to the federal-tribal context. As noted, grantmakers from private foundations are in creasingly recognizing that the standard three- year funding cycle is not tied in any logical way to the reality of institutional and system change - inside Indian country or without. Nor is the le ngthening time span for system change merely a private foundation phenomenon. Acknowledging the challenges in system change and the importance of not abandoning promising efforts befo re they can take root , the California State 32 We have noted a number of foregoing federal efforts. There also have been foundation efforts; for example, the Annie E. Casey Foundation has invested in \"New Futures\" at Fort Peck and in an initiative at OST. These efforts should be taken into account in this information sweep as well. This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 23Department of Health and Human Services recently gave seven p ilot counties seven years during which to undertake social servi ce system change (Gardner 2000). Strengthen Local Capacity Through More and Better Technical Assistance One of the federal commitments to CIRCLE was that the federal partners would facilitate greater access for the tribes to technical as sistance (TA) from the U.S. Depa rtment of Justice. This is a laudable policy - it recognizes th e importance of technical assi stance and provides a means for increasing participating tribes' acce ss to it. Yet it pays to be cl ear exactly what TA is important for. Our short answer, and the reason we address the issue at this point, is that high quality TA promotes both types of project sustainability, an d thereby increases the odds that a project will result in system change. At the very least, TA leaves behind human capita l, data, or procedural tools; even if a program or ini tiative withers afte r the withdrawal of exte rnal funding, these are bases on which an individual or community can late r build. At best, TA promotes the creation of sufficient capacity for the initiativ e to carry on and meet its goals. Across the sites, CIRCLE program directors and staff who rece ived on-site, program-specific technical assistance told us how much they lear ned from and enjoyed the trainings and other TA opportunities provided through CIRCLE.33 Unfortunately, they also reported that there was too little TA, that the time gap between the reque st for and provision of TA was too large,34 and that the TA needed was not always available through USDOJ programs (a related complaint was that some available TA was too generic and therefore ina pplicable to specific tribal situations). None of these points are surprising, and they largely ar ise from the fact that CIRCLE did not include a separate funding stream for technical assistance. Instead, federal program pa rtners were asked to help identify technical assistance from within the Department for which the tribal CIRCLE programs were eligible.35 Moving forward, this implies a need for more and better TA.36 Intriguingly, providing better TA may provide the means for offering more TA. The key is recognizing the TA-increasing impl ications of two facts: 1) th at good technical assistance can 33 In fact, the only negative feedback we received on the substance of USDOJ-prov ided technical assistance concerned the strategic planning assistance provided at th e initial CIRCLE meeting in Rapid City. Tribal representa- tives felt that the assistance was too gene ral and did not meet them where they were; this is not surprising, given the identified need for tribe-specific assessment and strategic planning. If th ere had been three trainers, each working with partners from a single site, the feedback might have been quite different. Additionally, we note that our under- standing of \"technical assistance\" does no t extend to presentations at the clus ter meetings; while many prospective technical assistance providers attended these meetings, giving a talk differs substantially from working side-by-side with program directors and staff on their particular planning, implementation, training, and technology concerns. 34 In several cases, nearly a year elapsed be tween the request for TA and its delivery. 35 It should be noted that this administrative arrangement al so increased the difficulty of the federal partners' jobs. 36 We can provide only a general list of the areas in which more and better TA would have been valuable to the tribal partners (see the paragraph later in this section that begins, \"Shifting the funding focus...\"). Thus, we recommend some exercises for identifying where TA can be useful. First, we recommend a review of the \"lessons learned\" from similar comprehensive justice system initia tives in Indian Country. Second, we recommend a similar review for comprehensive community initiatives generally. Finally, we believe that regular and frequent polling of participants (via debriefs, agenda items at meetings on \"improvables,\" and other survey methods) will suggest potential TA topics. Providing highly competent, neutral fac ilitators for meetings at the site and cross-site level ensures that this information is collected in a way that minimizes conflict and draws out participants' best thinking. This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 24reduce or even replace the need to monitor co mpliance; and 2) that programs, meetings, and other already-funded events offe r opportunities for peer TA. These points are covered in turn. Many non-federal government funders (especially foundation actors) have made, or are making, a gradual shift away from intens ive monitoring and toward inte nsive, well-rounded technical assistance.37 There are several reasons for this shift. One is that good TA - TA that is targeted at specific site needs and addresses problems in a way that is useful to implementers - provides essentially the same information as monitoring . In other words, if grantmakers are actively involved in the TA process, TA becomes a \"t wofer\" and makes for a better use of funds.38 A second reason for the shift is that it corresponds better with the idea of \"partnership.\" Joint involvement in TA would create situations in which the federal government and tribes truly partnered in problem solving, where by contrast , monitoring visits leave the impression that federal actors are interested only in overseeing tribal efforts. Indeed, tribal CIRCLE partners expressed a desire for more benefit for them to em erge from such visits; this would be possible if the federal government players shifte d to a more actively advisory role. Shifting the funding focus away from monitoring creates budgetary maneuvering room for the purchase of more TA. Critically, this should include training and assistance in addition to USDOJ's offerings. Reports from the tribal part ners and our own observations suggest that the CIRCLE coordinators, steering committees, partner program directors, and/or partner program staff may have benefited from t echnical assistance on a wide vari ety of topics, although many of these extend beyond USDOJ's traditional areas of expertise. For example, USDOJ fruitfully provided training in community policing and to court-appointed special advocates and technology assessment TA, but trib al-level implementers' needs ex tended to TA on evaluation, nation building and institu tion building (including issues of cultural match), strategic planning, political communication and strategy, leadership development, incorporating community in decision making, and financial mana gement and budgeting, among others. A second option for increasing the quantity and range of TA offerings is to use already- scheduled meetings and events as TA opportunities. On the one hand, USDOJ already recognizes this point; it brought representative s to the cluster meetings who we re able to explain TA options within the Department and how to access to them . On the other hand, these representatives did not offer training itself at the meetings, nor did USDOJ take advantage of tribal skills and resources brought together by the cl uster meetings. The latter point deserves emphasis: most of the tribal participants had ski lls, knowledge, and information that would have been valuable to share with the others (either all of the others, or in a direct peer-to-peer way). For example, the OST Coordinator has a background in community organization and could have capably taught a short course for the other coordinators and program staff. The observation about tribal talent is reinforced by the feedback we received from tr ibal partners about the cluster meetings - their primary concern was that they di d not get to use these meetings to learn from one another. 37 For example, the Annie E. Casey Fo undation's \"Technical Assistance Re source Center\" is a major investment intended to complement its \"Making Connections\" initiative (a neighborhood transformation and family development project). See <www. aecf.org/tarc/> and <www.aecf.or g/initiatives/ntfd/ making.htm>. 38 Questions about compliance that are not answered during TA sessions could be the focus of written reports from the grantee to the grantor; again, this is a method typically used by foundations.

Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 25Despite inter-tribal learning bei ng a goal of CIRCLE, this opportun ity for inter-tribal learning was missed, and with it, the opportunity to pr ovide valuable, relevant, and needed TA.39 Invest in Local Actors Cross-site study underlines the importance of quali ty local leadership to the effectiveness and sustainability of the CIRCLE initiative. The site coor dinators appear to be particularly important local leaders. The coordinators have played a key role in matching federal funding streams with local needs (that is, in strategy design and implem entation). They have served as a vital point of communication between tribal and federal partners and, more gene rally, as the mediator between two sovereigns, struggling to fuse the nations ' competing priorities and demands. Lacking alignment with specific local institutions, they have been able to function as real change agents, promoting reforms and innovations that are good for their tribal justice systems (as opposed to benefiting a particular department or agency only). In the absen ce of administrative oversight of newly created justice system positions, they have provided employees with necessary supervision. They have comm unicated the ideas of CIRCLE to community and government audiences and worked to gain pol itical support and authority for their tribes' CIRCLE strategies. Finally, they often provided sp ecific, detailed support and troubles hooting assistance to partner programs and their personnel. When we asked ques tions at the sites about sustainability, the answer we invariably heard was that sustainability depended on the Project's coordinators (the role, not necessarily the person), in that the coordinators promoted an overall vision for the Project within the community and helped ensure th at the entire effort continued to move forward. This finding argues that investment s that increase the site coordina tors' capacity to do their jobs well are likewise investments in sustainability. The authors of future initiatives should consider providing these local leaders w ith the following types of support and capacity enhancements: Capacity to maximize efficiency. The CIRCLE coordinators' most common complaint about their jobs was the amount of detail work they were required to do, both for federal reporting purposes a nd for partner program management. These demands meant they too often gave sh ort shrift to \"big picture\" tasks such as political communication, planning, comm unity interaction, building a team of core supporters who shared similar system change ideas, and assessing strategic progress. Providing administrative a ssistance and technological support are straightforward ways to redress this imba lance and shift the c oordinators' day-to- day focus from grant management to strategy. Training and learning opportunities. While each of the CIRCLE coordinators had a unique set of skills that was useful to the job, each could have benefited nonetheless from training and learning opportunities aimed at improving their effectiveness in the coordi nator role. Every effort s hould be made to provide coordinators of future programs with (f or example) strategic planning and plan 39 The literature on peer TA provides additional evidence of this point. See, for example, Center for the Study of Social Policy (1998). This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 26implementation skills, political co mmunication and negotiation skills,40 financial planning and analysis and budge ting skills, public outreach skills, and facilitation skills. Peer TA may provide a particular ly fruitful training opportunity, as peers would understand exactly what kinds of challenges the coordinators face, and might even be able to offer training that others would not be able to - such as \"training\" in the patience and courag e that it takes to see change through. Rest, regeneration, and recognition. People perform better when they can approach their jobs with energy, exc itement, and a sense of worth. Given the demands on the CIRCLE coordinators to spearhead change, promote the idea in a sometimes unreceptive climate, and manage the many details associated with system change, these \"three R's\" may be especially important for them. Building in funds for the coordinators to have lunc h with or enjoy recreation activities with their local and federal partners, providi ng opportunities for peer interaction during cluster meetings and site visits, and gi ving the coordinators ' kudos at local and national events are a few examples of what might be done to serve these purposes. Certainly, evidence from the site s suggests that the coordinators are not the only local leaders able to affect the progress and sustainability of CIRCLE - they may be the most critical on-the- ground leaders, but they are not the only ones. Across th e sites, champions for system change were, variously, members of the executive branch, partner (and non-partner) program administrators, site-based federal employees , influential citizens, and tribal college representatives. Using the mechanisms listed above to support this broader array of local leaders builds additional local leadership capacity in support of sustained system change. A Final Note on Funding Technical Assistance Though we describe opportunities for increasi ng and enhancing TA that maximize current resources (ranging from rethinking monitoring functions to using the accumulated expertise and experience of site coor dinators), we acknowledge that the mo re ambitious technical assistance agenda we propose will require at least some new funding. Engaging a wi der range of funders, especially private funders, might be one means of increasing the resour ces for TA. Increased federal funding might require the means mentioned a bove - block grants or the extension of self- governance compacting authority to the U.S. Department of Jus tice. While these new programs would require legislative support, they would be built on extensive federal practice and policy . Summary and Conclusion We conclude that CIRCLE was a productive inve stment of the efforts and resources of the participating federal and tribal partners. CI RCLE generated valuable new knowledge about the strategic importance of addressing crime problem s through system-level (as opposed to program- level) thinking, the promise of federal cros s-agency (and, potentially, cross-department) cooperation and coordination as a means of incr easing the value of federal investments in 40 All of the coordinators related stor ies of the difficulties they had had in keeping the political commitment to the Project going, and yet, change is difficult to sustai n without the buy-in of at least some political leaders.

Of equal importance, CIRCLE produced tangible progress in the process of justice system strengthening at each of the tribal sites: It enabled the Pueblo of Zuni to make substantial progress toward the development of a functioning criminal justice system by: (1) strengthening the performance of constituent agencies (domestic violence service providers, the police department, corrections, etc.); (2 ) building a sophisticated management information system capable of providing timely information on the performance of individual agencies and the system as a whole and, eventu ally, on the overall justice system's ability to assist the tribe in addressing difficult social and criminal problems; and (3) developing a th eory of change (or logic model) that has helped the tribe craft a strategic approach to \"break ing the cycle of violence.\" It has helped a set of key Northern Cheyenne leaders and community members consider the importance of developing a tribal Department of Justice; it has allowed the creation and expansion of progr ams that support a better tribal court (probation programs, victims assistance pr ograms, court clerk positions, etc.); and it has enabled an ongoing focus on the pr oblems of the nation's youth and the development of a youth rehabilitation cen ter to complement other youth outreach efforts. It has provided citizens of the Oglala Sioux nation an opportunity to identify how their culture and other important features of the local context should influence the design of their criminal justice institutions . This has, in turn, provided reformers with a framework for rethinking the design of current institutions and agencies charged with addressing crime and crime-related problems. We identify four opportunities fo r increasing the impact of simila r initiatives in the future: First, we recommend building on the fede ral partners' efforts to support CIRCLE through the development of mechanisms that: (1) increase coordination and communication across federal agencies and between federal agencies and tribes, and (2) streamline the funding process fo r tribes seeking to strengthen the performance of their justice systems. In essence, this kind of arrangement exchanges increased flexibility in term s of funding and program mandates for strong commitments to system change and performance accountability - it provides an incentive for strategic thi nking. Formalizing the CIRCLE working group - and, over time, vesting it with in creased authority a nd resources - could be an effective means of institutionalizing this incentive structure and capturing and preserving the learning gained in such comprehensive initiatives. Second, we recommend strengthening the focus on nation building as the conceptual framework for planning and implementing similar initiatives. We assert that the federal government and tribes must work harder to share the \"tribes as nations\" frame of reference. If tribes ' nationhood is a consistent focus in the work, federal and tribal representatives ma y find more fruitful ways to negotiate This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 28and compromise, and tribes may gain in creased control of their futures by exercising greater choice over the type of funding they accept and programs they develop. An important consideration fo r tribes is that the nation-building perspective obligates them to think mo re strategically about the role grant opportunities play in the pr ocess of nation building. Third, our review of the re lative starting and ending point s for each of the tribes strongly suggests investing increased re sources in assessment and planning. The most tangible payoff will be improved institutional and system performance. We emphasize the role of cultural match in en suring effective, sustainable institutions: research shows that institutions that are sensitive to the local context and incorporate culture in their design are not only better performi ng but also better able to leverage a wide range of valu able, informal community resources in addressing local social problems. This is particularly important in Indian country, where the mechanisms for maintaining so cial order and reso lving conflicts are often embedded in custom , culture, and tradition. Finally, we draw attention to the importa nce of considering sustainability in the design and implementation of future initia tives. This is much more than asking where the money will come from after the current funding cycle ends (though we emphasize that a consistent finding from related initiatives is that fundamental system change requires more than the t ypical three-year investment, which is, after all, an arbitrary desi gnation). We point, in particul ar, to the value of high quality technical assistance in building lo cal capacity and to the importance of investing in the development (and maintena nce) of the local executive leadership these initiatives depend on to champion and manage change. Taken together, the accomplishments at each of the sites and th e valuable new knowledge about system change in Indian country produced by the CIRCLE initiative point to the importance of getting the foundations righ t. At Oglala Sioux, this is dem onstrated in the tribal partners' improved understanding of the kind of institutional de sign that might work best in their particular tribal context; at Northern Cheyenne, this is de monstrated in the partne rs' appreciation of the essential functions of a tribal Department of Jus tice; and at Zuni, this is demonstrated in the CIRCLE Project's success at shapi ng a set of tribal justice instit utions into a system with the capacity to make progress on a range of pressing social and crime problems. These are all substantial initial accomplishments, but we also recognize that this is a midstream perspective. The next challenge for existing stakeholders in this effort - both federal and tribal - will be to make the right investment in strength ening and building on these foundations.

The clear implication of this approach at the tribal le vel is the tribal partners' opport unity (and responsibility) to help design and guide the evaluation. But there are other implications of a participatory approach as well, some of the most important of which stem from the Project's focus on partnerships. For example, the federal-tribal partnership in CIRCLE implies that the federal partners also ought to have opportunities to help guide the tribal site eval uations (which they did through the CIRCLE Project Evaluation Subcommittee). And it implies that both the tribal and federal partners have a responsibility for making CIRCLE work, a responsibility that, in a participatory evaluation framework, exposes the federal partners' agencies and processes to the same scrutiny as the tribes'. The solicitation for the CIRCLE Project evaluation made it clear that federal CIRCLE Project designers both realized and expected this; it called fo r an evaluation that, among other things, focused on \"the developm ent of the CIRCLE Project in th e U.S. Department of Justice including the streamlined appli cation, reporting, and monitoring pr ocesses and the assessment of these processes by the three CIRCLE Project site s\" (National Institute of Justice 2000, p. 4). Federal level process analysis has at least two im portant benefits. For one, it helps ensure tribal participation in evaluation activities. Tribal partne rs consistently cited the evaluation of federal partners as one of the things they liked best about the CIRCLE evaluation and as a motivator for their own participation. They recognized the connections between a federal process evaluation and true federal-tribal partners hip and, thus, saw the federal pr ocess evaluation as supportive of the government-to-government relationship. Along th ese same lines, they noted that federal process analysis demonstrated the U.S. Depart ment of Justice's understanding that changes at both the tribal and federal levels might be necessary to make the Project successful. Indeed, this is the second benefit: the analysis clarifies the kind of adjustments that might improve the Department's future efforts. This paper presents the federal process analys is. It describes the development of the CIRCLE Project within the U.S. Department of Justice (USDOJ) by explaining th e context in which the Project arose, the genesis of the specific idea, th e development of a manage ment structure within USDOJ for this comprehensive effort, the selection of participant tribes, the Project's \"kick-off,\" and the roles of the various federal partner, quasi-partner, and non-partner offices, bureaus, and agencies during Project implementation. The pa per concludes with a preliminary assessment41 of the U.S. Department of Justice's relative succes s in meeting the goals it set for the Project. 41 The CIRCLE Project evaluation is intended to have two phases, an earlier, 18-month process evaluation phase and a later, 30-month outcome evaluation phase. This paper is a part of the first phase, and in that sense, nearly all of its assessments are \"preliminary,\" since the evaluation as a w hole is not complete. But evaluative statements that have to do with Project outcomes or other types of long-term change are \"preliminary\" in another sense as well - they are more or less unobservable in this early phase.

Concept Development: CIRCLE's Or igins, Goals, and Final Form Genesis of the Idea During the 1990s, the U.S. Department of Jus tice began an important shift in its policy involvement in Indian Country. Historically, the Department's role was narrow - its personnel engaged with Indian Country primarily through th e investigation and prosecution of crime. But as the inadequacy of law enforcement and justi ce services to address contemporary problems in Indian Country became increasingly apparent, US DOJ expanded its involvement and worked to augment the core justice services provided by the Department of the Interior Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Divisions of Trib al Government Services and of Law Enforcement Services. For example, in 1995 USDOJ funded the Tribal St rategies Against Violence Program (TSAV), a tribal-federal partnership desi gned to empower tribal communiti es through the development and implementation of a comprehensive reservation- wide strategy to reduce crime, violence, and substance abuse. USDOJ launched the Indian Country Justice Initiative (ICJI) in 1995 and worked with two Indian nations , the Northern Cheyenne Tribe and the Pueblo of Laguna, on a pilot effort to streamline USDOJ's support for Indian Country. In 1996-97, representatives from USDOJ worked together with colleagues from the Department of the Interior Bureau of Indian Affairs and select tribal leaders on the \"Executive Committee for Indian Country Law Enforcement Improvements,\" in an effort to an alyze and propose responses to tribes' pressing crime and justice concerns. In 1998, the U.S. Departments of Justice and Interior jointly committed to increasing resources for tribal pu blic safety through the Indian Country Law Enforcement Improvements Initiative (ICLEII).42 The Comprehensive Indian Resources for Comm unity and Law Enforcement (CIRCLE) Project is a companion to and outgrowth of these effort s (although it is probably mo st closely associated with the ICLEII). The specific idea for a new comprehensive program emerged after Attorney General Janet Reno visited the Wind River Reservation in Wyom ing in July 1998. The idea was detailed in an October 29, 1998 memo from the Dir ector of the Office of Tr ibal Justice (OTJ) to the Attorney General entitled \"Concentrated and Coordinated USDOJ Programs on Selected Indian Reservations\" (LeClaire 1998). After discu ssions with staff from a variety of divisions, programs, offices, and agencies within USDOJ , the Associate Attorney General recommended the approval of the CIRCLE Project in November 1998. The Goals, Guiding Principles, and Innovations of the CIRCLE Project The proposal memo for CIRCLE lists three sp ecific objectives/goals for the Project: \"Accelerate and coordinate USDOJ programs and grants at CIRCLE demonstration sites to guide general im plementation of the Indian Country Law Enforcement Initiative \"Promote the inter-tribal exchange of id eas and experiences in law enforcement, community development, and federal-tribal relations 42 This history is reviewed in greater detail in B aca (2001) and in Office of Justice Programs (1997). This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 31 \"Develop a comprehensive planning and development process for safe and healthy tribal communities\" (LeClaire 1998, pp. 1-2) These goals were intended to reflect USDOJ's unde rstanding that \"the most effective solutions to the problems faced by tribal communities are likely to come from within the communities themselves, rather than being imposed by the Fede ral Government, and [that] the problems to be addressed require a comprehensive approach that incorporates coordinated and multidisciplinary efforts\" (Baca 2001, p. 10; see also, National Institute of Justice 2000, p.3). During evaluation interviews conducted in the latter half of CIRCLE implementation, USDOJ staff noted several additional, less explicit goals for the CIRCLE Project. To a large extent, these reflect the same commitment to and appreciation of tribally driven solutions and comprehensive programs that the goals listed in the Project pr oposal memo do. Yet they also reveal a strong pragmatic strain in the federal pa rtners' hopes for and exp ectations of CIRCLE. The supplementary goals USDOJ staff (almost all of wh om were directly involv ed in grantmaking or policymaking for the CIRCLE Project) discussed were: To address (or at least draw attention to) the baseline roadblock that tribes have in developing comprehensive programs - serious gaps in their criminal justice systems. Unlike states and municipa lities, tribes have not had the opportunity to build up their modern justice systems over a relatively long time span. Their traditional systems were suppressed or eliminated by colonizers, and it is only since the mid-1970s that tribes have been able to reconstitute justice systems under their own control: se lf-determination and self -governance policies gave them the option to develop more full-bod ied court systems and to manage law enforcement and other justice-related programs once administered by the BIA. This is an ongoing process, and thus, it is generally the case that contemporary tribal justice systems are \"less complete\" than their non-tribal counterparts. Also, most tribes lack the financial wherewithal to augment grant funds; their tax bases are severely constrained by comparison to st ates and municipalities, and relatively few tribes have signif icant alternative source s of government revenue.43 This constraint results in \"here today, gone tomorrow\" programs (as grant funds run out and cannot be replaced from tribal co ffers), an ever-changing array of system components (a tribe might win funds for a probation officer in one year and for a victims advocate in the next), and strange intra-program funding deficits (a tribe might have funding for a police officer but not for that officer's uniforms). Comprehensive initiatives aim to attack related problems from multiple perspec-tives; this is difficult enough in settings where the partnering programs are well established. Implementing a comprehensive strategy is that much more difficult in settings - like Indian country - where pr ograms must be created or strengthened before real partnership is possible and where there is no guarantee that present partners will remain in existence even in the short run. 43 Despite the income some tribes have from gaming, only a few have profited significantly (U.S. General Accounting Office 1997) and even for them, gaps in jus tice system institutions, programs, and infrastructure are only one of many demands on government revenue (see, for example, Cornell et al. 1998, especially pp. 60-72).

Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 32 To highlight the need for additional and more consistent resources for tribal law enforcement projects (and to remedy the probl em, at least for a little while, for the three participating tribes). As noted above, tribal ju stice systems suffer from limited and inconsistent funding. The Indi an Country Law Enforcement Improve- ments Initiative provided additional resources to several USDOJ programs as a means of increasing the funds available to Indian Country, and yet, internal questions persisted about why the programs serving Indian Country received extra funds. Thus, demonstrating the real need for additional money for Indian Country and justifying these internal allocations was another Pr oject goal. Proponents of CIRCLE also realized that the Depart ment's usual categorical and piecemeal approach to grantmaking contributed to tribes' problems with limited and incon- sistent resources, and they hoped that CI RCLE would address these problems for at least a little while. (Of course, th e financial resources used for CIRCLE are themselves subject to the Congressional ap propriations process, so the agencies participating in CIRCLE could, at best, o ffer a partial solution: they could only guarantee that, if the tribes abided by the rules of the annual application process, they would, for a few years, receive a portion of the agencies' funds.) To foster true strategic planning and to increase the partnership between tribes and USDOJ . When a tribal nation can work cooperatively with the federal government on a particular issue on an ongoi ng basis, and with guarantees that the funding for the programs in place will conti nue, it is possible to move from short- term crisis-driven \"planning\" to true strategi c planning. Indeed, th is is one benefit of the contractual relationships developed between tribes and th e Bureau of Indian Affairs and Indian Health Servic e (IHS) under P.L. 93-638. A longer-term relationship also promotes a sense of partnership. By contrast, USDOJ's usual piecemeal grant process discourages strategic and comprehensive planning and limits feelings of joint purpose. Supportive staff with in USDOJ expressed hope that, with its longer-than-usual time span, CIRCLE would improve the chances for real strategic planning and increase the sense of partnership between USDOJ grantmakers and tribal leaders, ad ministrators, and program managers. Whether or not CIRCLE met these sets of goals is an important consideration in assessing the CIRCLE Project's overall success, and is a topic that is addressed at the conclusion of this paper. Brief Description of the Resultant Project The sections that follow give greater detail about how the U.S. Department of Justice built on these plans and goals. Yet it is useful at the outs et to present a brief outline of the program that emerged: currently under implementation at the No rthern Cheyenne Tribe, Oglala Sioux Tribe, and Zuni Pueblo, the Comprehensive Indian Resources for Community and Law Enforcement Project creates a funding collaboration at the fede ral level between six offi ces and bur eaus within the Office of Justice Programs (t he Corrections Program Office, 44 Violence Against Women Office, Office for Victims of Crime, Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, 44 By the time of this report's release, the Corrections Program Office had been dismantled, and its functions subsumed under the USDOJ Bureau of Justice Assistance.

Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 33Bureau of Justice Assistance, and the National Institute of Justice) and the Community Oriented Policing Services Office (COPS). The collabor ation does not commit new funds to Indian Country; rather, it works to streamline the federa l funding process by whic h tribes receive money for corrections programs, domestic violence, vict im services, youth services, tribal courts, and law enforcement and encourages Indian nation s to develop a single st rategy for using these funds. Other, non-grantmaking offices and agen cies of the U.S. Department of Justice participated in the Project to varying degrees. For example, the Office of Justice Programs (OJP) American Indian and Alaska Native Affair s Desk (AIAND) had a prominent role in spearheading Project development and coordinati ng Project implementation; the Office of the Assistant Attorney General authorized the releas e of resources to the participating tribes; the Office of Tribal Justice provide d critical management guidance; and the USDOJ Office of the Comptroller offered key advice and technical assistance. As noted, the hope is that CIRCLE, not only thr ough its focus on effective planning at the tribal level but also through the federa l funders' collaboration in suppor t of comprehensive strategies, will enable tribal communities to develop programs that are better able to combat the interlinked community problems of crime, violence, substa nce abuse, and juvenile delinquency. The fact that CIRCLE is designed to explore the benefits of more integrated federal funding for tribal justice programs is a critical distinguishing elemen t of this Project from its predecessors (such as ICJI, tribal Weed and Seed, a nd TSAV). Other initiatives have focused tribes on comprehensive planning, but the collaboration between the se ven USDOJ units participating in CIRCLE is innovative and unique in the Department's history of involvement with tribes. II. Developing a Federal Oversight a nd Management Structure for CIRCLE Creating an Administrative Structure for Grantmaking from Multiple Programs The first challenge CIRCLE's developers faced was determining where to \"site\" oversight and management of the Project within the U.S. Depa rtment of Justice. On the one hand, OJP was a logical choice since CIRCLE was a grant progra m and OJP's offices and bureaus likely would make most of the grants that comprised the program. On the other hand, some Project proponents were reluctant to place CIRCLE within OJP b ecause of their concer n that truly innovative programs were the only way to better support trib es and their impressi on that OJP was not a fostering environment for innovative grant prog rams; indeed, one of the more innovative and successful grant programs in Indian Country, COPS, was placed outside OJP specifically to avoid its bureaucracy.45 There were discussions about locating the Project elsewhere, such as in the Criminal Division, but pressure from the A ttorney General to move forward meant that a decision and action were required. Lack of realistic or feasible short-run alternatives led to a decision in favor of OJP. 45 Certainly, not all Project proponents within USDOJ shared this perspective; as stated, some did. Others pointed to the long-term involvement and experience of offices such as OVC (which has been involved with tribes since 1989) and VAWO and argued that OJP made the most sense as a host agency. On the other hand, many tribes share the stated impression of OJP and COPS. As with other USDOJ grant programs, there have been stumbling blocks to the COPS Office's interactions with tribes, but overall, tribes view the Office's leadership as supportive of tribal programs and consider the development of the special COPS Tribal Resources Grant Program an extremely positive step. This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 34The second challenge was Project development per se - that is, the challenge of translating the Attorney General's vision, and the Assistant Atto rney General's approval memo, into a real and workable initiative. This task was assigned to the OJP American Indian and Alaska Native Affairs Desk. In response, the de sk officer undertook an education effort to learn about past USDOJ comprehensive projects and gather ideas for the new project. She then met with the leadership of each bureau and program office w ithin OJP to educate them about the CIRCLE Project; to request resources a nd support staff; to he lp coordinate policy efforts and, where appropriate, assist in policy development; to troubleshoot; and to brief bureau and program leaders on the initiative's prog ress. While this involvement wa s most intensive during Project development, the AIAND officer continued such involvement throughout the Project's implementation. Certainly, recruitment of a group of funding program s within the U.S. Department of Justice to participate in this innovative init iative was a central aspect of th e Project developm ent challenge. Initial recruitment (as noted, conducted larg ely by the AIAND officer) focused on the grantmaking programs already involved in the Indian Country Law Enforcement Improvement Initiative - the Community Orie nted Policing Services Office a nd, within the Office of Justice Programs, the Corrections Program Office (C PO), the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP), and the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) Tribal Courts Program. Then, invitations were extended to othe r grantmaking offices w ith significant funding relationships with tribes, including the Violence Against Women Office (V AWO), the Office of Victims of Crime (OVC), and the Drug Courts Program Office (DCPO). The core group of funding partners - COPS, CPO, OJJDP, BJA, VAWO, and OVC - emerged from these two recruitment efforts. While this is an impressive team both in its size and breath, interview sources stressed that not only DCPO but several other grantmaking progra ms within USDOJ also opted against participation. The creation of a specific ove rsight and management stru cture for CIRCLE was a third challenge. One early idea was for the OJP American Indian and Alaska Na tive Affairs Desk to administer the overall program and for the Corr ections Program Office, the OJP unit that had received the most money in the ICLEII, to ma nage the \"money side.\" Concerns arose within OJP, however, about the desirability of taking di rection from a non-grantmaking entity that was essentially an advocate for tribes. In the end, however, a version of the early idea held sway. In consultation with the Office of the Assistant A ttorney General of OJP, the OJP AIAND and CPO agreed that CPO would the lead administra tive and financial agent within OJP for CIRCLE, but that the offices would jointly manage th e CIRCLE Project and report monthly to the OJP Deputy Assistant Attorney General. This ar rangement provided the Project with CPO's grantmaking expertise and AIAND's wo rking knowledge of Indian tribes. It should be noted that CPO took on substantial administrative and financial oversight tasks as lead grant manager for CIRCLE. Each OJP a nd COPS grant program operates under a different set of statutory requirements that dictate how f unds may be spent, and these limitations were not removed when the programs committed to CIRCLE; thus, CPO's lead grant manager needed to learn all of the statutory requirements guiding the grant programs of each CIRCLE partner, which, in some cases, differed significantly from CPO's. He needed to develop a system for tracking the flow of paperwork between all the pr ograms and, if possible, marry this collabora- tion on paper to a more personal feeling of partnership between the participant programs This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 35(through the convening of regular meetings, for exam ple). The lead grant manager also needed to serve as a point person to the three tribal pr ograms, which meant, among other things, being available to take their calls, troubleshoot for them with the other partners, and work to secure technical assistance requests. Theoretically, this single point of contact for CIRCLE made it easier for tribes to rece ive support. In prac tice, however, it slowed re sponse time and some tribal and federal partners even felt it added a layer of bureaucracy, as the questions and problems that tribes raised had to be relayed from the lead gr ant manager to the relevant partner program. This problem lessened as the Project moved forward and the tribes develope d relationships with individual program representativ es; many felt that this was a good solution, particularly in light of the other demands of th e lead grant manager role . Raising and Resolving Tensions Between Project Supporters While one group of OJP and COPS staff worked to create a management structure that could make CIRCLE a reality, another group within USDOJ remained ap prised of and engaged with CIRCLE as a concept. Essentially, there were two groups of CIRCLE proponents within USDOJ, and these groups represented two very differe nt USDOJ functions - policy development and grant management. The policy group centered ar ound the Office of the Associate Attorney General. It provided leadership and policy dire ction but no grant funds. The grants management group was comprised largely of OJP and COPS grant managers. Th is group not only provided funds but also carried out much of the nitty-g ritty work necessary for program implementation. From the beginning, tensions existed between the groups. One contributing factor was limited understanding of each other's or ganizations. For example, memb ers of the policy group tended to lack familiarity with the statutory require ments of OJP and COPS grants, which the grant managers relied upon in making their decisions. Th e groups also had very different decision- making authority and styles. The policy group prefe rred to lay options on the table, discuss them until a consensus could be reached, and direct action based on the emergent decision. The grantmakers, following funding rules, deferred mo re decisions up the OJP hierarchy. While the groups spent time trying to educate each other, they were nonetheless frustrated by their organizational differences. Members of the gran t management group often felt under fire from the policy group simply for doing their jobs. Memb ers of the policy group were frustrated by the grant managers' lack of final au thority to make decisions and seeming inability to be innovative. These tensions and differences were particularly evident in the Project's goals, the speed of its implementation, the decision to make Project c oordinators tribal empl oyees, and in USDOJ's communications with the participant tribes around the content of the first cluster conference: Goals. Members of the policy group were very focused on the Attorney General's desire to know the effect a comprehensive project woul d have in Indian country. Members of the grants management gr oup were concerned about showing the needs basis for the additional funding thei r offices and agencies had received. Speed of implementation. The policy group felt that si nce CIRCLE was a directive from the Attorney General, the Project should be pushed fairly quickly from the concept phase to implementation. The gr ant management group wanted to move more slowly and engage the tribes in mo re strategic planning and development. In the end, the Associate Attorney General decided that since CIRCLE involved the This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Coordinators as tribal versus federal employees. In part because coordinators in the Indian Country Justice Initiative had been federal employees and also because of a belief that federal employment mi ght free the coordinators from tribal political interference, USDOJ's polic y group advocated that the CIRCLE coordinators be federal employees (L eClaire 1998). By contrast, the grant managers felt that the tribal-level CIRC LE Project coordinators should be tribal employees. They not only believed that this arrangement wa s more supportive of tribal sovereignty, but also that it would better posi tion the coordinators to innovate and accomplish Project goals (as tribal employees, the coordinators would be free of the rules and restricti ons of federal employment). By the May 1999 CIRCLE introduction meeting in Rapid C ity, the issue was resolved in favor of tribal employment.46 First cluster conference. Members of the policy group encouraged representatives from the Northern Cheyenne CIRCLE Project to take a leadership role in agenda development for the first cluster conferen ce, which was to be held at Northern Cheyenne in April 2000. When OJP receiv ed the agenda, it substantially revised the conference plan, explaining that the No rthern Cheyenne agenda did not meet statutory grant requirements and that w ithout revision the expense could not be justified to OJP leadership. Grant manage rs felt that the policy group should have known the rules and not over-promised what could be accomplishe d at the cluster meeting; they also felt that had their pe rspective been brought to the table sooner, they might have been able to incorpor ate more of the Tribe's original ideas.47 These differences resulted in a situation in wh ich each group felt that the other did not know how to use USDOJ resources effectiv ely in Indian country. Grant managers saw the policy group's recommendation that the site coordinators be federal employees, their recommendation that requests for technical assistance by-pass standard channels, thei r rush to implementation, and their limited appreciation of grants' statutor y requirements as evidence of a lack of understanding of how to work on-the-ground. Th e policy group members felt that the grant managers were inadequately supportive of th e Department's commitment to a government-to- government relationship with the tribes and cite d the cluster conference agenda revision as an example of how OJP had minimi zed tribal inpu t and control. 46 In later interviews, policy staff acknowledged that their change of heart resulted from an improved understanding of what made projects work in Indian Country, which th en necessitated a re-balancing of the arguments for and against federal employment. 47 Evaluators heard conflicting stories about the planning phase for this cluster conference; the most common version of events is reported here. To the point, one fede ral interviewee reported that the agenda remained largely unchanged, but most other federal and tribal interviewees reported that the Tribe's original ideas and plans were substantially revised to fit within OJP's funding guidelines. This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 37For a time (much of calendar year 2000 through Ja nuary 2001), the groups even met separately. Eventually, however, the two groups merged in to one, with its membership consisting of representatives from OTJ, NIJ, COPS, and the grantmaking offices and bureaus of OJP. The transition from the Clinton to the Bush Administ ration was instrumental in making this happen. During the Project's midpoint a nd maturity (from early 2001 onw ard), this new group met twice a month to discuss CIRCLE implementation. It also formed three subcommittees - a public relations subcommittee, an ev aluation subcommittee, and cluster meeting subcommittee, the latter two of which included tribal representative s. In order to keep the highest levels of USDOJ administration advised of CIRCLE plans and progress, an OJP st aff member (usually the lead grant manager from CPO or the OJP American I ndian and Alaska Native Desk officer) briefed the Office of the Assistant Atto rney General on regular basis. Overall, interviewees reported that these regul ar CIRCLE meetings fostered teamwork between the federal partners. Additio nally, although CIRCLE and the cooperation it demanded created more work (and sometimes more frustration) for the federal partners, they noted the Project and the interaction between programs, offices, and bur eaus it necessitates have helped them better understand how the other federal components work. III. Practical Aspects of Project Implementation Selection of Participant Tribes In the earliest phases of the CIRCLE initiative' s development, there was debate about the desirability of targeting speci fic tribes versus determinin g CIRCLE participation through a competitive process. Many policymaking and leadership offices within USDOJ preferred participation by invitation, while many within OJP preferred participation through competition. Ultimately, the balance of opinion and politics was in favor of participation by invitation. This decision required CIRCLE's initiators to se lect a group of tribal invitees. Many players within USDOJ participated in the selection effo rt, including the Office of the Attorney General (OAG), the Office of Tribal Justice, an OAG subc ommittee comprised of U. S. Attorneys with an interest in Indian country, the Department's Cr iminal Division, the Office of Justice Programs, and the Office of Community Oriented Policing Se rvices. In the general terms of the preceding section, site selection was a joint effort of th e policymakers and grant managers. A variety of considerations factored into their decisionmaking, and like CIRC LE's goals, only some criteria were made explicit in the Project proposal memo ; other, less explicit se lection criteria were reported in interviews. The criteria helped USDOJ narrow the list first to 6-8 possible invitees, and finally, to three. The specific considerations that led to the selection of the Northern Cheyenne Tribes, the Oglala Sioux Trib e, and the Pueblo of Zuni were: Population. Project designers wanted to reach ou t to tribes with medium to large populations, which they defined as greater than 5,000 but less than 40,000. According to the Indian Labor Force Report, 1997 (Bureau of Indian Affairs 1997), the Northern Cheyenne Tribe's 1997 enrollment was 7,373, and its on-reservation ce population was 4,199; the Oglala Sioux Tribe's 1997 enrollment was 39,734, and its on-reservat ion BIA service population was 39,321; This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 38and the Pueblo of Zuni's 1997 enrollment was 9,281, and its on-reservation BIA service population was 9,634. Level of crime. Project designers wanted to fund tribes that had serious violent crime problems, \"in terms of the nature and volume of the tribal and federal caseloads\" (LeClaire 1998, p. 4). 48 The lack of reliable and comparable crime statistics across Indian Country makes it difficult to assess how the tribes ulti- mately selected compared with each othe r and with the universe of tribes as a whole in this dimension; however, al l three report having considerable and intensifying crime problems at the outset of CIRCLE. Data from a single-day jail census in 1998 suggests that, among 50+ tribes with thei r own jail and detention facilities, all three tribes rank near the middle of the li st in terms of the proportion of the resident Native population that is under local supervision; on June 30, 1998, approximately 0.6% of the Native popu lation at Zuni, 0.4% at Northern Cheyenne, and 0.3% at Oglala Sioux was under supervision by tribal authorities (estimates calculated from Ditton 2000 a nd Bureau of Indian Affairs 1997). Governance and justice infrastructure. Project designers wanted to work with tribes that had a \"reasonably well-develope d tribal infrastructure, including tribal government, law enforcement, and cour t system\" (LeClaire 1998, p. 4). At the initiation of CIRCLE, the Pueblo of Z uni and the Northern Cheyenne Tribe already were in the midst of justice sy stem strengthening, and for the latter, the process even had included a constitutio nal reform supporting the separation of powers and an independent judiciary. By contrast, the Oglala Sioux Tribe had received low marks on a recent BIA review of the Tribe's Department of Public Safety (Naranjo et al. 1996), suffered fr om allegations of government corruption, and was sinking deeper into a constitutio nal crisis (that would erupt with a takeover of the central tribal admi nistration building in January 2000). Relationship with USDOJ or OJP. Project designers were interested in using CIRCLE as a vehicle for strengthening curr ent relationships with tribes. During the selection process, grant managers w ithin the Office of Justice Programs (OJP) and the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) looked across their programs for tribes with which they had developed good working relationships. For example, Northern Chey enne had a previous relationship with OJP and the USDOJ Criminal Division through the Indian Country Justice 48 This factor points CIRCLE towards addressing a twofold pr oblem - the tribal justice system's ability to address reservation-based crime and justice issues and the ability of the U.S. Attorney's Office and Federal Bureau of Investigation to do the same. As a policy matter, CIRCLE Project planners within USDOJ knew that the involvement of the U.S. Attorney's O ffice and FBI was necessary, an d they especially encouraged the district-based U.S. Attorneys to be involved with the CIRCLE sites. As a result, the U.S. Atto rneys were involved at each site to varying degrees, and mostly at the outset rather than thr oughout the Project (see U.S. Attorney section further on in the text). There was little or no involvement of the FBI. As a practical matter, this result (limited partnership with USDOJ entities working on the ground with tribes) was not surprising. There was no incentive for them to be involved, since all CIRCLE funding was directed at tribal agencies. Thus, data on the number of tribal arrests, tribal prosecutions, and tribal court convictions might have been better indicators of the kinds of crime and justice problems that CIRCLE had the capability to address.

Based upon the Pueblo of Z uni's past history with USDOJ grant programs, representatives from both OJ P and COPS believed that it had the capacity to do very well with CIRCLE. Ag ain by contrast, the Oglala Sioux Tribe recently had had difficulty managing a VAWO grant, a situation that resulted in allegations of tribal irregularities in th e spending of program funds and a USDOJ audit. Traditionalism. Attorney General Reno was very in terested in indigenous justice and wanted to include at least one tribe in the CIRCLE Project that might provide a model of the effectiveness of indigenous approaches to justic e; Project designers were particularly interested in lear ning how USDOJ grants, which are geared towards Western justice, work in traditional communities. While there are strong cultural influences on justice and law enfo rcement at each site, most USDOJ staff viewed the Pueblo of Zuni as \"the most traditional.\" Commitment. Before moving forward with a trib e, USDOJ wanted to make sure that its political leaders (chief executive and council/legislature) were committed to the Project. To ascertain this commitment, OTJ, COPS, and local U.S. Attorneys made an official visit to the top candidate tribes to identify tribal justice components, develop a better understanding of tribal justice needs, and gauge tribal interest in a project like CI RCLE. There was a federal aspect to commitment as well. President Clinton had visited Pine Ridge Reservation, home of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, in July 1999, and in his speech there, he promised additional resources from the U.S. govern ment to help the Tribe tackle the numerous challenges it faced. Tribal jurisdiction and law enforcement arrangements. Project designers wanted to work with tribes whose criminal ju risdiction was not rest ricted under P.L. 83- 280, as greater jurisdiction might allow a tr ibe to work more comprehensively on crime and violence issues. But the Project 's initiators also wanted to explore differences in the structure of law enforcement, especially management differences in the tribes' law enforcemen t agencies (direct service from the BIA versus tribal management under self-det ermination contracts or self-governance compacts). The BIA manages law enforcemen t for the Northern Cheyenne Tribe, while the Pueblo of Zuni and the Oglala Sioux Tribe have contracted to manage their own police departments under P.L 93-638. Community-based leadership. Project designers were interested in working in communities with rela tively strong community-based leadership (and, hence, the capacity to mobilize and engage the community in system change). While this factor was considered early in the site selection process, fe deral partners never cited it when they were queried ab out the factors driving selection. 49 49 This is despite the facts that community-based lead ership, community mobilization, and community education have proven important in the implementation of compre hensive strategies elsewher e (see, for example, Kelling et al.

Project designers expresse d initial interest in working with a tribe or tribes that had progressed with the implementation of full faith and credit initiatives to protect batt ered women, but this factor was little mentioned beyond the initial discussions. This could be because full faith and credit initiatives are in their infancy outside Indian country, let alone within. Verifiable results. Some Project designers expresse d interest in working with tribes that already were active in the collection and reporting of accurate reservation-level criminal data, but like the two preceding factors, this consideration was discussed onl y in the very early stages of site selection. On-the- ground work has made it clear that each of the three tribes were then and continue to be at different stages in the process of moving toward accurate, timely, research-supportive data collection. Based on this list, there were some strong reasons to exclude the Oglala Sioux Tribe from the CIRCLE demonstration - and yet, it was the one tr ibe on everyone's list of potential candidates. USDOJ staff took President Clinton's promises to the Tribe very seri ously and additionally argued that if the CIRCLE Project could help OST improve its justice system, the Project probably could help any tribe. The Invitation to Tribes CIRCLE was initiated formally through an invita tion to the three CIRCLE tribes to attend a meeting in Rapid City, South Da kota in May 1999. In pa rticular, USDOJ urged tribal leaders and representatives from the three tribes' justice systems to atte nd. The purpose of the meeting was to present the CIRCLE Project to the tribes and to officially invite their participation. Significantly, not only USDOJ staff, but represen tatives from two other federal departments attended the meeting - IHS sent a representati ve to learn about CIRCL E, and a BIA delegation was present to answer questions about detention facilities. On the first day, USDOJ presented an overview of the CIRCLE Project a nd sought input from the tribes about the idea. The second day focused on strategic planning, with the hope that this brief training and planning exercise would give the tribes tools for devel oping their CIRCLE strategies. The se ssion did not go as well as the federal partners hoped, however. Each tribe was at a different point in its planning process, and addressing these differences in such a large gr oup and short time period proved problematical. 50 From the tribes' perspective, the meeting wa s a useful introduction to CIRCLE, and the opportunity to participate a favor able one. But the meeting also was criticized as a one-way 1998 and Bureau of Ju stice Assistance 2001) and that, in retrospect, the CIRCLE Project has engaged community leadership to very different degrees across the sites. Preliminary results suggest that culturally appropriate community leadership may be an important factor in the successful implementation and sustainability of CIRCLE . 50 One federal interviewee noted that the strategic planning session at the Rapid City meeting was intended to be the first of a series of planning sessions with each tribe. Ho wever, because of tribal a nd Departmental dissatisfaction with the technical assistance provider, the idea was scrapped. The interv iewee also noted that the CIRCLE tribes were offered the opportunity to submit re quests for additional strategic planning assistance on a training by training basis, and that each site chose only one (additional) strategic planning session . In interviews w ith tribes, only the Northern Cheyenne Tribe mentioned this opportunity; it received strategic plan ning assistance from the Crossroads Leadership Institute.

Over the course of two days , the federal partners explained CIRCLE, its purpose, and the grant opportunities it offered and provided informa tion about strategy development. There were no formal presentations by the tribes about their current justice systems or the challenges they were f acing and few informal presenta tion opportunities (these were limited to the feedback session and the strategic planning training). To the extent that it occurred, the tribes felt that two-way information flow be gan afterwards, as the fe deral partners followed up the Rapid City meeting with site visits to each participating tribe. The First Step - Funding the Coordinator The tribes' primary follow up task to the Rapid City meeting was to apply for funding for their CIRCLE Project coordinators. Taki ng this first step would allow them to move forward in accessing additional funds, as the coordinator's role was to be \"responsible for coordinating the development and implementation of the strategy by facilitating regular meetings of the board; monitoring progress on grant-funded project implementation; servi ng as the liaison between the tribe and the U.S. Department of Justice; facilitating coordinati on and cooperation among criminal justice, substance abuse and other social service agencies to improve services\" (Office of Justice Programs, \"CIRCLE A pplication Kit 1999,\" p. 4). The coordinator was to be the glue that held the Project together, facilitating cooper ation between programs at the tribal level and brokering the federal- tribal partnership. Each tribe selected its coordinator internall y, although in consultation with the Washington- based CIRCLE partners and the local United States Attorney's Office. The Northern Cheyenne Tribe filled the coordinator post in August 1999, as did the Oglala Sioux Tribe. The Pueblo of Zuni followed with a hire in November 1999. At Northern Cheyenne and Zuni, the same coordinator was in place from the outset, while there were three c oordinators at Pine Ridge (the first left after two months and the second after a year, both for \"political\" reasons). In every case, the Project coordinator is not only a tribal employee, but also a tribal member. Annual Application and Review Process The participating tr ibes' applications for funds in support of the coordinator position were the first of four applications they were required to submit to gain access to CIRCLE funds. The later applications were submitted by the tribal c oordinators on an annual basis (fiscal years 1999, 2000, and 2001) and were for program funds to support the implementation of the tribes' CIRCLE strategies. Tribes applied by completi ng a USDOJ-produced application kit, which bound together brief instructions and individual forms for the various grant programs that were cooperating in CIRCLE. In other words, the ki t emphasized that CIRCLE was not a block grant program with pooled funding from several sources - tribes still had to ti e proposed activities to particular funding streams. Yet at the same time, th e kit eliminated any need for tribes to stitch this group of programs and grant applications to gether on their own, and being part of CIRCLE was a reasonably strong guarantee that the set of funds would be available for three years. That is, the Project and its application form lowered the search costs, uncertainty, and short time horizon constraints that the tribes otherwise woul d have faced in seeking similar grants from USDOJ. Once the tribal coordinators submitted their an nual funding applications to OJP, each USDOJ grantmaking program participating in CIRCLE re viewed the portion relevant to its funds.

Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 42particular, grant managers made sure that the tribes' funding requests met statutory requirements. If there were questions, the indi vidual grant managers followed a fairly formal process: they would mark up a review form and forward the ques tion or concern to the lead grant manager in CPO, who would then contact a trib al representative for clarifica tion or revision of the funding request. After the grant managers' individual reviews, the federal pa rtners also met together as a group to discuss the tribes' applications.51 Finally, before funds were disbursed to the tribes, the USDOJ Comptroller's Office reviewed the applic ations. Through this application, review, and funding process, the CIRCLE tribes received mo re than $30 million from fiscal year 1999 to fiscal year 2001 to strengthen th eir justice systems. (The Appe ndix to this paper breaks these funds out by tribe, USDOJ program, and year.) In the abstract, this is a smooth pr ocess. In practice, there were significant bumps in the road that required adjustments along the way - and even then, not all of the issues could be resolved. One problem the grant managers highlighted was the \"incompleteness\" of the application kit. The streamlining approach, in which all participatin g programs' applications were combined in a single application kit of manageable size, mean t that program descriptions and rules were presented in very summary fashion. As a result, so me grant managers felt that the tribal partners were not as familiar with the requirements of the federal programs as they would have been had they used a usual, program-specific application k it. For example, rules fo r OJJDP's Tribal Youth Program allow tribes to apply for funding in f our different areas, but a grantee may receive support for a particular area only once. The CIRCLE application kits neglec ted to include this fact, which limited the participating tribes' ability to plan appropriately; in the first year, some applied under all four areas at once, and had OJJDP funded them a ll, the tribes would not have qualified for second-year support. 52 The tribal partners' limited knowledge of program rules also prevented some of them from applying for the full amount of available funding. 51 The purpose of these review sessions is unclear to the evaluators. Since the application process is not competitive, discussion of meritorious programs was unnecessary. Since USDOJ had indicated that no application as a whole would be rejected, a \"go - no go\" discussion about each tribe's overall application was not needed. Finally, since revisions occurred at the individual grant level (as discussed in the text), discussions about how to resolve particular program funding issues should have been moot. It is possible that the meetings were used to discuss the tribes' comprehensive strategies or as a status check to determin e whether the federal partners were adequately supporting the tribes in moving toward their goals, although why th is would have occurred annually instead of on an ongoing basis is unclear. Federal comments on draft evaluation do cuments noted that two of these activities (resolution of individual programs' funding concerns and evaluation of the tribes' strategies) did occur during the review sessions. It should be noted that evaluator confusion about the re view sessions arises in larg e part because the evaluation team's request to attend a review session was denied, base d on fears that the team's presence would impede open discourse and that team members would not be content to be observers only. Thus, an important opportunity to observe how CIRCLE worked at the federal level and to a ssess the collaboration of the federal Project team was lost. In lieu of attendance, USDOJ did supply the evaluation team with redacted versions of the documents grant managers prepared for the review meetings. For the most part, these documents provided the grant managers' impressions of whether the applications met statutory guidelines. The only additional insight they offered into the review process is that the federal grantmaking partners may have used the sessions to scrutinize each other's CIRCLE spending, in order to push each other to achieve, to get the most \"bang for the buck,\" and to support innovation while remaining within grant guidelines. This sort of peer-to-peer support would have been valuable, but evaluators were unable to confirm its occurrence. 52 Tribal Youth Program funds were available in fiscal years 1999 and 2000 only; see Appendix A.

Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 43USDOJ did attempt to ward off information problems arising from application kit space limits by providing grant managers with an early opport unity to explain thei r programs' rules to participating tribes. It held a meeting in Denve r in July 1999 for exactly this purpose, which many federal grantmaking partners attended. Unfort unately, the most important audience for this meeting, the tribal Project coordinators, were not in attendance, as they had not yet been hired. For them, the only opportunities to learn USDO J program rules occurred over time, through cluster meetings. This meant that much useful information reached the relevant tribal parties quite late in the game. For example, the Office of Victims of Crime presentation occurred at the Pine Ridge cluster meeting in May 2001, after tw o of the application kits already had been submitted. Absent opportunities to put full information in the tribal coordinators ' hands early on, many OJP and COPS grant managers ended up spending significant time throughout the three years of CIRCLE explaining their program rules to individual tribal program partners and individual CIRCLE coordinators. After the first application round, a number of fe deral partners expres sed concern that the applications did not reflect \"strategies\" - that is, the application information did not describe how the programs would work together and co mplement one another in support of an overarching goal for the justice system. On the on e hand, there was only so much the tribes could do about this, since the grant co mponents participated in CIRC LE by choice and there was not a natural coherence between the va rious funding streams. On the ot her hand, the first application kit (1999) did not expressly en courage the tribes to think about links between the funding sources or about the way the funding fit with their strategies. Realizing this, the federal partners revised the 2000 application kit, making changes that they hoped would increase the tribes' emphasis on program linkages and strategy. Fo r example, the 2000 kit included a \"Problem Definition Worksheet\" and a \"Response Implemen tation Worksheet,\" which were intended to help the tribes define their sp ecific problems and the strategic responses they would be making with CIRCLE funding. The federal pa rtners also increased the time period allotted to application writing, thereby increasing the amount of time each tribe had to thin k about its strategy and write it into the application.53 Reflecting on the final application round in 2001, most federal interviewees concluded that despite initial challenges, the a pplication, review, and funding pro cess had evolved into one that worked well. It had become more transparent, be tter encouraged the tribes to think in terms of their overall strategy for reducing crime and vi olence, and generated more and more productive \"back and forth\" between the tribes and the fede ral partners on the applications. With time and practice in partnership, the proce ss gave both the tribal and federal partners a better idea of what the tribes needed and what the CIRCLE funds could do to help. 53 Reflecting on this specific point, most federal interviewees felt that the changes had helped both the Pueblo of Zuni and the Northern Cheyenne Tribe improve their stra tegies. But the changes were less useful to OST, whose second application lacked strategic cohesion by comparison to the other tribes'. One reason was surely the federal funding freeze (discussed in detail in th e OST process analysis), which stoppe d much of the OST CIRCLE Project's progress in its tracks. Politics may also have been in the way, as the second OST CIRCLE Coordinator in particular cited pressures from his political overseers as an impediment to getting his job done. More time and better forms simply could not outweigh the negative influences of these other factors on strategic planning.

These included monitoring via the application and revi ew process, mandatory regular progress and financial reports from the site coordinators, fo rmal monitoring site vi sits, and grant manager attendance at technical assistance site vi sits and CIRCLE cluster conferences. This combination provided for more intense mo nitoring of the CIRCLE Project than was usual for OJP and COPS. In particular, it was more inte nse than the monitoring to which they subject non-demonstration project grantees. For example, th e site coordinators were required to submit extensive semi-annual progress repo rts that provided a fiscal update on the Project and covered each component program's progress on grant impleme ntation. By contrast, federal interviewees noted that non-CIRCLE grantees generally su bmit one-page progress reports. The application also intensified the monitoring process. Despite being chosen for the CIRCLE Project, the participating tribes had to \"re-apply\" for funds each fiscal year. As noted above, the federal partners used the application and review process to keep close tabs on the tribes' work and verify that the tribes' activities met statutory guideli ne. If problems or questions arose, the CIRCLE coordinators were required to address them before any funds wo uld be awarded. Thus, monitoring was an important and sometimes dr iving aspect of the a pplication and review process.54 While USDOJ did not necessarily c onduct more monitoring site visits per se with CIRCLE tribes, when viewed in combination with all th e other forms of in-person contact between the tribal and federal partners, in-per son monitoring was also more intense than usual. This imposed a significant burden on th e site coordinators, who had to arrange and atte nd all of these (and other) sessions. In fiscal year 2001, for example, the site coordinators had to arrange and/or attend one federal monitoring site visit, two eval uation team site visits, two cluster conferences, and whatever technical assistance sessions were provided for their tribal partners through CIRCLE; many of these meetings and interac tions also required follow-up by the site coordinator.55 Some federal interviewees noted that th ey did not get as much out of USDOJ's \" en masse \" site visits as they would have liked, and that they preferred program-specific visits - even though this would have compressed the site coordina tors' time to work on th e Project itself still further and would have eliminated the grant ma nagers' own opportunities ga in an unde rstanding of the ways their programs interacted with or co mplemented other programs (which is integral to a comprehensive project and could help them provide bett er service to the tribes). 54 One federal interviewee argued that longer semi-annual progress reports were important for a comprehensive project, since they helped the coordi nators chart their progre ss and provided grant managers with adequate information to usefully engage with grantees about prob lems and hurdles. This was the stated purpose of the \"strategic planning\" sections of the annual applications as well. In other words, the CIRCLE coordinators were expected to chart strategic progress thre e times a year on paper, report on it at cluster conferences, and speak to federal officials about it during monitoring site visits. If not \"intense scrutiny\" as noted in the text, there is at least a degree of redundancy in these requirements. 55 Fiscal year 2001 may have been the bus iest year in terms of meetings, but on ly marginally. There were two cluster conferences in fiscal year 2001 (as o pposed to one each in fiscal years 2000 and 2002) and two evaluation team site visits (as opposed to none in fiscal year 2000 and one in fiscal year 2002), but ea rlier years were marked by additional planning/start-up meetings with federal represen tatives and later years with additional technical assistance meetings, as requests began to be filled.

Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 45Cluster Meetings Four cluster meetings were held throughout the three years of CIRCLE f unding at approximately six-month intervals. The meetings rotated between the tribal sites (Northern Cheyenne in April 2000, Zuni in December 2000, and Oglala Sioux in May 2001), with the final meeting being held in Washington, DC (in January 2002). The purpose of the meetings was to gather key CIRCLE players together for the excha nge of information and ideas. This general statement of purpose had many inte rpretations. The tribal and federal partners viewed the cluster conferences variously as: Opportunities for training on the re quirements of the OJP and COPS funding available through CIRCLE Opportunities to inform tribal partners about a dditional funding opportunities available through USDOJ but not included in CIRCLE per se (such as technical assistance funding, MIS funding, code development funding, etc.) Opportunities for the federal partners to learn how CIRCLE was progressing at each site Opportunities to highlight the particular programs tribes were improving or developing through CIRCLE Opportunities for the federal partners to visit reservations and learn more about individual tribes Opportunities to include a broader pool of federal collabor ators in the CIRCLE effort (such as the Indian Health Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Department of Housing and Urban Development, etc.) Opportunities for tribal peer -to-peer information-sharing, so that the coordinators and tribal program directors and staff could learn from each other On reflection, the agendas of the cluster conferences appear to have been weighted more heavily toward the first five items on this list than the last two. One reason, as raised in the discussion above about agenda planning for the Northern Cheyenne meeti ng, is OJP's need to justify meeting expenses under their grants' statutory guidelines. While this concern is valid and supported the transfer of a significant amount of us eful information to tribes (see below), it is nonetheless the tribes' perspective that the fede ral partners essentially controlled the cluster conference agendas - which not only limited the learning and collaboration the meetings could foster, but is also difficult to reconcile with the goals and guiding prin ciples of CIRCLE (for example, that tribes would take the lead in pr oblem-solving in their communities and that inter- tribal information sharing was valued). 56 While members of the CI RCLE cluster conference 56 A statistical example of this point is the fact that at the final cluster meeting, the agenda allowed tribal representatives to have the floor for, at most, 5.5 of the meeting's 16 hours. This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 46subcommittee report substantial outreach in an e ffort to gain tribal input to the conference agendas, some federal partners nonetheless agreed in private interviews that they had not reached out adequately to the tribes to see what they wanted to get out of the meetings. On the flip side, tribal partners noted that it was di fficult for them to imagine what a meeting agenda would look like that was useful to them and useful to the federal partners. Substantively, each meeting was structured around a theme, and these themes were often important drivers of whether or not participan ts thought the meeting was a success. An even more accurate statement might be that a mee ting's success depended on how a theme played out given what the grant managers were able to (s tatutorily) provide at the cluster meeting in support of the theme. Northern Cheyenne, April 2000 . The theme of this cluster conference was \"Comprehensive Strategy Development. \" Lingering dissatisfaction with the way the agenda process had played out and di fficulties with comprehensive strategy development training similar to those e xperienced at the kick-off meeting in Rapid City limited the usefulness of this meeting for many participants. On the other hand, the federal partners' impression was that the applications did improve after this meeting. Zuni, December 2000. The theme of this cluster conference was \"Technology.\" OJP was able to provide substantial information about technology-related possibilities, including information about funding for assessments to determine technology needs. All partners agreed that technology held great promise for improving and coordinating CIRCLE programs, and tribal participants expressed eagerness to complete such assessments. Most viewed this meeting as quite successful, especially since as a result of the cluster presentations and discussions, the federal CIRCLE partners promised to help the tribes find resources to complete technology needs assessments. 57 Oglala Sioux, May 2001. The theme of this cluster conference was \"Victim Services.\" OVC presented more detailed information about their grant programs and the guidelines for use of funds, and several other USDOJ officials and grantees discussed their involvement with victims' issues in Indian country. Some tribal partners felt that because this three-day meeting was so narrowly focused, it was too costly in terms of time and trav el money (some even stayed away). But most of the federal partners were satisfi ed with the meeting, especially because they learned more about, and are now better able to support the work of, the Office of Victims of Crime. Washington, DC, January 2002. The theme this cluster conference was \"Sustainability.\" OJP asked staff, grantees , and representatives from other federal departments to present thoughts and info rmation on sustainability (particularly 57 Evaluation was a secondary theme at this meeting. Both tribal and federal informants suggested that the activities and presentations of the evaluation team also boosted the meeting's usefulness. This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 47funding sources) to the tribes and allotted time for tribal representatives to discuss their thoughts on sustainabi lity. This was an impressive return to the original Project goal of involving a broader circle of programs , agencies, and departments in the CIRCLE effort. At the same time, many tribal partners felt that these presentations did little to relieve their primary concerns , which were how to fund their coordinators after year three and whether USDOJ had any ongoing (post year three) commitment to CIRCLE. As the final cluster conference in the cycle, some tribal participants al so were hoping for an opportu nity to look back on the Project and talk about what they had accomplished. And, given the conference's location in Washington, DC, they thought that some of the higher-ranking policy officials who had long talked about CIRCLE might briefly attend; as it turned out, there was no official \"meet and greet,\" and even many of the OJP partners were not in attendance.58 The general sense among trib al partners and among some federal interviewees was that this fina l conference did not send people away on a high note. IV. The Role and Impact of Quasi-Partners and Non-Partners The official federal partners in the CIRCLE Pr oject were the grantmaking units in OJP and COPS, which provided financial su pport, and the OJP American In dian and Alaska Native Desk, which provided Project development and coordinati on services. Of course, there were a variety of other supporters within USDOJ, which because of their non-financial role might best be called \"quasi partners.\" This section highlights the cr itical role of two such unofficial partnering agencies, the Office of Tribal Justice and the Offi ce of the U.S. Attorneys. It then turns to the fact that while the Project proposal memo sugge sted a broader range of collaboration, including collaboration with other federal Departments, this did not occur. The section closes by considering the impact of the lack of part nership with the BIA and IHS in particular. The Office of Tribal Justice The Office of Tribal Justice was created in 1995 to improve communication between USDOJ and Indian tribes. The Office functions as a point of contact and advocate within USDOJ for all tribes, a role that includes reviewing and commenting on legislatio n, policy, and litigation affecting the USDOJ-tribal relati onship. In this capacity, OTJ played a large role in the development and implementation of CIRCLE. Fo r example, after Atto rney General Reno expressed an interest in improving the U.S. Depa rtment of Justice's su pport of Indian Country justice programs, OTJ visited tribes to discuss how USDOJ might best do this; these discussions influenced the creation of CIRCLE. Once the partic ipant tribes were selected, the OTJ Director assigned an OTJ Deputy Director to each; the Deput y Director serves as a \"primary point of contact\" between the tribe a nd OTJ in order to promote access to and clear lines of communication with USDOJ. The a ssigned representatives spoke with and visited the tribal CIRCLE partners regularly and worked in part nership with the U.S. Attorneys serving the 58 It should be noted that the Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General of OJP did attend the meeting and provided a statement at the outset about the important learning opportunities CIRCLE provides. This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 48CIRCLE tribes. Through these efforts, OTJ deepened its knowledge of and relationships with all three participant tribes. Many federal and some tribal interviewees re ported that OTJ's involvement was critical to CIRCLE's development and successful implem entation. Throughout the Project, OTJ worked with tribes and Department offi cials as problems developed (som etimes even before) and helped move things forward when they threatened to get stuck - whether this was because a \"policy\" person didn't understand certain realities of working on the ground in Indian country, because a tribe didn't understand why certain program rule s applied, or because a grant manager desired guidance on the degree of flexibil ity allowed under the law. In su m, another project like CIRCLE would require the involveme nt of such advocates. Reflecting on CIRCLE, OTJ repres entatives themselves believe that the Project has been an important step forward for the participating tr ibes and for USDOJ. The federal teamwork and streamlined grant process guaranteed the particip ating tribes significant funding for three years, which in turn gave them breathing room for wo rking on fundamental tribal justice issues. The consolidated grant process edu cated the federal partners on tribes' government-to-government relationship with the U.S. and helped make US DOJ's commitment to that relationship real. Indeed, given these benefits, OTJ interviewees (as tribal advocat es) expressed a desire for the teamwork, streamlined funding process, and federa l-tribal relationship ma nifested in CIRCLE to be institutionalized. Yet they are realistic about the difficulty of change. Giving a larger number of Indian nations the attention that the CIRCLE tribes have rece ived would require the strong support of USDOJ leadership, significant fundi ng and staff increases among the grantmaking programs, and staff increases both at OTJ and at the OJP American Indian and Alaska Native Desk (which, from within OJP, performed functions complementary to those of OTJ).59 The U.S. Attorney's Office The role of the U.S. Attorney's Office (USAO) in CIRCLE varied from tribal site to tribal site and was particularly dependent on the relationshi p the tribe and the USAO had prior to CIRCLE: Northern Cheyenne Tribe. At the outset of the CIRCLE Project, the tribal liaison in the Montana USAO had extremely pos itive working relationships with the tribes in the state, an d he saw CIRCLE as an oppor tunity to deepen that relationship with the Northern Cheyenne Tribe. During the early phases of CIRCLE implementation, he spoke freque ntly with the CIRCLE Coordinator about issues ranging from management to policy and provide d assistance when necessary. This individual was later appoin ted Director of the Office of Tribal Justice, and continued his supportive ro le at Northern Ch eyenne - not only because of his early connections to the Pr oject there but also because the Assistant U.S. Attorney who replaced him as tribal liaison has not been as engaged with the Montana tribes. Pueblo of Zuni . The tribal liaison and tribal \"point of contact\" in the New Mexico U.S. Attorney's Office have been suppor tive of the Zuni CIRCLE Project, but not 59 Of course, the burden on grantmaking staff would be eased if USDOJ were able to shift to a block grant process. This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 49engaged in its conceptual or day-to-day efforts. That is, the variou s individuals holding these positions60 have never sat down with Zuni CIRCLE staff, tribal police, or tribal prosecutors to discuss the Pueblo's crime prevention and control challenges and priorities or how the USAO might work differently to assist the Pueblo in addressing those concerns. One important reason why is that the Assistant U.S. Attorneys who work with the New Mexico tribes reported uncertainty about what their role was with regard to CIRCLE. As one member of the Office noted, \"The bottom line is that it would have been productive if the USAO's role had been clearly defined. And it would have been good if we could have had a line assistant who could have devoted a significant amount of time to the CIRCLE Project\" (personal communicat ion, May 2002). At this time, the Pueblo of Zuni remains interested in improving the relationship with the New Mexico USAO, especially because it hope s to improve the Office's prosecution rate of Zuni-generated federal cases. Fo r its part, the New Mexico USAO reports that it is ready to assist, within the ti me and caseload constraints that it faces. Oglala Sioux Tribe . The South Dakota U.S. Attorney's Office has had a much rockier relationship with the Oglala Si oux Tribe, which extends back decades. Even if there are positive personal relati onships between tribal staff and a U.S. Attorney, the culture and history of place make it difficult for the Oglala Sioux to interact with an institution (USAO-USDO J) whose law enforcement branch is viewed as having treated the Tribe poorly (see, for example, Matthiessen 1992). For its size, the South Dakota USAO is al so very busy, and since the tribal liaison position is in addition to (and does not re place) other work, the position directly competes with these other case responsib ilities for available time; when CIRCLE came along, there was little to no extra time in the tribal liaison's schedule to commit to it. An Assistant U.S. Attorney was released to work on the application phase of CIRCLE, and another participated in an early CIRCLE pilot program to improve prosecution rates, but in late r years, CIRCLE received only limited support from the South Dakota USAO. Discussions with tribal partners indicated th at strong relationships with the USAOs were a resource and ought to be seen as being as useful as grant funds. Including the USAOs in CIRCLE's work in a more deliberate manner would have allowed the participating tribes to think even more comprehensively about their approach es to crime and community safety, since the USAOs are responsible for pros ecuting the most serious crim e problems on reservations. Of course, the USAOs would have ne eded additional funding to make this work, since each site would have needed a U.S. Attorney who had the time to work with them. (Tribal liaison work is an additional task at in all the Offices, not just in South Dakota.) 61 60 Three different individuals worked either as New Mexico USAO \"tribal liaisons\" or \"points of contact\" with the Pueblo of Zuni during the CIRCLE Project. These two positi ons correspond to slightly different roles within this USAO, but both had some involvement with CIRCLE. 61 The point about time is also a point about presence. USAO s would be most effective if they were able to spend a significant amount of time in the tr ibal communities they serve, learning ab out each tribe's jus tice system, tribal This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

In terms of the problems CI RCLE is trying to addre ss at each tribal site, two critical \"non-partners\" are the U.S. Department of the Interior Bureau of Indian Affairs and the U.S Department of Health a nd Human Services Indian Health Service. The former provides substantial funding for law enforcement in tribal communities and the latt er funds a variety of justice-related health services, including substa nce abuse treatment and mental health care. The close linkage between these services is exemplif ied by the fact that many offenders also receive substance abuse treatment or mental health care from the tribe; that is, the tribal criminal justice and health systems have joint responsibility for these individuals. Additionally, data held by each organization are helpful to assessing change in th e tribes' justice systems (for example, IHS or tribally contracted hospitals may collect data on assault-rela ted emergency room visits). Several examples from the participating tribes demonstrate how a more formal partnership with these entities at the federal level could have promoted better on-the-ground implementation of the CIRCLE strategies. In each case, better cooperation with the BIA or IHS might have increased the payoffs of USDOJ's investments. COPS-funded vehicles. Perhaps the most poignant example of the potential payoffs of cooperation between federa l departments con cerns COPS-funded vehicles. Each of the three CIRCLE tribes purchased police vehicles with their COPS funding, but only the Zuni Police Depart ment was able to put the vehicles into service in a timely fashion. The probl em was that COPS grants to tribal governments fund investment but not opera ting expenditures - the tribes could not use COPS grant funds for vehicle main tenance or insuran ce. Apparently, the assumption was that as governments, the tribes had tax bases or other government revenue streams that coul d be used to underwrite the operating costs of new police vehicles. Yet most tribes - these three tribes among them - have extremely limited sources of government revenue. Likewise, while the BIA funds maintenance and insurance co sts under direct service or P.L. 93-638 contracts for \"its\" vehicles, its budgeting did not s upport the operating costs of COPS-funded vehicles. Thus, the tribal police departments and CIRCLE coordinators had to cast about for alternatives, a process that, in the absence of expl icit cooperation with the BIA, required innovation a nd a certain amount of luck. Zuni's solution was to negotiate early on w ith the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Prior to purchasing any vehicles, the coordinator approached the local BIA Superintendent and arranged a swap. Using COPS funds, the Pueblo would purchase several new and relatively econom ical police vehicles and place their maintenance and insurance under the Pueblo 's P.L. 638 law enforcement contract. In exchange for this upkeep, the Pueblo would re-budget its remaining COPS citizens' and tribal government's expectations of federal prosecutors, and community priorities for law enforcement. Spending more time in tribal communities might also create the opportunity for reciprocal training - for example, the opportunity to provide a USAO perspective on what it takes (in terms of record-keeping, investigation, tribal police responsibilities, etc.) to ensure federal pros ecution and to improve the chances of conviction.

This agreement was not common knowledge , for after many starts and stops, the Northern Cheyenne Tribe reached a completely different resolution of the problem. It agreed to lend the vehicles to its BIA-managed police department for the length of the COPS grant. At the end of the grant, the vehicles will be returned to the Tribe, and the BIA will no longer accept responsibility for their maintenance and insurance. This agreement was put in to practice in March 2002, but at that point, the Tribes had owned th e vehicles for nearly two years. In other words, this is a limited solution at best , and one that fails to maximize the usefulness of the COPS funds. Worse, during the many months the Tribe attempted to resolve the problem, no one at BIA or USDOJ was able to assist the coordinator with a solution; in partic ular, no one suggested that it might be possible to swap expenses, as the Pueblo of Zuni had done.62 The Oglala Sioux Tribes met si milar obstacles in placing the vehicles on the road. While the parties at OST became aware of the possibility of a swap, there was resistance on both sides to this funding solution. This may have been due in part to the fact that the vehicles had alrea dy been purchased and there may have been little money left to organize an exchange of one type of spending for another. But there also appears to be serious compe tition between tribal entities and local BIA staff over Department of Public Safety Resources. Despite the fact that the Department operates under a P.L. 638 contra ct, the BIA keeps close tabs on it. For example, tribal interviewees noted that local BIA staff have actively looked for vehicle identification numbers to make sure that they are not financing any CIRCLE vehicles. In sum, this example demonstrates the ease with which local BIA agencies can disrupt or support a CIRCLE strategy. Had Bureau agents received direction early on from the federal level about cooperati on and about possible solutions to this problem - in other words, had they been real partners in the circle from the start - the COPS grant funds could have been put to even more productive use. 62 Of course, it is possible that had the Zuni solution been proposed by the Northern Cheyenne CIRCLE Coordinator, the BIA would have rejected it, since the Northern Cheyenne police department is BIA-managed whereas the Zuni department is operated by the tribe unde r a P.L. 93-638 contract. While this possibility cannot be discounted, supposing that it would have been the case misses the larger point: the police vehicle problem is an example not only of having too few partners at the table, but also of the absence of critical intertribal communication . Presumably, the cluster meetings could have been used for such communication, but their structure did not promote it. For example, coordinators were required to report on their progress at the cluster meetings, but were not provided opportunities to talk about how they solved problems. Indeed, the meetings never gave the CIRCLE coordinators an opportunity to sit down together in a small group and discuss the similar problems they faced and the solutions they were findin g. One coordinator requested funding to visit the other sites and for the other coordinators visit his site for just such purposes, but fu nding was not forthcoming and the visits did not occur. Yet the list of similar problems that the tribes faced leave no doubt that such meetings, visits, and other opportunities for peer-to-peer communication would have helped the coordinators and improved their programs.

Correctional facility staffing is a second example of this same problem. CPO provides funds for construction, but the tribes are expected to provide ongoing operating e xpenses. The largest such expense is staff, so the discussion is usually couche d in those terms - the tribes have been concerned that they will build facilities that cannot be staffed because there is no money to pay for staff. If the BIA built a correctional facility, it would assume responsibility for operating it, but when CPO provides the investment, there is no guarantee that the BIA or tribe will have the budgetary flexibility to operate and maintain it. Absent BIA partnership (a nd IHS partnership - their funds could support detoxification and counseling staff, for example) in the CIRCLE Project, OST worked for a year to obtain a commitment from the Bureau, or from the Tribe's Congressional dele gation, that there would be staff and ot her operating funding for the facility. At the time of wr iting, the Tribe finally had received word that the BIA would provide such funding. Remarkably, neither the Pueblo of Zuni nor the Northern Cheyenne Tribe had th e same lengthy struggl e with the Bureau; in both of these cases, the BIA (and, for several positions, the IHS) much more readily agreed to take on responsibility for operating and maintaining the new facilities. Again, a federally brokered partnership between the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Department of Interi or (which houses the BIA), and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Servi ces (which houses the IHS) might have led to a smoother resolution of this pr oblem for OST (and, as noted in a footnote above, would have increased inter-trib al information-sharing opportunities). 63, 64 While these points about the \"non-partner impact s\" on the CIRCLE program might be seen as a criticism of the Project's design and implementation at the federa l level, they also hold a silver lining: they demonstrate that the participant tribes understand the benefits in comprehensive action and that they are ready to take comprehe nsive planning to the next level and include a 63 To USDOJ's credit, it appears that Project planners were aware from the beginning that BIA ought to be involved with CIRCLE at least with respect to the detention cente rs. During planning meetings, USDOJ noted the need to look into having the BIA on board in terms of detention st aff, and the Bureau was invited to the Rapid City meeting in order to answer questions about the detention centers. Also, CPO saw a need to include the BIA and IHS in the needs assessments for the correctional f acilities; their involvement was seen as a means of moving assessment past a simple bed count to the provision of information about how the correctional facility would help improve the tribes' justice systems . Thus, the observation is not that USDOJ didn't understand but, rather, that the Department perhaps did not do enough to advocate on CIRCLE's behalf to other departments and gain their cooperation. While interviewees did not provide specific examples of what more USDOJ could have done, there are a variety of possibilities. With respect to BIA, for example, OTJ or OJ P representatives might have had regular meetings with staff of the BIA Division of Law Enforcement Services and Division of Tribal Government Services, they might have invited the same staff to participate in the twice-monthly CIRCLE team meetings, they might have regularly included local agency and national-level BIA staff on cluste r conference agendas, they might have met with local agency BIA representatives as a matter of course during monitoring site visits, they might have proposed \"matching schemes\" for BIA investment in the CIRCLE communities, and so on. As noted in the cross-site analysis, legislation supporting cross-departmental cooperation may have provided even more avenues for collaboration. 64 There is an important lesson for the Department of Interior Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Department of Health and Human Services Indian Health Service, and other departments that work with Indian nations in these examples: partnership with other federal agencies can increase the re sources on the table, improve the viability of projects, and potentially led to better outcomes. In other words, not just USDOJ, but other departments ought to strive to increase their collaboration around community justice and health projects in Indian Country.

Tribes see the inte rconnections between the problems and the funding streams that could help them solve the problem s, and are pushing their partners in the U.S. Department of Justice to continue to help them along this path. V. An Analytic Look at the U.S. Depa rtment of Justice' s Work on CIRCLE Has CIRCLE Met Its Goals? Analysis of the process by which the U.S. Depa rtment of Justice developed and managed the CIRCLE Project provides substantia l data with which to assess the Project's success vis-\u00e0-vis its goals. Of course, tribal process and outcome analyses will be necessary to make these determinations more fully, but the review contained in this paper pr ovides an important start. The explicit and implicit goals for the CIRCLE Project are listed below; a di scussion of progress made to date follows each goal. Goal: to accelerate and coordinate USDOJ programs and grants at CIRCLE demonstration sites to guide general im plementation of the Indian Country Law Enforcement Initiative65 In general, CIRCLE did succeed in accelerating the pa rticipating tribes' receipt of an overall set of program funds from the U.S. Department of Ju stice. Indeed, whatever else one may think of the tension between the \"policy group\" and \"gra nt management\" group that characterized early CIRCLE Project planning and development within US DOJ, this tension did result in a fairly expeditious movement of funds from the U.S. De partment of Justice to Indian country. The only exceptions to the notion of acceleration were am ong the few tribal programs already receiving money from the OJP and COPS programs that cooperated to fund CIRCLE; in these cases, no \"acceleration\" was necessary. But this is not to say that accelerated funding is always a good thing. The Northern Cheyenne Tribe and the Pueblo of Zuni were administrativ ely prepared for the Department's fairly rapid grant award, but the Oglala Sioux Tribe was not. The Department's subsequent decision to freeze the Oglala Sioux Tribe's receipt of CIRCLE funds suggests that acce leration is desirable as long as a tribe's financial management infr astructure is adequate and accountable.66 Furthermore, acceleration of funding forced the tribes to bypass early-stage assessment and follow-on strategic planning, which, as discussed in the cross-site analysis, has been detr imental to the Project overall. CIRCLE also succeeded in the coordination of fundi ng and, to a large extent, in the coordination of grant management, which produced benefits for the tribes. The Project achieved this coordination through the work of the USDOJ CIRCLE Committee, the use of inter-agency 65 As a reminder, the first three goals listed in this anal ysis (\"to accelerate and coordi nate...,\" \"to tribal exchange...,\" and \"to develop a comprehensive...\") are taken directly from the proposal memo for CIRCLE written in October 1998. The second three goals (\"to foster ...,\" \"to address...,\" and \"to highlight the need...,\") are implicit and derived from interviews with USDOJ staff. 66 We note here and elsewher e that one federal participan t disagrees with this charact erization of the funding freeze at the Oglala Sioux Tribe.

As a result of fe deral funding coordination, OJP and COPS were able to guarantee that the tribes participating in CI RCLE would receive funds from a particular set of grant programs and would not have to attempt th is coordination themselves. In other words, the tribes were released from at least some time-cons uming \"grant search\" tasks. To the extent that the CIRCLE Project lead grant manager and tribal coordinators were able to resolve problems and answer questions for the indi vidual tribal programs and partic ipating federal grant managers (that is, coordinate grant mana gement), CIRCLE may have produced additional time savings for the tribal partners. Even so, the history presented above suggests th at coordination was not always comfortable for the federal partners or for the tribal partners . Indeed, as CIRCLE progres sed, instead of working through the Project coordinators a nd lead grant manager, the tribal program directors and federal grant managers tended to fall into a more traditional relationship, bypassing the lead grant manager. While this may have been an easier so lution in the short run th an full coordination, it fails to recognize that a single point of contact is the structure USDOJ ultimately must adopt if it continues to move away from categorical f unding and toward pooled resources. Indeed, the tensions surrounding this \"extra layer of bureaucracy \" arise only because of the interim nature of CIRCLE, where statutory requirements on cate gorical funding (and six different Offices and Bureaus) remain within a mo re comprehensive model. The message here is that coordi nation is important, and that US DOJ (and especially the Offices and Bureaus that participated in CIRCLE) should not pull back from it. I ndeed, the participating tribes have called for increas ed coordination of funding str eams within USDOJ and beyond, recognizing that enhanced federa l-level coordination would provide even better support to their attempts at coordination on the ground (for ex ample, better coordination between the BIA Division of Law Enforcement Services and the COPS Office would ha ve supported better integration of COPS-funded officers and e quipment into tribal police agencies). Goal: to promote the inter-tribal exchange of ideas and experiences in law enforcement, community development, and federal-tribal relations Cluster meetings were the right first step toward achieving this goal. They were a deliberate attempt to bring together tribal-level change agents, program directors, and leaders who were working on similar issues and striving toward related goals. As the discussion above highlights, however, they were not used to their fullest potential. Giving participant tribes a freer hand in helping plan th e meetings would ensure their greater relevance to tribal partners. Problems of the sort that arose during the planning pr ocess for the Northern Cheyenne cluster conference could be avoided (or at least mitigated) if USDOJ staff spoke with a more unified voice, were explicit from the st art about the kinds of activities that could and could not be funded, and had assurance from all parties that the guidelines were mutually understood 67; tribal partners are savvy enough and creative enough to work within these 67 We note that the federal partners report having tried to inform the tribal partners of such limitations; our recommendation is that a still more explicit explanation is pr ovided in the future, and that it is mutually understood.

Alternatively, with adequate lead-time, the tribal partners could work to gain non- federal funding (tribal funds, foundation funds, pr ivate donations) to support more innovative and productive cluster meetings. It must also be noted that cluster meetings ar e not the only mechanism for promoting inter-tribal exchange of ideas. The coordinators and program partners could have visited each other, and thus learned from each other in a hands-on wa y; such exchanges are common in municipal government, for example. The federal partners also could have actively (and costlessly) encouraged the tribal partners to seek advi ce from one another. \"Have you talked to your counterpart at Oglala Sioux/Nort hern Cheyenne/Zuni about that?\" should have been a common question posed by the federal partners to the tribes.68 Of course, ther e are many other possibilities for peer-to-peer learning and inter- tribal exchange; additional ideas and discussion are presented in the preceding pa per (the cross-si te analysis). Goal: to develop a comprehensive planning and development process for safe and healthy tribal communities and, Goal: to foster true strategic planning and to increase the partne rship between tribes and USDOJ These related goals link comprehensive and strategi c planning to two very different but desirable outcomes - safer communities and improved government-to-government relations. While progress has not been linear and outcomes data to lend credibility to the first point is not yet available, several factors sugge st that CIRCLE has facilitated both the short-term means and longer-term outcomes expr essed in these goals. The tribes' CIRCLE Project applic ations are one piece of eviden ce that CIRCLE assists tribes with comprehensive and strategic planning. Especi ally for years two and three, the application process served as a tool and opportunity for strate gic planning, and the app lications that emerged for Northern Cheyenne and Zuni in 2000, and a ll three tribes in 200 1, reflected significant improvement in the development of st rategic and comprehensive plans. USDOJ also took other steps to promote compre hensive and strategic planning. For one, it recruited a fairly diverse set of programs to th e CIRCLE Project, so that tribes could develop multi-disciplinary responses to their crime and justice problems. Additionally, it provided strategic planning training sessi ons at both the kick-off meeting in Rapid City and at the Northern Cheyenne cluster conference. While trib es expressed a degree of dissatisfaction with both trainings, the second one in particular appe ared to contribute to improved year two CIRCLE applications. 68 This is not to say that no inter-tribal information exchange of this sort occurred. Federal personnel have provided a few examples of the inter-tribal exchange of ideas, an d VAWO supported at least one visit by a tribal program partner to another CIRCLE site. Yet tribal reports suggest that this sort of advice and action was uncommon. Thus, we emphasize the point that it should not have been. This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 56On the other hand, USDOJ did not do as much as it could have to develop and foster sound planning processes. As the grants manageme nt-oriented personnel pointed out early in CIRCLE's development, goal one (accelerated fundi ng) is itself a barrier to improved planning: good strategic and comprehensive planning takes tim e. In general, sound planning processes also require site-specific, problem-targeted technical assistance, especially in the form of baseline assessment, which was not really part of the CIRCLE Project.69 And, by allowing the tendency noted above - in which grant managers and tribal program directors reverted to more traditional grantor-grantee relationships as time went al ong - CIRCLE undermined its own promotion of comprehensive planning. Apparently, the pro cess of grant coordination offered too few opportunities and resources for system-based th inking, which limited grant managers' incentive to support tribes' work on strategi c, comprehensive plans. These obs tacles to strategic planning and comprehensive program development placed limits on how far USDOJ was able to go toward meeting its goals. In terms of outcomes, it is st ill too early to assess whether CIRCLE has improved the safety and health of the tribal communities in which it was implemented. The data presented above do speak to one aspect of improved community sa fety and health, however . By providing funding from a diverse range of grant programs, CIRCLE enables tribal communities to implement many different kinds of programs to address crime, jus tice, safety, and community health issues. As a result of CIRCLE, tribes have variously and among other things: strengthened their law enforcement data generation capacities (which help them better iden tify and act upon trouble spots and repeat offenders); provided safe places for youth to hang out, interact, and play (so that they are less inclined to turn to negative social behaviors such as drugs, alcohol, and crime); and created probation services (whi ch provide increased linkages be tween actions and consequences and, thus, help deter crime). The plan is to know more about ho w CIRCLE's component programs and tribal strategies are working at the conclusion of Phase II of the evaluation. Much more can be said about CIRCLE's effect s on federal-tribal relations. Considering the federal viewpoint first, intervie ws suggested that most federal CIRCLE partners are dedicated to working on a government-to-govern ment basis with tribes.70 Indeed, several interviewees noted that their involvement with CI RCLE has motivated them to maintain or even increase their involvement with tribal communitie s once the Project concludes. Fo r the grantmaking partners to CIRCLE - that is, for the grant managers in OJP and COPS - the nature of their interaction with tribes provides the best evidence of incr eased federal-tribal partnership and improved government-to-government relations. Many s upported improved government-to-government (institutional) relationships through the developm ent of positive personal relationships with the tribal coordinators and other tribal partners; the tribes repor ted noticing this di fference, noting, \"When we call, they [OJP and COPS grantmakers] call back.\" This was a much harder and more significant step for grantmaking staff than it might initially appear, as the ethic in their Offices 69 Some technology and law enforcement needs assessments did occur, but fairly late in the game; for example, for one of the tribes, fall 2002 was the estimated completion date of a COPS law enforcement equipment needs assessment. 70 In other words, the interviewees did not simply seem to be reiterating express USDOJ policy; rather, they discussed the relationship in terms that showed they understood its difficulties and possibilities.

However, other information from tribes sugg ests that CIRCLE's impact on federal-tribal partnership was not uniformly positive. Especi ally because statutory limitations and other funding constraints prevented the federal grantm akers from undertaking action that would have been unambiguously supportive of the government -to-government relationship (for example, supporting greater community involvement at Ogla la Sioux, letting the tribes have greater control over the cluster conference planning pr ocess, supporting ongoing strategic planning), federal partners sometimes appeared unsupportive of greater tribal-feder al partnership. This problem draws renewed attention to a point made in the cross-site analysis - that the next step should not be to retreat from co mprehensive programs and return to purely categorical support, but to continue to push forward toward pooled funding, waivers on statutory requirements, and substantial support for as sessment and planning. While the federal partners' co mmunication with the tribes was improved through CIRCLE, and as noted above, this improvement supported the sense of partne rship, visible breakdowns in communication undermined that sense. The Correcti ons Program Office's failure to ensure that the relevant parties at OST (not just the trib al President) knew that the Tribe would not be receiving fiscal year 2 002 corrections construction funds is an example.71 The breakdown in communication has weakened the partnership as mu ch (if not more) than the policy decision to not guarantee funds.72 With regard to the connection between strategi c planning and federal-tribal partnership in particular, both federal and trib al commentators suggested that CIRCLE's short time horizons and relatively limited investments in strategic pla nning stood in the way of a long-term sense of partnership. A government-to-gove rnment relationship isn't \"h ere today and gone tomorrow,\" and real partnership arises when the tribes se nse that the federal government is working with them over the long haul. Critically, substantial funding transfers are not the only indicator of a positive long-term relationship; personnel ava ilability, technical assistance, support for assessment or other planning efforts, and inst itutionalized training w ithin USDOJ on Native issues are other means of helping tribes feel that the partnership is lasting. Considering all these points in balance, it appears that CIRCLE has improved tribal-federal partnerships and promoted government-to-governme nt relationships. But without some sort of institutionalization and internalization of the learning and knowledge gained from CIRCLE (such as Departmental training in Indi an affairs) and without efforts to effect policy changes that can keep the tribes and the federal government focused on their partne rship (such as ongoing collaboration by grantmakers or block grants), these positive changes may prove ephemeral. 71 As discussed in the OST chapter, CPO did send letters in February and April 2001 to the OST President that obliquely and then directly advised the Tribe that progres s was too slow to warrant the award of third-year funds. But tribal representatives, including the OST CIRCLE Project Coordinator and Corrections Project Manager, who traveled to Washington, DC in August 2001 to discuss progress on the OST corrections center, were unaware of the letters and, thus, unaware of CPO's decision. 72 OST remains eligible for competitive funding from CPO for construction of a new detention facility. This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 58Goal: to address (or at least draw attent ion to) the baseline roadblock that tribes have in developing comprehensive programs - serious gaps in their criminal justice systems While it is not clear that this understanding has broadly permeated USDOJ, or even OJP and COPS, the six Offices and Bureaus collaborati ng on CIRCLE Project fu nding were forced, time and again, to recognize the limitations on action pos ed by system gaps. For example, increasing the size of the police force has a limited impact on law enforcement if there are too few prosecutors, judges, jail spaces, and/or probation o fficers to make police o fficers' citations have bite. Given that they faced these problem s, the federal partners also worked with the tribal partners to fill the gaps. With reference to the example above, CIRCLE Project f unding paid not only for more police officers but also for court process se rvers, court development to decrease caseloads and track offenders, and probation officers and services, and will eventually provide increased detention space. Goal: to highlight the need for additional and more consis tent resources for tribal law enforcement projects (and to remedy th e problem, at least for a little while, for the three participating tribes) Again, this understanding is held and shared by the core federal partners (the OJP and COPS grant managers who funded CIRCLE) and by a numb er of other Offices and individuals within USDOJ (for example, the Office of the American Indian and Alaska Native Desk in OJP and the Office of Tribal Justice), but ma y not be widely shared across ot her grant and policy makers in the Department. In terms of the actual flow of resources, it is worth underlining that because the CIRCLE Project simply accelerated existing grant funds but did not commit new USDOJ funds to Indian country, CIRCLE did not increase the resources of tribes (although it may have redistributed them). In other words, these funds would have been spent on programs in Indian country (although perhaps not at these tribal sites) even in the ab sence of CIRCLE. It is not even necessarily the case that CIRCLE tribes received more funding that non-CIRCLE partners; a successful tribal grant-seeker might have been able to stitch together and equally impressive package and not have been subject to the same intense scrutiny. In at least one case, CIRCLE tribes received less funding that non-CIRCLE tribes - non-CIRCL E tribes receive TYP funding based on population, but the CIRCLE tribes received a set am ount, which, because they were all relatively populous tribes, was smaller than what they woul d have received through the traditional grant process. For the three years of CIRCLE, it seems clear that the Pueblo of Zuni and the Northern Cheyenne Tribe (neither of which experien ced a CIRCLE funding freeze or uncertainty around the third year of corrections construction funding, as did the Og lala Sioux Tribe) did receive funding from USDOJ in a more consistent ma nner than they would have without CIRCLE. Again, it was the guarantee of funds from the federa l partners that generated this consistency. When looking beyond the three years of Project f unding, however, the guarantee is gone and any strong sense of \"consistency\" in funding is probably gone too. Ye t a weaker version of \"more This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 59consistent funding\" does result from CIRCLE in the medium run: the federal partners are now much better informed about each other's programs and can better direct tribal applicants to appropriate and additional funding sources when que stions arise. Of cour se, this benefit lasts only as long as the personnel involved with CIRCLE remain and the current grant program structure lasts. Conclusion: Progress and Productive Tension In every instance, evidence from this review of the federal government's involvement with the CIRCLE Project suggests that the Project helped USDOJ move in the direction of its goals. Sometimes the movement was not very far, but it was progress nonetheless. Sometimes the progress resulted in the face of difficult tensions - between \"po licymakers\" and \"grantmakers,\" between the tribes and USDOJ, and perhaps even among the gr antmakers themselves. But the progress suggests that the tensi on was productive, and with that result, USDOJ ought to think seriously about how to build on and move forward from the CIRCLE Project. Likewise, the Department's overseers within Congress and the Executive Branch ought to recognize the importance of the progress made through CIRC LE and provide USDOJ with opportunities and incentives to expand upon the effort - through, for example, legislative di rectives, revisions in program goals, authorizing legisl ation, direct appropriations, and Executive orders. The cross- site analysis, presented in the previous chapte r, offers additional, specific advice on the way forward. This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

The specific Offices/Bureaus, grant programs, and their acronyms are: The Office of Community Oriented Polic ing Services (COPS) grant program The Office of Victims of Crime Children' s Justice Act (OVC-CJA) grant program The Office of Victims of Crime Victim Assistance in Indian Country (OVC- VAIC) grant program The Bureau of Justice Assistance gr ant for the CIRCLE coordinator position (BJA-Coordinator) The Bureau of Justice Assistance Tribal Court Program (BJA-TCP) The Office of Juvenile Justice and Deli nquency Prevention Tribal Youth Program (OJJDP-TYP) The Office of Juvenile Justice and Deli nquency Prevention Volunteers for Tribal Youth Program (OJJDP-VYTP) The Violence Against Women Office (VAWO) grant program The Corrections Program Office (CPO) grant program In the first two years of CIRCLE, the Offices /Bureaus engaged in an Inter-Agency Agreement (IAA) to transfer funds from their indivi dual budgets to the CIRCLE budget; funds were disbursed from this budget as tribes' applications were appr oved. In 2001, the third and final year of CIRCLE funding, the application proce ss was accelerated and th e total funding levels were determined after the applications were received. The charts below reflect these funding arrangements and indicate only one instance in which the Project committed more money to tribal programs than was available in the IAA; VAWO funds were overspent by $50 in fiscal year 2000. This negative and all the positives (insta nces in which the tribes did not apply for all of the funds available) carried over to the subsequent year of CIRCLE funding. The \"N/A\" entries in the CPO row of Tables A1, A3, and A4 reflect the fact that CPO did not have a specific amount targeted at CIRCLE for fiscal year 1999 or 2000 . CPO's only constraint was its overall budget of $34 million for all its Indian Country projects. The \"N/A\" entries in the CPO row of Tables A2 and A5 reflect the fact that CPO only guaranteed funding for the first two years of CIRCLE; any further funding was related to a Tribe's progress. Th e \"N/A\" entries in the OJJDP rows of Tables A1, A2, A4, and A5 refl ect the fact that the VTYP and TYP committed, respectively, to only one and two years of CIRCLE funding (although for 36-month budgets). The \"N/A\" entries in the final column of Table A5 reflect the absence of an IAA in fiscal year 2001. In total, the tribes participating in CIRCLE received more than $30 million over three years to improve their justice systems. Table A2 lists the actual amounts awarde d by program by fiscal This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department.

Tables A3-A5 show the actual amounts awarded by tribe by fiscal year. In brief, the Oglala Sioux Tribe received $11.6 million, the Northern Cheyenne Tribe received $10.2 million, and the Pueblo of Zuni received $8.5 million.

In keepi ng with the guiding principles of a participatory evaluation, the evaluation team work ed with the Zuni leadership group to identify their priorities for this phase of the work. As a re sult of these disc ussions, we used our early site visits to gain a basic but clear understanding of the design of the initiative and considerable time during subsequent site visits to construct a theory of change or logic model, which we describe in the attachments to this report. These attachment s also include a calendar describing progress to date and highlights of a preliminary evalua tion plan for Phase II of this effort. I. The Context The Pueblo of Zuni is located approximately 120 miles west of Albuquerque in western New Mexico. The setting is beautiful ; the semi-arid climate and high elevation provide for stunning vistas and blue skies almost every day of the year. Ther e are approximately 10,000 enrolled tribal members on the reservatio n and a total of just over 11,000 residents. The tribe is considered a \"young\" tribe with over a third of the residents between the ages of 6 and 20. The reservation is relati vely large; at approximately 638 squa re miles it occupies an area nearly the size of Rhode Island. Most residents live in or near the Zuni community, clustered in somewhat densely populated villages. Tribal cult ure is especially strong and native language use is quite high (over 95%). Tribal government and politics are relatively stable when compared to the other sites in this initiative and to Indian country overall. Th is has created a fairly secure environment for the ambitious \"system chang e\" agenda pursued by the Zuni steering group. The Zuni are not a gaming tribe, nor are they considered to have a robust economic base. Unemployment is high (over 65%). Family income is far below national averages at around $7,000 per household (but note that the per capita income for residents of New Mexico is among the lowest in the nation). Substantially over half the children residing on the reservation live in poverty; 100% qualify for the federal free lunch program. II. The Development of CIRCLE at the Pueblo of Zuni Hayes Lewis, formerly the Development Direct or at the Tribal Office of Planning and Development, is responsible for the early development of the Pueb lo of Zuni CIRCLE initiative. His leadership in combination with the Pueblo's relative political stabilit y, progressive thinking about system change, and strong departmental leader ship were critical to this formative stage. This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 65Mr. Lewis authored the basic desi gn of the initiative. He prepared the first and second CIRCLE applications, the second with the participati on of Tyler Lastiyano, th e Zuni CIRCLE Project Coordinator. Through the time of this report, Mr. Lewis con tinued to play an important but informal role in the development of the initiativ e. The continuing growth and development of the initiative is the product of a gradually widening core leadersh ip group, most especially Mr. Lastiyano and a relatively small group of key depa rtment heads and tribal leaders. This group includes the Chief of Police and the Tribal Judge (both of wh ich attended the first cluster meeting and have been involved in CIRCLE since its inception).73 The basic design of the initiative has not changed in any major way during its development. This is a positive attribute - it means that the authors of the initiative outlined an approach capable of weathering significant challenges (the Zuni CIRCLE Project has f aced both political and fiscal challenges). The initiative also ha s benefited from the participation of talented management able to draw on a variety of internal and external resources necessary to its continued growth and development. There are a number of important co mponents in the overall approach, but perhaps the three most criti cal are the following: A clearly designed logic model that links investments in program development and system functioning to the key outcomes the tribe seeks (that is, those related to \"breaking the cycle of violence\" at Zuni) Particular attention to the developmen t and strengthening of system functioning through investment in a management information system, the development of interagency protocols, a nd the coordinator's role A focus on strengthening core institutions, including the police department, corrections (most especially correctional faci lities), youth services, and the nexus of agencies and facilities focu sed on reducing family violence III. The Zuni CIRCLE Project Logic Mode l (or Theory of Change): Linking Core Outcomes to Programmatic Initiatives Getting Started on Identifying Measurable Outcomes As noted, the CIRCLE initiative at Zuni has been car efully framed as an effort to break the cycle of violence. The basic strategy for moving towa rd this goal includes both programmatic and agency-change efforts. The hope is that these effort s to break the cycle of violence will result in a variety of specific outcomes, whic h are described in more refined detail in three attached charts 73 Originally, the Pueblo of Zuni established a Governing Board for the management and oversight of the CIRCLE Project. This has since been designated as the CIRCLE Tribal Support Team. The following individuals (listed along with the offices which they represente d) have participated on the Tribal Support Team: Tyler Lastiyano, Tribal Coordinator; Hayes A. Lewis, Development Director, Office of Planning and Development; Shirley Bellson, Tribal Administrator; Lt. Governor Barton Martza; Head Councilman Eldred Bowekaty; Syverson Homer, Captain of the Zuni Police Department; Judge Albert Banteah, Zuni Tribal Courts; Reb ecca Quam, Acting Director of Social Services; Jerome Haskie, Department Head of Public Sa fety; and Verona Yamutewa, Acting Program Director of the Shelter and Zuni Violence Against Women Programs. Participation on the Team is based on departmental relevance to CIRCLE initiative or leadership. This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 66(briefly introduced below). The CIRCLE steeri ng group at Zuni will \"know\" their strategy has been successful if the following occurs: Reports of domestic violence increase in the short term, while incidents of domestic violence decrease in the long term Reports of child abuse and neglect increas e in the short term, while incidents of child abuse and neglect d ecrease in the long term Juvenile crime decreases over time, with a possible near-term increase Alcohol abuse decreases over time, w ith a possible near-term increase Repeat offending for selected indi cator crimes decreases over time (These \"indicators\" will be particularly valuable for demonstrating improved system functioning. They will provide answers to questi ons such as: once offenders come to the attention of the system, does the justice system function sufficiently well - in terms of soci al services, punishment, and related correctional activities - th at the likelihood of repeat offending is reduced? To begin with, the tribe will look for increasing periods be tween initial offenses and re-offending. If, for example, the \"typical\" or average time between DUI arrests is 3 months, the goal will be to extend that to 4-6 months.) A vast reduction in \"families that fall through the cracks,\" or cases that fail to receive appropriate/adequate services (For example, if a woman seeks prot ection from an abusive spouse through a restraining order, are the terms of the order followed up on appropriately and are adequate shelter and services provide d? The CIRCLE team at Zuni will use periodic case audits to determine how well the system functions for the individuals and families that come to its attention.74) Building the Logic Model An important objective of our work with the Tribal Coordinator and other members of the steering committee at Zuni was to match thes e outcomes with programmatic activities and strategies - the underlying question being whet her or not the initiative's managers could reasonably expect progress on these outcomes given the investments they have made in system building, program development, and improved agency performance. The steering group - in particular the CIRCLE Coor dinator - identified the specific e fforts linked to the above outcomes. There is considerable (intentional) overlap in these lists. 74 The third evaluation site visit to Zuni included a review of potential tools for auditing system functioning and early work on modifying those tools to \"fit\" the goals of the Zuni CIRCLE Project and the Pueblo's cultural and demographic context. The remainder of this work will be completed in Phase II of the evaluation. This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

The key products requested by the Zuni CIRCLE team are the attached charts, which assemble the components described above into a coherent logic model (or theory of change) and evaluation framework for the ongoing efforts at Zuni. The following specific documents are attached: Chart I: Linking Programs and Strategies to Goals/Results Chart II: Linking Goals/Results to Measurable Indicators This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Discussion of System Change Efforts The key components of the Zuni CIRCLE initiative's system change efforts are identified above; this section describes them in greater detail. This section also describes other valuable resources developed by the Zuni CIRCLE partners for movi ng the process of system change (and system strengthening) forward. Using Technology to Support System Integration An automated case management system (dubbed Full Court) links the tribal court, probation, the detention and jail facility, child welfare, the substance abuse treatment center (the recovery center), and the domestic violence service provider to each other. This permits joint (coordinated) case management of offenders as they move through the criminal justice system. Just as importantly, it permits coordinated service delivery for children, battered spouses, youthful offenders, families in need of services , and crime victims as they move through the relevant institutions encompassed by the CIRCLE initiative. Full Court, however, operates not only as a case management tool but also as an outcomes reporting tool. This provides the CIRCLE steeri ng group with the ability to link these two activities, which will be an important asset as the group enters Phase II of the evaluation. Additionally, Full Court has the ab ility to provide the tribe with accurate data regarding crime trends. The tribe is making parallel efforts to impr ove record keeping regard ing calls for service, incident reports, arrests, and geographic mapping of these demands on police and other justice system agencies. The Role of Facility Development in System Building The CIRCLE initiative has funded major new compone nts of the facilities infrastructure - in particular, facilities needed to support services/p rograms in areas that typically have contributed both to system breakdown and to problems in th e performance of individual institutions. For example, it is common for domestic violence to be underreported in Indian country. One aspect of the problem is that victims are vulnerable to reprisal; without access to emergency shelter and food for themselves and their children if they need to leave the house for safety,75 they may be fearful of reporting such crimes or fail to fo llow-up in pressing charges. While the CIRCLE initiative at Zuni focused on the development of a women's shelter, that shelter currently appears to be underutilized. The logic model and Phase II evaluation plan provide the means for both monitoring the utilizati on of the facility and determining causal factors for its under use (the system audit tools to be empl oyed during the second phase of th e evaluation will be especially helpful in this regard). Presently, the fact that th e shelter is underutilized may be a significant but predictable sign that the justice system at Zuni is not yet fully functioning. Indeed, while other \"system\" infrastructure needs (relevant to addr essing domestic violence) are yet to be met, the relatively recent development of the shel ter represents important progress. 75 A directly related problem is th e lack of jail space for offenders. This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 69Of course, the CIRCLE initiative at Zuni also includes the devel opment of correctional facilities. These facilities will not only addr ess critical issues of capacity and help the tribe meet minimal standards for correctional condi tions, but also enable the tr ibe to greatly enhance its programming for key crime categories such as alcohol-related crimes. The Role of the Program Coordinator The CIRCLE coordinator role emerged as a part icularly important force in promoting and sustaining system change at Zuni. This seems to be a function of two factors. First, the Coordinator at Zuni is highly competent and committed. Second, the position - whether by intent or accident - is designed in such a way that it effectively promotes syst em change. There are two important reasons for this: The position does not include a staff or department that creates a significant management burden for the coordinator. Thus, the coordinators are provided the opportunity to focus more fully on a ch ange agenda. (In actual fact, the coordinators have substantia l administrative duties but they are not constant and have permitted periods of intense focus on system change issues). The program coordinators do not have departmental affiliations. Thus, the coordinators have not generally been perc eived as having a part icular \"turf\" or other set of narrow interests to serve or defend and have b een better able to fulfill their primary role as change agents. Given their importance, effectivel y supporting the coordinators in th eir role is worth the serious consideration of the architects of this initiative (t he cross-site analysis pr ovides a full discussion of this issue). This is not necessarily a simp le proposition, as the role and its demands are somewhat complex (illustrated by the statement of the Zuni Coordinator in the footnote below).76 76 Tyler Lastiyano's description of his role as CIRCLE coordinator: \"As the conductor for this insane orchestra, I involve my self in a number of differ ent programs. I serve as a technical resource advisor. For many programs, I serve as another layer of bureaucracy to obtain program support. In most cases, I serve as an advocate for the prog rams, and I have not heard any complaints yet. \"My role as Tribal Coordinator had many wondering what exac tly I was coordinating? In the year I have been in this position I have managed to coordinate various programs to meet on a regular basis, conduct working sessions, evaluate programs, and provide much needed t echnical assistance for th e programs involved. \"My whole emphasis is not politically motivated which had been assumed by program directors. I have no desire to hold public office and strive only on accomplishment for the betterment of our community. Once program directors saw that I work day and night to improve their programs and that I speak on their behalf, I have gained their respect and confidence. \"I prioritize on issues expressed during our monthly meetings and on issues that need to be addressed based on the nature of the issue. I walk through once a week to thos e programs involved and see how employees are doing and ask for their input. I conduct ride-alongs with the Police Department and sit in on trials from time to time. \"Basically I am in a position where I ha ve access to support from the U.S nationa l level and state level. With that, I express these issues at the tribal level and make my recommendations and strategies for improvement.\" This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 70Development of Interagency Protocols Representatives from participating agencies are working together to develop policies and procedures that better coordinate the work of key system components. For example, in order to ensure a more coordinated effort, the police depa rtment and staff from the women's shelter have worked together to develop policies and procedur es that prescribe what officers should do when domestic violence is reported. One such new protocol requires th at when a report of domestic violence is made, a victims' advocate joins poli ce when they respond to the scene. This set of policies and procedures also instructs officers to make an arrest if a basic set of conditions is present (which was not done in the past). The development of interagency protocols for cer tain classes of offens es (domestic violence, abuse and neglect) has been completed, with th ese protocols sometimes linked to Full Court. That is, Full Court has the capacity to identify when appropriate follow-up services have been provided or when obligations imposed by the court are fulfilled. Addressing Family Violence Through Interagency Protocols We interviewed both a children's and a victims advocate during our first two site visits. The purpose of these interviews was to get a sense of the ability of new cross-agency protocols to change front-line practice. In other words, we wanted to know whether the mechanisms put in place through CIRCLE were effective in promoti ng meaningful cooperation across agencies and systems (\"meaningful cooperation\" occurs if linking agency/system operations actually makes a difference for the families in the system). One way cross-agency protocols could make a positive difference is in the smoothness and appropriatene ss of a client's path through the system; for example, effective cross-agency protocols might in crease the likelihood that, when an incident of domestic violence is reported, an investigation an d arrest are made and a woman and her children are moved into appropriate shelter. Other eviden ce of effective cross-agency protocols might be that the services offered to a family are of a higher quality (the services are culturally appropriate, are delivered on time, and so on) th an they would be in the absence of such cooperation. Discussion: Using Interagency Protocols and Agreements to Build and Strengthen System Functioning The ability of such interagency protocols to im prove system functioning is mediated by several factors, including the quality of staff, staff buy-in into system change, and the quality of the protocols themselves. Presumably, a very strong system change effort will work even with average staff possessing minimal commitment to cha nge. Our site visits to Zuni indicated that CIRCLE might be: Beginning to succeed in getting low or aver age quality staff with minimal buy-in to make the right system connections for the clients/families they serve Providing an opportunity for hi gh-quality staff with signif icant buy-in to not only make the right system connections for cl ients but also provide them with higher quality services than in the past This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 71It will, of course, require much more eviden ce to confirm these observations. The system auditing processes to be implemented in Phase II will be particularly valuable in that regard. Building a Constituency for Change The initiative has brought representatives from multiple agencies together and promoted the development of strong personal/professional relati onships - thereby buildi ng a fairly broad-based local constituency for system change and refo rm. This has helped the overall effort weather political change and other threats to its sustaina bility. What's more, this local constituency has used its resources (funding and othe rs) to support the development of new leadership in critical areas (a new chief of police and a new police captain, for example). Not only are these new leaders committed to improving the performance of the overall system by implementing changes specific to their department or agency (such as community policing), but they further strengthen the local constituency for sustained improvement of the overall system with their general buy-in of the CIRCLE initiative. V. Discussion of Agency and Institutional Change Efforts Implementing Community Policing The CIRCLE initiative is promoting important change (and reform) within the Zuni police department. The department, which the tribe opte d to manage via a P.L. 93-638 contract several years ago, is making a significant attempt to move to community policing. This effort is likely to bring the department into broad and deep contact with the tribal community and, as a result, may increasingly legitimize the police function loca lly (that is, through close involvement in the community, police who exercise their authority on behalf of the commun ity will increasingly seek community approval for such actions). Over half of the department will be dedicated to community policing. Basically, the Zuni Police Department is rema rkably similar to the \"typical\" department described in the Harvard study of po licing in Indian Country (Wakeling et al. 2001). This is a department of 20-plus uniformed officers pa trolling a community of around 10,000 living in a relatively limited geographic area. The number of officers has expanded r ecently and there are a number of young, inexperienced of ficers in the department (and like many other departments in Indian country, the Zuni force faces challenges in recruiting and retaining qualified officers). 77 At the time of our visits, all of the members of the department were tribal members and all were Native language speakers. As with other smal l departments both within and outside Indian country, the officers here function as generalists: they ha ve responsibility for a fairly wide range of duties other than simply patrolling the co mmunity. The department's budget is within the normal range for departments of this size in Indi an country, meaning that it faces significant but perhaps not overwhelming resource issues. Memb ers of the CIRCLE steering committee believe the department has a good relationship with the community, and our interviews with important observers of the department-community relationship support this assertion. 77 For example, it has difficulty attracting officers with appropriate educational back grounds and competes with local police jurisdictions for qu alified, experienced officers. This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 72The problems the department addresses are also qu ite similar to those of other tribal communi- ties, although there are a few notable variations. As in many other tribal communities, the crime problem that absorbs most of the department's a ttention and resources is alcohol-related crime, ranging from disorderly behavior and simple assault to drivi ng while under the influence and family violence (including child neglect and abuse issues and domestic violence). Unlike a number of other tribes, however , the level of youth violence and street crime appears to be relatively low. Although youth gangs are said to be a problem, ther e is little evidence of youth gang activity (in crime data, in youth weari ng gang-style clothing, in graffiti, etc.). It is clear that a tremendous am ount of energy has been devot ed to increasing the number of trained officers on the police force. But signs of a significant move to community policing strategies are already emerging: The department is utilizing a bike patrol in densely populated areas of the middle village and other areas. As of December 11, 2001, the Zuni Tenant Committee, a community- organization, agreed to community polici ng training and citizens patrol training available through the CIRCLE Project. This program will have volunteers conducting ride-a-longs, foot patrols, and neighborhood watches. Funding for off duty officers to provide additional servic es has been obtained through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The Zuni steering committee is planning ways to strength en the cultural relevance and legitimacy of the patrol function. Developing Services and Supports for At-Risk Youth During the first two site visits, we met with several youth and the staff that serve them at the Youth Center (formerly a Baptist Church). The trib al census as of July 2001 indicates there is a population of 3,022 youth from 6-20 years of age. Y outh Center weekly a ttendance averages 50- 60+ youth from the general public (not includ ing the court referred youth and youth suspended from school). The paragraphs below outline the pr ogram rationale and current operation of the Youth Center as described to the Zuni evalua tion team by the Coordinator, Tyler Lastiyano. Staffing A staff of six oversees the Center. The youth pe r staff ratio was an early problem in the development of Center programming - sugge sting especially strong demand for youth programming. In response, the tribal Workfo rce Investment Act pr ogram provided three additional staff. Activities and Programs The Center is developing a number of recreatio nal and cultural activit ies for youth, including movie nights, basketball, and instruc tion in building Zuni outdoor ovens ( hornos ). Notably, many of the youth participat ing in these programs and activities are said to be at some risk (though that might be said of most children and youth on the reservation). But these efforts are not casual. Great care has been taken to tie them in with the overall CIRCLE initiative at Zuni This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 73and to ensure that the youth that most need these services are identified and served. The effort is not yet fully developed and is li kely to be modified significantly over time, but it represents a strong start on worthwh ile youth programming. The Youth Center is open Monday/Wednesday/F riday for the general public. Tutoring in all subjects is provided from 3:00- 5:00 p.m., then scheduled activ ities are provided. The Center features a 16-week program for all court-referr ed youth, and is open on Tuesday and Thursday only for them. These two days are very comprehensive. All youth must attend counseling and participate in a service-lear ning project. They must also provide a volunteer from their immediate family to participate in activities. At the end of the 16-week program, a graduation is held for the participants. This is a mandatory fa mily session. If a participant fails to show or participate, the case gets referred back to the c ourts where a bench warrant is issued. Two groups have completed the program; the first group c onsisted of 30+ students, and the next group consisted of 40+ students. Links to Schools The Youth Center recently sign ed a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the Zuni Public School District to extend services to all short- and long-term suspended students. The issue here was that suspended students were sent home, wh ich served best as a short-term vacation. Now upon suspension the parents are referred to the Ce nter for orientation and placement of their child. No students are allowed to go home. Ex cept for service learning, the Center provides essentially the same set of services to susp ended students as it does to court-ordered youth. A recent MOA enables Youth Center staff to wo rk with school staff on academics and behavior problems by communicating with the school couns elors and teachers at any given time. The program also works in cooperation with the trib al probation officer who keeps track of youth regarding their alcohol a nd substance use along with other rela ted offenses. In addition, the Full Court system will link service providers to the Zuni Youth Center. Service Learning Initiative Service learning is geared to assist community members who n eed work done around at their homes. Projects include wood chopping, area beau tification, minor carpe ntry work, building ramps for the elderly, replacing windows, and so forth. The work allows youth to see their accomplishments, feel community members' apprecia tion, and thus, gain a sense of self worth. In January 2002 the Zuni Public School District hired a full-time educator to work with youth in the service learning program on their academics while the Youth Center Staff work on their behavior. This position will be transferred to th e new correctional facility upon its completion to provide educational servi ces for the service populati on within the facility. VI. Strategic Challenges While the progress made thus far at the Pueblo of Zuni is substantial, the Zuni CIRCLE Project nevertheless faces some important strategic challenges. During our interviews and research, three primary challenges emerged. We discuss them briefly below: This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

One of the most formidable challenges facing the local CIRCLE stakehol ders will be the development of a sustained funding stream adequate to support continued system building and reform; in other words, the challenge is to sustain a change agenda without the fiscal resources to support some key aspects of program and institutional development (including, for example, fac ility development). Most observers of change initiatives cite maintaining change efforts over a long period of time as a key leadership task (see Gardner 2000). This requires a combination of highly developed fundraising, fiscal mana gement, and political skills. The second major challenge the local stake holders face is whether and/or to what degree and how they wish to incorporate culture into the design of the individual agencies and institutions that make up their justice system. We cite elsewhere in this report the critical role that \"cultura l match\" plays in institutional performance in Indian country. This rese arch strongly suggests that an alignment between the form and powers of a government's contem porary institutions and the form and powers of its pre-reservation institutions is most likely to generate institutional stability and legitimacy. Yet, that \"match\" is not typical: the U.S. government created the twentieth-century governments of most tribes, over-riding indigenous institutions. In cases where tribes we re fortunate enough to avoid imposed constitutions or where, fortuitously, the imposed structure is well matched to pre- reservation forms, tribes are performing well; but where match is poor, tribes are struggling. 78 Currently, the Zuni coordinator and other lo cal partners plan to develop culturally appropriate treatment regimens, corr ectional tools, and case management practices by drafting new po licies and procedures and modifying relevant tribal codes. We are not certain these measures are sufficient to achieve a meaningful cultural match in these institutions. Our observations and interviews at Zuni indicate that the tribe is making a str ong effort to implement community policing, but that it has generally adopt ed that model as it is deployed in urban settings with strikingly different cultural contexts. As we state in our cross-site analysis, the challenge for the Zuni will be to determin e, given their cultural context, whether or not and to what degree they wish to \"redesign\" the systems that animate and guide policing and other components of their criminal justice system - such as the organizational structures of the relevant departments, tribal personnel and training systems, local management information and control systems, and tribal agencies that conduct strategic planning - so that they are linked to a vision shaped by the Zuni's needs, beliefs, prio rities, and resources. As a re sult of such redesign, the tribe's criminal justice system would likely become more indigenous (or self- determined), more likely to build upon and reinforce important cultural norms and 78 This point is based on research by Stephen Cornell and Joseph P. Kalt, especially Cornell and Kalt (1995) . This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department.

The third major strategic challenge for the local Zuni steering group will be to successfully negotiate the political e nvironment over the period necessary to consolidate and institutionalize the system changes they have achieved thus far. The key will be measures such as enteri ng successful partners hips with potential competitors (other agencies or constituen cies with competing change agendas or approaches to service delivery), developi ng a wide array of political allies, and avoiding unnecessary political rivalries a nd conflicts. The Zuni political dynamics were moderately stable, especially relative to a number of othe r tribes. But as in any other community (Indian or non-Indi an), politics are unpr edictable and not consistently rational, and the CIRCLE leadership will face substantial political management challenges as they nurse their initiative to maturity. In summary, we are acknowledging the tremendous task ahead of the Zuni CIRCLE initiative's leadership, despite the significan t progress achieved thus far. VII.

Involvement in the CIRCLE Project offers the Tribe an opportunity to further develop its youth crime prevention strategy a nd to offer services former comprehensive programs were unable to provide. Furthermore, th e Tribe's prior experience with comprehensive crime prevention programs established a str ong foundation for the Northern Cheyenne CIRCLE Project. Although comprehensive programs promise progress on especially difficu lt problems (including crime and substance abuse), their complexity poses a serious challenge to evaluators. One solution is to employ a \"theory of chang e\" methodology. This methodology enables program participants to work with evaluators to identify (1) the idea or theory behind the initiative, (2) process-oriented evidence demonstr ating that programmatic changes in line with the theory are occurring, and (3) indicators of program success. The theory of change for the Northern Cheyenne CIRCLE Project is rooted in the Tribe's experience with the Risk Focused Prevention Project, the Indian Countr y Justice Initiative, and th e Weed and Seed Program. The Northern Cheyenne steering committee embr aced the theory-of-change approach. Not only did it employ a methodology appropriate for the servic es offered, but it also was participatory in nature, allowing members of the CIRCLE team to di rect and participate in evaluation activities. The Steering Committee also embraced the idea of utilizing qualitative data and, where possible, quantitative data to describe program progress a nd to assess Project success. Detailed, in-person interviews with key personnel and staff of the Pr oject were primary eval uation activities planned by the Harvard team and the Northern Chey enne CIRCLE Project Steering Committee. To supplement these, the evaluation ac tivities incorporated a written survey that targeted the three main parties involved in CIRCLE: Participants (or clients and their famili es who have been served by the CIRCLE Project) Partners (primarily Steering Committee members) Staff (of the partner programs in CIRCLE) This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 87The data collected would be used to assess not only the development of the Project according to the Steering Committee's theory of change, but also to create a ba seline for any future evaluation activities. The prior history of comprehensive programs on th e reservation and the short period of time that CIRCLE has existed make it difficult to assess the direct impact of CIRCLE. However, qualitative data combined with limited quan titative data provide some key findings. They include: The CIRCLE Project has a core group of de dicated staff and pa rtners who have a history of working together and who believe the CIRCLE Project is making a difference in their community. There is less communication among the broa der set of CIRCLE partners and their staffs, which has limited system-w ide understanding of CIRCLE programs, services, and goals. Although most clients and families are satis fied with the services they have received from the CIRCLE Project, many remain unaware of the full menu of services available and would like to know more about other services offered. The CIRCLE Project at Northern Cheyenne has made considerable progress towards the Steering Committee's goals and objectives, especially considering its limited resources and the social and economic problems on the reservation. The Project has been able to build upon its history of working together to form a dedicated core team. The Project is increasingly tied to the nation- building process occurring within the Northern Cheyenne Tribe a nd, as such, is subject to the growing pains associated with this process. Looking to the future, the evalua tion team has identified severa l areas that might assist the CIRCLE Project in moving forwar d: strategic visioning and pl anning, community building, leadership development, a CIRCLE Project newsle tter, active involvement of the Tribal Council in CIRCLE activities and traini ng, and teambuilding activities for CIRCLE Project Steering Committee and staff. I. The State of Northern Cheyenne 81 Situated on more than 800 square miles in s outheastern Montana, the Northern Cheyenne Reservation is comprised of fi ve districts: Lame Deer, As hland, Busby, Muddy Cluster, and Birney. Lame Deer is the largest community, the seat of tribal government, and the center of most business, non-profit, educational, and fede ral activities on the rese rvation. Approximately 98% of the reservation is Indian owned; 77% is tribally owned. Approximately 55% of the 7,800 enrolled members live on the reservation. 81 Most statistics in this section are taken from the three CIRCLE applications submitted by the Northern Cheyenne Tribe. This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 88The economy is based predominately on agricultu re and ranching, although very few tribal members are employed in this economic sector (N ative-owned land is leased to non-Natives for farming and ranching). The combined government agencies are the largest employer in the community, accounting for 250 full-time and 229 pa rt-time employees. Unemployment averages 65% annually, with rates reaching as high as 80% during the winter months (Bureau of Indian Affairs 1997). Among employed tribal members, 22% have incomes below the poverty level. Median household income in 1997 was $14,200. The communities surrounding the reservation offer very little opportunity for employment, and many tribal member s lack the necessary training or the skills to compete for the jobs that are available. Major health problems such as substance abuse and domestic violence are contributing to the breakdown of family structures with the Tribe. Family involvement in school activities is low, while dropout and daily truancy rates are high. Lame Deer High School dropout rates from 1997 to 1999 were 300% higher than the state of Montana dropout rate. Since 1997, enrollment at Chief Dull Knife College (the tribal college) is down 60%. More than 85% of the students in the Lame Deer School system consistently fall below the 50th percentile in math and reading on national achievement tests. The youth of today are the decision-makers of to morrow. With more than 60% of the Tribe's population being age 30 or younger, it is especia lly clear that the cha llenge of developing a healthy, sustainable nation rests predominantly with the younger generations. In order to contribute, however, many Northern Cheyenne youth must overcome enormous difficulties stemming from their socioeconomic situation. Th e Northern Cheyenne CIRCLE Project, with its focus on improved justice system services to yout h, has great potential to contribute positively to this process. II. Political/Cultural History Prior to European contact, traditional governme nt among the Northern Cheyenne centered on the Council of Forty-Four and the Mi litary Societies and War Council of Twenty-Four. E. Adamson Hoebel, an anthropologist who co-authored The Cheyenne Way (1941) with Karl Llewellyn, describes the Tribe's Forty-Four during the of the Cheyenne social stru cture is the tribal council of forty-four peace chiefs. War may be a major concer n of the Cheyenne's...yet clearly the Cheyenne's sense that a more fundamental problem is the danger of disintegration through internal dissension and aggres sive impulses of Cheyenne against Cheyenne. Hence, the supreme constitutional authority of the tribe lies not in the hands of the aggressive wa r leaders but under the contro l of even-tempered peace chiefs. All the peace chiefs are proven warriors, but when a chief of a military association is raised to the rank of p eace chief, he must resign his post in the military society. He retains his membership , but not his position as war chief. The fundamental separation of civil and military powers, with the supremacy of the civil, which is characteristic of so many Am erican Indian tribes and is written into the Constitution of the United States, is most explicit in the unwritten constitution This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 89of the Cheyenne nation. A Cheyenne peace ch ief is chosen for a definite term of office - ten years - and ritua lly inducted as a member of the council. Each chief is representative of his band (note: four ch iefs for each of the ten bands plus four head priest-chiefs) and is always a h eadman of an extended family. The personal requirements for a tribal chief, reiterated again and again by Cheyennes, are even- tempered good nature, energy, wisdom, kind liness, concern for the well-being of others, courage, generosity and altrui sm (Hoebel 1978, p. 43; a similar point is made in Moore 1996, p. 162). Under no circumstance could a chief be impeached or deposed during his ten-year term of office, not even for murder. If the chief was still alive at the end of his term, he chose his own successor from within his own band, ensuring that every band had at least four representatives on the council. There were no economic advantages to be ing a chief, only respect and honor. In addition to ruling on matters of camp policy, the council acted as a judicial bo dy in cases involving criminality ( ibid., especially pp. 50-52). Unlike some other tribes, the Cheyenne went to great lengths to integr ate their bands into a Cheyenne nation. Also unlike other tribes, such as the Lakota, in which a band or division might or might not respect the declaration of war made by other bands, the Cheyenne absolutely required every band to participat e (Moore 1996, especially p. 90). Administratively, the duty of carrying out the inst ructions of the Council of Forty-Four fell on the six warrior societies. Each of the six societies elected four chiefs on the basis of their outstanding bravery and leadership abilities. Orders of the tribal councils were rarely disobeyed, one probable reason being the required consul tation between band leaders and members that proceeded final decisions. The warrior societie s also served as camp and hunt police, kept discipline during the great holy ceremonies, and pl ayed major roles in organizing the Sun Dance and Massaum ceremonies. In certain instances, the council chiefs delegated some of their authority to the warrior society chiefs (Powell 1980). The \"military societies tended to reinforce the unity of the Cheyennes by suppressing would- be secessionist bands and factions, and thus acted as one of the strongest elements bindi ng the tribe together\" (T aylor 1980, p. 81). Taylor also writes that the \"Cheyennes were unusual in their degree of tr ibal organization,\" ( ibid., p. 82) and argues that the Tribe's unique, integrated internal structure helped preserve tribal unity during the assimilation pr ocess in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Although there is evidence of the Cheyenne havi ng contact with Lewis and Clark in 1804 (Hoig 1980), the first formal contact between the Chey enne Nation and the United States government did not take place until 1825, when General Henry Atkinson traveled up the Missouri River to mediate peace treaties with the In dian tribes of the northern plai ns (Svingen 1993). The pressure from other tribes moving west even tually forced the Cheyenne to split into two, the Northern and Southern Cheyenne, in 1830. The Cheyenne were assigned land between the North Platte and Arkansas rivers through the Treaty of Fort La ramie in 1851. The land embraced territory in what is now Wyoming, Nebraska, western Kansas, an d half of present-day Colorado (Mooney 1905- did not initi ally realize that the Treaty had disregarded the north-south Cheyenne division, and grouped both bands in the south. Despite the Treaty stipulations, the Northern Cheyenne refused to move to the southern territory, and remained in their traditional lands where they slow ly grew distinct from their southern relatives.

Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 90In 1907, a respected Cheyenne anthropologist co mmented on all of the changes the Northern Cheyenne had experienced in thei r culture over the past 200 years: The most salient fact brought out by a st udy of the Cheyenne is that of the newness of everything, which they have, with the single exception of the Sacred Arrow cult. In the comparatively short pe riod of two centuries...they have shifted their habitat nearly a thousand miles, from the sheltered timber to the open plains, have so completely lost their old life a nd have borrowed so much from the tribes of their new surrounding, that if it were not for their Algonquin speech and the known facts of their history, we should fail to recognize in the roving buffalo hunters of the upper Arkansas the same pe ople who once planted corn, fished the lakes, and built their earth-covered lodges at the head of the Mississippi. Their great Sun Dance came from one tribe; th eir council system from another; the Omaha dance, Ghost dance, and Peyote rite from others; their warrior organizations as they now have it, thei r shield system, their whole equestrian habit, their tipis and their tipi life, are all of recent adoption and development... Their existing customs and ceremonials are under constant change, and are not now what they were even ten years ago ( ibid., pp. 420-421). A further modern change is that recent constitu tional reform (1997) has reorganized the judicial branch to implement a separation of powers and established that judges must now be elected rather than appointed. III. Comprehensive Approaches to Law Enforcement The Northern Cheyenne Tribe has extensive ex perience with comprehensive crime prevention initiatives. Over the last 13 years, the Tribe has participated in fo ur federally sponsored comprehensive initiatives: the Risk Focused Pr evention Project, the I ndian Country Justice Initiative, the Weed and Seed Program, and the CIRCLE Project. The opportunity to be part of each initiative has allowed the Northern Cheyenne to develop and expand services and to better address juvenile crime issues. Risk Focused Prevention Project Some at Northern Cheyenne have suggested that the tribe's movement away from more traditional forms of government went hand-in-hand w ith an erosion of the family structures that had been at the center of traditional Cheyenne cu lture and society. Whatever the cause, ruptures in family life and the fear of \"losing\" their younge r generations led the Trib e to apply for its first federally funded comprehensive law enforcement initiative: in 1992, the Tribe became involved in the Department of Education' s Risk Focused Prevention Project. Historically, juvenile justice systems have focused on sanctions, treatments, and rehabilitation to change behaviors after they occurred. By contrast, and as its name notes, th e Risk Focused Prevention Project is prevention based. It was deeply grounded in research on adol escent problem behaviors such as substance This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 91abuse, delinquency, violence, dropping-out of school, and teen pregnancy (Bueermann 1999). All of these problems were and are pervasive at Northern Cheyenne.82 The Risk Focused Prevention Project addresse d these problems through, \"a data and results- driven, community-oriented policing and problem-solving strategy\" ( ibid.). Although the Project did not eradicate juvenile crime on the reservatio n, it did develop some important lessons learned for future programs to build on, including the following:83 The police mission must shift away from the simple apprehension of criminals and toward the task of addressing crime and violence before they occur. A crime prevention strategy must address risk and protective factors through a coordinated strategy involving multiple community \"institutions,\" such as the family, schools, the community, the poli ce, and the criminal justice system. Effective strategies build on existing inst itutions and create new partnerships to fill service gaps. Key community leaders need to be enga ged \"to develop a vision of common goals for the community, and to commit to a risk-focused prevention strategy\" (Hawkins 1995). Indian Country Justice Initiative On September 20, 1995, Attorn ey General Janet Re no issued a Memorandum to the U.S. Department of Justice (USDOJ) establishing the I ndian Country Justice Initiative (ICJI). Citing the dearth of law enforcement services in Indian Country, and the need to improve the safety and quality of life for American I ndian citizens, ICJI began implementation in February 1996. The Northern Cheyenne Nation and the Pueblo of Laguna were the pilot sites. ICJI was based on the same principles as the Ri sk Focused Prevention Project. The Initiative was intended to: \"improve coordinati on among federal and American Indi an justice systems as well as relevant service providers; en courage and develop innovative a pproaches to justice; improve existing systems including communications and pro cedures; strengthen o ffender supervision and treatment; expand prevention, intervention and traini ng activities; and enfor ce laws against major crime especially those i nvolving violence\" (Lujan et al . 1998, p. 3). ICJI had four main objectives. In summary, they are (see Lujan 1998, p. B-3): Strengthening tribal judicial systems Accessing resources for prevention, rehabilitation, and diversion 82 This statement should not be interprete d to mean that earlier initiatives were unsuccessful; rather, solutions to the deep-rooted social ills that underlie the problems take time . Certainly, the counterfactual is also unknown: it is likely that the problems would be even worse today without the groundwork laid by Risk Focused Prevention Project, the Indian Country Justice Initiative, and the Weed and Seed program. 83 The first three lessons are paraphrased from Bueermann (1999). This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 92 Creating effective options for pr obation, treatment, and sanctions Improving investigations and expanding prosecutions Weed and Seed Despite the two previous comprehensive strategi es, Northern Cheyenne still faced overwhelming youth crime problems. Problems included (cited in the Tribe's first CIRCLE application): 20% of school age children reporting the use of inhalants and methamphetamine 50% of students dropping out befo re graduation from High School 65% of reservation resident suffering from unemployment 74% more burglaries per capita occurring than the national average 391% more arsons per capita occu rring than the national average The Weed and Seed initiative drew on the co mprehensive philosophy of the Risk Focused Prevention Project and ICJI. In addition, the same key community leaders that comprised the Risk Focused Steering Committee formed the Steering Committee for Weed and Seed. The Steering Committee consisted of representatives from schools, the local Boys and Girls Club, Native Action (a non-profit, community service organization), Chief Dull Knife College, local and federal law enforcement, the Trib al Court, and the tribal government. The Northern Cheyenne Weed and Seed strate gy was divided into four target areas: (1) Prevention; (2) Community Justice Systems; (3 ) Intervention and Treatment; and, (4) Economic Development. Key components of each of th e four target areas are listed below. Prevention The prevention aspects of Weed and Seed comple ment the work of the Risk Focused Prevention Project by providing alternatives to crime and by making the community less susceptible to crime. They include: Safe Haven (Boys and Girls Club) Smart Moves Drug Elimination Program Street lighting Neighborhood Watch Northern Cheyenne Law Enforcement Support Services STOP Violence Against Women grant Community Justice Systems Under the community justice systems target area, the Tribe sought to imp rove the community's ability to respond to violence and crime. To acco mplish this, Weed and Seed money was used to This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 93hire a Victim Witness Coordinator and new poli ce officers under a grant program of the USDOJ Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS), and to develop a Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) program. Other activiti es included the Domestic Violence Arrest Policies Project and grant and a Children's Justice Act grant. Intervention and Treatment The intervention and treatment target area cente red on the recruitment and hiring of a Tribal Youth Court Advocate and a Federal Probation Officer Liaison. An additional aim was the facilitation of a feasibility study fo r a juvenile detention facility. Economic Development By providing a meaningful future for the Tr ibe's children through pr ofessional training and economic development programs, the economic development portion of the Project may have supplied the greatest incentive for resisting crim e. The Tribal Business Information Center, the Grade School Mini-Bank, Entrep reneurship Training, and Micro- Business Development formed the core of this program area. IV. The Development of CIRCLE In addition to other selection crit eria, the Northern Cheyenne Trib e was invited to participate in CIRCLE because of its prior experience working with federal agencies in the development of comprehensive youth crime prevention projects. Indeed, key individuals involved with prior projects attended the initial CIRCLE meeting in Rapid City, South Dakota. The specific group attending the meeting included: Kim Dahle (then Project Coor dinator for Weed and Seed) Henry Thompson (Weed and Seed Steering Committee) Norma Gorneau (Tribal Vice President a nd a Weed and Seed representative) Glen Little Bird, Jr. (Tribal Council Member) Rudolph King, Sr. (Tribal Judge) Bill McClure (BIA Law Enforcement Services) Ron Spang (Northern Cheyenne BIA Police Chief) Tracy Toulou (Montana U.S. Attorney's Office) Several of these people remain involved in CIRCLE as members of the Steering Committee or advisers to the Project. The Tribe was fortunate to have both a soli d programmatic and administrative foundation in place from the Risk Focused Prevention Project and the Weed and Seed Project. It also had the commitment and experience of a core group of community members who had been involved with these projects (largely as representatives of community institutions); this core group became the Steering Committee for the Northern Chey enne CIRCLE Project. The specific programs, This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 94institutions, and constituencies represented on the Steering Committee included law enforcement, tribal government (including the execu tive, legislative, and judicial branches), the Boys and Girls Club, Chief Dull Knife College Extension Program, the Office of Prosecution, Tribal Health Services, the Recovery Center, Tr ibal Social Services, U.S. Federal Probation, the U.S. Attorney's Office, youth, elders, and school representatives from each of the three local school districts. From the outset, the Northern Cheyenne tr ibal government empowered the CIRCLE Project Steering Committee to identify specific strategies for the overall development of the Project. The Steering Committee was mindful that in order for CIRCLE to be eff ective, it would have to be part of the overall nation-bu ilding puzzle. Recognizing this, the Steering Committee sought and received USDOJ funding to hire Crossroads Leadersh ip Institute to facilitate a series of strategic visioning and planning meetings. These meetings were intended to help the Steering Committee envision where the Tribe could be in 10 years and the role the CIRC LE Project could play in that vision. The Steering Committee focused on thre e concepts in developing its plan: Reservation-wide strategic visioning and planning sessions. This process encouraged both public as well as priv ate sector members and tribal and non- tribal members to participate in developing a comprehensive \"master plan\" for capital and program development for all aspects of reservation life. Community building. A series of forums aimed at overcoming the differences between people. Individual forums cente red on subjects such as community building strategies, Cheyenne and tr ibal history and language, community leadership, and community policing. Leadership development. Designed for youth, adults or elders, the program is intended to promote leadership developmen t for both current and potential leaders at all levels. As part of the reservation-wide strategic visioning and planning sessi on, community members identified seven core focus areas (areas the nation ought to support or strengthen). The CIRCLE Project's aim is to help in as many of those ar eas as possible. The seve n areas identified were: Youth equal the future Self-sustaining economy Tribal government Law and order Community spirit Cohesive family units Drugs and alcohol In conjunction with the focus areas identified by the community, the Steering Committee identified seven additional needs or concerns: This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 95 Needs assessment on a continued basis Juvenile resources (detoxificati on, treatment, school, rehabilitation) Courts Prosecution Shelter Re-introduction of cultural values Identify youth programs (sports, play areas, etc.) Steering Committee members identified three areas that could be specifically targeted as part of the CIRCLE Project: Law enforcement needs on Northern Cheyenne. They hoped that CIRCLE would address the need for a police officer in each reservation district and the need for police officer training. Crime problems. They specifically were concerne d about burglary by juveniles, deaths that had not been properly inves tigated, the abuse of children, domestic violence, a variety of drug crimes (m aking, transporting, se lling, and using), alcohol-related crimes (DUIs, public in toxication, intoxication by minors, liquor violations, and bootlegg er activity), and the lack of citations for minor violations (such as traffic violations). Intervention and prevention. They identified a need for continued assessment of programs and resources, to keep abreast of what was working, what program needs remain, and what resources exist fo r meeting those needs. They also felt that intervention and prevention would be better served with code development, better communication between justice agencies and vari ous service providers, and the implementation of alternative or new methods of prosecution. V. Theory of Change While comprehensive initiatives are promising, they pose a serious challenge to evaluators. One solution to the evaluation dilemma is to em ploy a \"theory of change\" methodology, in which initiative staff and participants work with evalua tors to identify (1) the idea or theory behind the initiative, (2) process-oriented evidence demons trating that programmatic changes in line with the theory are occurring, and (3) indicators of program success. At Northern Cheyenne, the theory of change is deeply rooted in the Tribe's prior experiences with the Risk Focused Prevention Project and the Weed and Seed Program. The result is a theory of change that identifies the importance of the continuing development of a comprehensive crime prevention and control strategy. The Steering Committee articulated the following theory of change: This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 96By creating a comprehensive project that unifies the activities and funding for the existing programs, which individually deal with youth crime problems, and identifies and develops new programs to fill gaps in service, the CIRCLE Project will be able to effectively de al with the problems of youth crime on the Northern Cheyenne reservation and to create a safer community . Prior experience with comprehensive program s on the reservation helped the Steering Committee predict early outcomes for the CIRC LE Project. The Steering Committee also was able to identify indicators and evaluation measur ement tools that could be utilized during Project monitoring and evaluation activities. Table 1 (bel ow) is an evaluation grid developed by the Steering Committee while working to identify the CIRCLE Project's theory of change. The grid guided (and will continue to guide) the evaluation team in its activities.

CIRCLE Components As a comprehensive approach to youth crim e prevention, the Northern Cheyenne CIRCLE Project strategy is comprised of a range of initiatives that together are anticipated to have an effect greater than the sum of the parts. This section review s the CIRCLE strategy's component programs and notes progress through mid-2002 on the implementation of various strategic initiatives. Community Justice Coordinator The Community Justice Coordinato r (CJC) was hired as a tribal employee in November of 1999 to oversee the Northern Cheyenne CIRCLE Project . The Coordinator repor ts to the Executive Administrator of the Tribe. In the first tw o years of CIRCLE, the CJC provided indirect supervision to 11 employees hired under the ei ght CIRCLE component programs. The CJC also provided direct supervision to two employees hired in the positi ons of Youth In-Take Coordinator (Tribal Youth Program) and Constr uction Project Manager (Juvenile Correctional Facility). Current CJC responsibilities include administration and manage ment functions related to CIRCLE, performed in cooperation with the tribal government, other CIRCLE programs, and other organizations working with CIRCLE; the hope is to minimize the Coordinator's direct supervisory and operational duties. During CIRCLE's third fiscal year, the CJC al so began working with the CIRCLE Project Steering Committee to redefine Project administ ration, so that the CJC can spend more time focusing on the long-term sustainability of the Northern Cheyenne CIRC LE Project. The revised set of responsibilities for the CJC would in clude: facilitating disc ussion and coordination between programs, developing and implementing the strategy by facilitating monthly Steering Committee meetings, monitoring the progress on each of the eight components of the grant, serving as the official liaison between the Tribe and the U.S. Department of Justice, preparing the required programmatic re ports for the grant, and staffing the CIRCLE office. Law Enforcement Enhancement Through the CIRCLE Project, the Tribe is providing additional officers, training, innovative technology, equipment, and vehicles to its Bure au of Indian Affairs-managed Law Enforcement Services Department. The law enforcement enhancement program will focus particularly on the expansion of community policing services in reservation communities beyond Lame Deer. Police officers also will be placed in substations at lo cal schools, to help with conflict resolution and school-based prevention programs. The Tribe has signed a Memorandum of Agreement with the BIA that outlines the roles and responsibilities for each entity, including procedures for the supervision of officers, equipment ownership and usage, and overall department administration. There are a total of 15 law enforcement officers (nine BIA funded and six trib ally funded). Two of th e tribally funded police officers were hired through the 1996 Universal Hi ring Program Grant. However, the money was sufficient only to cover officers' salaries and benefits, and even then, at a lower rate than the officers hired through the CIRCLE Community Polici ng (COPS) Grant. This latter grant made it possible for the Tribe to hire four additional poli ce officers and to cover the purchase of vehicles, uniforms, and other necessary equipment for all the tribally funded officers. (The CIRCLE This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 98Project has made a special effo rt to supply the tribal officer s with the same uniforms and equipment as the BIA officers.) The Project is working toward the provision of additional law enforcement officers for each community on the reservation, the implementation of community policing (especially assisting the community in participating in law enforcement), the provision of needed training to law enforcement officers), and the deterrence of juven ile crime. Looking to the future, the hope is to add a second school officer, who will work in co llaboration with the ex isting school officer and focus primarily on truancy issues. Such an office r would participate in the two reservation high schools' daily activities, conduct educational aw areness activities, and participate in more standard patrol work. Othe r ongoing and planned law enforcement program enhancement activities include: Assignment of officers to reside in the various districts of the reservation in collaboration with the housing authority, w ith an eye toward the development of tenant patrols Actively work with the victim service programs in the community to assist with domestic violence issues, child abuse/ne glect, and other victim-related crimes through participation in case management teams, mentoring programs, Boys and Girls Club activities, and training Activation of daily bicycle patrols and foot patrols throughout the five main reservation communities, in order to develop a presence in neighborhoods and to foster more positive interactions between citizens and police Tribal Court Enhancement The primary goal of the Tribal Court enhancement program is to provide integrated services to the community and to improve juvenile rehabilitation services and programs. The CIRCLE Project helps by developing support staff and ade quate resources to assi st court personnel in arraignment, process service, research, data collection, and the timely production of court documents. The Court consists of an elected full-time Chief Trial Judge and a full-time Associate Judge. Both are elected by tribal members to serve four-y ear terms. A Clerk of C ourt is appointed by the Chief Judge to serve a four-year term. Two Appellate Judges and a Pro Tem Trial Judge are chosen by the Tribal Council and appointed by th e President to serve f our-year terms. The two Appellate Judges and the Pro Tem Tribal J udge are paid on a case-by-case basis. As a result of mid-1990s constitu tional changes that mandated judi cial independence, the Tribal Council passed a separation of powers ordinanc e on October 6, 1997. The or dinance provides for election rather than appointment of the Chie f Trial Judge and Associate Judge and for the incorporation of traditional justice practices in to the court system. These reforms link well with the Northern Cheyenne CIRCLE Project. Judici al independence and the separation of powers (which the ordinance supports th rough the election of j udges) contribute to th e strengthening of the justice system overa ll. Furthermore, opportunities for in corporating traditional means of justice may be particularly relevant for th e youth-focused CIRCLE strategy. During interviews This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 99for the CIRCLE evaluation, the Chief Judge indicated that the Tribe is interested in developing treatment for juveniles that addresses the recovery of the family as a w hole. While recognizing that the juvenile is need of treatment, it is of ten the family situation that places the youth in trouble in the first place. Not only does this retu rn to core principles behind the Risk Focused Prevention initiative, but also to an emphasis on traditional Cheyenne healthy family structures. The CIRCLE Project has supplemented the work of the Court by providing funding for the employment of key personnel, including a proce ss server, a law clerk, a youth intake specialist, and a part-time family judge. The process server is responsible for serving court documents throughout the reservation, including bench warrants, jury summons, and subpoenas. Additionally, using tribal and national voter lists, the process server has established a system for juror selection. The law clerk is responsible for assisting the judge(s) with research and writing of court documents. The youth intake specialist's primary task is to produce criminal histories of youth offenders for the Court. In order to ensure th at judges receive a complete history on juvenile offenders so that they can craft approp riate court orders, the youth intake specialist not only compiles criminal record data from existing records84 but also supplements this work with home visits, schools visits, and visits with other juve nile services staff. Children's Justice Act Partners hip for Indian Communities Through CIRCLE, the Northern Cheyenne Tribe has focused on enhancing serv ices to victims of child sexual and physical abuse. There are a vari ety of CIRCLE-related ac tivities in place to promote this goal. In particular, CIRCLE generated funds to hire a legal a ssistant, who assists the special prosecutor for these case s and helps ensure th at cases are tried unde r the tribal sexual assault code as well as the federal Children's Justice Act. The legal assistant was hired in October 2000. (The special prosecuto r is hired on an individual contract basis depending on the Tribe's need for services.) Other current activities in this area of CIRCLE include: Developing protocol s and procedures Responding to the needs of victims of child abuse Updating the current Northern Cheyenne tribal code Identifying and securing training for the respective agencies dealing with child victims Staffing cases to prosec ute in tribal court Providing education to the community about child abuse and the procedures for reporting abuse There also are plans underway to train a forensic team that could assist with child sexual and physical abuse cases. 84 An informal database exists but is inconsistently maintained. This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 100Violence Against Women Through CIRCLE funding, the Northern Cheyenne Tr ibe has been able to provide increased services to victims of domestic violence. This component of the CIRCLE Project is focused on the further development of the Healing Hearts Cris is Center. \"The mission of the Crisis Center is to help end family violence by providing services to battered victims and their children... and by educating our communities through workshops and training sessions\" (Nor thern Cheyenne Tribe 1998). CIRCLE funding has provided an additiona l advocacy position, supp lies, equipment, and direct services for victims; in year 1 it also supported a study a ssessing the need for a reservation-based shelter. (There is not a shelter on the reservation - victims must travel as much as 110 miles to reach one.) Having identified th e need, tribal victim services personnel then began the process of identifying a shelter site, visi ted other shelters to research their operations and procedures, produced draft operational and procedural manuals for the shelter, and developed draft schematic designs. The CIRCLE Project is currently looking for funding to build a shelter. Until one is built, the Project will continue to assist with the transp ortation of victims to other area shelters. Other current activities include: Creation of a revised Domestic Violence Code Development of a new Memorandum of Agre ement to be signed by all agencies and programs working with domestic violence clients Recruitment of a Domestic Violence Advocate Enhancement of community awareness of domestic violence issues and of services available to clients, children, and community members Safety audits of all programs involve d with domestic violence issues on the reservation Victims Assistance Prior to CIRCLE, the Northern Cheyenne Tribe provi ded direct victim services only in instances of domestic violence. With the help of CIRCLE funding, however, the Tribe was able to hire a Victim Witness Coordinator in June of 2000. Re sponsibilities for this position include assisting in program development for victims of crime an d ensuring compliance with federal codes. Daily tasks include identifying resources for victims, managing a 24-hour crisis hotline, and organizing forums and conferences for victim s and practitioners that address how best to he lp victims of crime. All work within this office is conducted under federal guidelines for dealing with victims of crime. In July 2000, the U.S. Attorney's Offi ce also hired a Victim Witness Coordinator for the Northern Cheyenne Reservation. To avoid dup licating services, the two Coordinators met in January of 2001 to discuss prot ocol. Also attending the meeting were the FBI's Victim Witness Assistant, the Tribe's Chief Prosecutor, the U. S. Probation Officer for Northern Cheyenne, and the CIRCLE Project Coordinator. It was determined that all cases to be prosecuted in federal court would be referred to the FBI's and/or U. S. Attorneys Office victim assistance program and that all cases being prosecuted in tribal court would be handle d by the tribal (CIRCLE-funded) program. This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 101The goal for this CIRCLE component is to creat e a change in the community's awareness, knowledge, and behavior concerning cr ime, violence, and victimization. Tribal Youth Program Implemented in fiscal year 1999, the Tribal Yout h Program targets youth ages 5 to 18 years old and provides them with services designed to prevent, divert, re duce, and control juvenile crime and delinquency on the Northe rn Cheyenne Reservation. One of the Program's major accomplishments, facilitated by the Northern Cheyenne CIRCLE Project, is the creation of Memo randa of Agreement with the Northern Cheyenne Tribal Court, Northern Cheyenne Office of Prosecution, and th e Northern Cheyenne Boys and Girls Club. Each MOA outlines the roles and responsibilities of the signatory agencies and organizations, the duration and management of their joint work, the cooperative parties' financial and admini- strative relationships, and th e future of the program. Another accomplishment is the creation of a Community Restitution Coordinator position (funded by CIRCLE); the Coordinator is responsibl e for establishing restitution agreements and ensuring that youth offenders make their restitu tion payments. This entails the assignment of youth offenders to community servi ce projects and making sure that the time sentenced is served. Community service projects may include elimin ating graffiti on public buildings, chopping wood for elders, cleaning parks and roadsides, and so on. The philosophy is that the projects will not only provide much needed services to the co mmunity but also help bond the youth to their communities and help them recognize that their actions have consequences. Volunteers for Northern Cheyenne Youth The Volunteers for Northern Cheyenne Yout h (VNCY) program aims to create positive opportunities for at-risk youth through the devel opment and implementation of a mentoring program. VNCY coordinates with the existing J uvenile Mentoring Program (JUMP), which is administered through the Boys and Girls Cl ub. Essentially, VNCY e xpands and enhances mentoring services and opportunities for at-risk youth. The program focuses on utilizing positive alcohol and drug free adult leaders (police officer s, teachers, judges, el ders, etc.) from the Northern Cheyenne community to serve as mentors for 12 consecutive months. Similar to JUMP, VNCY will be both school and after-school based and will focus on providing at-risk youth with guidance, friendship, and structure. Construction of a Juvenile Correctional Facility Federal rules specify that juvenile offenders must be detained in a wholly or effectively separate facility from adult offenders. That is, there mu st be separation from the adult population by sight and sound, and the jail must employ juvenile-speci fic detention guards. Since the Tribe has only one jail, issues over the placem ent of juvenile offenders have occurred, and the Court is attempting to find alternative ways of sancti oning youth offenders. Unfortunately, one of the common alternative sanctions employed by the Tribal Court, community serv ice, has often been ignored. Tribal youth simply have refused to comp lete the assigned hours of community service. Given the lack of viable consequences, lack of space has even become a stumbling block to the prosecution of juveniles. This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 102The CIRCLE Project allows the Tribe to craft a more appropriate resp onse. Through CIRCLE, the Tribe is working to plan, design, and c onstruct a youth detention, rehabilitation, and education facility. More specifica lly, it will provide s ecure detention for j uveniles, a group home, an alternative school, a vo cational training center, and a medical health center. The hope is that the facility will offer all available resources und er one roof - a comprehensive continuum of care - for youth and their families, and a system of gr aduated sanctions that is rationally imposed by the Tribal Court in accordance with th e severity of a youth's offense(s). CIRCLE funding has allowe d the Tribe to hire a Constr uction Program Manager who is responsible for overseeing the facility planning t eam and for seeing the building project through from the design phase to construction. The planni ng team includes representatives from agencies involved in the CIRCLE Project, the BIA Area Office Engineeri ng Department, and the Tribal Employment Rights Office. Construction also is funded primarily through CIRCLE, with a 10% match from the Tribe. At the time of writi ng, ground had been broken, but construction had yet to begin in earnest. The facil ity is slated to open in 2003. VII. Evaluation Template As part of the overall evaluation, the three colleg es affiliated with the CIRCLE sites were each granted $7,500 to assist in Phase I evaluation activities. At Nort hern Cheyenne, Chief Dull Knife College used a portion of its money to hire two c onsultants to assist in articulating the Project's theory of change. The two consultants are both experienced in the implementation and evaluation of comprehensive community -based initiatives. Prior to the second site visit by external members of the evaluation team, the consultants worked closely with the Steering Committee to de velop an understanding of the design and implementation of the Northern Cheyenne CIRC LE Project. During these meetings, the Steering Committee identified two key issues they wanted the evaluation to addre ss: (1) the development and \"health\" of the partnerships within the CIRCLE Project a nd (2) the degree of overall comprehensiveness of the program. Therefore, the evaluation template focuses on three sets of individuals who can provide information about one or both of these topics: Participants (or clients and their famili es who have been served by the CIRCLE Project) Partners (primarily Steering Committee members) Staff (of the partner programs in CIRCLE) Together, the Steering Committee, on-site eval uation partners (Chief Dull Knife College personnel and their contracted consultants), and external evaluation partners (from the Harvard Project on American Indian Economic Developmen t) determined that implementation of the evaluation would consist of two main activities: (1) written surveys (to be administered to This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 103individuals within each of the categories noted a bove) and (2) interviews with staff and directors of the partner agencies/programs.85 The Steering Committee sees the surveys as providing information that will help summarize the Project's current accomplishments in terms of partnership and comprehensive service provision and that will benchmark future progress toward th ese goals. They see the interview portion of the evaluation as a critical supplement to the surv ey data. The interviews should provide more qualitative and in-depth insight into the develo pment of partnerships, the partners' and staffs' understanding of the initia tive's objectives and of their own responsibili ties toward CIRCLE, and the success of the Project in meeting its go als. The Steering Committee requested that the external evaluation team members conduct as ma ny interviews as possible during their second site visit, and it supplied both a li st of desired interviewees and of core interview questions. Prior to the site visit, all evalua tion team members had an opportunity to comment on the proposed survey questions, interviewee list, and interview questions. The remainder of the $7,500 gran ted to Chief Dull Knife College was used to support survey activities. Some of the funds were used to train and compensate Chief Dull Knife College students who administered the thr ee groups of surveys. A small port ion of the funds was used to purchase gift certificates to a local store to compensate client s and their families for taking the time to answer the surveys. VIII. Phase I Evaluation Results Phase I of the CIRCLE Project evaluation focuse s primarily on process - whether or not the tribal sites are succeeding in implementing the stra tegies they designed at the outset of CIRCLE, how they have done so, stumbling blocks enc ountered, and so on. Because the evaluation asked the tribal partners to clarify the logic or theo ry behind their strategy, it also suggests a framework for thinking about outcomes that would signal progr ess and success of the initiative overall. This section sheds light on the success of the process and on preliminary outcomes issues using data from the interviews and surveys and a limited set of quantitative criminal justice system data that the evaluation team was able to collect. It is or ganized according to the expected early outcomes listed in the evaluation template (Table 1) de veloped by the Steering Committee. These ideas also are depicted in Figure 1; additional outco mes were identified during the evaluation process and added to the diagram. Each early outcome/m ilestone represents evolution according to the theory of change expressed by the Steering Committee. 85 For privacy and logistical reasons, the Steering Committee did not feel it would be possible to conduct interviews with clients or their families as part of this first, 18-month phase of the CIRCLE evaluation. However, they envision that any future evaluation efforts will include in-person client interviews: on written surveys administered to clients during the first phase of the evaluation, families are as ked if they would be willing to be part of any future evaluation activities, and respondents who agree might be available for in-person interviews during the next round.

These issues are introduced first in Table 1 and discussed specifically below. However, an introductory summary is useful. Survey and interview results indicate the following: The CIRCLE Project has a core group of de dicated staff and pa rtners who have a history of working together and who believe the CIRCLE Project is making a difference in their community. There is less communication among the broa der set of CIRCLE partners and their staffs, which has limited system-w ide understanding of CIRCLE programs, services, and goals. Although most clients and families are satis fied with the services they have received from the CIRCLE Project, many remain unaware of the full menu of services available and would like to know more about other services offered. Increase in communication among partners/ programs Both the interviews of the staff and surveys collect ed (11 total) indicate a relatively low level of communication between programs. In contrast to their relatively freque nt communication with the CIRCLE Coordinator and tribal administration, most program st aff report that they \"Rarely\" or \"Never\" engage in in ter-program communication. When asked which CIRCLE Project programs they were aware of, 8 of 11 staff members were aware of the Tribal Youth Services offerings, and 6 reported awareness of the Youth Service Center. Two (but not the same two for each pr ogram) reported that they were aware of the CIRCLE Project's Tribal Court Enhancemen t component, Law Enforcement Enhancement components, Volunteers for Northern Cheyenne Youth component, Victims Assistance in Indian Country component, and Violence Against Women component. A single respondent was aware of the Children's Jus tice Act Partnership. Two of the staff surveyed \"Strongly Agreed\" that they had a good understanding of the role(s) of each team member participating with or in th e Northern Cheyenne CIRCLE Project, four staff members \"Agreed,\" two recorded a \"Neutral\" re sponse, one staff member \"Disagreed,\" one \"Strongly Disagreed,\" and one responded that the question \"Does Not Apply.\" Building Relationships among Partners/Programs Throughout the interviews, it was made clear that staff member s felt that th e building and maintenance of partnerships, both internally and externally, were vital to the success of the CIRCLE Project. However, only a few individuals felt that CI RCLE had contributed to the development of partnerships with the staff of the other CIRCLE Projects; a few also indicated that CIRCLE had contributed to the development of partnerships externally (that is, with local non-tribal agencies and federal agencies). The majo rity of those interviewe d did not indicate that CIRCLE had contributed to the building of relati onships among local partners and/or programs. This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 106Increase in Coordination and Coop eration among Partners/Programs When asked whether or not they were satisfied with the number of client s who were referred to them by other programs, only three of the staff surveyed \"Agreed\" and another three replied that the question \"Did Not Apply\"; two were \"Neu tral\"; Agreed\" or Disagreed.\" The reverse re lationships are weak as well: When asked how often a staff member referred clients to othe r CIRCLE programs, the majority responded that they \"Rarely\" or \"Never\" did so. The interviews also indicate that the lack of communication between programs, and the resulting lack of knowledge of other pa rticipating programs, has contributed to a noted lack of coordination and cooperation among programs. Se veral program managers indicated that they were not even aware of who was on the CIRCLE Steering Committee. Increase in Service Delivery Since this is the first round of CIRCLE Project evalua tion, there is no previous data that, through comparison, would indicate increas es or decreases in overall service delivery (this may be possible in Phase II of the evaluation). However, the data do provide some useful insigh t into service gaps. When asked if they were satisfied with the services received through th e CIRCLE Project, 27% of the 81 clients/families surveyed responded that they \"S trongly Agree,\" 36% an \"Agree,\" and 4% answered w ith a \"Strongly Disagr ee.\" Although the survey data suggest that clients and their families were generally satisfied w ith the service(s) they have received from the CIRCLE Project, they also indica te that clients and their families are not aware of all the programs available. When asked which CIRCLE Pr oject programs they were aware of, most respondents marked only a few programs on the list. Typically, only 20% of respondents indicated an awareness of a ny given CIRCLE program. Only one program was known by more than 25% of the survey responde nts - the Tribal Youth Services program. Indeed, this program had much greater visibility than any other, with 53% of respondent s indicating an awareness of the program and its services. Initial evaluation data indicate that clients were informed of their available choices and options by CIRCLE st aff (26% responded \"Strongly Agree,\" 36% \"Agree,\" and 15% \"Neutral\"). this may be true, the staff su rvey data indicate that the staff themselves were not aware of the full range other programs, so could not have informed clients of all available options. Increase in Caseload: Probation Officers There was a limited amount of case disposition data available for the evaluation effort. The only complete annual data was for 2000, which showed that both the number of cases disposed and the number of cases that resulted in probation increased somewhat from January to December 2000 (although the percentage of cases disposed that resulted in probation remained relatively constant). CIRCLE monies created two juven ile probation positions , and based on the 2000 disposition figures alone, each officer would have had a fairly manageable caseload (18 youths per month). However, the tribal court's push fo r diversion rather than prosecution increased these caseloads substantially. Hiring lags, tr aining needs, and high turnover placed additional strain on the probation function an d further limited the officers' effectiveness. More data are needed to understand the l onger-term probation trends. This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 107Increase in the Number of Prosecutions As discussed immediately above, arrest and dispos ition data are limited at present. What data do exist indicate that the number of prosecuti ons has increased during the period of CIRCLE implementation. However, as of April 2000, the CIRCLE Project also has implemented automatic diversion of youth offenders from the courts for a potential alternative sentencing process. This should dramatically decrease th e number of prosecutions in the future. Increase in the Number of Arraignments Data for the year 2000 in dicate an increase in arraignments. More comprehensive data collection is needed to indicate the long-te rm trend in arraignments. Increas es in crime rates would indicate that arraignments would increase as well. Increase in Crime Rates Although data collection is incomplete, the data do seem to indicate that, on average, arrest rates for juveniles are increasing (see Fi gure 2). This is particularly true in the months following the implementation of the CIRCLE Project (December 1998 onward). Figure 2: Juvenile Arrests per Month (Jan. 1997- July 2001) Reflecting on this information, several caveats ar e important. First, results are preliminary; additional data and analysis are needed to determine the true impact, if any, that the CIRCLE Project has had on juvenile arrest rates and other crime indicators, such as court arraignments, probation rates, and diversion program particip ation. Second, the time Average: 34 Post-CIRCLE Monthly Average: 64 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 108also affects the conclusions that can be drawn. Even if further analysis supports the preliminary finding, data in Figure 2 are i ndicative only of CIRCLE's earl y stages, not its longer-term impact. Third, any quantitative an alysis must be examined in the context of other known facts about the Project. For example, it is not necessarily the case that an increase in arrest numbers indicates an overall increase in crim inal activity. Instead, the change must be viewed in light of the increased police presence and activity due to the implementation of the CIRCLE Project (and, potentially, of CIRCLE-motivated or comm unity policing-motivated increases in crime reports). Indeed, qualitative data collected from police and other CIRCLE staff points toward the interpretation that the upward trend is due more to the increased police presence than to an increase in criminal activity. The crimes driving the apparent increase in crime rates are non-violent offenses such as intoxication and curfew violations (see Figure 3) , which historically have accounted for the largest percentage of juvenile arrests. Again, it should be stressed that the dataset is not complete enough to determine whether the implementation of CIRCLE has impacted juvenile arrest rates for these violations. However, a gross comp arison of the pre- and post-CIRCLE monthly averages86 mirrors the preliminary finding above. Th ere was an 81% incr ease in the average number of monthly juvenile ar rests for intoxication violations in the months after CIRCLE implementation as compared to the months be fore (25.77 per month after CIRCLE versus 14.35 before), and a 114% increase in th e average number of juvenile arrests for curfew violations (15.67 per month after CIRCLE versus 7.31 before). W ith a greater police pres ence on the streets and a greater focus on the preventio n of serious juvenile crimes, it might be the case that police are targeting misdemeanor violations in an at tempt to deter juveniles from committing more serious offenses. 86 Averages help make sense of data that otherwise have considerable variance.

Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 109Figure 3: Juvenile Arrests per Month for Int oxication and Curfew Violations (Jan. 1997 - May 2001) The limited quantitative data gathered by the evalua tion team shows a slight increase in assault and other violent offenses between January 1997 and July 2001. However, the numbers are relatively low and a very small percentage of th e overall juvenile crime rate. The small increase in violent offenses and the contrasting percep tion by the CIRCLE staff th at juvenile violent crime is increasingly problematic is perplexing; ev aluators will consider this issues closely once the dataset is complete. In the short term, th e evaluation team has taken note of several hypotheses. For one, the recent small spike in and increased concern about juvenile violent crime could be related to a broader phenomenon: nati onwide, there is a tren d of youth posturing as gang members, even where gangs are not trad itionally found. Alternatively or additionally, juvenile violent crime at Northern Cheyenne ma y be linked to drug activity on the reservation; informants note that this correlation has held up in the past and that qu alitative data suggest a connection between the recent (small) increase in crime and a surge in \"huffing\" (inhaling chemicals). Looking to the future, monthly numb ers of repeat offenders are another important type of data that should be collected, as well as the number of prior arrests per o ffender. These data are currently unavailable but are be ing compiled by CIRCLE Project sta ff. External evaluation team members were told during the third site visit that law enforcement's sense is that there is a small, 0102030405060708090100Jan-97Mar-97May-97Jul-97Sep-97Nov-97Jan-98Mar-98May-98Jul-98Sep-98Nov-98Jan-99Mar-99May-99Jul-99Sep-99Nov-99Jan-00Mar-00May-00Jul-00Sep-00Nov-00Jan-01Mar-01May-01Intox ication CurfewBeginning of CIRCLE Project: December 1998 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Preliminary quantitative data do indicate that th ere is a high recidivism rate among juvenile offenders. Together, the inside rs' observation and the quantit ative data suggest that the CIRCLE initiative at Northern Cheyenne potentially should refocus its efforts to stop juvenile offenders from repeating criminal activity after their first contact with law enforcement. What the data cannot show, however, is the number of youth th e CIRCLE Project is keeping from coming in contact with law enforcement in the first place. The preventative aspects of the CIRCLE Project are the most difficult to measure, and qualitative da ta that highlight succe ss in this area should be taken into account with the more easily measured quantitative trends. Increase in Chaos and Confusion Related to System Change The Steering Committee listed requests for clarifi cation and expressions of anger or frustration as indicators of an increase in chaos and c onfusion related to system change. Although the evaluation team did not have the opportunity to ex amine all of the measurement tools identified (verbal and written communications, survey ques tions to all three groups, steering committee agenda items, minutes of meetings), there were some clear indications from staff that there has been an increase in system chaos and confusi on. The increase has been perpetuated by the lack of communication between CI RCLE programs and partners. IX. Other Relevant Findings Evaluators felt that a number of additional find ings were important to the on-going development of the CIRCLE Project. These are listed below. Lack of Public Awareness As a whole, interview responses suggest that CIRCLE should be doing more to educate tribal members about the Project. This may be a tall order. The Project Coordinator has neither the time nor the financial resources to engage in much community education. Personnel turnover problems are a further constraint, since employees that have been on board for a shorter period of time may be less able to teach community member s about the Project overall. While the CJC and several other CIRCLE staff attend district (community) meetings when they can, the meetings are often poorly attended by community member s themselves. Given the dispersion of the reservation's population and most residents' relatively limited tr ansportation options, there are few other opportunities to address a large audience about CIRCLE Project issues. How to get the CIRCLE message out to the public at-large is a pr oblem to which neither the CJC or the Steering Committee has been able to find a good solution. Insufficient Data Collection and Analysis Capacities Collecting and analyzing criminal justice data a nywhere is often difficult and time consuming. The difficulty of collection is further compounded in Indian country by the lack of automated data systems and skilled personne l responsible for maintaining a nd updating data records. The situation at Northern Cheyenne is a case in poin t. The majority of the Tribe's criminal justice system data is kept in a paper format and organized in a piecemeal manner, and there is only one person on the CIRCLE staff who has the capacity to enter and analyze it. As a result, law enforcement and other CIRCLE staff have ve ry limited access to crime data. Putting an This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 111automated crime data system in place at Northe rn Cheyenne (along the lines of Full Court at Zuni) might solve this problem, but such a solu tion also would require a high level of staff training in computer system s and database management. Lack of Resources Despite the vast array of funding sources offe red through CIRCLE, the Project at Northern Cheyenne remains constrained by a lack of resources - CIRCLE programs' budgets tend to be adequate to accomplish the bare minimum of goals. What is most dramatically missing at Northern Cheyenne is a relatively small amount of discretionary funding that can be used to fund, among other things: An administrative assistant for the Coordinator The payment of insurance, inspection, operations, and maintenance costs of the new police vehicles (that sat idle for more than a year for want of such monies) A weekly newsletter to help spread the word about CIRCLE programs, staff, services, and activities An Updated computer equipment Supplementary training in areas such as program management and basic computer skills High Personnel Turnover The lack of consistent overs ight and management of empl oyees has contributed to high personnel turnover. Another important factor co ntributing to turnover may be the actual hiring process; job descriptions may have been vague or unclear and may have attracted people without the necessary skills or desire to adequately co ntribute to the overall mission of CIRCLE. While the solution to this problem seems clear - to impr ove the job descriptions and to actively recruit particular individuals for the ta sks - it may not be easy to implement. As the person who is currently responsible for mana ging all CIRCLE activities and fo r finding the funding for current and future employee salaries, the CJC has some involvement in the hiring process, but it is limited. Similarly, the programs for which CIRCLE f unds positions have limited input. Instead, the Northern Cheyenne Tribe human resources st aff takes primary responsibility for writing the job descriptions, fielding applications, and hiri ng of all employees whose positions are funded with CIRCLE grant dollars. The Desirability of Greater Suppo rt from Tribal Officials The foregoing problem raises a larger issue wi th the CIRCLE Project at Northern Cheyenne, which is that the tribal administration plays an important, although latent ro le, in the initiative's success. Unless CIRCLE can garner not only the support, but the active involvement of the Tribal President, Council, and key members of the executive branch/tribal administration, the Project's work will be harder than it might be. Members of the Steering Committee noted that their overall goal is really to build a \"justice department\" for the Tribe - but when programs as similar as youth probation and community service ar e not under one roof (one of several possible examples of discordant justice system organizati on that arise from a \"get a grant here, a grant there\" development process), this goal may be elusive without the express involvement and This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 112exercised authority of tr ibal principals. Time and again, th ough, the evaluation team were told that this more active involvement was unlikely at present, not because support for CIRCLE was lacking, but because political energy was a s carce resource and much was currently being directed toward activities that had been deemed more important. In particular, tribal principals are concentrating on maintaining the judicial independence and separati on of powers specified by a recent constitutional amendment and implementation ordinance. X. Potential Ways Forward The Northern Cheyenne Tribe developed a st rong foundation for CIRCLE to build upon. With this foundation and the more recent investments of CIRCLE, it appears that many pieces are in place to effectively address the Tribe's youth crime problem. Indeed, some preliminary indicators suggest that the Proj ect already has begun to meet the expected goals of the Steering Committee. An important outstanding concern, how ever, is whether or not financial resources can be found to sustain the process of strategi c, comprehensive system development on a long- term basis. If resources can be secured, the CIRCLE Project can continue to play an integral part in the overall nation building pr ocess at Northern Cheyenne. For the short term, the evaluation team has identifi ed potential ways to move the Project forward. Several of these ideas also were identified in the Tribe's first CIRCLE application: Strategic visioning and planning Community building Leadership development Other recommendations include: Develop a CIRCLE Project newsletter to be mailed to all reservation residents, tribal members, and others identified by the Steering Committee Actively involve the Tribal Council, as the governing body for the reservation, in the CIRCLE Project (To achieve this, the CJC should keep the Council briefed on all aspects of CIRCLE; involve Council members in tr aining and development opportunities and consider developing speci alized programs for the C ouncil; and firmly link the CIRCLE Project with the issues that most occupy these leaders, especially the enforcement of recent constitutional refo rms - after all, CI RCLE is also about strengthening the justice system.) Develop teambuilding activities for th e CIRCLE Project Steering Committee and staff (It is important for this group to maintain a high level of team spirit, develop the characteristics and behaviors that its desi res in others, and serve as a model for others.)

History of the Oglala Sioux Tribe In order to understand the Ogla la Sioux Tribe's goals for the Co mprehensive Indian Resources for Community and Law Enforcement (CIRCLE) Project and its implementation process, one also must understand the Tribe's history, culture, and cu rrent cultural and poli tical context. That is, a project such as CIRCLE cannot be understood in a vacuum - its goals, implementation, and results are inherently ti ed to context. This section provides some contextual pe rspective, although it is not meant to be a complete history of the Oglala Sioux Tribe (OST) nor a full description of the nation's culture and current political environm ent. Rather, it is meant to provide a basic understanding of the history and culture that are woven into the Tribe's CIRCLE Project. 87 The Oglala Lakota are one of seven subdivisi ons of a larger Lakot a-speaking linguistic community variously called the Teton-Dakota, Teton, Sioux, West ern Sioux, or simply Lakota; in turn, the Lakota are one of seven divisions of Oceti Sakowi n, the Seven Fireplaces, which includes all \"Sioux\" tribes and speakers of not only Lakota, but also Dakota and Nakota. During the 17th century the Lakota people lived in what is now Minnesota; they relocated to the high plains in the 18th century, to an area that is now larg ely encompassed by the state of South Dakota. The Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851 gua ranteed peace between the United States Government and signatory Indian nations (including the Lakota), delimited the territories of each party, bound each Indian nation to choose a principal chief, and provided for annuities to be paid by the U.S. Government to the tribes. The Fo rt Laramie Treaty of 1868 established the Great Sioux Reservation, which included all of present day South Dakota west of the Missouri River. In 1876, a United States Commissi on compelled a few Lakota to sign an agreement ceding the Black Hills, an agreement that not only was s ecured through duress (the Lakota signatories were offered a choice between selling and starving) but also was in violation of the 1868 Treaty (which required approval of three- fourths of the adult males for a ny land transacti ons). The Great Sioux Reservation was partitioned in 1889 into six smaller reservations, including the Pine Ridge Reservation, which is the contemporary homeland of the Oglala Sioux Tribe. The Office of Indian Affairs (OIA), a precursor to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, used many means for controlling Indian behavior. Agency cour ts and police forces were two such means. In particular, in 1883 the U.S. Department of Interi or issued a code for a \"C ourt of Indian Offenses\" (CIO) at each reservation-leve l OIA agency; among other things, the code included prohibitions of the Sun Dance, plural marriages, and the pr actices of medicine men. Although three Indian judges were to preside over cases, OIA Agents appointed them, and ofte n, an Agent applied the provisions of the code without the judges. The Agent enforced the code through Indian policemen appointed and paid by the Office of Indian Affairs, a nd the Agent himself served as 87 The external evaluation team members do not consider themselves experts on Oglala history. They have, however, taken the time throughout this phase of the CIRCLE evaluation to learn as much as possible about the Oglala Sioux Tribe's history and people. This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 114the commander of this police force. As early as 1879, the Agent at Pine Ridge appointed and swore in fifty Oglala men \"to serve the Great Fath er [the U.S. President] and him only\" (Biolsi 1992, p. 7). Their first action was to prevent a party of Cheyenne who resided at Pine Ridge from leaving to join Sitting Bull's ba nd in Canada. The leader of th e party was killed, and the Agent informed the Oglala, \"Remember this...you have seen the power of the polic e; they represent the Great Father\" ( ibid.). Thus began the domination of th e Oglala Lakota by the United States through a Western-style court system and police force. (See Biolsi 1992, pp. 7-10, for additional detail.) The impact of this history cannot be underest imated. Many contemporary Oglala Lakota still distrust Western-style court systems and law en forcement. Indeed, OST CIRCLE partners noted that receiving funding from a fe deral agency often makes thei r jobs more difficult - some community members see their work as self-interes ted (that they are there just to collect a pay check) or as being performed on behalf of th e federal government rather than the tribal community (as was the work of the early CIO judges and police). No matter how good the CIRCLE partners' work, history make s it difficult for these community members to see that (for example) the tribal Victims of Crime Office, CASA Program, or CIRCLE Project are trying to do things to help the Oglala people. This sentiment is an enormous obstacle to overcome. It means that the CIRCLE partners and Coordinator mu st deal with the day-to-day problems of the justice system as well as with the system-relate d pain and distrust that have built up through years. In 1934, the Oglala Sioux Tribe accepted the provisions of the Indian Reorganization Act (IRA) by a vote of 1,169 to 1,095, with some 56% of th e eligible voters atte nding the polls (Biolsi 1992, p. 78). Not only was this a slim margin for the passage of a constitutional vote,88 but some of the positive votes may have been based on the an ticipation of material be nefits (perhaps even the return of the Black Hills [ ibid., pp. 78-79]) rather than on info rmed opinions about the Act. Work on the Oglala Sioux Tribe constituti on began in 1935, and although there were constitutional committees comprised of Oglala citi zens, the options they were able to consider were not representative of the intentions of committee members, the Tribal Council, or the Oglala Lakota people. Instead, OST was allowed to develop an \"IRA constitution,\" based on a model and checklist provided by th e Office of Indian Affairs, the elements of which were promoted (many would say \"imposed\") without regard for indigenous culture or governance traditions. (See Biolsi 1992, pp. 92-108 for additional detail.) The Oglala Sioux Tribe's IRA-constituted Tribal C ouncil historically has faced and continues to face opposition. For example, after the creation of the IRA Tribal Councils, the indigenously formed Treaty Councils on the Rosebud and Pine Ridge Reservations refused to disband and refused to recognize the author ity of the Tribal Councils. Th e Treaty Council at Pine Ridge registered its disapproval of the Tribal Council through protest votes and resolutions, including a vote that protested the use of tribal funds by th e Tribal Council without the people's approval and a 1937 resolution to \"abolish the new Indian Reorgani zation...for the reason the officers of the Oglala Sioux Tribal Council every time calls fo r monthly meeting they receiving a great deal 88 In the U.S. system, constitutional votes require a super-majority. Even for day-to-day decisionmaking, the Oglala Treaty Council, a body that relied on fairly traditi onal practices, used a three-quarters approval rule.

Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 115of Tribal funds without consent from the Pine Ridge Indians\" (Biolsi 1992, p. 156). A 1939 audit added to the Treaty Council's di stress. It revealed that the Tribal President had received $210 without proper accounting and that he was issued $2,918.32 in checks for per diem and expenses; in other words, he had received a subs tantial amount of money in addition to his salary (ibid., pp. 158-9). The Treaty Council filed a petition with the fede ral government to call for a tribal referendum on the repeal of the Oglala c onstitution, but it was never called. The Tribal President was impeached in 1941 for embezzlement. The Oglala people's struggle to rebuild tribal govern ment to reflect their values, rather than the values or culture of the United States, continue today. In 2000, the Grassroots Oyate (or \"Grassroots People\") initiated a peaceful take over of the tribal government administrative building to protest the legitimacy of the Tribe' s formal government structure. The Grassroots Oyate occupied the building for approximately one year. Similar to the protest in 1939, one of their demands was for the removal of the OST Treas urer for corruption; i ndeed, six of the nine district governments enacted resolutions calling for removal of the Treasurer, but the central tribal government refused to consider these reso lutions. Also during this time, the FBI seized records and equipment, and federal charges were filed against several tribal political and administrative officials. Eventually, the Tribal Council suspended the Tr ibal President. The crisis' connections to law enforcement and jus tice were wide sweeping: the Tribal Council removed supervisory authority over law enforcement from the tribal Department of Public Safety (and from its commissioners and review boards) and placed this supervisory authority with the Council's Judiciary Committee, and despite 22 years of tribal management, the Council retroceded tribal criminal investigation responsibilit ies back to the BIA. The elections in 2000 signaled tribal citizens' frustrati on with this situati on. Only two of 17 Tribal Council members were re-elected. The ne w tribal administration restored supervisory authority over law enforcement authority to th e Department of Public Safety and undertook a variety of other actions to re store peace to the community. An important point underlying thes e political stories is the fact that Oglala culture, a distinct lifeway from mainstream, Western culture, not only has influenced hi storical processes at Oglala Sioux but continues to influence tribal governan ce, justice policy, community relations, and so on, today. Oglala culture has survived despite high unemployment, high crime rates, and other social ills. Indeed, many would argue that cultur e itself sustains the Oglala (not the other way around). For example, practices such as the Wiping of the Tears Ceremony help the Oglala move forward after losing loved ones. And distinct Og lala culture is evident in many aspects of CIRCLE and the Tribe's justice programs - fr om the Wocekiye (wor ds of wisdom and encouragement) held at the beginning of each CIRCLE meeting and the sweat lodges for youth in Kiyuksa Otipi (the Kyle Youth Detention Cente r) to the CIRCLE team's dedication to healing community members through improved justice system functioning. II. Demographics and Socioeconomic Conditions The Pine Ridge Indian Reservat ion covers 4,500 square miles in southwestern South Dakota. Approximately 40,000 Indians (mostly Lakota) a nd 4,000 non-Indians reside on the reservation. Eighty-five percent of the reserv ation workforce is unemployed, and of those that are employed, This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Alcohol is a pervasive problem, especially among youth, who comprise approximately 40% of the tribal population (ibid.). Of the 1,093 youth housed in Kiyuksa Otipi (Kyle Juvenile Detention Center) at some point during 2000, 65% had been sentenced to char ges that included public intoxication (Oglala Sioux Tribe 2000).89 The Oglala Sioux Tribe Department of Public Safety fiscal year 2000 report notes 11,606 adult arrests for drunkenness (OST Department of Public Safety 2001). III. Community and Nation Building in the CIRCLE Project The community building (horizont al relationships) and nation bu ilding (vertical relationships) challenges associated with the CIRCLE Project ar e tremendous - and more broadly, critical to the development of a more stable form of government at OST. Ho rizontal relationships refer to those relationships community members build with each other as families, clam members, band members, and tribal members. Vertical relations hips are the relationships developed between the government and its people. Generally, if peop le cannot forge horizont al relationships and strategies for interaction, they are unable to bu ild the much-needed vertical ones. Thus, to first build community, OST members/citizens must come together and get along, or at a minimum, confront conflict (via a justi ce system) peacefully. Once community is possible, the people as a nation can formally decide how thin gs are to be run; that is, they can determine the form of OST government. Recent troubles at OST demonstrat e that the community and nation have been pulled apart as a result of events in their history. However, th e picture also shows groups of individuals, such as Oglala Oyate Iwiciyak api Okolakiciyapi (OOIO, or the Society to Strengthen/Defend the People and Families) and CI RCLE, which are working together to rebuild the community and nation. OST's CIRCLE Project facilitates both vertical (Tribal Court, De partment of Public Safety, Corrections Facility) and hor izontal (SuAnne Big Crow B oys and Girls Club, Runaway Homeless Program) relationship development. A dditionally, the CIRCLE Pr oject is trying to accomplish tasks that are at the crossing between vertical and hor izontal relationships (Tribal Youth Program, Court Appointed Sp ecial Advocates, Victims of Crime Office, and the database project at Cangleska). These latter programs ar e addressing both community and nation building responsibilities simultaneously; they provide places for people an d government to meet, as well as procedures and processes that aid in the resolution of personal and institutional controversies. Additionally, by providing structur ed means of communication and compromise, and practice in these interactions, the pr ograms serve as a seedbed for more thoroughgoing change. IV. The Beginning of the CIRCLE Project at OST The Invitation The first general CIRCLE meeting was held on May 18, 1999 in Rapid City, South Dakota. Members of the United States Department of Justice invited representatives of the Oglala Sioux 89 It should be noted, however, that many of the juveniles housed at Kiyuksa Otipi are juveniles involved in federal court or housed by agreem ent with other tribes.

The U.S. Department of Justice (USDOJ) presented the CI RCLE Project concept, invited the three tribes to participate, and distributed application kits. Those in attend ance from OST included the Tribal President, several members of the Tribal Council, and two child advocacy specialists. A prosecutor from the South Dakota U.S. Attorney's Office also attended. Drafting the Application After the Rapid City meeting, the OST Tribal Council voted to move forward with the CIRCLE Project, and a group of key players (comprised pr imarily of individuals already involved with and committed to Oglala Oyate Iwiciyakapi Okolakic iyapi) came together to form an application drafting committee. The group held meetings at va rious sites across the Pi ne Ridge Reservation in order to gain ideas for and to work on the ap plication. During this pr ocess, the South Dakota USAO released the attorney who had attended the Rapid City meeting from his prosecution duties so that he could work with tribal representatives on the application. He tr aveled to the reservation several times a week fo r this purpose, and as the deadlin e grew closer, he traveled to the reservation every day to ensure that the application was completed on time. Participants in the ap plication process did no t always understand the messages that were coming from USDOJ. It may have been that the messages we re unclear, but it is equally likely that, given the Tribe's past experiences with the federal go vernment and USDOJ in particular, some of the messages were hard to hear because they were unexpected. For example, it was not clear at the outset that as long as the app lication was submitted on time, was coherent, and met statutory requirements, it would be funde d. Nor was there a strong sens e that USDOJ was looking for input from OST - some individua ls on the application drafting co mmittee initially believed that Department officials would simply come in and tell them what to do. As the application process progressed, however, and especially after repres entatives from the USDOJ Community Oriented Policing Office, Office of Justice Programs, and Of fice of Tribal Justice visited the Pine Ridge Reservation to promote CIRCLE, the committee came to understand that Project designers within USDOJ hoped the Tribe would be able to use CIRCLE funds to craft a strategy that served OST's unique needs. Thus, the applicati on-drafting group targeted four elements within the justice system on which to focus: prevention, law enforcement services, the Tribal Court, and detention/corrections. On a less pos itive note, one of the other unclear messages at the outset was exactly what kinds of efforts might be funded. In thinking about the best ways to address their target areas, the committee was eager to include a community education component; they wanted to inform and engage community members, so th at they would support and sustain the Project (\"complete the circle\"), instead of viewing it as another Band-aid ini tiative run by people who were not committed to the community and its problems. These ideas had to be removed from the application, however, due to thei r lack of fit with the menu of funding options available under CIRCLE. Because the proposal-drafting committee was leas t aware of the OST Department of Public Safety's needs, the committee and the USDOJ Co mmunity Oriented Policing Services Office worked closely with Public Safety administrators to ga in that understanding. As a result of the COPS Office's assessment, it became clear that th e CIRCLE Project would include a large grant to the OST Department of Public Safety (DPS). This realization created some early community concern that the Project would be dominated by law enforcem ent. The drafting committee and This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 118COPS Office representatives also worked closel y with DPS to consider the impact that ending COPS funding would have.90 The additional involvement w ith DPS necessitated by this complicated issue may have further fueled community concern. As the OST CIRCLE Project evolved, however, law enforcement's role has been complementary to that of the other programs rather than dominant, and this has generated great er partnership. For exampl e, instead of viewing CIRCLE's ambitious crime reduction goal as DPS's re sponsibility, the servic e provider partners in CIRCLE see themselves as engaged with DPS in the reduction of crime. Looking back, there is also some dispute about the role Tribal Court staff played in the application process. Some reme mber court personnel being involve d (at a minimum, they helped arrange for the application drafting committee to meet in the courtroom several times), while others (including court staff) emphasized that they were not involved in the application process. Some court staff recall that they found out about CIRCLE only when they were informed about the funds the Tribal Court would receive as a result of the app lication. What everyone does agree on is that including funding for the court in th e CIRCLE application was critical: the Tribal Court is under-funded, under-st affed, under-trained, and func tions inadequately. Many community members feel that when individuals go to court, nothing happ ens. The perception is even stronger with regard to juvenile cases, which means that many of the Tribe's youth crime and justice problems may be linked to - or even arise from - problems at the Court. The hope embedded in the Tribe's CIRCLE application is th at the strategy of provi ding a probation officer, staff training (for prosecutors , advocates, and other personnel) , and a computer networking system (that links the courts with the police, probation, and prosecutors) will improve court functioning and change the Tribal Court's image.91 An important coda to the CIRCLE application process is that the proposal-drafting committee continued to meet after applicatio n submission. Initially, it attempted to play an informal role in the guidance of CIRCLE. However, the committee was never given any authority by the Tribal Council to act as the steering committee for CIRC LE, so its impact was limited. For example, sustainability was an issue the committee di scussed from the start. Committee members proposed setting aside money from each sub-gran tee and then pooling these funds to support a resource person whose job would be to write grants to sustain the Project. Yet without authority to make this happen, or to substantively affect the implementation of CIRCLE in any other way, the committee eventually abandoned the discussion of CIRCLE sustainability and returned its primary interest to OOIO. To the extent that some of the members of the OOIO oversight body are also partners in CIRCLE and some of the initiatives' issues are similar, the committee's meetings for OOIO offer a limited opportunity to address problems that CIRCLE and OOIO share. But CIRCLE certainly has not been able to access the knowledge and expertise of this established group in the thorough going way that it might have, had the committee been designated CIRCLE's formal steering committee. 90 Despite these early conversations, no plan was ever devel oped to help DPS transition b ack to a smaller staff after the expiration of COPS funding. 91 In 2002, court and law enforcement staff also were discus sing a drug court, an addition that would further remedy the Tribal Court's problems. At the date of writing, howeve r, the Court had yet to submit an application to USDOJ's Drug Courts Program Office. This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 119Goals and Strategy The Oglala CIRCLE Project's goals and compre hensive strategy were refined throughout the implementation process. In general, refinements reflected the CIRCLE partne rs' efforts to better define and target the Tribe's justice concerns. At the outset of the Project, for example, it was unclear how much harm limited prosecution was cau sing within the justice system overall; by responding to this learning, Project principals were able to identify more realistic goals and craft a more effective strategy. The initial CIRCLE strategy focused on Oglala y outh and was designed to respond to three inter- related \"youth concerns\": juvenile crime, a lack of recreational activities for youth, and a lack of juvenile treatment facilities. For example, truancy is a larg e problem among OST youth, and the strategy incorporated the idea that without incentives to stay in school and without things to do while not in school, it is easy for young people to plunge from truancy into crime. Furthermore, there were no treatment progr ams at Kiyuksa Otipi (the Kyle Juvenile Detention Center) to assist youth with the problems that led them to commit crimes (especially drug and alcohol use). Given that one of the initial OST CIRCLE Project goals was to reduce crime by 20%, focusing on youth and on the connections between youth and cr ime seemed a reasonable first approach to mitigating the Tribe's crime problems. As the OST circle of partners proceeded with Project implementation, however, their goals and strategy shifted to address broade r nation-building needs. In the second year of CIRCLE funding, discussions began in earnest about something the partners had l earned in attempting to develop and manage their CIRCLE-related programs: weakne ss in the Tribe's formal justice institutions and processes made all of thei r jobs harder. Of course, under taking system-strengthening tasks would, at least in the short run, compromise their ability to meet the Project's goal of a 20% reduction in crime. Strengthening the justice system would not onl y result in more convictions but, potentially, more arrests. And because extant arrest and conviction rate s had little correlation with the actual crime rate, improvements to th e justice system that increased arrest and conviction rates would make it appear that the crime rate was rising. In other words, it became apparent that without an accurate baseline for criminal statistics and without time for system changes to generate an accurate baseline, the goal of a 20% reduction in crime was unrealistic. Thus, the OST CIRCLE team revise d its goal to focus more dire ctly on the root problem the Tribe faced (a revision which shifted emphasi s toward nation building and away from an untenable statistical target); their new goal was to increase the effectiveness of OST justice system institutions. In its third year, the OST CIRCL E Project continued to pay at tention to youth concerns and justice system improvements, but focused partic ularly on a subpart of the year two goal - namely, on rebuilding the tribal co urt system. This focus was driven by the fact that the lack of prosecution of criminal cases in the Tribal Cour t was the most practical problem standing in the way of other justice system improvements. Even wh en they are taken at face value, the statistics on prosecution are sobering. There is only a 10% conviction rate among the cases filed or charged in criminal court, and there is a strong sense among insiders that this 10% is reflective not of successful prosecution but of individuals who, out of a lack of familiarity with the system, plead guilty. Defendants familiar with the weakne ss of court system request jury trials. The Court must honor these requests, but it rarely has the capacity to follow them through. This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 120The lack of prosecution creates a powerful ripple effect through th e rest of the justice system. Police officers have less incentive to make arre sts when they know that perpetrators will be released immediately due to a lack of prosecu tion. In that case, declin ing arrest rates would reflect incentives against arrest rather than a falling crime rate. Furthermore, probation officers cannot rehabilitate defendants if they are not prosecuted. More often than not, the repeat offenders know how to work the system and walk away without conseque nces, so they are not even offered the services a probation officer ha s at his disposal. Also, victims are offered no relief or justice if perpetra tors are not held accountable. Yet the lack of prosecution is, most profoundly, a signal of problem s within the Tribal Court. A well functioning court system would be more effective in monitoring cases, setting them for trial, refusing to allow prosecutors to dismiss case s, motivating police officers to work with prosecutors in moving cases forward, and in ot herwise filling and acting upon the docket. For this reason, the OST CIRCLE team has come to re alize that the Tribe does not need to simply \"improve\" the court system but, if it hopes to tr uly protect and preserve the Lakota people, to rebuild the Tribal Court to reflect community needs and culture. This is a daunting task for any Indian nation, but particularly for the Oglala. Here, proponents of serious system change are often met with strong resistance and even intimidation. One individual noted that not only does the CIRCLE team n eed funding and technical assistance, but its members also need courage. Certainly, they alrea dy have made one courage ous step forward: by advocating for serious system change, those who ar e tribal employees esse ntially have put their jobs on the line. Remarkably, two other groups, the Task Force on Sexual Abuse and the Pine Ridge Area Chamber of Commerce, have joined the CIRCLE team in calling for court system reform.92 Ultimately, this institution rebuilding should enable the Tribe to reduce crime. It is not a quick solution, but it may be the only effective one, which ma kes it imperative that USDOJ (and other external investors) understand the CIRCLE team's (and other change agents') commitment to court reform and, howe ver possible, continue to support it. The CIRCLE Project Coordinator Similar to discussions at the federal level, there were early discussions at Oglala about where to house CIRCLE. Cangleska, already deeply involved with justice system operations, offered to act as the coordinating agency. However, the Tr ibe was looking for an individual to run the Project, not an organization. Th e first OST CIRCLE Coordinator, Daryl Mesteth, was hired in August 1999 but soon left the post. Bart Merdanian, formerly an assistant to OST President Harold Salway, was hired as the CIRCLE Proj ect Coordinator in October 1999. Mr. Merdanian resigned in January 2001, primarily because the politic al pressure to do things counter to what he 92 It is worth noting that the OST CIRCLE team realizes th at its goal of Tribal Court and prosecution reform is something that the Project cannot accomplish alone, and thus, it has cultivated relationships with these like-minded groups. But it is also the case that such fundamental change cannot o ccur without champi ons, and the CIRCLE partners may have stepped into that role. This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 121thought was best for CIRCLE and its partner programs had become too intense.93 Eileen Iron Cloud was hired as the CIRCLE Coor dinator in late January 2001. Ms. Iron Cloud describes her role as CIRCLE Coor dinator as all-around go-to person, organizer, facilitator, administrator, couns elor, and mediator for the Project . Specific tasks mandated by the grant are to coordinate the lo cal CIRCLE components, abide by USDOJ's specific administrative and accountability requirements (for example, to file semi-annual progress reports and various financial reports), and trav el to numerous meetings. A major obstacle the Coordinator faces in carrying out these tasks is a lack of administrative support. Despite the complexity of the Project and the size of the funding package - factors that generate a substantial workload - no money was made available for this function. Thus, Ms. Iron Cloud reports spending a considerable amount of ti me on tasks that an administrative assistant might perform equally well. The absence of a sta ff assistant is felt in another way when the Coordinator must travel to the meetings: there is no one in the office to ensure that invoices are signed, reports are filed, or daily problems ar e addressed. Faced with these many duties and responsibilities, the ac tual time the Coordinator can commit to implementing the comprehensive strategy or assisting the CIRCLE components in strengthening their programs is quite limited. In that sense, the Coordinator has very lit tle time to truly \"coordinate\" the Project. Similar to the lack of funding for administrativ e assistance, there was no funding in the grant package for basic necessities, like office rent, ut ilities, or a computer . The OST CIRCLE Project Coordinator has had to make due in an offi ce without heat or air conditioning and with a computer borrowed from another agency. Given these challenges, the Tribe is fortunate that as the longest-ter m Coordinator, Ms. Iron Cloud brings a broad portfolio of skills to the job. Her experience includes management, government, and strategic planning and plan implementation. She also has a background in organizing, which helps her tap the energy of the community in effecting change. Moreover, she works to share her knowledge and skills with the local CIRC LE team, which encourages and better equips the group in addressing its difficult system change goal. Selection of the Programs Involved with CIRCLE Component programs of the OST CIRCLE Project fo llowed different paths to their inclusion. Some of the programs were represented at the fi rst CIRCLE meeting in Rapid City. For example, the director of the Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) Program heard about the CIRCLE Project, wanted to learn about the opport unities it might offer, and made a request to attend the informational meeting. Representative s from both Cangleska and the Runaway and Homeless Youth Program were involved in the a pplication process. Other components, such as the Tribal Court, were neither represented at th e Rapid City meeting nor actively involved in the application drafting process, but were included in the applicati on. Thus, many key players on the CIRCLE team have been involved with the Project from the beginning. 93 Tragically, a drunk driver killed Mr. Merdanian three week s after his resignation. Had the Tribal Court been able to access and act upon the driver's reco rd, he probably would not have been on the road. Thus, many felt that Mr. Merdanian died as result of the exact problems he had been working to solve. This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 122However, other key players, most notably the Tribe's prosecutors, have been absent throughout. As emphasized above, one reason for their lack of connection is the ove rall weakness of the Tribe's justice system. The number of cases pros ecuted in the Tribal Court by staff of the OST Attorney General's Office has been waning for several years, and though attempts have been made through CIRCLE and by other means to increas e their activity and to engage them in the process of justice system strengthening, the situa tion has been slow to ch ange. One factor may be the high turnover in the Attorney General position94 (which may itself be an indicator of other, underlying problems). Of course, another point made above is that at the out set of the application drafting process, it was not obvious to the CIRC LE planners and partners that the lack of prosecution was such an enormous problem. The issue became clear only as CIRCLE implementation progressed. The Role of Community Education Community education was an impo rtant part of the initial draft CIRCLE strategy. The original plans for the OST CIRCLE Project included comm unity activities every six months and budget line items in support of community outreach, su ch as money for translators and meeting handouts. These formal elements of community outreach were dropped from the implementation of CIRCLE. Nonetheless, the a pplication-drafting group wanted th e Project to be a full circle between the partner programs, the tribal government, and the tribal community. As CIRCLE got off the ground, however, there were difficulties in realizing this vision. Because they were concentrating on de veloping new services and expa nding existing offerings, the CIRCLE partner programs tended toward relativel y individualistic effort s. The funding freeze (described below) exacerbated this tendency - each program was so busy trying to survive that the directors had difficulty conducting their own work, much less work together. The lack of cooperation was especially eviden t in the second year applica tion for CIRCLE funds, which did not really reflect a group effort or team-drive n strategy. Critically, limited teamwork also caused relationships between the CI RCLE Project and the community, which had begun to emerge during the application process a nd the very early stages of CI RCLE implementation, to wither. After the restoration of Project funding and through more consistency in the Coordinator position, however, CIRCLE regained its group focus and has been able to reach out more (and more cohesively) to the community. Representa tives of several partner programs have spoken regularly on KILI radio to inform the commun ity about their services and CIRCLE's efforts. Many of the components are involved in other collaborations, such as OOIO and the Sexual Abuse Task Force, which gives them an op portunity to discuss CIRCLE with additional community justice and social service practitione rs and to inform community members who may be more tied to those other programs. The eval uation-related focus groups convened (and to be convened) by Oglala Lakota College faculty and students will provide further community education and involvement. The Coordinator's de cision to bring two comm unity members to the January 2002 CIRCLE cluster meeting in Wa shington, DC was another mechanism for educating, involving, and tapping th e energy of community members for the CIRCLE Project. 94 As of May 2002, another new Attorney General had been hired. Her goals include office reorganization and moving forward with more trials. These are important pos itive steps, ones that, it is hoped, will receive broader governmental and community support. This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 123It should be noted that not all of the CIRC LE partners expressed a desire for community engagement. A few felt that the group should focus on the work that needed to be accomplished and that community outreach took valuable time aw ay from it. Others were frustrated with the misinformation in the community and the commun ity's distrust of federally funded programs. Even so, most directors and staff of the CI RCLE programs demonstrated their dedication to community engagement through their efforts to provide information and to involve community members in their programs. And certainly, th e few individuals who verbally expressed a disinterest in involving the co mmunity with CIRCLE or CIRCLE' s evaluation nonetheless work tirelessly at providing serv ices to the community. The Freeze of CIRCLE Funding A History of the Funding Freeze Early in the process of applyi ng for CIRCLE, the planning gr oup expressed concern about the Tribe's ability to manage Project finances in an accountable and externally acceptable manner. The specific concern was that the Tribe lacked adequate financial management infrastructure to deal with a grant as large and complicated as CIRCLE: because CIRCLE funding was composed of grant monies from several offices within USDOJ, there were different rules on how each portion of the funding could be used. This would be a difficult grant management task even for a state government, let alone a tribal government w ith a checkered financial management history. As an alternative to direct tribal management , Department of Public Safety representatives suggested that DPS manage the f unds; although it is a tribal depa rtment, its financial operations are a step removed from the central tribal govern ment/Tribal Treasurer's Office. The possibility of having Cangleska, Save the Children (a member organization of OOIO), or a specially created and completely separate fiscal agent manage the funds was also considere d. But whatever entity ended up managing the funds, the committee realized from the start that , USDOJ training on rules, regulations, and expected accountability might be necessary. The tribal application-drafting committee was not alone in expressing concern. All OJP and COPS grantees are required to have a financial system that is able to receive funds, account for their use, and provide repor ts back to OJP on a quarterly basis. Grantees also must have an audit mechanism that meets external financial standards. Some federal partners expressed worries that the Oglala Sioux tribal government did not have these capabilities. But their fears apparently were put to rest when the U.S. Department of Justice Office of the Comptroller, which was required to verify that each tribe had sufficien t infrastructure to handle the CIRCLE grants, expressed its confidence in OST. The USDOJ's Comptroller's Office had dealt with OST's financial office on prior grants a nd was of the opinion that the Tr ibe had adequate infrastructure to fiscally manage the CIRCLE grant. Thus, the dr afters of the application ultimately agreed to have the Tribal Treasurer manage the funds. As recommended by the CIRCLE pl anning committee, when the grant was awarded, the Tribe made a request for technical assistance to ensure that it had the appropriate infrastructure and procedures to manage the grant funds. 95 USDOJ granted the request and sent a team to Pine 95 The evaluators heard conflicting versions of these events, particularly from various federal personnel. The most common version is reported here. This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 124Ridge in December 1999 to conduct the trainin g. During these sessions, a USDOJ comptroller noticed that a large draw down had occurred and that the money had been placed in the Department of Public Safety account, but that appropriate documentation to support the draw down was not present. At this point, becaus e the DPS draw down wa s essentially unapproved, OST's CIRCLE funds were frozen. At USDOJ's re quest, the Department of Public Safety returned the funds to the CIRCLE account, but stil l more time was needed to address USDOJ's accountability concerns. The USDOJ Office of the Comptroller conducted a site visit and made several recommendations about changes that could be made to ensure the proper handling of the grant funds. These changes were made; they included the requirements that invoices and payments be approved by the OST CIRCLE Proj ect Coordinator and USDOJ Comptroller prior to the disbursement of funds, draw down requ ests be approved by the Tribal Treasurer and USDOJ Comptroller, and grant recipients be e ducated on the new policie s and procedures. After this, the USDOJ Office of the Comptroller was satis fied that there was an appropriate draw down process in place, and the freeze was lifted. The freeze placed the Project on hold for almost a year, which severely constrained the partner programs' ability to begin their work and make progress toward CIRCLE' s goals. And while the freeze resulted in procedures that improved acc ountability and increased tribal administrators' appreciation of the need to orient program staff and directors on financial reporting and accountability standards, it is yet to be seen if these changes have long-term impact. Much of the burden of keeping the funds flowing post-freeze a nd making sure that furt her irregularities do not arise has fallen on the Coordinator's shoulders . For example, she worked with the CIRCLE accountant to provide a training fo r all sub-grantees, which was in tended to help them be better prepared for handling grant money. Observations on the Afterm ath of the Funding Freeze Many individuals were upset that the team effort that had gone into CIRCLE had been undermined by a single organization and that its actions had harmed all of the partners. Furthermore, several individuals had attempted to prevent such a problem, but tribal and federal pressures to move the Project forward thwarted th ese attempts. It seems th is is a case where a somewhat slower start and close at tention to tribal feedback (which is what the \"government-to- government relationship,\" \"tribal consultation,\" and a \"participator y project\" ought to be about) may have prevented a fairly debilitating occu rrence in the OST CIRCLE Project's life cycle. Preliminary fiscal management trainings mi ght have prevented a yearlong set back. Certainly the freeze hurt the CIRCLE partners fina ncially. Its othe r harms are evident in a point made above: the freeze weakened the partners' ab ility to work as a team, which, because the Project was so new, was already fragile. It genera ted distress in the short run, and as the year wore on, it forced the program directors to \"hunk er down\" and tend only to their own programs. Once funding was unfrozen, it was relatively easy for the CIRCLE partners to proceed with implementation of their particular parts of the CIRCLE Project, but relatively difficult to regenerate and grow a sense of partnership and a desire for teamwork. Ms. Iron Cloud reported that when she came on board as Coordinator (s hortly after the resumpti on of funding), it took significant effort to move group members past their anger and into a mindset where they could work fruitfully together as a team. This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 125Given where they were, it is remarkable how far OST CIRCLE team members have progressed in their sense of partnership. During the first si te visit by the external evaluators in March 2001, tribal CIRCLE partners expressed a great deal of frustration; duri ng the final visit nearly a year later, the atmosphere and group dynamic were completely different. Team members supported each other in addressing the obstacles they were facing; they had identified common problems and were beginning to focus on problem solving; and they were talking about the efforts they could make both as individual programs and as a team to address the Tribal Court, broader government infrastructure, and nation-buildi ng challenges the Ogla la Lakota people face.96 V. Implementation of the Ogla la Sioux Tribe CIRCLE Project This section presents information about each of the partner programs in the OST CIRCLE Project, with an emphasis on the organizationa l changes the CIRCLE Project facilitated and on the progress the program has made toward its sp ecific CIRCLE-related goal(s). Where possible, the discussions close with reference to data that may be useful for outcomes analysis (the focus of Phase II of the CIRCLE Project evaluation). This section is written from the perspective of mid-year 2002, before the end of the federal government's three-year funding commitment. The Tribal Court In recent years, several organiza tions have conducted reviews of the Oglala Sioux Tribal Court system. They have identified much the same set of problems: an insufficient number of judges, a lack of probation officers for both adult and juve nile monitoring, the absen ce of an Office of the Public Defender, no training for prosecutors, the l ack of a computerized record keeping system, and limited service of summons and warrants. Prio r to CIRCLE, for example, the Court had to rely on the police department to serve warrants, notices, summons, and ci vil papers; because the department did not have the sta ff or resources to perform this service, record s suggest that approximately 50% of subpoenas requested by the prosecutor were not se rved. Also, at the time of the Phase I evaluation there were only thre e full-time judges (although as discussed below, there were plans to hire an additional child support enforcement judge). The 1999 Assessment by the Northern Plains Tribal Judicial Institute noted that Tribal Court staff had indicated that a jury trial had not occurred for three years and that ther e had been no juvenile trials for an even longer period (Northern Plains Tribal Judi cial Training Institute 1999, p. 9). Goal The Tribal Court's CIRCLE Project goal is to stre ngthen the criminal justice system so that it will be responsive to the needs of the Oglala Sioux Tribe's citizens. Progress and Challenges The Court has made some progress toward its goal. CIRCLE funding provided for a process server, and his work has resulted in an increa se in the number of summons and notices served. 96 Although the funding freeze was a difficult obstacle fo r the CIRCLE Project and the partner programs to overcome, it did have benefits. It spurred the development of procedures not only for CIRCLE but for other grant programs as well. At present, no tribal programs are allowed to make lu mp sum drawdowns without explanation; tribal procedures require documentation of what the funds are used for.

Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 126This service was conducted only on the western porti on of the reservation; more recently, service has been extended to include the eastern portion. Of course, unless the case backlog is cleared, making it possible for new cases to be heard, the impact a process server can have is limited. CIRCLE funding also was used to support probation officers in Pi ne Ridge and Kyle, which is another important step forward fo r the OST criminal justice syst em. In early 2002, the officers were supervising more than 110 probationers, and since their work began the year before, nine individuals have successfully completed proba tion. While on probation, individuals are offered numerous opportunities to receiv e support and training, including AA meetings and classes in parenting, DWI prevention, domestic violence prevention, and GED preparation. (Some courses are required while others are optional, depending upon the individual.) In Pine Ridge, probationers also have the option of shortening their sentences by partic ipating in community service, such as the garden pr oject or other commun ity activities. Technically, the community service program is designed for those who have b een adjudicated, but because so few individuals are being prosecuted, there are ex cess \"spaces\" in the program. As a result, the probation officers have opened the community service program to a nyone who is incarcerated in the Pine Ridge jail. While successful, the probation program is wrestli ng with numerous challenges. For instance, there is a lack of physical space in Pine Ridge for a probation o ffice. The officers also desire training but have received little. Although the fi rst CIRCLE-funded probation officer was hired in 1999, the first training that OST officers attended was in A ugust 2001. A particular training need is in procedure development, as the curren t OST code lacks provisions and guidelines for probation officer procedures and the tribal officers have had to develop them on their own. Fortunately, the tribal officers developed a relations hip with the U.S. Probation Office to assist them with many of their questions, and Cangleska , which also supervises probationers, has been able to provide some additional assistance, es pecially with procedure development. Another problem has been the lack of a database that would allow officers to monitor clients. The probation officers developed thei r own databases for year 2000- 2001, so that they would be better able to identify the most troublesome offenders, but this work is not technically a part of their jobs. The probation officers al so struggle with the enormity of their task; each supervises over 50 probationers, a number that is likely to grow as the court a nd prosecution systems are strengthened. Finally, there is no current plan to continue the probation offices once CIRCLE money is depleted. The Tribe is not in a position fi nancially to fund the offices, and so in spite of the probation officers' success, it is unclear whether their program will remain operational. Another positive organizational change that may result from the CIRCLE Project is the development of a child support enforcement and cu stody division of the Tribal Court. The Court received money in the th ird year of CIRCLE to contract for an additional judge and a prosecutor for this Court. It is hoped that the separate forum will move the custody cases forward in a timelier manner and decrease the caseload for the judges in the main Court, thus speeding the disposition of other cases. Change is much slower on other fronts. The pilot program with the U.S. Attorney's Office to increase the prosecution rate, which would involve Assistant U.S. Attorneys prosecuting misdemeanors in the Tribal Court, is stalled. For a short period of ti me, an Assistant U.S. Attorney who was also a former OST Tribal Cour t Judge was assisting with the prosecution of This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 127misdemeanors, but she has since left the U.S. Atto rney's Office, and the Court is still struggling with the lack of prosecution. Additionally, the Court has yet to develop an automated court records system, although one is desperately need ed. (See the Cangleska discussion, below, for more on progress with the automated system.) Observations and Lessons The biggest problem the OST Tribal C ourt faces is the l ack of prosecution. Interestingly, this sticking point was not addressed in the Tribe's initial CIRCLE strategy and grant application. Conversations with CIRCLE staff indicate that at the time, the partners simply were not awar e that deficiencies in prosecution were so central to the other justice problems they faced. Yet the solution is not straightforward - many parts of the just ice system and of the Tribe overall will have to do their part to make sure that cases go to court and are tried. For example, the Tribe will have to find a way to retain a law-trained Attorney General and prosecutorial staff, someth ing that - whether due to locational preferences, political interference, or both - has proven difficult (during the first, 18-month phase of the evaluation, the A ttorney General position was filled and vacated several times). It might also be wo rthwhile for the Tribe to revive its pilot program with the U.S. Attorney's Office, in which Assistant U.S. Attorneys help prosecute misdemeanors in the Tribal C ourt. Besides increa sing the prosecution rate, the program might foster a better relationship between the U.S. Attorney's Office and the Tribal Court. To make this work, however, the Assistant U.S. Attorneys have to be willing to abide by rules of the Oglala Sioux Tribal Court and refrain from imposing their views onto the Court. Teamwork requires commitment from all parties. Throughout this phase of the evaluation, external evaluation team memb ers both observed and received reports about many meetings that prosecutors were invited to attend but did not. It is unclear why they choose not to participate in these important justice system-rebuilding efforts. Regardless of th e reasons, however, their presence is a necessity: the OST CIRCLE Project goal for 2002 is to improve the Court and increase prosecution, which cannot happen without the prosecuto rs' cooperation. Significantly, the Tribal Council has a criti cal role in making this happen, so its members must also be committed to having an effective prosecution unit. In the past, the Council has drawn the Attorney General away from prosecutorial duties and into the role of a general counsel. Not only has this put undue pressure on a single individual to perform two completely different jobs, but it has been unfair to both branches of government, which have legitimate legal needs. The Tribal Court needs an Attorney General who is committed to and focused on the prosecution of criminal cases, since without one (or one with competing responsibilities), it is difficult to enga ge the prosecutors in system change. On-site training for the prosecutors and c ourt staff may be helpful. Ideally, the Court would conduct this training in a manne r similar to the training sponsored by CASA on child abuse. In order to crea te a broad knowledge base and a greater sense of teamwork, CASA invited all se rvice providers, law enforcement, and This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Together, the various groups learned what their roles ought to be and increased their commitment to system change. A similar training process would prevent the prosecutors and court staff from feeling singled out as \"the problem.\" Indicators of Ongoing Prog ress and System Change An increase in the number of cases prosecuted Increases in the number of individuals on probation and the number completing probation OST Probation Statistics 2001, excluding Cangleska probationers* # on Probation # Having Completed Probation Kyle 72 0 Pine Ridge 40 9 * Cangleska supervis es domestic violence probationers only.

Increased court staff satisfaction Development of automated court record-keeping system Department of Public Safety Goal The OST Department of Public Safety's or iginal CIRCLE goal was to reduce crime by 20% during the lifetime of the grant and to improve the credibility of law enforcement by involving the community in law enforcement efforts. While the crime reduction goal has been modified to a more general focus on crime prevention a nd reduction, the latter goal is unchanged. Progress and Challenges Prior to CIRCLE, the OST Department of Public Safety had a COPS Universal Hiring grant that was about to expire. The COPS funds provided through CIRCLE prev ented the Department from losing the 60 officers it had hired under the Universal Hiring grant and allowed an increase in the total number of COPS-funded officers. As of May 2002, there were 73 COPS-funded officers in this 99-officer department. In an effort to use its COPS officers in the most effective manner possible, the OST DPS created special response teams, or task forces, that correspond with the Tribe's initial youth-focused CIRCLE strategy (there are task forces on juveni le crime, bootleggers, drugs, and burglary) and This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 129assigned four COPS officers as school resource officers. A lthough it is not known how much criminal activity would have been identified in their absence, the task forces appear to be productive; for example, the bootlegger and drug task forces have each identified 80-90 bootleggers and dealers. The follow-up activities of the police, prosecutors, judges, and probation officers with these cases will be an impor tant sign of progress not only for DPS but for the entire CIRCLE Project. DPS also used COPS grant funds to purchase equipment and vehicles , improve communication technology, and train its officers in community policing. For example, the Department intends to use COPS funding to place two repeaters on their towers to increase officer-to-officer and officer-to-base communication. The improvement to radio communication is critical as there are several areas on the reservation where officers can be out of contact. However, the funding for third-year technology purchases is on hold unt il a technology assessment is completed by the U.S. Department of Justice. (This is true fo r the other CIRCLE tribes as well.) OST requested this assessment in early 2001 (shortly afte r the December 2000 CIRCLE cluster meeting at which USDOJ representatives agreed to help th e tribes try to secure technology assessment funding), but it was not implemented until spring 2002. These changes, particularly the increase in de partment manpower, have presented the OST DPS and CIRCLE Project with several critical challenge s. The first - DPS's inability to furnish the new officers with basic policing equipment or vehi cles - is largely an internal (tribal, non- federal) challenge. For example, the COPS gr ant included funding for uniforms, but these resources have not fully \"trickle d down\" to the officers, and some even have had to buy their own uniforms. COPS money also made it possible for the Department to purchase a variety of new vehicles (15 Sport Utility Vehicles, two All-Terrain Vehicl es, and two snowmobiles), but the grant program does not cover operating expens es such as insurance and maintenance costs; thus, DPS has been unable to put the vehicles on th e road. While it is easy to criticize COPS for this restrictive funding rule, the fact that the other participating tribes in the CIRCLE Project found ways to overcome this problem appears to place responsibility for this challenge with the CIRCLE Project, DPS management, and DPS's supe rvising authorities (i ncluding the BIA). This latter point deserves expansion. The Zu ni CIRCLE Project addressed the problem of inflexibility in COPS funding rules by approach ing the local BIA Supe rintendent with the request that the vehicles be placed under the tr ibe's P.L. 93-638 contract for maintenance and insurance - with the understan ding that the CIRCLE Project w ould buy economical vehicles and re-budget the remaining COPS fund s for the purchase of comput ers, cameras, and additional uniforms, which is allowed under COPS grants and which ot herwise would have been purchased with 638 funds. In essence, they swapped respons ibilities for certain ki nds of purchases. The Northern Cheyenne CIRCLE Project reached a different and shorte r-lived solution, but it is a solution nonetheless. The Tribe has agreed to lend the BIA-managed police department the new COPS-funded vehicles for the duration of the COPS grant; at the end of th is period, the vehicles will be returned to the Tribe. The situation has played out very differently at Oglala Sioux. As at Zuni, the Tribe approached the BIA to request absorption of vehicle opera ting costs under the Tribe's 638 contract for law enforcement. But because the COPS funding was already fully spent, there was no opportunity for a swap; BIA agreed to finance maintenan ce and insurance for the COPS/CIRCLE vehicles This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 130only if OST would agree to give up other budget items in the contract. To ensure that this decision is enforced, local BIA personnel active ly scrutinize police ve hicles' identification numbers to make sure that BIA funds are not being used to operate CIRCLE vehicles. Realistically, an in ability to re-prioritize ot her items in the DPS budget is the reason a Northern- Cheyenne style solution will not work at OST eith er; at Northern Cheyenne, the BIA controls the police department, so it was th e BIA and not the Tribe that had to do the (difficult) re- prioritization, but it nonetheless occurred. A second, immense (and, technically, federally im posed) challenge the OST Department of Public Safety faces is how to retain at least some of the COPS-funded officers brought into the Department through CIRCLE. Once the COPS gran t is exhausted, the Department faces the possibility that its force size will shrink to 26. Given that the reservati on is divided into nine different districts, this staff reduction would re duce each district to police coverage by only 2-3 officers (who must then spread their time out over a 24-hour period). Th e staff reduction would also dismantle the task forces. The Chief of Po lice, tribal CIRCLE partners, and the community are very concerned about the impending loss of officers. Although COPS program managers have indicated that the grants may be extended fo r a year or two, an extension merely pushes the problem a little farther into the future. DPS is in cr itical need of planning that can help avert or mitigate this situation. Observations and Lessons The OST DPS example demonstrates that the circle of part ners not only would have been more comprehensive, but more functional, had BIA been included in the CIRCLE Project in a deliber ate (and funding-relevant) way. Grant management training and grant planni ng assistance may be helpful to the Department. Better grant management may have averted the equipment problem and the vehicles problem (for example, it might have led to some funds being \"held back\" for negotiation with the BIA, as they were at Zuni). Grant planning assistance may help the Department find other sources of manpower funding and/or help its leaders thi nk through feasible alternatives to a large police force. Tribal citizens' reactions to the Depart ment's attempt to implement community policing are mixed. On the one hand, repor ts suggest that community policing has yet to take root. The police force is fairly young/inexperienced, the training for community policing began only in 2000, a nd it might be expected that full internalization of this new policing strate gy will take several years. Individuals in focus groups and some of the tribal youth evaluators encountered were especially adamant that the police were untrained, act ed too aggressively, and did not respect community members. On the other hand, formerly staunch oppone nts of community policing (many of them veteran officers) report having \"come around.\" Individuals within the Department noted that over the last several years, officers have increased their cooperation with the districts, whereas before, many declined to engage in grassroots collaboration and proble m solving. Additionally, some service This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 131professionals outside the formal set of CIRCLE partnerships, who might therefore be less attuned to community polici ng, reported hearing of and experiencing situations where community policing has had a positive impact. In particular, they cited increased feelings of safety arising from officers' greater willingness to visit homes and ask what they can do to help families, and from their greater \"positive\" visibility (for example, officers passed out candy at Halloween and volunteered to serve dinner at holiday events). These impressions might not be contradictor y. It is typical for those within an organization to see change first. The chal lenge is to make change wide sweeping enough for the outputs of change (such as officer conduct, attendance at community meetings, and home visits) to become broadly visible in the community. Providing officers with ongoing training and encouragement is one way to address the challenge. The Departme nt also ought to publicize what it is doing, so that people are primed to obs erve and support the change in law enforcement strategy. Recent turmoil in the Department probabl y has been an important factor behind its inability to use the COPS vehicles and better prepare for the expiration of the COPS grant. In other words, it is not surprising that an agency weathering turbulence and suffering from often random , politically imposed change lacks an ability to plan effectively for the use of current funds or for the future. In the upheaval of 1999 and 2000, the police chie f was replaced, the Tribal Council seized oversight authority over the Depa rtment, and parts (if not all) of the Department were under threat of retrocession to the BIA. Indicators of Ongoing Pr ogress and System Change A short-term increase in the number of arrests to illustrate the effect that an increased number of police officers have on the Department's ability to enforce the law, and a long-term decrease in the number of arrests to illustrate the deterrence of crime 97 OST Arrest Totals, 1998-2001* FY 2001 FY Juveniles 3,944 3,948 Not available Not available * These statistics were derived from annual reports of the OST Department of Public Safety and account for the number of arrests for adult and juvenile major offens es, minor offenses, and tra ffic violations. The reports also contain statistics for non-arrest contacts. 97 The OST CIRCLE team and evaluators remain agnostic as to the definition of \"short term\" and \"long term\" during this phase of the CIRCLE evaluation, but anticipat e addressing the issue in Phas e II. A present approximation is that a short-term period is five years and a long-term period is 20 years. This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Both are 10,713 square feet, have a 28-person capacit y, and were originally built as holding centers rather than longer-term detention facilities. In addition, the Tribe has a juvenile detention center, which also is located in Kyle. Of ten, individuals will be sentenced in the Tribal Court, but cannot be held due to a lack of dete ntion space. It is estimated that 65% of the 22,000 arrests made over the course of the last thre e years were alcohol related (Oglala Sioux Tribe 1998), yet neither of the adult faci lities provide detoxification se rvices to assist those with alcohol problems. These two problems - the Trib e's limited detention space and its lack of detoxification programs within th e detention facilities - tend to compound other problems within the OST justice system. Goal The corrections goal listed on the initial CIRCLE application was to improve current facilities and develop a detention-related alcohol/drug detoxification facility. Since then, the goal has evolved to developing a new correctional facility that includes alcohol/drug detoxification services. Progress and Challenges Prior to the employment of a project manager for the corrections center in March 2001, efforts were proceeding quite slowly. A planning committee was doing some work, but there was no one to carry out the day-to-day administrative tasks necessary for getting the project off the ground. Significantly, these tasks not only include ove rsight of facility construction but also include development of the policies and procedur es necessary for the facility's operation. Even with a project manager in place, construc tion planning has been fairly drawn out. One of the first delays arose because of a disagr eement between OST and the USDOJ Corrections Program Office (CPO) about facility size. The Trib e's study determined th at a 250-bed facility was needed, but CPO declined to fund anything more than a 115-bed facility. According to CPO representatives, they simply were holding OS T to its 2000 CIRCLE app lication, which proposed 115 beds. In response, tribal personnel pointed out that the due date for this application preceded completion of the Tribe's needs assessment study. Ev entually, in an effort to move forward, the CIRCLE team, corrections planning committee, and project manager deferred to CPO's decision, although some close to the building effort harbor a lingering fear that the new facility will be filled to capacity immediately. A later delay ar ose when CPO switched corrections construction consultants. The first consulting firm CPO engage d for its grantees worked closely with the OST Corrections Project Manager and provided substant ial useful guidance, which sped the project along. But with the change in consultants, th e relationships broke dow n, and planning progress slowed (although less than it might have, since the first consultant worked with OST free of charge for a brief period following the change). This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 133In the interest of making the best use of fu nds, the project manage r and project planning committee also delayed progress. Their specific concern was that CPO had paid too little attention to the facility's operating needs. CP O's funds were for construction only, and the project manager and project planning committee felt strongly that they ought to identify a source of operating funds before moving any farther ahea d. After multiple petitions to the South Dakota Congressional delegation and to the BIA, the Tribe gained a commitment from the BIA to provide operating support - but it took many months. The most pressing current challenge to prog ress concerns funding. Tr ibal representatives believed that participatio n in the CIRCLE Project would guarant ee them adequate funds to build the facility, especially since they had acquiesced to CPO's mandate of a 115-bed jail. But CPO representatives felt their commitment was to fund ing projects that were progressing well, and in the third year of CIRCLE, they decided that th e project at Oglala Si oux was not far enough along to receive funding. CPO obliquely warned the Tr ibe of this decision in a February 2001 letter (from the CPO Program Manager for the CIRCLE Project to OST President John Steele) and quite directly in an April 2001 letter (from the CPO Di rector to OST President John Steele). Unfortunately, it appears that th e individuals who most needed th is information did not receive it: the OST CIRCLE Project Coordinator, Corrections Project Manager, and others involved with corrections planning visited CPO in August 2001 w ith the full expectation that funding was still forthcoming. It was not until after this meeting that the USDOJ Office of Tribal Justice made contact with the OST CIRCLE Coordinator and Co rrections Project Manager to clarify CPO's stance. Since CPO worked on a regular basis w ith the OST CIRCLE Coordinator, it is most surprising that she was not dire ctly informed of the loss of funding. USDOJ's consultation process (which attempted to create communication between individuals with similar ranks in the US and OST governments and between individuals with similar CIRCLE implementation tasks) may have worked for other purposes, but failed he re. It generated a mismatch between those in USDOJ with the information and those at the tribal level who needed it. Since then, the Corrections Program Office has to ld the Tribe that it may compet e for future funding through the regular grant process and that th e Tribe stands a good chance of re ceiving such funding. Even so, there is a real risk that the wo rk done to date will prove futile. Observations and Lessons The timetable set within the CIRCLE Proj ect for correctional facility planning and construction was unrealistic and predictably unrealistic given the context (for example, the Bureau of Prisons has been attempting to set up a halfway house within the boundaries of the reservation for nearly 10 years). The reasons to proceed more slowly include political pre ssures (often precipitated by the rapid turnover of tribal admi nistrations), siting problems (stemming, among other things, from variegated land ownership a nd infrastructure deficits), and tribal citizens' deep-seated distrust of the U.S. federal governm ent (given Wounded Knee II, OST citizens may be especially di strustful of USDOJ). A more realistic timetable might have minimized frustration and even averted some setbacks. The Tribe's success in gaining a commitment from the BIA to staff the facility is an example of what can be accomplished by asserting greater self-determination over the grantor-grantee relationship. The Tribe may have gained a larger facility This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 134or a more realistic timeline (while there are probably more, these are known examples of things OST had to give up in order to move forward) had a stronger focus on self-determination been a part of the negotiations with CPO (and had CPO been more responsive to the OST context). Alternatively, if the Tribe's insistence on such points led to a mutual decision to not pursue construction of a new facility, this, too, would have been an exercise in self -determination - and one that would have left less of a bitter taste than the possibility now on the table, that after much progress, the dream of a new facility nonetheless will be abandoned. Runaway and Homeless Youth Program Goal The CIRCLE-related goal of th e Runaway and Homeless Youth Pr ogram (RHYP) is to reduce, control, and prevent crimes against tribal youth by advocating for runaway and homeless youth and by developing and implementing a coordinated and collaborative system to ensure the safety and protection of these youth. Progress and Challenges CIRCLE provides funding for the RHYP Director's salary and for stipends for safe home providers. Because the program is relatively sm all and quite dependent on CIRCLE funds for its operation, the progress its Director could make toward Project goals was severely constrained by the funding freeze; for example, during the freeze, nine potential safe homes were lost. Since the restoration of funds, however, two new host homes have been licensed, and the Program is engaged in ongoing outreach to recruit even more . In the same period, the program has made contact with and referrals for 189 runaway children, provided serv ices to 37 homeless youth, and acquired software to enhance its record keeping and data collection. Another highlight has been the Program's involvement in the issuance of a Standing Order by the Chief Judge regarding the necessary procedural stipulations for detainment of youth in the Kyle Juvenile Detention Center. Much of the RHYP's work is accomplished th rough partnerships with other agencies. For example, the Program has benefited from part -time clerical assistan ce provided through the Temporary Aid to Needy Families (TANF) program . The RHYP Director also works closely with OOIO and both tribal and n on-tribal social welfare agenci es to improve the services provided to Pine Ridge youth. For instance, she is active with the Sexual Abuse Task Force and OOIO's Children's Advocacy Group, which is enga ged in redrafting the children's protection laws. These interactions not on ly increase other providers' knowledge of the RHYP but the Program's ability to serve its clients as well. Observations and Lessons Teamwork can foster success that an individual cannot: the Runaway and Home- less Youth Program is best able to ach ieve its goals by working with other programs and organizations. RHYP's i nvolvement with CA SA, OOIO, CIRCLE, etc., allows it to move forward on sp ecific goals and see how its work is complemented by that of other programs and agencies. This experience has made the RHYP's Director a leading advocate of cooperative work. He r vision is of a This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 135single resource center that w ould provide \"wrap around\" serv ices, so that no tribal children and youth fall through the cracks. Can a non-profit agency achieve more succes s than a tribal program at Oglala Sioux? The RHYP may be a test case, as it is likely to move toward non-profit status when CIRCLE funding expires. N on-profits appear to have greater sustainability than some tribal progra ms because of their greater access to foundation funds and their greater insulati on from tribal politics. On the other hand, some programs might be more appr opriately located within the public sector; for example, certain accountability concerns or a mandate to reach a broad segment of the population may argue for government agency service provision. Indicators of Ongoing Pr ogress and System Change An increase in funding to expa nd/improve services offered Opening of the emergency shelter An increase in the number of safe homes Conversion to a non-profit organization A short-term increase (and long-term d ecrease) in the number of youth needing services SuAnne Big Crow Boys and Girls Club Named after SuAnne Big Crow, the Boys and Girl s Club was one of the first in Indian Country. SuAnne Big Crow was the star of her high school basketball team and led the Pine Ridge team to several state championships. Much more than a leader in sports, she was also a spokesperson against alcohol use and abuse. He r dream was to go to college and return to Pine Ridge to help establish a program to help other youth find the strength, confidence, and inspiration to succeed. She wanted a place that would be \"Happy Tow n, USA\" - a place that was safe, where youth could escape and avoid violence and abuse. When SuAnne's life was cut short by a tragic car accident, her mother was determined to make SuAnne's vision come to life, and her determination resulted in the founding of th e SuAnne Big Crow Boys and Girls Club. Most members and observers agree that the 10-year-old Club is a phenomenal success and that through it, SuAnne's vision lives on. Goal The SuAnne Big Crow Boys and Girls Cl ub's CIRCLE-related goals are to expand geographically and programmatically (that is, to serve more youth in more locations and in more ways). Progress The Boys and Girls Club has accomplished much despite the initial delay in funding. CIRCLE monies support the direct or of the Targeted Outreach Program and pay for two part-time staff, all of whom were hired in early 2000. The progra mmatic expansion spearheaded through Targeted This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 136Outreach includes the Smart Moves, Nike Play Da ily, and Job Ready programs. In order to draw youth inside the Boys and Girls Club and into these activities, the Di rector for Targeted Outreach is visibly active outside the Club - he conducts weekly school visits and participates in neighborhood walks. The Director is particular ly focused on reaching out to youth that may succumb to gangs, and to that end, he has received training in gang awareness and gang education, is developing collaborative agreements with the Department of Public Safety, and presides over the Pine Ridge Gang Task Force. He also is reaching out to youth whose behavior has brought them into contact with off-reserva tion, non-tribal juvenile authorities. His most significant accomplishment on this front has b een the development of a Memorandum of Understanding with Rushville, Nebraska which stat es that Oglala youth arre sted in Rushville will be referred to the SuAnne Big Crow Boys and Girls Club Targeted Outreach Program for community service and necessary classes. The Boys and Girls Club also has been successf ul in its geographic e xpansion. CIRCLE funding has allowed the Club to lease the new recreati on center in Wanblee, as well as three other satellite offices. Lessons Learned The Boys and Girls Club's status as a national non-profit may be one reason for its success and longevity. As a non-profit, the Club is able to seek funding from a broad array of sources (corporations, pr ivate philanthropies, federal, state, and tribal government, etc.), and it is relative ly immune to the influence of tribal politics (of course, this also may be due to the fact that the Club has gained respect through success and, as a result, is allowe d to operate without interference). In combination, these factors have underwritten the Club's extraordinary success and may make easier for the Club to maintain the positions created by CIRCLE than it will be for other tribal programs. The funding freeze created significant cha llenges not only for programs that were new and/or fragile but also for well-est ablished organizations like the Boys and Girls Club. Regardless, once the Club r eceived its CIRCLE funding in December 2000, it moved forward quickly and accomplis hed much in a short time span. Indicators of Ongoing Pr ogress and System Change An increase in the number of youth participating in Club activities Development of a relationshi p with the Tribal Court that allows delinquent youth to be referred to the Club A long-term decrease in gang-related crimes Court Appointed Special Advocates Program The Court Appointed Special Advo cates (CASA) program is receiv ing two separate grants under CIRCLE, one from the Tribal Youth Program/Vol unteers for Tribal Youth Program (VYTP) and the other under the Childre n's Justice Act (CJA). This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 137Goal - VYTP The goal of VTYP is to recru it individuals to vol unteer and mentor youth in the Tribe's Emergency Youth Shelter. This program was placed under CASA because CASA already had instituted a volunteers program. Progress and Challenges - VYTP As of February 2002, CASA had been unable to fi nd a qualified candidate to run the volunteers program. The hope was to recruit an individual with a Maste r's degree so th at youth being mentored through the program might also receive counseling services. Observations and Lessons Learned - VYTP CASA and other local entitie s are aware of the difficu lties of recruiting highly trained candidates to reservation-based j obs, but external funders, evaluators, and review boards tend not to be. The result is a set of expectations about the possibilities for a program that might not be realistic, and such expectations can limit progress. Many tribes and rural communities face si milar skills and recruitment dilemmas, and experience suggests that there are ways to relieve it. One option is to hire interns who are working toward Master's degrees for a semester or summer (indeed, some tribal service providers already are using this opportunity). A permanent CASA employee could supervise the intern(s), and this way, it would be possible to gain both expertise and pr ogram continuity. A nother option is to contract with an outside or ganization (for example, a service provider located in Rapid City) for particular services, or to share an employee with another Tribe (which might allow a higher total salary ). Ideally, the contractor or shared employee would travel to the reservation on a regular basis; alternatively, service recipients could travel to the provider, whic h is at least better than not being able to offer the services at all. A third op tion is to hire an individual who may not have the educational certifications, but ha s some experience and the dedication to do the work. Although the individual might not be able to provide counseling services, he or she could be a resource to refer people to other counselors, and the experience might even encourage the indivi dual to seek the education necessary to provide counseling (CASA could suppor t this option through flexible work hours or tuition contributions). Goal - CJA The goal of the CIRCLE-affiliated CJA grant progr am at Oglala is to develop a \"circle of investigation, prosecution, and servi ces\" around children who are abused. Progress and Challenges - CJA CJA's grant programs fit exactly with CASA 's purpose, which made CIRCLE funding quite helpful to CASA. Moreover, the CIRCLE-relate d CJA grant was awarde d at a point when CASA's existing funding supported activities for only three-quarters of the year. CASA used CJA grant funds to pay a portion of three employees ' salaries (the CASA director, a children's This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 138mental health specialist,98 and an office assistant) and the full salary of one employee (a child advocacy coordinator). Especially in the later st ages of CIRCLE, this support freed the director to spend more time planning for the future, both in terms of funding and in terms of program development. Because CASA already was struggling to su rvive, the funding freeze was particularly detrimental to its program implementation and progress toward CIRCLE goals. Even after the freeze was lifted, ongoing funding dela ys slowed CASA's progress. These arose both from the post-freeze funding request requirem ents and the fact that CIRCLE money flowed only indirectly to CASA - it was first paid to the Tribe a nd then paid out by the Tribe to CASA. CASA principals reported gaps as long as three months between the submission of draw down paperwork and their receipt of funds . It is unclear whether the dela ys originate within the tribal or federal government or both, but whatever th e source, these funding gaps make it extremely difficult for programs like CASA, which have no \"cushion\" funds, to do their work. Despite these problems, CASA has moved forward toward its goals. As noted, it has been able to hire more staff. Additionally, it has recruited and trained more advocates. As of February 2002, there were 27 active advocates, some of whom w ill be trained to work with abused children. It also has used CIRCLE funds to train service providers and provide community education on child abuse. In September 2001, CASA co-spons ored a training conference, which it called Wakanyeja Ob Kinanjinpi Nan Awanwicaglakapi (Stand Up For The Children And Watch Out For Them), that focused on inter-agency issues in child sexual abuse. Although the conference occurred a full year after the technical assistance request was submitted (a lag due in part to the funding freeze and in part to the di fficulty of finding a time that wa s convenient for all potential attendees), it was a great success. A testament to its success is the fact that participants - police officers in particular - have asked for more trainings. CASA personnel and conference attendees both have noted that holding the meeting in Pine Ridge helped generate this positive experience, as the location allowed more community memb ers and service provider staff to attend. A pressing challenge that CASA has yet to address is its lack of capacity for data collection and analysis. CASA would like to have accurate lo cal statistics on child abuse and other child protective needs and a better system for tracking cases. The Director has discussed this issue with the CIRCLE-funded probation officers, who have independently created systems for tracking their caseloads, but has concluded that the process is overwhelming, particularly because CASA lacks staff time and equipment to commit to the project. Observations and Lessons Learned - CJA Cross trainings, such as the one sponsor ed by CASA, are an effective way to bring multiple service providers together to learn not only about a particular issue but also about each other and the services they each provide. At least within the Oglala Sioux community, and perhaps ge nerally throughout Indian Country, these trainings are most effective when they are easy to attend (that is, local). 98 TYP provides the remainder of this salary. This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 139 CASA has avoided being di stracted by the problems that characterize the OST justice system and has instead managed to work collaboratively with other tribal and non-tribal agencies toward their joint goals. In this regard, it may be a model for other CIRCLE partners. Through its i nvolvement with organizations such as OOIO Wakanyeja Ikiciyapi Woophe (Children's Advocacy Laws - Group #7, which is focusing on redrafting OST laws to better protect children) and the Sexual Abuse Task Force (which is fo cusing on developing protocols for all service providers involved in sexual abuse cases), OST CASA is able to do more than simply make sure an advocate shows up for a child's interview or court appearance. The agency's partnerships w ith other, complementary organizations help its staff concentrate on the best outcomes for chil dren and, ultimately, on the bigger picture - overall justice system improvements. 99 Indicators of Ongoing Progress an d System Change - VTYP and CJA An increase in the number of volunteers More local trainings Development of a database that help s CASA monitor child abuse cases and analyze overall trends in child protective needs Victims of Crime Office Goals The overall and CIRCLE-related goal of the OST Vi ctims of Crime Office (VCO) is to develop a network of service providers (inc luding the Department of Public Safety, Tribal Court, Attorney General's Office, IHS Mental Health and Soci al Service programs, BIA programs, OST Human Services programs, private agencies, and advocac y groups) who offer important direct services for victims of crime and to improve victims' access to those services. Progress and Challenges While the Victims of Crime Office is ten years old, its small size and large number of clients often have threatened to swamp it. With CI RCLE funds, however, the VCO director has been able to hire two part-t ime staff members and a TANF particip ant (to help with clerical tasks); together, they significantly increase the Office's capacity to meet client needs. The workload sharing made possible by a larger staff also give s the VCO director time to assess needs and gaps in service provision and to reach out to new pa rtners. OOIO and the Sexual Abuse Task Force are two such new partners, and VCO hopes that in the near future, it can incorporate traditional healing into its network of services. Additiona lly, the expanded staff improves Office outreach (staff members have had time to app ear on KILI Radio, for instance). 99 The CASA program appears to be a true success story for the CIRCLE Project and the Oglala Sioux Tribe. A more specific case study (of CASA's success, how it ha s met challenges, and how it might meet remaining challenges) may be a useful element of Ph ase II of the CIRCLE Project Evaluation. This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 140Observations and Lessons Learned Unlike the Victims of Crime Office, most of CIRCLE's partne r programs work with offenders or potential offenders. In itially, this difference meant that VCO tended to see the overall CIRCLE goal of crime reduction as \"somebody else's problem\" (and, in particular, the Department of Public Safety's problem). Through work on the CIRCLE team, however, VCO staff members have become convinced that all of the partner progr ams and all community members have a role in meeting this goal. They have come to realize that if each program works in the ways it can to improve the justice system, the system may eventually change, and crime will be better addressed and better deterred. OST VCO personnel believe that cultural components are vital to victims' healing processes. However, the guidelines that re gulate grants from the federal Office of Victims of Crime make it difficult to f und such components, and the OST Office has been forced to be more creative in supporting and foster ing this aspect of healing. Indicators of Ongoing Pr ogress and System Change An increase in number of victims served Here we note that an increase would be an indicator of program progress and system functioning. Preliminary evidence, however, suggests movement in the opposite direction. Clients Served by the OST Victims of Crime Office Fiscal year 1998 1,129 Fiscal Year 2000 (estimate*) 990 * Estimate based on the numbe r of clients served from January-June 2000 (445). Improved client follow-up The addition of traditional healing cerem onies to the menu of services offered to clients Tribal Youth Program Goals The goal of the Tribal Youth Progr am is to ensure that detainees in the OST Juvenile Detention Center (JDC) have an advocate to liaise on their be half with the JDC itself, the Tribal Court, and the OST Attorney General's Office, and to ensure that every youth who enters and is released from the JDC receives an appropriate intake and release needs assessment. A long-term goal is to help coordinate various agenci es' services to yout h to \"wrap around\" yout h needs and, through this multi-faceted service provision, decrease juvenile incarceration.

As of February 2002, only one Court Services Advocate for youth had been hired although there has been funding for two positions. This single advocate has accomplished much. Prior to the development of the TYP and advocate position(s), it was not uncommon for the tribal Depart ment of Social Services to place children at the JDC in lieu of finding foster homes. The Court Services Advocate, OOIO representatives, and tribal judges worked in coope ration on an order to prohibit su ch placements, an order which the advocate and JDC staff now actively enforce. As a next step, the ad vocate is working with the police to prohibit the use of criminal inves tigator holds, in which juveniles are placed in detention while waiting to be interviewed by a criminal investigator; there is no basis in law for this procedure, although some police officers ha ve come to rely on it. The advocate also has developed and implemented an intake and releas e assessment process for the JDC, and works on implementing these plans with IHS mental health staff, parents, and sch ools. Finally, with the advocate's assistance, the JDC a nd other providers of services to juveniles are making progress in developing wrap-around service, although ther e is no formalization of this process (through, for instance, an inter-agency Me morandum of Understanding). The TYP's primary challenge is the dearth of hear ings in the Pine Ridge branch of the Tribal Court. In at least one instance, a juvenile waited in the JDC for an extended period of time with no word from the Pine Ridge court about a h earing, and the advocate had to push the Tribal Court into action. Some of the advocate's latest work may lead to significant change, however. She has begun exploratory conversations with st aff of the SuAnne Big Crow Boys and Girls Club about the development of a teen court, wh ich could be housed at the Club. A teen court could remove much of the juvenile hearings lo ad from the Tribal Court and improve the speed with which justice services ar e delivered to tribal youth. Observations and Lessons Learned Institutionalized procedures help mainta in change; for example, the Court order against the tribal Department of Social Services gives the Juvenile Detention Center and the Court Services Advocat e ongoing power to prevent DSS from using the JDC as a \"home\" for youth in need of care. Similar institutionalization (MOUs or MOAs, ordinances, written pr ocedures for the JDC, etc.) may be necessary to maintain the other positive changes the advocate has achieved. This is especially true if the advocate position(s) disappear with the completion of CIRCLE funding.

Its CIRCLE-related goal is a sub-goal is this overarching effort: it hopes to reduce violence against Native women by creating and installing an information networking system that is capable of generating and maintaining a domestic violence offender database. Progress and Challenges Independent of and prior to CIRCLE, Cangleska had begun to develop a database of domestic violence offenders that could help the agen cy increase offender accountability and promote women's safety. However, information in the Cangleska database was available only to or through the agency's advocates and probation officers. Funding from CIRCLE has enabled Cangleska to hire a networking specialist whos e work should expand system accessibility. As of February 2002, a communication tower for the system had been placed on the Kyle branch of the Tribal Court and work was underway on the placem ent of a Pine Ridge branch tower. CIRCLE also has provided some technical assistance funding for training system users. Once the system is in place, tribal courts and jails should have access to up-to-date probation and protection order information. System access will s till be specified by Cangleska, however, which will make victim safety the primary consideratio n its determinations. At a minimum, prosecutors and correctional officers will be able to access and add information. Observations and Lessons Learned Teamwork is not always an easy ta sk. Convincing seve ral different law enforcement agencies that it is a good idea for them to be linked online and coordinating the implementation of that vi sion has been difficult. The fact that Cangleska is not a tribal government enti ty but, rather, a non-profit tasked with law enforcement duties complicates the process: some individuals within the agencies to be networked have expressed concern about a non-law enforcement agency managing a law enforcement database. It may not be unreasonable for Cangleska to have this sort of involve ment. Nevertheless, it is an issue that Cangleska and the tribal law enforcement agencies need to address and resolve, since outstanding concerns discourage potenti al users from entering data into the system or relying on the information it can produce. Cangleska, like CASA and the SuAnne Big Crow Boys and Girls Club, demonstrates that a non-profit can provide services that the tr ibal government, at present, is unable to. While even a thick layer of non-profits cannot substitute for a well-functioning tribal government, effec tive non-profits impr ove the health and safety of the community in the short r un (that is, until the tr ibal government is reformed/rebuilt).

Promoting Change at OS T through the CIRCLE Project Limitations on the OST CIRCLE Project's Theory of Change A theory of change approach to evaluation identi fies the intended outcomes of an initiative, the activities that need to be implemented to achieve the outcome, and the contextual rationale for the approach (Connell and Kubisch 1999). This sort of evaluation works well when attempting to assess the progress of a comprehensive initiativ e, since it acknowledges a community's self- knowledge, the fact that different outcomes may be desired in different communities, and that the means even for achieving the same goal may diffe r between communities. Ideally, this type of evaluation helps change agents consider whic h programs and processes are moving toward a goal and which are not, allows them to re-assess their strategies, and promotes more effective deployment of limited resources. In sum, pla nning, implementation, and evaluation fit hand-in- glove through this methodology. Unfortunately, it has been difficu lt to apply a theory of change based evaluation framework to the OST CIRCLE Project and, thus, realize the benefits of such an approach. The problem has been the lack of a well-worked out, consistent , and complete logic mo del to guide CIRCLE's work at OST. This is not to say that the CIRC LE Project has not had remarkable outputs; it has, and they are detailed in the foregoing section. Nor is it to say that tribal implementers lack an understanding of what, how, and w hy justice-system enhancing change should be effected within their nation. Rather, the problem is that both tribal political interference and federal limitations on action have restricted the obj ect and means of CIRCLE's work, and these restrictions have made it impossible to state and put into practice a workable logic model and theory of change for CIRCLE - not to mention having made it difficult for the OST Project overall to move forward in a coordinated way to accomplish change. Two observations support this conclusion. For one, OST set two different goals (and perhaps three, depending on one's interpre tation of the Project's third-year focus) for its CIRCLE Project funding 100: in the first year, CIRCLE's goal was to decrease crime by 20% through improvements to the lives of Oglala youth; in th e second year, the goal was to address substance abuse, domestic violence, and juvenile crime through efforts to make justice system institutions more effective; in the third year, the team narrowe d its institutional focus to rebuilding the tribal court. Certainly, theory-of-change based evalua tion supports the refinement of comprehensive initiatives over time - yet goals are not the usual object of refine ment in the implementation of a comprehensive initiative. More commonly, underlying ideas about how change works in the community (\"We thought the mayor was really the key, but it turns out that the comptroller is\") or about the activities that support change (\"We thought co mmunity education would create popular pressure for the mayor to change her mind, but it turns out that she responds better to a face-to-face meeting\") are subject to revisi on. OST's changing goals thus signal several possibilities. One is that the Project's local designers were given insufficient time to think through community problems and aggregate that information into a correct, cohesive, and 100 This paragraph may be interpreted as being critical of the fact that OST changed its goals mid-stream. It should not be. Instead, it is intended to shine a light on the circum stances that led OST Project de signers to set an original goal that was both unrealistic and inapplicable to the Trib e's real needs. Indeed, the Project's leaders should be commended for refocusing on those needs and determining to meet them through nation building. This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 144Middle Layer: The Project's Limited Range for Action consistent goal; given the lack of early assessm ent in the CIRCLE Project (Fisher 1998, p. 1) this is a strong possibility. Another is that, given the context, especially the political situation at OST, it was unadvisable or even dangerous to address a particular problem (or perhaps to explicitly address it) through CIRCLE. Only at mid-stream did OST's CIRCLE Project move toward what many consider the critical community justice issu e at OST, which is reform of the judicial system. It is possible that had CIRCLE defined th is goal at the outset, it might not have been allowed to pursue its work at all.101 The fact that community participation in and s upervision over the Project was absent until a year and a half into implementation (and even then, in a relatively informal way) also supports the assertion that OST's CIRCLE Proj ect was constrained from putting a workable logic model into practice. Both internal and external analysts have argued that legitimate action occurs less through central tribal government functioning than it does through \"lower-level\" community- based institutions. And yet, the menu of funding o ffered by the U.S. Department of Justice (and the restrictions on that funding), strongly discourage d the inclusion of this type of oversight. In other words, people know how legitimate change occurs within the community - they have an overarching theory for effecting progress - but it has not been easy for them to apply it to CIRCLE. One way to see what CIRCLE has been struggling w ith is to picture a logic model or theory of change as having three layers: the top layer is the problem to be solved, or the Project goal; the second is the implementation of programs in suppor t of that goal; and the th ird is the contextual rationale that supports this approach. Having been prevented until quite recently from being clear about the Project's ultimate goal and having been discouraged from relying on the known supportive processes for system change, OST's CI RCLE Project has been able only to work in the middle - implementing programs and \"getti ng things done,\" but not necessarily being capable of creating sustainable moment um for fundamental system change. Figure 1: The Range of Motion for OST's CIRCLE Project Goal: Strengthen Justice System (esp. Reform/Rebuild OST Court System) Activities: Implement Programs and \"Get Stuff Done\" Contextual Rationale for Action and Ch ange: Community Support and Involvement 101 Politics influenced the design of the CIRCLE Project in year 2 in yet another way: tribal political-financial difficulties led to the first-year funding freeze and, during the planning phase for year 2, forced the Coordinator and partners to focus on the Project's survival rather than on goal-setting, strategy, and a well-worked out logic model.

They are listed and discussed below. Greater Progress toward Change is Li kely to Require Greater Community Involvement. At many meetings and in many inte rviews and conversations with evaluators, community members stressed a n eed for change in the justice system - but it was also obvious that they were not engaged in CIRCLE's work. According to many tribal members, it is also th e case that the IRA government has not fostered change, nor is it often supportive of it. From OOIO to the take over at the Red Cloud Building, it is apparent that th e community is an important change agent. Given this, the future of the CIRCLE Project greatly depends on its ability to draw in the grassroots . Sources of funds other th an the federal government might have to be tapped, or non-monetary resources deployed to the task. One positive point is that the Tribal Council el ected in 2000 has tried to make more of a commitment to change and to become more involved in community meetings, which may make CIRCLE's work easier. Critically, however, the Council needs to continue to empower the community and to su pport, assist, and foster change - even through election cycles. Substantive Change is Likely to Require a Greater Focus on Nation Building. CIRCLE's final goal of court rebuild ing probably cannot be accomplished without greater support at the Tribal Council level. The Tribal Council has expressed interest through their idea of an OST Department of Justice, but this move must not be a simple re-naming of the system already in place - the Tribe must address the OST justice system's fundamental problems. A nation building frame for thinking about these problems w ould help the Council focus on reforms that might result in a more effective, culturally appropriate justice system. CIRCLE's partners and the C oordinator must find ways to talk to the Tribal Council about this viewpoint, demonstrate its importance, and work through their programs to support the Council in making positive change. Effective Change is Li kely to Require More Consci ous Incorporation of Cultural Practices. OST CIRCLE team members have re cently begun to discuss the fact that in order to have a strong nation, th ey need strong governing institutions that fit their culture. This is not to say that th is is a new realization but, rather, one that the group is increasingly prepared to act upon in their programs. There is a sense (which is supported by theory and resear ch, see for example, Cornell and Kalt 1995) that culturally empowered institutions and practices will be more effective. Reasonable initial projects (propose d by the CIRCLE partners and supported here) include a better inte gration between community policing and the practices and authority of traditiona l people and traditional cu lture (such connections can help reinforce the fact that policing is not simply about enforcing the law but also about helping parents get truant children back in school, serving dinner to the elderly, and playing basketball with the youth); the use of traditional healing This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice. 146ceremonies for victims of crime; offering sweats for youth in the Juvenile Detention Center; and incorporating Lakota spirituality into the adult correctional facility's detoxification program. The OST CIRCLE Coordinator and partners must work with USDOJ (and other f unders) to help them see how these non- Western definitions of policing, healing, a nd treatment are appropriate targets of support within the ove rall initiative. Effective Change is Likely to Require Ongoing Support of Local Change Leaders. Because of the especially challenging environment in which change is being attempted, ongoing progress will require c onsistent and committed leadership. This is the only CIRCLE pilot that experienced turnover in the Coordinator position, and additional turnover may be harmful. 102 To keep progress moving forward, retaining the current Coordina tor is probably criti cal, and steps to support her in this position are equally crit ical. Support might come in the form of additional USDOJ-funded training for the pa rtner team (especially training that might complement the Coordinator's skil l set), resources for the coordinator position from USDOJ or some other funder, and resources to support the Coordinator's renewed attempts to implem ent a theory of change based strategy (such as money for community educa tion projects rela ted to CIRCLE). Realistic Expectations for Change Will Ar ise from a Closer Examination of the Local Context. Given the context, initial expectations - especially external expectations - about the amount of cha nge that could be fostered by the OST CIRCLE Project were unrealistic. This poi nt is reflected in conversations the CIRCLE partners have had about arrest da ta, in the trouble the Bureau of Prisons has had establishing a reservation-based halfwa y house and the parallel difficulties CIRCLE affiliates have en countered in planning a CPO-funded detention facility, and in the effect of OST's somewhat endemic political instability on justice sy stem functioning, among othe r things. These kinds of contextual information should not have dissuaded USDOJ from inviting OST to participate in CIRCLE; instead, they should have helped USDOJ work productively with OST to conceptualize a more realistic and workable strategy for change. It is not too late to pay su ch attention to c ontext and strategy. Ongoing Evidence of Change Will Require the Development and Use of Relevant Statistical Data. Most of the OST CIRCLE compone nts collect data in some manner - the difficulties are understanding whether it is the correct data with which to mark progress, finding ways to sustain its collection, and finding some means to pool data and encourage its co mprehensive interpretation. At least one interviewee emphasized the need for a st atistical department or cross-agency representative who could focus on just ice system data collection and use. Ultimately the Tribe may want to augm ent the system being put in place by 102 The point is not that turnover per se is detrimental - in fact, since it led to the employment of a highly skilled third Coordinator, the turnover to date may have had a positive result. Instead, the point is that a program like CIRCLE benefits from both strong and consistent leadership , that further instability in this position is risky, and thus, that support ought to be provided to maintain and encourage the current leadership.

Whatever decisions are made, more organized data collect ion is critical. It will he lp the Project move beyond basic program implementation to performa nce assessment and the refinement of partner efforts: if the CIRCLE partne rs determine that their programs and processes are not having the hoped-for effects, they can determine and make necessary adjustments. Reflection on Past Successes May Inspire the Team for the Work Ahead. At this point, the OST CIRCLE Project faces seve ral daunting challenges. One is to motivate broad acceptance (particularly tribal government acceptance) of its goal to rebuild the OST court system. Anothe r is the impending end of federal funding for CIRCLE. In the face of these challe nges, team members might benefit from reflection on their past accomplishments . They have already done much to improve the system, particularly in terms of \"gap filling\" (putting programs in place where there were none before). Ha ving endured the freeze in federal funding, they have survived much and ga ined strength. Thes e experiences can energize them for the road ahead. Future Success Will Depend on Ongoing Teamwork. OST's CIRCLE Project has built on the teamwork of OOIO and brought a dditional players to the table. These partnerships will be useful for the stag es ahead and, indeed, ought to be expanded (key players that are still missing include tribal prosecutors and a variety of federal agencies). The tribal -federal partnership also ha s been critical and should somehow be institutionalized. This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

This appendix documents the implementation status of each template component as of mid-2002. Interviews with the Directors of CIRCLE Project Component Programs External evaluators visited w ith directors and staff of the various CIRCLE Project components during each of the three site vi sits to better unde rstand how the components fit into CIRCLE, what their goals are, and how they are making progress towards those go als. The end product of these interviews can be f ound in the substantive report Community and Nation Building at the Oglala Sioux Tribe: The Oglala Sioux CIRCLE Project . Identification of Extant Quantitative Data and Its Usefulness as Baseline/Benchmark Measures Most of the OST CIRCLE Project's partner programs collect some type of quantitative data. (The full report identifies some of the specific extant data.) However, there is no consistent mechanism through which justice system data can be compared or aggregated. Indeed, much of the data is kept in paper format only and according to systems developed by individual staff members. Numerous interviewees mentioned the n eed for a single system that could aid in the collection, sharing, and comparison of criminal justice system data. Mini-Cases Students who will write mini-cases and the subject of these cases are still being identified. This will continue into Phase II of the evaluation. Cross Agency Partnership Survey Evaluators asked questions about changes in communication and partne rship in the partner program director and staff interviews. They al so conducted an informal written survey and a discussion on this topic duri ng the Phase I exit meeting. Focus Groups To date, two youth focus groups have been co nducted. The purpose of the focus groups is to assess the community's attitudes towards law en forcement and the tribal justice system. The focus groups are also an opportunity to educ ate the community about the CIRCLE Project. Additionally, the groups help gene rate questions and format in formation for a community-wide survey on the tribal justice system. One focus group was held with high school students and another with students in Kiyuksa Otipi, the Kyle Juvenile Detention Center. Th e findings from the two groups include: There are no services for youth being inte grated back into the community after incarceration.

American Indian probation officers might alleviate this problem.103 Youth feel there are few or no consequen ces for misconduct and illegal acts. They cited an incident at Red Cloud School where two youth brought firearms to school, were arrested, and were released as soon as their parents came after them. Moreover, the incarcerated yout hs feel that if there had been consequences at the tribal level, they would not have ended up in the federal system. The youth at Kiyuksa Otipi feel there is not a graduated punishment system within the detention center. Their perception is that youths violating center rules received the harshest punishment permissible. Juveniles incarcerated at Kiyuksa Otipi re ported an absence of classes through which they could continue their educations. High school youth feel the tribal police \"have attitudes,\" and several students stated that they had witnessed and hear d stories about police \"acting higher, better than other people.\" Youth feel that the 7 p.m. curfew is too restrictive. Once the school is shut down at 7 p.m., there is nowhere for youth to play. Tribal police are spotlighting homes in the cluster housing. If youth are on the lawn or porch, the police will shine th eir lights on them. Sometimes the police even walk up to houses and shine their flashlights in the windows. High school youth feel that some school security guards are too aggressive and search students improperly. They th ink security cameras would be more appropriate as a security precaution. The youth question what the tribal police do with the alcohol they confiscate - there is a belief that the police get drunk on the weekends. If true, this sets a double standard. The youth also questione d whether the police were fair in enforcing alcohol-related violations. One youth cited an instance where a drunken individual approached her father and inc ited a fight. Her father was placed in the drunk tank even though he had not been drinking. 103 We note the possible contradiction here with statements in the main text that juvenile prosecution (and, hence, incarceration) was not occurring at Oglala Sioux. Our und erstanding is that this comment was made by a tribal- member youth on federal probation - that is, someone whose offenses were adjudicated and penalized outside the tribal system. It could equally well have been made by a youth from another tribe living on the Pine Ridge Reservation after having been incarcerated in the juvenile facility there (the facility houses juveniles from several other Lakota/Sioux tribes).

They cite d an instance when the police came in and tried to shut down a Youth Opport unities dance at 11 p.m., when it was scheduled to go until 12 a.m. Some youth reported that police conduct sear ches of young women improperly - by pulling their bras or touc hing them inappropriately. Students living outside the populated areas of the reservation agreed that most of the problems happen in the populated areas and not in \"the country.\" Gang fights are occurring some of the housing areas (such as Wanblee). Quality Assurance Team A formal Quality Assurance Team (QAT) has not yet been formed. However, the CIRCLE Project Coordinator and the lead on-site evaluation team member ha ve functioned as an informal QAT. All evaluation materials and activities have been discusse d with them. The Coordinator updates the OST CIRCLE team in meetings and in informal settings on activities of the evaluation. The Coordinator and lead on-site evaluator then provide the off-site evaluation team with any feedback or concerns. This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.
