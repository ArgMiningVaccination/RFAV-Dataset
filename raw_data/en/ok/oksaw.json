Oiling is certainly a basic component of your hair care routine. Oil can penetrate the hair shaft thereby delivering hydration and preventing hair damage.

It can also trigger allergic reactions in those with sensitive skin. Yet a basic oiling routine can be judiciously followed, after consultation with a hair professional. For instance, [hot oil massage](https://www.femina.in/beauty/hair/oil-massage-for-hair-all-you-need-to-know-109018.html), if done in a proper way, can do wonders. A warm oil massage is said to be more beneficial than a cold oil massage as the heat can facilitate blood circulation, thereby boosting nutrient supply to hair follicles. Hair also absorbs oil better when it is warmer. Do not overheat as it can destroy the nutrients. Do not start oiling your hair indiscriminately, especially if you have oily hair. Consult a hair expert beforehand. Q. What are the best foods for hair growth? A: Applying hair masks as home remedies is fine, but you have to fight hair damage internally as well. Your hair care routine is incomplete if your meals do not contain the foods that are essential for your hair health.

So, consult a dietitian first and then opt for a diet that contains eggs (protein and biotin), leafy vegetables (iron), nuts and seeds (Omega 3 fatty acids), and avocado (Vitamin E) and whole grains and meat (Vitamin B). Of course, this is not an exhaustive list of the best foods for hair growth. Consult a dietitian for more options. Take foods that are rich in protein, biotin, Vitamin B, Vitamin B 12 and Vitamin E.
