Originating in China more than 2,500 years ago, acupuncture is currently one of the most thoroughly researched, practiced, and respected forms of holistic medicine available. According to Chinese Medicine, your overall health is determined by 5 main factors: The flow of oxygen/function of your body (Qi) The flow of blood in your body (Xue) The health of your blood vessels (Xue Mai) The health of your organs (Zang Fu) The health of your nervous system (Jing Mai) Acupuncture uses a variety of techniques, including placing very thin sterile needles into specific points on the body, to stimulate and influence these 5 factors.

Questions will be asked regarding symptoms, health and lifestyle. Your acupuncturist will also check your pulse and tongue and may conduct a physical exam. With this information, a diagnosis and treatment protocol with other recommendations will be made. An acupuncture treatment may last from 30-90 minutes. The needles are approximately the size of a cat's whisker. The needles come in a sterile container and only used once. The sensation caused by an acupuncture needle varies. You may experience vague numbness, heaviness, tingling or dull ache where the acupuncture needle has been inserted. Sometimes people experience a little pain as the needles are inserted. All these reactions are good and a sign that the treatment is working. The depth of insertion varies from person to person. After treatment, you may feel energized or may experience a deep sense of relaxation and well-being. How To Prepare: Write down and bring any questions you have. Make sure you are fed, hydrated and not in a rush when you come in for treatment. Refrain from overexertion, tough work outs, drugs or alcohol for up to 6 hours after treatment. Avoid stressful situations. Make time to relax and be sure to get plenty of rest and water. Between visits, make note of any changes that may have occurred, such as alleviation of pain, pain moving to other areas, or changes in the frequency and type of symptoms. Education Requirements For Acupuncturists: Today, acupuncturists undertake three to four years of extensive and comprehensive graduate training at nationally certified schools. All acupuncturists must pass a national exam and meet strict guidelines to practice in every state. [National Certification Commission for Acupuncture "}
