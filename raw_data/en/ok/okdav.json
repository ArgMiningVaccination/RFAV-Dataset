I like to get in the flow of working with patients and sometimes I don't really have time to soften things for them. This week I learned that sometimes a little straight talk can be exactly what's called for. I saw an older couple this week who were about to do some travel. They're vaccinated, boosted, and the whole lot. They felt like they were totally protected because of it. I had to remind them that they still needed to be very careful and that they're still liable to catch and pass Covid. It was absolutely a bummer because they felt they had done everything right, but they needed that straight talk to be reminded of what they needed to do. Watch the live show below: For an Omicron update, we're looking at symptoms of congestion, headache, scratchy throat, and fever. Those are the main indicators we're seeing right now, very similar to a head cold. People are dealing with that for a day or two and then going into recovery, which you need to take seriously because it's more than just a head cold. As viruses mutate, they tend to get weaker but also more contagious. So, while getting it becomes a lot more likely, hopefully, it leads us to herd immunity. For people who have listened to our home medicine cabinet episode, there are a few things you need to stock up on. When the fever comes, you need to let it do its job while also defending the body. The best thing for that is [Calcium Lactate Powder](https://balance30a.standardprocess.com/products/calcium-lactate-powder?fbclid=IwAR1NW4-vSYgzId6v_yNmCPLmWTFR-mTI8CbAPI_8Yi9Z8OxNNqBZw7XAKJs). If we can get calcium back into the tissue, the body won't be in as much pain or discomfort. One tablespoon of that with a tablespoon [Hydrate](https://goodonyaorganic.com/products/hydrate-electrolyte-powder-mix?variant=33052447473773&fbclid=IwAR3GW-OTyJj4_EunqMmOyJJXZA3_gqFbboiqbDLnUCo1A9KGvSdXhj_EpCs) with 20 ounces of water twice a day will do wonders for resupplying your body in the middle of any fight. Whatever else you're doing, the first thing you need is a system that is functioning properly. We still need to maintain the zinc, between 50mg and 100mg, and Vitamin D, at least 5,000 IUs. In addition, about 15 tablets of [Cataplex C](https://balance30a.standardprocess.com/products/cataplex-c?fbclid=IwAR17tTG3ZTFd_Jt-GykST3o-yQpISt5SVcy2qXnDDvISRjbDb6LYW0xi5B4) a day, if you're over 170 pounds make it 20. Vitamin C stops infections. This is essential because if you don't get infected you don't die. Because Vitamin C is water-soluble, you pee it out and start all over the next morning. 1. Where do people find a doctor who will prescribe Hydrochloroquine and Ivermectin? I'm going to try and get that information to you. The FLCCC may be able to help you. I would also suggest loading up on the [Turmeric Forte](https://balance30a.standardprocess.com/products/turmeric-forte?fbclid=IwAR3lkyA6RCxT-lTtRUDOFxBwt00xIx3UKDJxWIUazsTFfb4kto70z639LSM), 9 a day. That along with the [Cataplex D](https://balance30a.standardprocess.com/products/cataplex-d?fbclid=IwAR0E8Nq0xJJRzZGUm4wUWso70XQOxRi1Zk_4xqVHevmi5kKrhFmAptMXWyE) and [Zinc Chelate](https://balance30a.standardprocess.com/products/zinc-chelate?fbclid=IwAR0aT1MwKlSJGZLNFCicNT86Js7lNjxr5hbgBeXSQkyTps_D47rJXOL3eGg) will all help you be at your peak function. Andrographis Complex is an herb we've seen a lot of success with as well. Even if you're not experiencing symptoms, you can still follow this protocol, it will absolutely take you to the next level. That's the key difference between this and antibiotics. If you followed this protocol, independent of a virus, it would help you. Antibiotics would not. Nobody wants to be uncomfortable, but if you have a strategy ahead of time, you're less likely to make a poor decision in an emotional state. 2. Why are you optimistic about 2022? It's not necessarily that I think it's going to be an easy year, I think it's going to be a good year because more people are asking what they need to do. They're not just waiting to be told what to do, they're going out there and trying to live the best life they can. I definitely think the Joe Rogan Experience has had a lot to do with that. It's provided provocative thought for people to ask questions. We have the opportunity to move back in a direction away from fear and uncertainty. Certainty leads to action and action is medicine. 3. My sodium level was low yesterday when I had blood work for rotator cuff surgery, which I had to cancel until it improves. I have been on the cleanse for 7 days and have successfully lost 6.8 pounds. Any thoughts on when it will improve? If I see low sodium standalone, usually I'll chalk it up to dehydration. One of the easiest ways to bring it up is electrolytes and one of the best ways is with sea salt. A \u00bc teaspoon will get you about 200mg of sodium. And when it's bound to others, it's in a safe and effective way. If I see it significantly low, it can be because of medication, but typically it's a hydration issue. Look for sea salt, sea kelp, or beet greens. 4. What is the Joe Rogan podcast title you were referring to? Dr. Peter McCullough and Dr. Robert Malone. 5. What is the difference between traditional and allopathic medicine? Traditional and allopathic medicine treats symptoms. Holistic medicine treats root causes. Too many people believe that traditional medicine is also looking for root causes and it's just not. Look at cancer. If we were interested in treating root causes, we wouldn't just be treating cancer cells, we'd be looking at all of the reasons people get cancer. When someone goes into remission for cancer, traditional medicine doesn't even recommend a lifestyle change. If the symptom is removed you are released. It's not designed for chronic care. It's not designed to improve your lifestyle. Holistic medicine requires more action by the patient. It's about stacking healthy habits in order to improve your lifestyle. Most people don't even know why they're on medications or what they really do. You need to ask if what you're taking is actually good for you as a whole person. There is a time and place for symptom relief, but only as part of a larger strategy. 6. How do you start to build your immune system? That could be an episode all by itself, but here's an unexpected answer. If I had a room full of people and I could only give them all one thing to get healthier overnight, it would be a digestive enzyme. The strength of our stomach acid fights viruses, bacteria, and parasites. I would pass out [Zypan](https://balance30a.standardprocess.com/products/zypan?fbclid=IwAR3wUTTEQs2gVor6_Om_BOA0B2PR6mqsz05sNODKfReuTvzILKFOuTTdXKo) to the whole world, except people with a stomach or mouth ulcer. Take one or two right before each meal. The more animal protein, the harder it is to break down. 7. Can you take too much zinc? Yes, you can. Zinc is a metal and we're supposed to get it in trace amounts. The dosing should be between 10mg and 50 mg a day. We need to be mindful of our dosages, too much can lower your iron or copper levels and lead to adrenal issues. And last, but certainly not least, this week's action to become superhuman is... Ask Yourself, \"What Can I do?\" Take the time, ask the question, take the action. The Omicron protocol I recommend includes everyone is [Zypan](https://balance30a.standardprocess.com/products/zypan?fbclid=IwAR3wUTTEQs2gVor6_Om_BOA0B2PR6mqsz05sNODKfReuTvzILKFOuTTdXKo). What's Next?
