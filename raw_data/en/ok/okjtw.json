Are the experienced effects truly the herbs at play, individual genetics or is it a [placebo-effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo), where the mind cures the body out of anticipation of cure? In ancient cultures, knowledge of traditional medicine, such as Ayurveda, was passed down for generations either through oral tradition or written texts. Ayurveda studies the human body in its entirety and recommends natural herbs as medicine for a specific ailment. Ayurvedic medicine has been practiced in India for over [5000 years](https://umm.edu/health/medical/altmed/treatment/ayurveda). Ancient texts that describe this medicine date back to 1500 BCE [1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26511157). Besides its historical use, traditional medicine is still practiced to this day in some parts of the world, and in recent years has made its way into the doctor's office. Even though there is skepticism about the use of traditional medicine, it isn't uncommon for doctors to practice or combine western medicine with [Naturopathy](http://www.naturopathic.org/content.asp?contentid=60), [Complementary and Alternative medicine](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/consumer-health/in-depth/alternative-medicine/art-20045267), [Holistic medicine](http://www.abihm.org/search-doctors), or other types of traditional medicines. Over the years, scientists have been curious to understand the mechanistics behind Ayurveda and how these herbs interact with the body and exhibit a particular effect. But what if, there was some validity for the science behind this ancient knowledge? What if we can unravel the mysteries behind why and how traditional medicine works? With the technology at hand today, we may be closer than we think... In recent years, scientists have studied herbs like [Turmeric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turmeric) and [Ashwagandharishta](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3456848/) for their medicinal properties suggested in the ancient texts. Ashwagandharishta is primarily known for applications in neurological disorders such as depression, epilepsy, and anxiety [2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26511157). [Bhondave et al. (2014)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26511157), studied if Ashwagandharishta could help protect rat livers against CCl4 induced toxicity [3](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26511157). With the the [StepOne real-time mixes](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/pcr/real-time-pcr/real-time-pcr-reagents/taqman-real-time-master-mixes.html), the team observed upregulation of antioxidant enzymes, such as catalase (CAT) and (GPx), and downregulation of IL-6, a pro-inflammatory cytokine. Their results show a possible mechanism of how Ashwagandharishta may provide hepatoprotection by preventing oxidative damage. Turmeric (or Curcumin) has also been extensively studied for its anti-inflammatory properties [4](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25314644), [5](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22909087). [McCann et al. (2014)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25314644) highlight the in vitro effects of turmeric extract against two gene variants associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in HEK293 cells [4](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25314644). Their results suggest that Turmeric, may beneficially affect two gene variants linked to IBD severity. [Klawitter et al. (2012)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22909087) studied if Turmeric may have an anti-inflammatory and anti-catabolic activity in inflammation related to Discogenic back pain [5](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22909087). Their RT-qPCR data suggest downregulation of proinflammatory cytokines. Although Turmeric shows anti-inflammatory properties in vitro, further in vivo and clinical studies are required to fully understand and validate the effects of Turmeric as alternative treatment for people suffering from IBD or Discogenic back pain. Many studies focus on the herbs suggested in Ayurvedic medicine, but [Govindaraj et al. (2015)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26511157) study a different aspect of Ayurveda; broken up into [doshas](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3215411/) (Vata, Pitta, Kapha) and focuses on the natural makeup of the body, which determines how individuals react to their environment, lifestyle and display susceptibility to different diseases. Govindaraj et al. (2015) study if genetics may play a role in Prakriti [1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26511157). The team determines Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with a particular Prakriti classification in 262 males. They observe that PGM1, which plays a role in many metabolic pathways, is associated with the characteristics described in the Pitta dosha. They use the [Ion PGM Sequencer](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/sequencing/next-generation-sequencing/ion-torrent-next-generation-sequencing-workflow/ion-torrent-next-generation-sequencing-run-sequence/ion-pgm-system-for-next-generation-sequencing.html) and technology](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/sequencing/dna-sequencing/targeted-sequencing/targeted-sequencing-ion-torrent-next-generation-sequencing.html) to perform targeted sequencing of the PGM1 genes to identify functional variants in the gene in 78 samples. We often hear on our evening news of how resveratrol, fish oil, turmeric or the next studied compound may be beneficial for our health. We head off to our local grocery store and buy a bottle of that supposedly natural compound and after months of disappointment, we question the validity of the science behind this research. It is possible that the research conducted was only in vitro or early in vivo models and only showed valuable results upon using enormous quantities of that compound. Such results are preliminary and need further support with more in vivo studies and maybe even clinical trials -popular media may forgo these details. Although uncommon, what's also possible is that the quality and potency of herbal supplements may be sub par. [DNA barcoding was recently used](https://www.thermofisher.com/blog/behindthebench/sequencing-moments-that-mattered-2015/#sthash.BwRFV3LJ.dpuf) to test the authenticity of herbal products, showed that most of the tested herbal products were of poor quality, had product substitution, contamination, and fillers. Without quality products, we may not experience the desired long-term effects. To this day, we try to understand the complexities of chemical compounds found in herbs, how they interact with our bodies, and how we, in turn, are genetically predisposed to react to them. What makes us different from one another is our genetics and just as we've come to understand that not all western medicine is created equal, we enter the realm of precision or personalized medicine. Interestingly, Ayurveda with its knowledge about herbs and Prakriti may have some valid science backing it up. What's amazing is that we've had this knowledge all along, and now we are just starting to align modern science with ancient traditional medicine. *For Research Use Only.
