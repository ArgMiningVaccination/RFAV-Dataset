The climate change issue was as always, on trend. Nuclear war was another hot topic everyone was talking about. But out of nowhere a deadly Virus was reported on Wuhan China and was spreading rapidly. The Patients reported breathing complexity with fever. This virus was even deadly for the old aged People and people with respiratory problems. Well, literally no one and no country on earth was prepared for this pandemic. It hit the world so hard and we are still trying to recover from what it took. This Virus was officially named SARS CoV2. Covid 19 testing was performed but sadly no poper cure was there. It seemed as if humans were helpless and could do nothing but just get tested. Covid 19 is still the worst fear in the 21st century. Everyone is talking about Covid 19 and getting Covid 19 testing. Many of us have already taken the Covid 19 tests multiple times. So, should you still take the Covid 19 tests? Let's break the answer to either take the Covid 19 testing or not. But first let's understand a little about CoronaVirus. Causes of Coronavirus: This virus wasn't first seen in humans. Coronavirus first developed in animals and from animals the virus gets transmitted to humans. When a human gets infected by this virus via animal contact, transmission from human to human is rapid. Respiratory droplets are actually responsible for the transmission among humans. If a Viral contained droplets come in contact with another human and hence there is an active transmission. Covid Vs Flu Covid is often mistaken as the seasonal flu. People are highly predicting Seasonal Flu as the cause of health issues they are facing these days. The symptoms might seem similar but Covid is different and far more dangerous than seasonal Flu. According to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/), about 1.80% of active Covid patients died whereas 0.04% to 0.16% flu patients died in the USA alone. The rate is definitely higher with Covid. Symptoms of Covid 19 Not much was known about the Virus and still, massive research is carried out to develop an effective treatment of Covid 19. Doctors and scientists are still puzzled about this new virus. It is to be noted that the symptoms of Covid-19 may come across as similar to cold and flu, making it difficult to detect on your own. People having active Covid 19 testing noticed the following symptoms: - Fever - Chills - Cough - Fatigue - Sore throat - Headache - Loss of smell and taste - Muscle pains - Diarrhea, nausea and Vomiting However, the symptoms may vary from person to person and some even don't develop any symptoms. So, getting yourself tested can be a great solution. Covid 19 testing Procedure: There are mainly three types of tests for Covid 19 testing. This process includes [lab sample collections](https://crystaldiagnosticlab.com/easily-conduct-your-lab-test-at-home/) either a nasal swab collection or taking blood samples. Antigen tests: Antigens tests are commonly known as Rapid Diagnostics tests. A nasal or throat swab is taken and tested if the swab is contained with the protein of Coronavirus. This test can be done in case of an emergency. Antigens tests are relatively faster and less expensive however the accuracy of the test is low. This test is not recommended as the results can't be trusted. PCR tests: PCR stands for Polymerase chain reaction and PCR is performed to detect the particular genetic characteristics from an organism. There should be the viral load in your body to get tested positive in this test. However, this test can detect viruses even if you are no longer infected by the Virus. At first the Nasal or throat swab is collected from the respiratory tract by the help of a soft tip with a flexible stick that is inserted into your nose. This sample is then confined in a tube and sent to the lab for further testing. This is the most accurate test for Covid 19. Antibody tests: This is one of the effective Covid 19 testing methods as they are used to know if someone had the Covid 19 infection. Blood samples are taken in order to detect the antibodies that are produced by our bodies immune system. It's more of the after effect test to know how our body responded to the virus. These tests can be used if a person had the Covid -19 infection in the past. Among these three, PCR tests and the Antibody tests are the most recommended as this test delivers highly accurate results and hence, can be used as a diagnostics test. However, the deliverance of the test results depends upon the Lab. We, here at Crystal Diagnostics lab, deliver the results within 24 hrs after the sample Collection. Covid 19 Testing Results Types: Negative If the Covid 19 testing results indicate Negative then Congratulations you don't have an active case of Covid 19 in your body at the time you took the test. However, lesser viral load in your body can also be the case of Negative detection. You just can't relax and be careless by simply seeing the negative Covid 19 testing results because the virus is still out there and you can get infected anytime. Staying safe is always the better option. Positive If the Covid 19 testing results indicate Positive, then you have an active case of Covid 19. Even though you are tested positive, it doesn't mean this is going to have a greater impact on your health. Most people recover without any health care but still some might need special medical attention. So Stop Panicking and try to understand the symptoms and the effects of the virus on your body. If you have breathing complexity then you must take extra care. If not, staying in quarantine, taking healthy diets and sufficient rest will do. Benefits of covid 19 testing: Well, it's obviously not a cure for the disease itself but early detection helps a lot in Covid -19 infection. You might have already got multiple numbers of tests done. Covid 19 testing helps the necessary safety measures to be effectively implemented as they help identify the suspects. Covid 19 testing can help minimize the human to human transmission. It helps you and your doctors to take necessary safety measures that will protect both your family and community. The test results also indicate how severe it can get and if you might need immediate attention from the experts. We obviously don't want to get hospitalized but the Covid 19 tests results can help predict the need of oxygen supply and ventilators as a worst case scenario. These are the times of great Crisis and a proper Covid 19 testing can help us take the acute life saving decisions that we will remember throughout our life. It might not be always worse, some might recover pretty soon and self isolation can also help a lot if detected at an early stage. Moment of Truth Do we have to take Covid 19 testing? A big Yes, you should take Covid 19 testing irrespective of your past test history. As we discussed earlier, Staying safe is our greatest strength. If you happen to develop symptoms of covid-19, then you should probably consider getting yourself tested. And If you are planning to travel abroad due to certain circumstances, then it is mandatory to take the Covid 19 testing. If you are looking for a reliable and government certified lab, then Crystal diagnostics Lab is the one. We provide reliable and accurate whole body tests along with PCR tests. Covid vaccines are also proving to be effective against the Virus. The second wave of Covid 19 is spreading at an even greater rate. Staying Isolated, wear a mask, maintain physical distance and wash your hand with Soap when you have external contact with anything and anyone. Take the vaccine if you have the opportunity and remember it's not only you at the risk, you are keeping everyone at risk around you. Be responsible and take responsible steps.
